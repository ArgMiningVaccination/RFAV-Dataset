The proposal for the Commission's new framework programme (see opposite), currently before the Council and Parliament, features a number of inno\u00ad vations. First, it is an explicit part of the European Research Area, of which it becomes, in a sense, the financing arm. This approach is shown by the pro\u00ad gramme's actions, which are aimed, for example, at developing networks of excellence, increasing the mobility of scientists, making Europe more attrac\u00ad tive to researchers, and strengthening the links between Community research efforts and national policies. This major transformation is largely the result of the strong support expressed by the various players, starting with the politicians. The concept of the European Research Area is now firmly on the agenda of the heads of state and government, hav\u00ad ing been discussed at two European Councils, first in Lisbon, last year, and then in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March. Although this political prominence is partly due to the need to stimulate research further, thus enabling the Union to join the knowledge\u00ad based society successful ly, it is also the result of changed attitudes. A second characteristic of the proposed framework programme is the concentration of research. Seven priority fields have been adopted on account of the high added value which European research can bring them. The final innovation is in the way the programme works, with the proposal for new instruments and greater operating autonomy. To reflect these deep-seated changes, RTD info is also changing -in form and substance: a new pre\u00ad sentation, which we hope will be clearer and more agreeable, and a new editorial line, which is more open to research in Europe.

In contrast to that of its pre\u00ad decessors, the context in which the European Union must today implement its traditional research activities is fundamentally new and innovative -that of the European Research Area (ERA), of which the frame\u00ad work programme is becoming the financing arm. This initiative, instigated by Philippe Busquin, Commis\u00ad sioner responsible for research, aims to provide the Union with a genuinely common strategy -comparable to that of the single market and currency -designed to strengthen Europe's scientific and technological dynamism on an increasingly global stage. The concept of the ERA was extremely well received by Europe's politicians who have given the Commission a very clear mandate to implement it. The projected global budget (including Euratom activities) is \u20ac17.5 billion, a 17% increase on the previous framework programme. The framework program.me consists of three main areas of action which reflect the main thrusts of the ERA. 1. Integrating research The framework programmes to date have been instru\u00ad ments for stimulating and supporting collaboration between European researchers . Without actually dis\u00ad appearing, this mission must now be adapted to deliver the new strategy of the ERA by incorporating actions that will catalyse the integration of European MAYO 9, 2001 The Commission's proposals for the 2002-2006 framework programme embody an innovative approach which gives substance to the European Research Area, following the positive reactions to the concept in political, scientific and industrial circles. research. In specific terms, this means two key changes in the programme concept: t concentration on a limited number of priority fields of research to which activities at the Union level can add real value (see table); t strengthening of links between the Community research effort and national and regional research policies. In the priority areas, the new framework programme will work mainly by supporting the development of cooperation within networks of centres of excellence. These networks will bring together the best research capabilities in Europe's regions to conduct common research programmes, enabling the emergence of 'vir\u00ad tual platforms of excellence' on a European scale. Substantial resources might also be allocated to sup\u00ad port integrated projects involving public and private partners, with clearly stated scientific and technologi\u00ad cal objectives and with a view to generati~g new knowledge and/or applications in the priority fields. In this respect -and as authorised by the European Treaties -the new framework programme will innovate by using its powers of intervention to encourage active participation in research programmes jointly imple\u00ad mented by a limited number of Member States. A substantial effort for SMEs The participation of SMEs in the framework programme is a key aspect of Union policy. Under the Fifth Framework Programme they were allocated 10% of the key actions budget. The new framework programme plans to allocate them 15% of the funds available through the various thematic fields of the Integration of European Research programme, making a total of \u20ac1.9 billion. ea: c<11 /s1 4 RTDinfoN\u00b0 29April2001 .FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME!

Structuring the European Research Area The ERA aims to correct structural weaknesses or defi\u00ad ciencies which could be described as 'transverse'. The most notable of these, already widely covered by pre\u00ad vious programmes, concern: t the strengthening of bridges between research and innovation; t the renewal of the human potential for research and mobility of researchers. There must be an active policy to make the ERA a more attractive area for scientific and technological research, not just to stop the traditional deficit caused by the 'brain drain', but also so that it attracts the best foreign researchers. However, there are two specifically innovative aspects of the programme which are destined to play a partic\u00ad ularly important role. t Support for the development of research infra\u00ad structures. Until now the Union has mainly tried to attract European researchers to the existing infra\u00ad structures of the Member States. In addition to this support for the mobility of researchers, the new framework programme initiates a policy for the coherent development of infrastructures, in the form of integrated actions facilitating their networking and ability to deliver scientific services at a European level. t The attention given to questions of 'science and society'. To achieve the necessary deepening of the Union's democratic foundations, better relations between 'science' and 'governance' and an improvement in the scientific and technological cul\u00ad ture of the average European are seen as priorities by policy-makers, researchers and the general public. 3. Strengthening the foundations of the European Research Area The new framework programme will also aim to strengthen one of its fundamental missions, which is to meet scientific and technological needs which arise in the implementation of Union policies in all fields where Community responsibilities are constantly growing - such as agriculture, fisheries, health and consumer pro\u00ad tection, the environment, transport and the informa\u00ad tion society. The tasks assigned to the Joint Research Centre will come under this key programme activity. Another important aspect is support in improving the coordination and coherence of research activities, at national and European level. This search for better co\u00ad ordination, which embodies the very spirit of the ERA, will aim to create opportunities for the mutual opening up of national programmes and cooperation between existing European scientific and technological frameworks. A third element of this action plan, the flexibility of which will be guaranteed by annual budget manage\u00ad ment, is increased anticipation of the scientific and technological needs of European policies and the often rapid responses these require. t 6 RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 Feature -BSE Investigating the past to unlock the present In 1997, the neurologist Stanley Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for having, with remarkable foresight, developed in 1982 the idea that the infectious agents causing degenerative disease of the brain could be abnormal proteins, which he called 'prions'. A decade later, his discovery is at the centre of all research on the animal and human forms of 'mad cow' disease. See The Prion Diseases by Stanley Prusiner www.nmia.co m/-md i bble/prion. htm I Whether it is advancing or 'blocked', science has problems when it comes to communication. An initial step, too often neglected, is to refer back to the past and retrace the complex meanderings of scientific thought, with all its doubts, oversights and uncertainties. IT WAS IN 1732 that zoologists first described scrapie, which was none other than the very first example of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Apart from the infected sheep, there were no fatalities, and this common disease was accepted as just one of the haz\u00ad ards of sheep farming, one that man learned to live with without asking too many questions . It was 150 years later, in 1920-21, that a new disease was discovered, affecting humans this time, and known as Creutzfeld-Jakob disease or CJD. This abnormal, fatal illness was extremely rare -0.4 cases per million inhabi\u00ad tants -and affected elderly people. Its appearance seemed to be mostly sporadic (85% of cases) but it was also sometimes found to be hereditary . For many decades science showed at best a moderate interest in these neuro-degenerative diseases, which were rare, difficult to characterise and mysterious in their mechanisms. Only the inquisitive few were intrigued enough by phenomena which reduced the brain -whether human or animal -to a sponge-like mass, to study them. From the kuru syndrome ... In the 1950s, an American, D. Carleton Gajdusek, and an Australian, Vincent Zigas, drew attention to what was known as kuru. This was a new form of fatal encephalopathy of the CJD variety, found in certain tribes of Papua New Guinea who ate human brains during funeral rites. This pioneering discovery on the transmissibility of human neurological diseases earned Dr Gajdusek a Nobel Prize in 1976. It also served to refocus attention on this strange type of pathology which he described as 'slow evolution viral diseases'. Interest intensified . Scientists found similarities between the human and animal forms and evidence of specific cases of infection with CJD during surgery. <1) Questions began to be raised regarding the 'species barrier' (the belief according to which these diseases are not 'inter-transmissible') and the viral nature of the infectious agent. . .. to the invention of the prion An important step was taken in 1982 with the theory of prions (standing for proteinaceous infectious particles and pronounced 'pree-ons') developed by an Ameri\u00ad can neurologist working in California, Stanley Prusiner. He explained how, following the tragic death of one of his patients from CJD in the early 1970s, he set about studying all the existing literature on the dis\u00ad ease. He was struck by the experiments of European radiobiologists which had shown the resistance of tis\u00ad sues infected with scrapie to radiation supposed to destroy any trace of nucleic acids constituting infec\u00ad tion by a virus. Professor Prusiner promptly sought to demonstrate that the transmission of this type of pathology was not of viral origin but due to a pathogenic transformat ion of the structure of natural proteins (known as PrP, whose natural function is still unknown to neurolo\u00ad gists), omnipresent in neuronal systems, into a differ\u00ad ent model of proteins with an abnormal geometric configuration, which he called PrPsc. He showed that these deviant prions were invasive, contaminating all the normal proteins of this family and ultimately 'gan \u00ad grening' all the neuronal tissues. This rather unorthodox thesis met with general indif\u00ad ference in biomolecular research circles. But the Amer\u00ad ican neurologist was soon to have his day. Just four years later, the prion hypothesis was to become one of the most widely publicised of any scientific theory. In 1997, justice was done when Professor Prusiner was awarded a Nobel Prize. t (7) There was also the scandal of CJD transmission to children dur\u00ad ing the brief period when growth hormones were transplant ed from the pituitary glands of human corpses. Feature-BSE I J RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 7 Research in Devastating as it was, until the mid-1990s mad cow disease was a scourge limited to the United Kingdom. A fact which unfortunately obscured the need to manage the international dimension of the crisis. Nevertheless, European research programmes had been quick to take the measure of its implications. IT WAS IN 1986 that the Central Veterinary Laboratory in the UK first identified two animals infected with an unknown form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in two British herds. By the end of 1989, 10 OOO cases had been recorded. The emergency measures, including the ban on any animal-derived feed -quickly established as the origin of the catastrophe -had little effect. The situation wors\u00ad ened. By 1992 the epidemic had struck 37 OOO cattle throughout the UK. The scientific community -both British and American - followed the affair with stupefaction. However, almost by chance, the scientific community had the recent research on the prion to turn to -thanks to the 'solo' efforts of one Stanley Prusiner in the early 1980s (see Investigating the past to unlock the present). A num\u00ad ber of research teams now set about pursuing this line of research, filling in the gaps in our scanty knowledge of these strange diseases. At this time questions also started to be raised -albeit in muffled tones -about a hypothetical impact on man, known to be sensitive to this kind of infection via the CJD family. A first precautionary measure was taken: the abattoirs discarded from the human food chain all organs suspected of being clearly infected with BSE -the brain and spinal cord. At the same time, in 1990 the British authorities took the first medical initiative by setting up the CJD Sur\u00ad veillance Unit. The mission entrusted to Robert Will of Edinburgh University was to set up a reinforced team for the screening and analysis of the symptoms of all cases of CJD in United Kingdom. Rare diseases 'Through circumstances which owed nothing to chance, the European Union was able to react very quickly to support the scientific community,' recalls Bruno Hansen, a director of European research pro\u00ad grammes in the field of the life sciences. 'Taking the view that this was a particularly important and useful field in terms of trans-European co-operation, budgets had been made available for the study of so-called rare diseases under the Third Framework Programme.' Beginning in 1993, the Edinburgh centre was there\u00ad fore able to work in constant cooperation with Europe's very best CJD experts. 'This cooperation, which considerably increased the epidemiological data available to us, played a valuable role,' stresses Dr Will. 'It was thanks to this that, in 1995, we identified three suspect cases in young subjects. This was, alas, proof of the appearance of a new variant of CJD which was attributable to infection with BSE.' Mobilisation An article announcing this discovery, signed by Dr Will and other European scientists, was published in the medical journal The Lancet. It was a political and media bombshell . 'From this moment, the demonstrated inter-species transmissibility was perceived as a sword of Damocles hanging over public health, and the need for a major mobilisation of Europe's scientific community was evi\u00ad dent,' continues Bruno Hansen. A panel of researchers, led by Charles Weissmann -one of Europe's most 'The need for a major mobilisation of Europe's scientific community was evident.' -Bruno Hansen 8 RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 prominent scientists in this field, who was working on the ideas developed by Prusiner -helped the European Union to determine the priority lines of research by extending them to trans\u00ad missible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) as a whole. Things moved very quickly. At the end of 1996, the first call for proposals was launched for research on diagnosis and transmission mechanisms in bovines. Two other calls followed in 1997 and 1998, covering all the other fields of study. Out of nearly 120 submissions by European teams, 54 projects involv\u00ad ing 150 multidisciplinary laboratories were selected and work began. The Commission's support for this first phase of research, which is still in progress, is 50 million euros (1). On all fronts Faced with the many unanswered questions about TSE, scientists are waging an out-and-out war on many fronts in the fields of both animal and human research -and fundamental research first of all. While it is prion research which almost certainly holds the key to the mysteries , the processes involved lie beyond our increasingly substant ial knowledge of molecular biology and genetic diseases. Although the gene which codes for the production of normal protein PrP was recently identified, nobody yet under\u00ad stands the role it plays in the neurolog \u00ad ical systems of mammals. All that is known for certain is that the illness results from a transformation in the Feature-BSE \u00a9 Robert Will, CJD Swveillance Unit, Edinburgh . configurat ion of the amino acid chains of the normal protein PrP, from the normally preponderant a-helices into ~-sheets, when it degenerates into a PrPSc prion. Due to this change, the prion is able to develop a resistance to the protease enzymes which regulate the management of the healthy pro\u00ad tein. This then triggers a chain reac\u00ad tion, leading to a general colonisation and irreversible degeneration of the neuronal system, culminating in the transformation of the brain into a 'spongy' mass. Multidirectional research The key questions as to why the pro\u00ad tein transformation occurs, what mechanisms are at work in its long TSEs are especially worrying as they are transmitted through the ingestion of infected products. This then poses the essential question of what path the prions take in travelling through the body to attack their ultimate target, the brain. 'There are strong indications to suppose that the pri\u00ad ons penetrate the central nervous system by way of the enteric nervous system [linked to the intestine] with the help of certain cellu\u00ad lar systems and mechanisms,' explains Hans Kretzschm ar, a German neuropathol\u00ad ogist. These. are the systems and mecha\u00ad nisms that must be deciphered to learn how the prion reproduces. It is the very question which lies at the heart of a European project involving French, Belgian, Swiss, Spanish and German teams, co-ordinated by Dominique Dormant of the neurovirology department of the Commissariat a l'energie atomique (CEA), a leading research body on the problem of TSE in France and the presi\u00ad dent of the French Group of Experts on prion diseases. Prion protein 1. PrPc Normal 2. PrPsc Pathological development, and how it is able to transform there\u00ad fore remain. What is it that triggers the devastating invasive process? What is the mysterious route taken by the infectious agent which lends it its terrible power to contaminate -not only within a single species, but also between species? (See A prion's passage). These questions have opened up a vast field of research in which scientists are trying not just to iden\u00ad tify the fundame ntal bases of the disease, but also to develop the full range of possible responses to it (see A testing race p. 7 2). On the animal front, due to the seriousness of the bovine disease, fundamental exper\u00ad iments are being conducted to permit both physio\u00ad logical and genetic approach es to the mechanisms of its developme nt and transmission. This research also covers the study of the best known TSE, scrapie, as well as the opportunities for contamination in all areas of livestock rearing (poultry, pigs and fish) where ani\u00ad mal-derived feed has been widely used. The human impact Then there are also, of course, the many studies on the human form of the disease. Epidemiological monitor- priority for the ERA fter four years of major targeted European research action on TSE, Europe is currently considering what fur\u00ad ther action to take on this priority front in the light of the results now being produced. On the one hand, under the Fifth Framework Programm e, a series of new projects will be selected this year following the 'Quality of Life' call for proposals last November. On the other hand, in the context of the European Research Area (ERA), the Council has given the Com\u00ad mission a clear mandate to make an inventory of cur\u00ad rent research undertaken on BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the Member States, to encourage the exchange of scientific information between research teams, and to identify research activities. to be rein\u00ad forced and new actions to be launched. Feature-BSE RTD info N' 29 April 2001 9 ing, co-ordinated by the Euro(JD network, has increased considerab ly throughout Europe and remains a key element in the scientific framework now in place. It is essential to screen and identify all the clinical and psychologica l characterist ics of new vari\u00ad ant CJD -attributed to animal transmission -while at the same time improving our knowledge of all forms of the disease. Identification is a particularly complex problem since the incidence of the disease in humans in its transmitted form is still very low. The continuing exchange of data between specialists is now enabling a vast operation to harmonise the criteria for clinical diagnosis to get under way. TSEs have a long incubation period. Several months, or even years, can pass between the moment of infection and the first appearance of identifiable clinical signs, which actually mark the final stage, by which time it is too late to do anything. In cattle, this dormant period is estimated to be a matter of months -hence the 30-month limit adopted for screening /slaughtering programmes. In man, the incubation can be one or two decades, or even more -the length of the period further adding to the detection difficulties . This represents a major chal\u00ad lenge, as the earlier the stage at which a screening method can be usefully applied, the greater the chance of developing treatment, which must be applied during the initial infection stage. Unfortunately, we are only at the stage of tentative investigation . For example, the British neurologist John Collinge -who confirmed the work of Robert Will with experiments on transgenic mice that provided irrefutable evidence of the BSE 'signature' in new vari\u00ad ant CJD, and is considered to be one of the world's leading experts on research on TSE -is coordinating a European research project in areas which could lead to new forms of treatment. Among other things, this research is attempting to synthesise peptides which can combat the formation of the abnormal proteins at the origin of scrapie. t (1) See: europa.eu.int/comm/research/press/2000/prl 512en. html.

These experts also defended the positions and interests of their respective governments. But times have changed. Independence By 1996, partly due to the scale of the BSE crisis, a radical review was clearly needed of all European practices in the field of scientific expertise. In the sum\u00ad mer of 1997, all powers of consultation in the field of food safety were brought together within the new Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-Gen\u00ad eral, which was considerab ly strength\u00ad ened and freed from the traditional influ\u00ad ence of the lobbies which like to haunt the Brussels corridors. First entrusted to Commissioner Emma Bonino, this DG is now headed by David Byrne. 'A two-tier device ensures a clear divi\u00ad sion between risk assessment and advice on risk management,' stresses Paul Vossen, general secretary of the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC). This body coordinates a network of eight advisory committees specialised in various fields that evaluate the scientific data and then submit their conclusions and opinions to the Community authorities. The SSC itself, consisting of 16 members -half of whom assist in the work of the eight sec\u00ad toral committees -gives opinions on multidisciplinary issues. All the conclu\u00ad sions arising out of this system of exper\u00ad tise are made public, some as 'prelimi\u00ad nary opinions', when the experts con\u00ad sider that additional information or Feature -BSE RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 experts exactly? comments from the scientific world ( or public authorities) is required. The golden rule can be summed up in three words: excellence, independence and transparency. The committee mem\u00ad bers are appointed following an interna\u00ad tional call for proposals and selected on the basis of very strict criteria in terms of competence, expertise, ability and clar\u00ad ity with respect to the political, adminis\u00ad trative or economic responsibilities they may have to exercise in their current pro\u00ad fessional activities. Transparency 'In a case such as mad cow disease - which takes up 80% of our time at pre\u00ad sent -the SSC refers to the ad hoe Advi\u00ad sory Committee on TSE, which includes more than a dozen or so of the top international experts on animal epi\u00ad demics and new variant CJD. The SSC is also free to set up new working groups of other scientists whenever it deems this necessary.' (1) The present concern to apply the pre\u00ad ca uti o nary principle to everything related to the BSE crisis involves adopt\u00ad ing a very wide-ranging approach when it comes to the assessment of TSE-related risks. 'The SSC has issued almost 70 new opinions or updates on the subject in the space of three years. Most of the requests we deal with come from Commun ity bodies -Coun\u00ad cil of Ministers, Commission services, European Parliament -but any repre\u00ad sentative organisation in the Union, public or private, or even an individual , is also entitled to submit a reasoned and justified request for an opinion to the Commission services.' The scientific evaluation and risk assess\u00ad ment at the DG does not take place in a vacuum, but is closely linked to all projects relating to TSE under the Research DG's programmes . 'Many experts on the ad hoe group and the various specific working groups they consult are involved in the European research networks working on the sub-ject. There is therefore a two-way cir\u00ad culation of information. The DG can refer to the latest research projects sup\u00ad ported by the Union while the conclu\u00ad sions of the experts on the ad hoe com\u00ad mittee and SSC are the basis for identi\u00ad fying new research needs.' t * see box p. 72.

Info The JRC's February 2000 newsletter reports on the BSE tests tests See fs/bse/bsel2_en html HOW TO DO you tell a BSE-infected cow from a healthy cow? By finding a way of detecting whether or not it is infected with abnormal prions. A simple truth -but a considerable scientific challenge. One possible way forward is to develop an immuno-biological test to render an antibody capable, following the action of an \u00b7 enzyme within brain or nerve tissue liable to infection, of recognising the presence of abnormal prions. Several teams are working on this problem. In 1998 three of them presented the first post-mortem tests, suitable for use on animals immediately after slaugh\u00ad ter: Prionics (developed by the Swiss firm of the same name), Biorad (jointly developed by French public research and a US firm) and Enfer (Ireland). These dis\u00ad tinct tests, which can be carried out by operators working in abattoirs, were approved by the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General after checks at the Commission's Joint Research Centre lasting sev\u00ad eral months. Five other tests (four European and one American) are currently being assessed at the JRC. A Food Authority for 100\u00b0/o vigilance In November 2000, the European Commission submitted its pro\u00ad posals to the European Parliament and Council for the creation of the new European Food Authority, to be in place by 2002 at the lat\u00ad est. This will be responsible for developing a global strategy for analysis and advice on all matters relating to the safety of the food chain 'from farm to fork' (thus also including animal health and diet). By virtue of the rule of separating risk assessment from risk management, established by the Union in 1997, the EFA will have the status of an independent and autonomous body. It will be allo\u00ad cated substantial resources and will replace the current system of scientific consultation, with an extensive mandate to conduct a proactive policy of scientific assessments and recommendations, information gathering and risk identification, rapid warning in case of crisis and transparent communication to the general public. On the Web: europa.eu .int/comm/dgs/health_consumer /library/press/press82_en.html Warning and precautionary devices The important measures taken by the Union since 1 Jan\u00ad uary 2001 include the systematic screening of all cattle aged over 30 months (which currently means several million animals). But this is a precautionary measure rather than a guarantee of safety. The tests make it pos\u00ad sible to recognise with certainty tissues which have reached an advanced stage of contamination and other tissues which are guaranteed safe. However, already infected tissues in an animal at a much earlier stage in the particularly long BSE incubation cycle may not react and can thus slip through the protection net. Be that as it may, the use of tests -plus increased pro\u00ad tection measures consisting of discarding a long list of cattle organs from the food chain and a ban on meat and bone meal for livestock feed -does provide an additional warning device, but one which does not necessarily lead to an easier management of the crisis. This is because the more effective the checks, the greater the number of cases discovered. Towards a blood test? But the scientific battle on the test front -which also involves detecting the disease in humans -is far from over. And it would take an altogether different direc\u00ad tion if we crossed the crucial barrier between the pre\u00ad sent stage of post-mortem tests and in vivo detection, permitting identification at an increasingly early stage in the disease cycle. Apart from the advance in terms of public health, such progress is eagerly awaited by farmers, who would then have a genuine tool for giv\u00ad ing their herds a clean bill of health. Hence the importance of the research on methods of diagnosis carried out by some 50 high-tech laborato\u00ad ries within over a dozen European projects. One par\u00ad ticularly promising line of inquiry is being pursued by a team of Danish, Israeli, Swedish, Spanish and Swiss researchers. Coordinated by Hans Kretzschmar, a neu\u00ad ropathologist at Munich University, this project is con\u00ad cerned with the detection capacities of new specific monoclonal antibodies, opening up the possibility of blood tests, in both animals and man. MEDIC IN E. RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 13 Elusive allergies Nearly one in three Europeans suffers -or will suffer -from an allergy. 10% of children suffer from asthma. Described by some scientists as 'the real millennium bug', allergies have become progressively more common over the past two decades. And the social cost -in terms of health care and absenteeism, for example -is estimated at 45 billion euros a year. A major research effort is essential in this field where our knowledge shows some surprising gaps. FIRST DESCRIBED by the Austrian physician Clemens von Picquet back in 1906, an allergy is an 'inflamma\u00ad tion' which follows exposure to a specific substance or micro-organism, known as an allergen. The body responds to a usually inoffensive stimulus by trigger\u00ad ing the action of immune mechanisms -just as it does when defending us against germs, but in this case for no real purpose. The body's reaction is violent and, in the extreme and rare cases of anaphylactic shock, can even prove fatal. 'There are many different types of cause,' explains Dr Alain Vanvossel, a scientific officer at the Research DG. 'Genetic factors and immunological aspects can all play a part, as well as pollution and other environ\u00ad mental factors, as can lifestyle, including diet. So all these avenues must be explored if we want to make any progress in preventing allergies.' Allergies are made all the more complex by the fact that they are often triggered by a combination of fac\u00ad tors which are difficult to identify. Their incidence can vary in the course of a lifetime and the phenomenon of crossed reactivity further complicates an already dif\u00ad ficult diagnosis. Increase in asthma Respiratory allergies are among the most common . They include allergic rhinitis, such as the familiar hay fever, the incidence of which seems to have increased from 1 % of the population at the beginning of the 20th century to between 15% and 20% over recent years, affecting adolescents and young adults in particular. 'This complaint should not be viewed as a minor irrita\u00ad tion,' states the European Allergy White Paper.ell 'Recent studies show that chronic allergic rhinitis, usu\u00ad ally caused by the allergens found in buildings, cause a level of discomfort in the patient equivalent to that of moderate asthma. Some studies even suggest that this complaint can lead to asthma.' The link is worrying, as asthma is another major allergy. It affects 10% of children, continues in 5% of adults and affects twice as many people as 20 years ago. Polluted air -with NOx from vehicle emissions, for example -is increasingly being cited as the cause of the problem and some statistics show that asthma is more common in urban than rural areas. Socio-eco\u00ad nomic factors are also mentioned, as asthma is more frequent among the socially disadvantaged . Although the resulting mortality is low in Europe, the number of children who suffer from it is a cause for concern, as is the number of determining factors which remain unidentified and which are probably linked to the interaction between our genes and lifestyle. Skin allergies Skin allergies are another major category of allergy. A number of studies have found a worrying increase in atopic dermatitis over recent decades. Also linked to hereditary factors, in some regions of Europe as much as a quarter of the population is believed to be affected by this condition. Eczema and urticaria are also affect\u00ad ing a growing number of people, with experts predict\u00ad ing that between 40% and 60% of them are at risk of going on to develop respiratory problems .

Here it is more a question of intolerance than of allergies proper as the symptoms are not due to an activation of the immune mechanism. But what\u00ad ever the case, this hypersensitivity is also linked to a change in lifestyle. Targeted research 'Europe is certainly not without its strengths in con\u00ad ducting the research required to combat this public health problem,' believes Dr Vanvossel. 'In addition to multidisciplinary teams of high-leve l scientists, it also has the diversity of populations, lifestyles, environ\u00ad ments and public-health systems to permit a very tar\u00ad geted approach.' The Quality of life and management of human resources programme under the Fifth Framework Pro\u00ad gramme for Research is already supporting studies by THE ECRHS II (European Commun ity Respiratory Health \u00b7 Survey) project is an ambitious study following on from an initial survey carried out in 1992-93. More than 10 OOO young \u00b7 adults from l 2l European countries will once again come under the scrutiny of scientists and doctors from. 29 scientific centres. The aim is to deter\u00ad mine the factors linked to the incidence (or remission) of allergic sensitivity and asthma, and to reduction in the pulmonary function. The ECRHS II project will com\u00ad pile an extensive database with multiple variables on THE INQUIRY into intestinal flora is particularly innov\u00ad ative in that it is exploring the quite paradoxical asso\u00ad ciation found by most epidemiological studies between a high risk of allergy and a Western upbringing under hygienic conditions. 'We found that children from small, weU-to-do families, with sanitary housing, are at greater risk of developing allergies,' explains Agnes Wo1d of Gothenburg Uni\u00ad versity (SE), co-ordinator of the microflora on allergy development) pro\u00ad ject. 'Sanitary conditions in Europe are totally differ-over 50 European teams, many of them also cooper\u00ad ating with laboratories in EU-applicant countries (see examples below). Some are concerned specifically with asthma and the aetiology of allergies, some with food allergens, and some with methods of diagnosis and treatment strategies. 'The emphasis is clearly on prevention . That is why it is important to ensure that the results get back to the people in question, and that they are put to the best possible use, as it is often issues of lifestyle which are raised by these diseases,' concludes Dr Vanvossel. Further calls for proposals for research on allergies are planned for March 2001 and 2002 under the Quality of life programme . These will make it possible to finance a large number of innovative projects in this field. t respiratory allergies -especially asthma -and risk fac\u00ad tors (environmental, hereditary, etc.). 'We are also going to compile a blood bank for the pur~ poses of DNA analysis,' explains Dr. Deborah Jarvis, the study co-ordinator. 'It will be possible to correlate these results with every type of incidence recorded. That will enable us to explore the associations between expo\u00ad sure and response at a really pertinent European level.' ent from those of 100 years ago, a time when aller\u00ad gies were virtually unknown.' The hypothesis? The microflora of the intestine, the first system to be colonised by micro-organisms after birth, play a key role in regulating the immune sys\u00ad tem. The researchers believe that our children's microflora inhibit the development of tolerance to the antigens present in the digestive system. Three hundred babies living in Sweden, the United King\u00ad dom and Italy will be monitored from birth, to enable scientists to confirm -or qualify -this position. The project's ultimate objective is to open up new avenues for prevention. THE EXPOSURE of expectant mothers to certain pollu\u00ad tants could make their babies more prone to develop allergies. This is the hypothesis being studied by researchers on the Plutocracy project (Placental uptake and transfer of environmental chemicals relat\u00ad ing to allergy in childhood years). 'Placental contami\u00ad nation by pollutants in general, and PCBs and heavy metals in particular, could affect certain functions of the placenta -and thus the development of the fcetus,' explains Dr. Margaret Saunders, the project IS A LACK OF contact with germs from a very early age damaging to health? Does excessive hygiene lead to immune deficiency and risks of allergy? It seems that children in frequent contact with animals -on farms, for example -are .less prone to allergies. The same is true of those brought UR according to the princiQles of . anthroposophy <1) who, among other things, receive fewer vaccines and antibiotics, and enjoy a diet that is richer in fermented products. But why? That is what the researchers on the Parsifal project (Prevention of allergy. Risk factors for sensitisation in children related to farming and anthroposophic life style) aim to find out. THE AIRALLERG PROJECT (Effects of outdoor and indoor air pollution on the development of allergic disease in children) is focusing on one of the prime suspects behind the increase in allergies: air pollution. Several hundred children in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands are being monitored from birth. The researchers collect continuous information on the allergic sensitivity of the children and on the atmos\u00ad pheric pollutants to which they are exposed, both out\u00ad doors (such as the gases and particles emitted by vehi\u00ad cles) and indoors (mould, bacteria, tobacco, combus\u00ad tion gases from boilers and cookers, etc.).

'We are looking for the link between the mother's exposure, the contamination of the pla\u00ad centa and the epidemiology of allergies in children.' This research is particularly important in seeking to reduce risks to children's health, starting in the womb. By exploring a number of avenues (diet, vaccinations, infections, contacts with animals, microbial contami\u00ad nants, intestinal microflora, etc.), this study should help develop a prevention policy for al~:rgies.

This success makes what may otherwise be quite a major transplant operation much less daunting. And opens the way for growing stem cells from other human tissues. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES of cellular biology is to recreate, in vitro, human tissues designed to be rein\u00ad troduced into the body. Tissue cultures originate in a very specific category of cells, known as stem cells. These stem cells are not only able to multiply -to replenish the stock -but also to differentiate and to become specialised cells. Blood stem cells, also known as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), are of particular interest to researchers and doctors. They are found in the red bone marrow where they produce all categories of blood cells (red corpuscles, white corpuscles and platelets) . Growing these HSCs in vitro could therefore make it possible to grow white corpuscles to treat individuals with a bone marrow deficiency or red corpuscles for those suffer\u00ad ing from anaemia -or even to create a complete blood substitute for transfusions . Reproducing without differentiating Any transplant requires a sufficient quantity of blood stem cells to re-implant and, above all, to regenerate the tissue. But donors for organs or for blood are rare. In the specific case of HSCs, produced by the red mar\u00ad row of long bones -such as the femur or sternum -tak\u00ad ing the sample involves major surgery which is an obstacle to finding more than one suitable donor. The solution, therefore, is to amplify the limited HSCs available. But here the researchers face a twofold diffi\u00ad culty: the stem cells are cells at rest which do not spon\u00ad taneously divide and when they do start to proliferate and to differentiate they die very quickly. The aim of the European project entitled Hematopoietic Bioreactor,(1) carried out by eight research teams over four years, was to amplify the HSCs in vitro and to induce them to repro\u00ad duce automatically without differentiation or ageing. I I MEDICAL RESEARCH . RTDinfoN\u00b0 29April2001 17 The blood from a single umbilical cord (80-120 ml) contains as many hematopoietic stem cells as the 800-1200 ml of bone marrow usually taken from a donor. When amplified in vitro these cells enable an adult transplant to be performed without major surgery. Umbilical cord and cell banks The project partners first chose a source of hematopoi\u00ad etic stem cells which solved the problem of donors: the blood from the umbilical cord, which is usually destroyed after birth. The HSCs present in the umbili\u00ad cal cord are of better quality, less likely to be infected, and most importantly less aggressive for the patient than those obtained from bone marrow. 'We realised that the blood obtained from a single umbilical cord, that is between 80 ml and 120 ml, contained as many Another kind of tissue culture Another aspect of this project concerns the develop\u00ad ment of culture environments without any foreign protein in order to reduce the risk of transmitting pathogenic agents such as prions or viruses to man. 'We have developed an environment free of serum albumin and transferrin of bovine or human origin, these being transporters of the fatty acids and iron, respectively, essential for any cellular culture. We have replaced them with synthesised molecules which are ce of stem cells blood stem cells as the 800 ml to 1200 ml of bone marrow usually taken from a donor,' explains Dr Jacques Hatzfeld, the project coordinator . 'The small quantity of HSCs taken from an umbilical cord is suffi\u00ad cient to generate enough blood cells in vitro for a, transplant in an adult patient.' But another obstacle also had to be overcome before it was possible to grow these precious cells. As they are taken from the umbilical cord, they are usually kept in a rest state by the cellular-division inhibitors . The researchers managed to combat this by using mole\u00ad cules which block the action of these inhibitors thus enabling the cells to divide. They then managed to halt the irreversible process of differentiation, with the HSC culture continuing to reproduce for over 1 00 days. In Europe -and in Germany, France, Italy and Spain in particular -umbilical and placental blood banks have been progressively built up in the form of frozen samples which can be subsequently amplified in bioreactors -environments whose composit ion is continuously monitored -using the technique devel\u00ad oped by the project. This system makes it possible to reduce the waiting period for a transplant consider\u00ad ably. In the longer term, doctors would like to create a reservoir of compatible blood stem cells which can then be used as required. therefore not contaminated but which play the same role,' stresses Dr Hatzfeld. The development of the blood stem cells in a bioreac\u00ad tor used by European researchers is a model which is now being applied to other tissues, such as the liver, pancreas, bones and even muscles and brain cells. It is also attracting the interest of industrial partners. This project has therefore opened the door to the laboratory growth of stem cells from human tissues in Europe. t Contact Dr Jacques Hatzfeld Recherche Scien\u00ad tifique, Villejuif, France (coordinateur) Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom Laboratorio di Biologia Cellulare, lstituto della Sanita, The full title is Hematopoietic Bioreacto r: a model for human somatic stem cell culture. 18 RTD info N\u00b0 29 tpril 2001 DIGEST . \" ..

This sequencing of a plant genome for the first time is of considerable significance for the future of agriculture and its effects could be felt much sooner than the decades it will take for the further genetic exploration of human DNA. Work on sequencing Arobidopsis tholiono, which grows in most lati\u00ad tudes, began 1 0 years ago, the plant being chosen for its genetic simplic\u00ad ity. Because decoding these genes is likely to advance relatively quickly, Arabidopsis is set to become a 'bio\u00ad model' unique in its class and the source of a mass of applications for many crops. arabidopsis.org/home.html From the Research Area to the Education Area? There has been a lot of talk of the European Research Area since Janu\u00ad ary 2000. It is an idea which is not only gaining ground, but also being 'exported'. Elly Plooij-van Gorsel (NL), an MEP who follows the Union's scientific and techno\u00ad logical policy with particular inter\u00ad est, believes a European Education Area would be a useful comple\u00ad ment to the Research Area. Her idea took 'informal' shape at an 'informal' meeting convened by the Swedish presidency which invited Europe's research and edu\u00ad cation ministers to take part in a weekend brainstorming session in Uppsala from 1 to 3 March. On the agenda at the meeting were the issues raised by the need to boost Europe's scientific expertise, which is suffering on two scores: - the growing trend among young people to reject science courses and careers, a problem that needs to be tackled at source -by changing the way young people perceive science and careers in science; -population ageing -already appar\u00ad ent even within research teams - which ultimately raises the question as to the performance of European research and education systems in a global knowledge-based society. Contact: eva-m grabs media attention? Why do some research subjects suddenly attract such media attention? Why does much more essential research work meet with such indifference? Is it always a question of jumping on the bandwagon? Physicist Dario Camuffo,<1> one of Europe's most renowned analysts of the microclimate of museums and conser\u00ad vation conditions for works of art, tells of his recent experience. I imagine that these days newspapers are bored with repeating the mad cow story, and were wondering when would there be something new. One of them, Corriere de/lo Sera, which is the most important Italian newspaper, remembered some research I was doing and pre\u00ad sented it as the attraction of the day. In that research, I used the paintings of Canaletto to measure the aver\u00ad age level of high tide in Venice. There were two reasons for this: green-brown algae live in the area which is periodically wetted by tides, and the top of the green band coincides with the high tide level. It was possible to obtain an objective measurement of that level in the first half of the 1 700s because Canaletto, Bellotto, Guardi and the painters of the school of Vedutisti Venezioni used a camera obscura to produce the sketches for their paintings. Before that, artists used to \u00b7 make a sketch on site, and then finish the painting in their ateliers. Canaletto needed a lot of money for his lifestyle, so he invented a way to produce his paintings very quickly. With a camera obscuro he pro\u00ad jected the image of the scene on to a sheet of paper or the canvas, and then drew all the outlines very carefully with a pen. As a result, all his paintings are like real photographs, but taken one century before Daguerre's invention. This idea has driven half of Europe crazy. It has been reported in all the Italian newspapers, journalists and TV are searching for me continually; today I was interviewed from London, and the person told me that the news has already appeared in the Herold Tribune, the Guardian and the Chilean daily Lo Tercero and on various Internet sites (2). You see, you can work seriously your whole life, and nobody cares; but if you only mention an amazing triviality, this immediately goes round the world.

Sheila Jasanoff, who is Professor of Science and Public Policy at Harvard University and specialises in the interactions of law, science and politics, explains. 'The apparenfrobustness of US expertise may well depend on its essential vul\u00ad nerability. If US experts seem to be trusted, it may be because American law and administrative practice have created a wealth of avenues through which people can express, and if necessary act upon, their distrust of expertise ... Grounds on which the credibility of policy-relevant science can be chal\u00ad lenged include not only dubious methodology, but also more overtly social criteria, e.g. untested disciplinary assumptions, inadequate peer review, conflicts of interest, and so forth. The result can be endless deconstruction of technical arguments ... We can identify four mechanisms for preventing such disintegration and for successfully integrating expertise into public policy even under conditions of uncertainty and conflict: Expert authorization. Scientific and technical policy justifications are accepted without challenge on the authority of expert advisory bodies. Although this approach seems to be quite widespread in the US, American advisory bodies (like many of their European counterparts) frequently rep\u00ad resent multiple viewpoints, stakes, and interests. Accordingly, what looks on the surface like purely technical authorization often incorporates distinctly social and political elements. Administrative exhaustion/judicial review.

The Community patent system will not replace either the Euro\u00ad pean patent system or the national patents systems. It will supplement them. A Community patent will be obtained by filing a European patent application des\u00ad ignating the Community area as a whole. This application can also designate non-Commu nity coun\u00ad tries (Switzerland for example). As has been the case since the Euro\u00ad pean patent system was set up in 1978, French, English and Ger\u00ad man will remain the only lan\u00ad guages in which the examination procedure can be conducted . The Community patent will not bring any changes to the filing or examination of applications. It is only after the patent has been issued that the system will be innovative, in terms of the much reduced translation obligations (bringing a major cost reduc\u00ad tion) and its unitary nature. The latter characteristic will allow legal disputes concerning Com\u00ad munity patents to be the subject of uniform decisions applicable throughout the Community ter\u00ad ritory, thus resulting in increased legal security.

Although most of them (56%) are not really pleased with the way Europe is going, young people (aged 18-24) are generally the most optimistic, with 50% holding positive view.

But its application is not without problems. So what is the best way of measuring this capricious poison? TAP WATER must be fit to drink. That goes without saying. At the collection stage, distribution companies carefully analyse the water and carry out the necessary treatments to eliminate any pathogens. But after that another para\u00ad meter comes into play, one which is singularly difficult to monitor and con\u00ad trol: its lead content. Although there may not be a problem between the collection stage and transit through the principal distribution pipes, the risk comes through contact with the sec\u00ad ondary pipes which carry it to the con\u00ad sumer's tap. Lead may contaminate the water as it passes through the branch pipes linking the public system for a particular street to the water meters in individual buildings, or as it passes through their old piping net\u00ad works. Because of its toxicity, lead is one of the most closely monitored chemicals under the new Community drinking water directive, which was adopted two years ago and was supposed to have been transposed into national legisla\u00ad tion by 25 December 2000. The direc\u00ad tive is based on WHO recommendations which set a maximum lead concentra\u00ad tion of 10 micrograms/litre (compared to 50 \u00b5g/1 at present). Member States have another three years to achieve an intermediate objective of 25 \u00b5g/1, and 1 3 years to meet the final target. The new regulations will require a con-siderable effort on the part of certain countries -France, Great Britain, Italy and Spain in particular -where a num\u00ad ber of branch and internal piping sys\u00ad tems are still made of lead. 'In Paris, the proportion is around 70%,' states lerotheos Papadopoulos of the Environ\u00ad ment Directorate-General.' A socio-eco\u00ad nomic study financed by the European Commission puts the cost of making the necessary changes across the Euro\u00ad pean Union at 35 billion euros.' But there remains the matter of reach\u00ad ing agreement on how to assess the lead content of drinking water. When measured at the tap (as stipulated in the directive), the lead content varies considerably depending on the distrib\u00ad ution zone, the individual building and even, within the same building, on the time of day or consumption habits. 'The stagnation time in lead piping is a crucial factor,' explains Alain Boireau, who is responsible for lead contamina\u00ad tion at Vivendi Water. 'The longer the period of stagnation, the greater the amount of lead which is dissolved. Any measurement is therefore going to give very different results depending on the time of day it is taken.' Measure for measure Before the directive can be imple\u00ad mented coherently, the Member States must agree on a sampling method. A recent study, supported by the Com\u00ad mission (Developing a new protocol for the monitoring of lead in drinking water), evaluated the various existing methods. None seems to be perfect. One of them, considered to be the reference method, was found to be very reliable in terms of obtaining a representative sample of the lead content of drinking water in a given building. It involves fitting a unit which draws off a small proportion of the water used to a flask. At the end of a week the flask contains a sample of water whose lead content represents the average for the building. However, apart from being difficult to implement, this method is also very costly. Three other methods were evaluated on the basis of 300 samples taken in five countries. The first, known as random daytime, involves taking a sample at a random moment during the day in a randomly selected building. 'This method has no value as far as the indi\u00ad vidual building is concerned, but it can be a good indicator for a complete dis\u00ad tribution zone, provided at least 30 samples are taken,' says Mr Boireau. 'The study showed that this was the most suitable method for compiling global statistics on a given country, region, town or neighbourhood. It is also the most economical of all the methods currently available.' The second method, known as fully flush, involves taking a sample just after the pipes have been cleared of any stagnant water. 'There is a need for campaigns to promote good prac\u00ad tice,' points out Mr Boireau. 'It is advis\u00ad able, for example, to use water for washing up before filling bottles with drinking water and to take your morn\u00ad ing shower before drinking the first glass of water. On condition that peo\u00ad ple take these precautions, this method then makes it possible to check whether the lead concentrations present -after running off stagnant water from the system -are acceptable in terms of public health.' The third method, known as 30 MS, involves sampling the water after 30 minutes of stagnation . This is then con\u00ad sidered to represent an average lead PUBLIC HEALTH 1 RTDinfoN\u00b0 29April2001 25 content for the user. The European study showed that this method gave results which were closest to the refer\u00ad ence method, but also incurred a cost (an average of one hour on the spot to take the sample) which is unacceptable for routine health checks. Pointers to a better choice 'The results of this study can serve as a basis for an interesting and concrete discussion,' believes Mr Papadopoulos. 'They have also highlighted the com\u00ad plexity of the problem and the impor\u00ad tance of the precise moment when the sample is taken.' Exposure to lead also depends on social, economic and cultural data which are very difficult to determine. In southern countries, for example, old people more often live with their chil\u00ad dren than in the north, consuming water during the day and thereby limit\u00ad ing the stagnation. Similarly, houses which are permanently occupied differ from those which are empty part of the time. The study results are now in the hands of the Commission, which plans to submit proposals to the Member States before the end of this year. t in clear water Thanks to meticulous monitoring, bathing water quality is improving considerably in Europe. But the lack of standardised microbiological measurement methods leaves the result open to dispute. A number of European research projects have tried to put an end to the discord, and, in the process, have provided good examples of what could become the 'support for Community policies' strand of the European Research Area launched by Philippe Busquin. A POOR RANKING is bad for the image. Feared by tourist resorts, the Euro\u00ad pean Commission's annual bathing water report, issued at the beginning of the summer, is awaited with bated breath. The latest edition (for 1999) notes a constant improvement in water quality for both coastal and river bathing water. In 1992, 84.9% of European beaches met the quality cri\u00ad teria laid down by the 1976 directive, in particular from a microbiological point of view. In 1999, the figure had climbed to 95.6%. For fresh water sites, the progress has been even more spectacular : up from 47.5% in 1992 to 90.5% in 1999. This optimistic picture is the result of constant efforts by the Member States and research carried out by laboratories with the aid of the Commission. But it remains open to debate. There is no standardised method for carrying out microbiological measurements in bathing zones -measurements designed to reveal possible faecal contamination. 'The 1976 directive remains vague on the methods of analysis, the result being that laboratories use very different meth-ods. The measurements are not fully comparable,' explains Bert Van Maele of the Environment Directorate-General. Disparities and limits Since the early 1990s, the Union has therefore supported a number of research projects designed, first of all, to assess the disparities between the various methods used and, subse\u00ad quently, to identify a standard method which all laboratories can adopt for their analyses. 26 29 I ~ Another drawback of the present system of monitoring bathing waters is that it is basically a retrospective method. Tradi\u00ad tional microbiological tests take about 36 hours to give a quantified result. It is not therefore possible to envisage a day\u00ad to-day management of beaches on such a basis. The Commission's annual pre\u00ad summer report on bathing water quality is based on the average measurement taken every two weeks during the previ\u00ad ous season. It is therefore only general trends which are picked up, the effects of particular incidents often remaining undetected. A big storm, for example, can cause the drains in a coastal town to overflow for several hours with large quantities of dirty water flowing into the sea. The two or three days which follow could see a very sharp increase in the faecal microbe content of the bathing waters. If no measurement is taken during this relatively short period this increase could well pass totally unnoticed. 'Besides, at the present time we do not have the technical means at our dis-~ PUBL IC HEALTH posal to deal instantly of microbiological tion,' explains Institute in Lille (FR). 'The tests do not yet exist. We will have to wait for a number of years.' Forecasts and variables A number of studies are being carried out at present to develop computer models that can forecast water quality on the basis of a wide range of possible influences, such as hydrography, weather, capacity of purification sta\u00ad tions, populatio n, drain design, etc. 'The purpose of these computer models is to predict a deterioration in bathing water quality so that, if necessary, cer\u00ad tain beaches can be closed as a preven\u00ad tive measure,' explains Eddie Maier, a scientific officer with the Research DG. The European Commission held a scien\u00ad tific workshop on this subject at Sitges (Spain) in June 1997. The experts con\u00ad cluded that a more proactive approach was 'technically possible' and would provide 'a valuable and inexpensive instrument in many cases' in support of a directive on bathing water quality. In its recent communication entitled Developing a new bathing water policy, the Commission notes that this research has given quite good results in the case of models for hydrographic basins which are small in size or only exposed to a small number of potential sources of pollution. But more extensive bathing areas with multiple potential sources of contamination require sophisticated forecasting models. Realistically, such models will probably be used only for the main bathing resorts. t Choosing Contact Jean-Marie Delattre your microbes jea n-m a rie. -Ii I le. fr The Microbath project (1996-1999), coordinated by the Institut Pasteur (Lille), set its sights on developing a standard method for analysing bathing water quality which could be used by all European laboratories charged with this task of protecting public health. 'It was first necessary to redefine the microbes selected as the best indicators of faecal contamination of the water,' explains coordinator Jean-Marie Delattre. According to the 1976 directive, two families of bacte\u00ad ria are 'good 'is that these families are much too big. They include many bacteria which have never seen an intes\u00ad tine in their lives. Today, everybody agrees that the best indicators are E. coli bacteria, and a group of four intestinal enterococci for recreational waters.' This selection is in line with the WHO proposal in its draft guidelines on recreational waters. Sixteen European laboratories cooperated on the Microbath project which validated two microbiologi\u00ad cal reference analysis procedures for these two micro\u00ad bial indicators . The methods chosen allow a maximum margin of error of 5% and were tested on a samples of natural fresh water and sea water. During one season, the laboratories then compared their own methods with the new standardised methods. Today, the proce\u00ad dures adopted by the Microbath project are candidates for the status of CEN (European Standardisation Cen\u00ad tre) standards . The next Commission bathing water directive could make an explicit reference to a CEN or ISO standard. 'This means that the Member States should preferably use an ISO or CEN method,' points out Bert Van Maele (Environment DG), 'but they can also use other meth\u00ad ods provided they show comparable results.' CLIMATE . RrD1nfoW 29April2001 27 to combat the greenhouse effect? Can forests reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the principal cause of climate warming? This sensitive question was one of the reasons for the failure of the conference in The Hague in November 2000 which sought concrete international commitments implementing the 1997 Kyoto protocol. Such commitments are the subject of intense scientific debate, which the vast CarboEurope research network is seeking to help resolve. 28 RTD info W 29 \\pi-ii 200 CLIMATE I 'THE CONCEPT of carbon sinks is a recent one, originat\u00ad ing around 1990 when climate change started to appear as a real threat,' remembers Riccardo Valentini of Tuscia University (IT), the co-ordinator of this research. 'Before that we had a static approach to the role of forest ecosystems in the carbon cycle, consider\u00ad ing that, come what may, they were in a state of equi\u00ad librium, their carbon absorption capacities being offset by emission fluxes. Studies carried out in the meantime have shown that the concept of carbon sinks is indeed a reality and that the stocking ability of these sinks is far from negligible.' Research carried out by scientists over the past decade has brought us to an initial conclusion: terrestrial carbon sinks, globally estimated to average around 1.9 billion tonnes/year (gigatonnes) in the 1980s, rose to a capacity of 2.3 gigatonnes in the 1990s -an increase of almost 20%. This development represents a major potential for soaking up C02, one which the latest estimates put at about one quarter of present C02 emissions of human origin. Opportunity in Kyoto It was on the basis of this finding that the industrialised countries finally committed themselves to reducing greenhouses gases at the arduous Kyoto negotiations in 1997. According to the terms of the concluding protocol of this 'historic' conference (see box), carbon sinks resulting from deliberate policies of afforestation (the creation of new forests) or reforestation (the replanting of zones formerly given over to forestry, but abandoned since 1970) could earn countries green credits equivalent to a reduction in the sources of greenhouse gas emissions. But this provision is proving a real problem due to the lack of an effective method for realistically quantifying such credits. Three years after Kyoto, the recent failure of the conference in The Hague has shown that some countries (most notably the United States) have seized upon this notion of forest carbon sinks as an argument for avoiding as much as possible any kind of restriction on their fossil fuel consumption . For its part, the Euro\u00ad pean Union is showing itself to be much more reticent about this whole notion of carbon sinks: before back\u00ad ing this option of flexibility in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is demanding an effective and reliable quantification of the real capacities of terrestrial forest ecosystems to stock carbon. The carbon cycle A primordial element in the global ecosystem, car\u00ad bon constitutes a fixed worldwide stock which is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, oceans and continents -according to a cycle governed by the continuous exchanges between each of these 'reser\u00ad voirs'. It is present in the atmosphere in the form of car\u00ad bon dioxide (COz) and plays a vital role as a green\u00ad house gas, absorbing (together with clouds, dust and certain other gases such as high-altitude ozone) the infra-red rays emitted by the reflection of solar rays from the earth's surface. This ensures that aver\u00ad age temperatures on earth remain temperate. Carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and the continents are mainly produced by the breath\u00ad ing of living organisms (which release carbon diox\u00ad ide) and plant photosynthesis (which fixes carbon to make organic matter). Natural disturbances (major forest fires, volcanic eruptions, etc.) can temporarily increase spontaneous emissions of considerable quantities of co2 into the atmos\u00ad phere. But during the earth's long history, the con\u00ad tinental reservoir has built up a quantity of carbon estimated to be three times the quantity present in the atmosphere, as a result of the processes of decomposition and fossilisation which are the rea\u00ad sons for long-term fixation in the form of coal, gas and oil. Since the beginning of the industrial age, the increasing combustion of fossil carbon, coupled with deforestation, has been the source of a perma\u00ad nent increase in the COz in the air. Hence the increased greenhouse effect and the prospect of global warming. The oceanic reservoir contains almost 20 times more carbon than the continental ecosystem. The considerable but largely unquantified exchanges of carbon dioxide between the air and sea are gov\u00ad erned by a whole range of physical parameters, linked to solubility, and biological parameters, linked to absorption by planktonic micro-organ\u00ad isms. Vast quantities of carbon are stocked in the sea in the form of limestone sediments, too. Is it feasible to make use of the capacity of marine car\u00ad bon sinks? Scientists believe that such action could lead to serious imbalances in oceanic ecosystems, in particular the proportion of oxygen essential to submarine life. fJ I CLIMATE . RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 29 Many unknowns The CarboEurope initiative aims to clear up the ambi\u00ad guity and to advance our knowledge on these issues. Launched a year ago by the Global change, climate and biodiversity key action under the Fifth Framework Pro\u00ad gramme, it consists of eight multidisciplinary research projects involving 190 scientists and 69 institutions from 15 European countries. Six of them, each developing their specific method\u00ad ologies and then comparing their results, are con\u00ad Europe (Forcast, Carboage, Car\u00ad boeuroflux, Recab, Aerocarb and Carbodata). Two others are studying important areas from the point of view of global carbon sink capacities, namely the car\u00ad bon stocking capacities of the vast boreal (Eurosiber\u00ad ian and tropical (LBAcarbonsink, in Ama\u00ad zonia) primeval forests. 'The scale of the research reflects the many unknowns science is facing in this field, which require real scien\u00ad tific teamwork if they are to be resolved. To evaluate the phenomena, local measurements must first be car\u00ad ried out. These are then incorporated into models making it possible to extrapolate the results in space and time, leading to a final estimate of their contribu\u00ad tion to the carbon cycle at the global level.' Treetop sensors Contacts Riccardo Valentini, us. bruen ing@cec.eu. i nt The Eddy Flux sensor technology developed by the Euroflux project (which preceded CarboEurope) is based on the measurement of rapid tluctuations in vertical wind speeds and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmos\u00ad phere. Placed on towers above treetop level, these devices carry out 20 measurements a second and calculate a net carbon dioxide flux between the vegetation and the atmos\u00ad phere every hour. 150 of these instruments are currently operating worldwide, 50 of them in Europe. The results obtained from these measurements in forests of every age and variety show that car\u00ad bon fixation by European plant carbon sinks is far from insignificant, contrary to what earlier studies had suggested. It can be as much as an average of 6 tonnes per hectare per year, with boreal forests fixing less carbon than forests in the centre and south of Europe. In particular, the results show that these ancient forests fix more carbon than was previously thought. 30 RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 CLIMATE From stock to source According to CarboEurope's initial estimates for the European continent, every year 0.3 gigatonnes of car\u00ad bon are fixed for every 2 gigatonnes emitted. 'These quantities are therefore far from negligible, but, more importantly, they are not constant,' believes Professor Valentini. 'The interannual differences can be consid\u00ad erable, of the same order as the sinks themselves, in particular due to the permanent variability of climatic conditions. When you have a global perturbation with a cycle extending over several years, such as that repeatedly triggered by the El Nino phenomenon or that of the North Atlantic oscillation, plant growth is greatly influenced and a forest sink can reverse its effect from one year to the next and become a source of C02 emissions.' But the uncertainty is not limited to the quantity of carbon dioxide absorbed by the conti\u00ad nental biomass as there are also major questions regarding the limits and stability of this stock. 'The sinks can only be a temporary solution,' stresses Valentini. 'Sooner or later the system's satura\u00ad tion level will be reached and the carbon dioxide stored released. The time gained in this way -50 to 1 00 years at the very most -can be used to develop alternative solutions. But it is to be feared that the problem of carbon sinks will be used by the States as an excuse for delaying the vital emission reduction measures which are needed.' All quiet on the environment front What is more, reforestation solutions are also causing local and environmental decision-makers to ask some questions. When evaluating the impact of a reforesta\u00ad tion project, every dimension, including subtle inter\u00ad actions, must be taken into account. Over the last two decades, the abandoning of agricultural land certainly contributed to a major increase in forest sinks between 1980 and 1998 in the European Union. It is estimated, however, that 4% of this increased carbon absorption is being offset by a constantly growing demand for wood, leading to increased imports and thus defor\u00ad estation elsewhere on the planet. Paradoxically, the Kyoto protocol highlighted the role of reforestation while remaining quiet about the huge problem of the destruction of ancient forests, in par\u00ad ticular in the tropics. Deforestation in these areas, largely due to man, totals something in the region of 2 gigatonnes/year, or the equivalent of the gains expected from a policy of carbon sinks. But these vir\u00ad gin forests also represent stocks of an irreplacable bio\u00ad diversity which it has taken hundreds of years to cre\u00ad ate. Their destruction cannot be offset by accounts based on new tree plantations, which would necessar\u00ad ily take the form of monocultures over extensive sur\u00ad faces. In this respect, the Kyoto protocol is in flagrant contradiction of another international convention, originating from the 1992 Rio de Janeiro conference, concerning protection of biodiversity (CBD). t Kyoto, a questionable step forward The Kyoto protocol, signed in Japan in 1997, will no doubt remain the symbol of a first historic step: the recognition of the need for humankind to unite in adopt\u00ad ing a global policy when facing up to its responsibilities vis-a-vis the global ecosystem of which we are a part. Accepting the scientific evidence for man's impact on the Earth's climate, the industrialised countries unilaterally agreed -i.e. without requiring developing countries to make a comparable effort, which would be unsustainable given their current under-consumption of energy -to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, principally the carbon dioxide (C02) produced by burning fossil fuels. The agreement calls for an average 5% cut in greenhouse gas emissions -8% for the European Union -compared to the 1990 emission levels. This is to be achieved over the next 10 years or so, that is by 2010-2012. But when it comes to implementing measures to achieve these ambi\u00ad tious objectives, the Kyoto protocol remains quite ambiguous. It simply recommends a number of measures to cut emissions -by increased development of energy\u00ad saving measures and the use of non-fossil fuel -while allowing some flexibility, the terms of which remain to e defined. 'Emission licences' can be traded, for exam\u00ad le, between rich and poor countries (in return for imple\u00ad enting clean energy development projects in the latter) hile mention is also made of the storage of carbon in he vegetation.

But this valuable scientific heritage is too often ignored. Now, thanks to the ENHSIN project, a network of interconnected databases is set to combine these resources in a coherent and accessible infrastructure. Anthias anthias -a fish disc'overed during the first voyage of Captain Cook (1768-1771 ). THE HOME of taxonomy*, Europe houses almost three\u00ad fifths of all 'type specimens' -those used to identify a plant or animal for the first time -in the history of the natural sciences. Its museums, botanical and zoologi\u00ad cal gardens, and universities possess collections of an incredible variety, in part enriched by its colonial past. 'Because they contain unique information on the dis\u00ad tribution of species in both space and time, these col\u00ad lections represent a source of fundamental knowledge for research, especially in the framework of the inter\u00ad national undertakings of the Convention on Biological Diversity,' explains Malcolm Scoble of The Natural History Museum in London (NHM). This agreement C1l, signed in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro by more than 180 countries, seeks to 'conserve biological diversity, the sustainable use of its elements and the fair and equi\u00ad table sharing of the benefits stemming from the use of genetic resources.' 'The collections are a source of essential references in this respect,' explains Simon Tillier, of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. 'If, for example, we discover a natural substance with potentially use\u00ad ful applications, we then need the means to compare it with reliable references so that we can share the I z Q) ..c f-------@ Agate -Sectioned mineral, showing the pattern of concentric circles around different points - Origin: Uruguay. fruits of the exploitation of this biological resource with the countries it comes from.' Natural science col\u00ad lections can also prove very interesting tools for eco\u00ad nomic prospecting. 'The analysis of micro-fossils is a very valuable tool in the search for oil deposits,' con\u00ad tinues Antony Weir of the NHM. 'And many museums have key collections of these specimens, which can be used as models and compared to samples obtained from experimental drillings.' Due to the geographical dispersion of the collections and the variety of information support systems used to classify them, gaining access to this knowledge remains something of an adventure . Despite some progress in facilitating the consultation of general data on Europe's various museological collections (see box), there is still no structure enabling information recorded on a given specimen to be obtained directly. 'At present, a researcher who wants to record the number of species of mosquito present in European collections has no alternative but to write individually to each of the bodies likely to have some,' regrets Simon Tillier. NATURAL SCIENCES RTD info N\u00b0 29 Apr-ii 2001 33 f natural \u00a9 MNHN, Paris history collections Interconnecting With the aim of rectifying this situation, a three-yea r project called ENHSIN (European Natural History Specimen Information Network) was launched in January 2000. Co-ordinated by The Natural History Museum in London, it aims to create an interactive system facilitating access to these valuable data. Among the most important are the place and date of discovery of each specimen, as well as the exact scientific name attributed to it. 'The idea is to create a permanent tool which allows for interconnection of the databases of the institutions housing the museum collections so as ultimately to build up a genuine European network,' says project coordinator Malcolm Scoble. Seven institutions have already teamed up to work on developing this pilot network. The task is a considerable one in a field scarcely touched by informa\u00ad tion and communication technologies . 'Of the tens of millions of specimens housed at the Museum National d'His\u00ad toire Naturelle in Paris, there is a com\u00ad puter file on just a small percentage of them,' explains Nicolas Bailly. 'And when databases do exist, they are not necessarily structured in the same way and the ways in which information is stored digitally can vary greatly from one institution to another.' The first step in creating a European network is therefore to harmonise, organise and structure the information on the speci\u00ad mens conserved in the museum collec\u00ad tions. Standardising A number of groups have been set up. Apart from computerising its own col\u00ad lections, each of the partners is respon\u00ad sible, alone or in cooperation with oth\u00ad ers, for part of the general harmonisa\u00ad tion work. One of the teams is identifying the needs and expectations of potential users of the ENHSIN net\u00ad work by circulating questionnaires, while another is studying any problems of intellectual ownership which could arise. Others are defining the overall structure of the database or its techni\u00ad cal construction, namely a program which can consult the databases on the various institutions' servers via the Internet so as to retrieve the pertinent information on each specimen. Finally, one working group is looking at how such a project should be managed. Although access to the network must in principle be free, this does not rule out charging certain users, such as companies. The work of the new ENHSIN network should progress rapidly over the coming months thanks to the survey results. At the annual meeting of the Taxonomic Database Working Group (TDWG), attended by the project partners last November in Frankfurt, there was even talk of using the initial results as a basis for creating a worldwide network. t (7) See also Carbon sinks to combat the green\u00ad house effect, p.2 7 Biodiversity: the network web The ENHSIN project is specific in that it seeks to network an inventory of data on the many and varied collections of specimens in the care of Europe's nat\u00ad ural history museums. It is also part of a major international effort consisting of many networking initiatives aimed at safeguarding biodiversity, a goal set by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992 at a conference in Rio de Janeiro. Launched in 199 7, the European Bio\u00ad CISE initiative aims to publish a cata\u00ad logue on the Internet systematically classifying biological collections. On a global scale, the Species 2000 network, set up in 1994 by the International Union of Biological Sciences .(IUBS), also has the objective of classifying all known species of plantsj animals, fungi and other micro-organisms on Earth. To coordinate and ensure the coherence of these many efforts, a new global struc\u00ad ture has been set up at the initiative of the OECD's Megascience Forum: the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) which will help organise the net\u00ad works. By joining forces with the inter\u00ad national community in this effort, the European Union will provide crucial logistical support. www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/biocise/ www.gbif.org/ www.sp2000.org/ 34 RTDinfoN\u00b0 29April2001 El'l RESEARCH AND SOCIETY Rooted in a common culture shared throughout a long history, the sense of belonging to the same area lies at the basis of the European identity. More recently, a European consciousness has been added to a moral and political consciousness. Is it true to speak of a European identity? How did the sense of belonging to Europe evolve during the 20th century? What are the factors which shape it? For the past decade more than a 100 historians have been networking, in small groups, on these complex issues which underlie the contemporary political debate. Their research won them a place among the finalists for the Descartes Prize. (*) To be or not IDENTITY is not the same as consciousness . Conscious\u00ad ness is not sentiment. The first task of the European iden\u00ad tities network of researchers was to define these three concepts, and then to study their variations in time and space, and in different socio-economic contexts. 'Iden\u00ad tity, that is the sense of belonging to Europe or the con\u00ad sciousness of being European, is linked to a socio-cul\u00ad tural dimension,' they explain in their presentation. Going back a long time, this identity is based on a shared civilisation and a common destiny. On the other hand, European consciousness is more recent -it emerged after the horrors of 1914-18 -and adds a moral and political dimension to identity: 'It is already a conscious\u00ad ness of the need to build Europe.' Finally, under the influence of consciousness and sentiment, European identity develops towards a sense of belonging to the European Union, even if this is still fragmentary. These different 'states' do not, however, develop linearly. Identification and behaviour After the first phase involving 120 researchers work\u00ad ing from 1989 tol 994, a network of 180 historians continued the exploration in two directions (1995- 1999). On the one hand, they investigated the processes by which European identities are formed and the resistance they meet and, on the other, the behaviour, alliances and action which help give birth to consciousness and sentiment, the mortar of Euro\u00ad pean integration. 'We first wanted to focus on relationships between European identity and national identity, or European identity and Western identity,' explains Robert Frank, a professor at the Universite de Paris I (Sorbonne) and the network's co-ordinator. 'We wanted to gauge to what extent national diversities are an obstacle to this process or, on the contrary, if they are perhaps a com\u00ad ponent of it.' Some groups studied cultural transfers -'influences' in terms of lifestyle or ways of thinking -between coun\u00ad tries and the part they may have played in creating the concept of identity. Others studied the same phe\u00ad nomenon with reference to regions, social classes, reli\u00ad gious beliefs, the media, etc. A sense of belonging Two components of European society were the sub\u00ad ject of more precise research: the economic players and intellectuals (see box). The sentiments of the for\u00ad mer seem to be marked by a constant desire to 'build' Europe. The motivations of the latter are more com\u00ad plex and less constant. It was in the 1920s that business managers first became aware of the importance of external competi\u00ad tion -mainly from the United States -and of the ben\u00ad efits of joining forces. They thought in terms of the 'European area' and the Franco-German axis, the lat\u00ad ter becoming one of the cornerstones of European RESEARCH AND SOCIETY RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 35 -intellectuals Intellectuals, especially German and French, played an important role in the formation of a European consciousness in the period between the wars. Based on pacifism and linked to Europeanism, this move\u00ad ment was partially interrupted by the Second World War. The Cold War and decolonisation brought a long period of indifference on the part of intellectu\u00ad als, most of whom took up positions in favour of either the East or the West, against colonialism, for the Third World, or supported Marxist theories and structuralism. 'Paradoxically, the intellectuals were interested in European unity as long as it was not becoming a reality. When Europe actually began to integrate, they turned away from it, finding it too economic and technological,' points out Robert Frank. Since the decline of the major ideologies and the fall of the Berlin Wall with its symbolic value, there has been a new confidence among intellectuals in the democracy embodied by Europe, as opposed to that of the United States. 'Europe is becoming an area which can provide shared values and propose acer\u00ad tain kind of globalisation which is not the US model.' o be European integration and already an important 'sub-area', that was soon to be destroyed by the Second World War. 'Monetary Europe and social Europe are more rooted in history than is generally believed. These two areas are two very important elements in the sense of belong\u00ad ing.' C1l Professor Frank believes that social Europe is of fundamental importance in strengthening a common identity. 'Europe will become a reality when its citizens have the real sense that it helps them progress in their day-to-day lives. For decades the nation state had a monopoly on welfare, and the welfare state has con\u00ad tinued to exist in our countries, despite the onslaughts of neo-liberalism. Europe could now shoulder part of the burden and become welfare-Europe.' The sense of belonging therefore needs to have its roots in the concrete . In this respect the euro is a valu\u00ad able tool. Pragmatic and symbolic -while also provid\u00ad ing a political instrument -the euro could make up for the deficiencies and strengthen the sense of identity. 'The general public is aware of the poor distribution of powers in Europe. Many Europeans no doubt want more from Europe, while remaining dissatisfied with the way Europe is being created. They have the feeling it interferes in questions of no importance because it is incapable of resolving major issues. Institutional changes, both real and symbolic, could boost motiva\u00ad tion for Europe and thus act as a catalyst. Recent progress towards European defence and a rapid reac\u00ad tion force for the EU is encouraging in this respect.' Elusive Europe But what Europe are we talking about here? Where should we set the limits to this Europe in the making? Is it enough to experience a sense of belonging in rela\u00ad tion to a political area to integrate into and become a part of it? 'Although the Russians have a European cul\u00ad tural identity, is it true to speak of their European polit\u00ad ical identity when most of them believe that Russia is a political entity in itself? Can we deny Turkey's Euro\u00ad pean cultural identity on the grounds that it is a Mus\u00ad lim country? No, because Islam is also part of Europe. In this case, too, it is Turkey's political identity which will be the determining factor.' The notion of the European area is one of the research network's future projects - a network now enlarged to include Polish, Hungarian and Russian historians, and seeking to include a range of disciplines. In addition to the palpable and concrete notion of area -northern, southern and central Europe, etc. -they will also be looking at the 'abstract' area. 'Is there a European democratic area, symbolic areas, a European-op inion area? These are all complex questions. Take just one example . There is often the feeling that there are national opinions on the one hand, and international opinion on the other, in the form of major global emo\u00ad tions. But the intermediate area -European opinion - is much more difficult to detect.' t (7) All quotations are from Robert Frank.

We retrace the route of one of 'greater Europe's' masterminds who decided to stay. came 1 BURES-SUR-YVITTE, south of Paris. This leafy suburb is home to one of the major centres of mathematics and the\u00ad oretical physics, the lnstitut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES). Maxim Kontsevich has taught here since 1995. This quiet mathematician was born in Khimki, near Moscow, in 1964. Born into a cultured family -his father was an expert on Korean language and history, his mother an engineer , and his older brother a researcher in computer imaging -during his last three years at secondary school in Moscow, Kontsevich took special advanced courses in maths and physics, admis\u00ad sion to which was by competition only. These subjects have fascinated him since he was an adolescent ('thanks to my brother and some very good books'). His talents were first displayed in the mathematics Olympiads, a high-level competition in which he was ranked second nationally. This success -at the age of 16 -won him a place at Moscow University. His high ranking in the Olympiads allowed him to bypass the rather subjective entrance examinations at a time when university policy had a clearly anti-Semitic slant (Kontsevich is pronounced in a way which resembles a Polish Jewish name, a fact which has caused his brother a lot of problems). After completing his studies, Maxim Kontsevich set to work on his doctoral thesis. He opted for a subject in the field of mathematical physics. At this same time he joined the Institute for Problems of Information Pro\u00ad cessing, a Moscow laboratory attached to the Acad\u00ad emy of Sciences, where he undertook research in mathematical theory. Witten's conjecture His career took an international turn in 1990 when he was invited to spend three months at the Max Planck Institute in Bonn (DE). The visit culminated in a con\u00ad ference and seminar at which the guest speakers included Sir Michael Atiyah, 'an eminent British math\u00ad ematician who spoke of wonderful things, most Fields, strings and knots Maxim Kontsevich's research cuts across many fields oi pure mathematics, mixing algebra, geometry, analysisl topology, combinatorics, etc. Some of his work is inspired by theoretical physics, in particular string the\u00ad ory and quantum field theory, which applies quantum theory to the interaction between elementary particles. Among other things, this theory helps us understand the interactions between electrons and photons, which are the 'energy packets' of an electromagnetic field. One of physics' main unresolved problems is that we still do not have a coherent theory of this kind which can be applied to gravity, even if preliminary models of quantum gravitation have been proposed and studied. One of Kontsevich's contributions has been to demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of two of the models. importantly Witten's conjecture.' This was a major concep\u00ad tual development based on certain geometrical aspects of string theory. Developed in the late 1980s, this complex approach takes the view that the fundamental particles of physics are not point-like objects but minute, on(a-dimen \u00ad sional strings existing in a multi-dimensional 'spacetime' (current puts the number at 11 ). Kontsevich was 'obsessed' by what he had heard and the next day, during a final boat trip on the Rhine for confer\u00ad ence participants, he explained to his colleagues how he intended to prove Witten's conjecture. The project sounded so impressive that he was invited there and then to return to the Max Planck Institute as a visitor for a full year. The young Russian mathematician was to spend a number of periods at the institute and it was in Bonn that he obtained his doctorate in 1992. His German 'visit' in fact lasted until 1994, interrupted by stays of several months in the United States at the invitation of Harvard University, Princeton's famous Institute for Advanced Studies, and the University of California at Berkeley, where he was a profes\u00ad sor from 1993 to 1996. Like many of his compatriots condemned to exile, Kontsevich could have settled permanently in the United States. He had a post at Berkeley, not far from San Francisco where his brother was living. He was in fact on the point of buying a home there when the IHES offered him the post of resident professor. He knew the institute's reputation, having spent a few days there in 1988 during a short working visit to France. Russian eclecticism So why did he decide to head back across the Atlantic to Europe? 'This institute offers total freedom in research, with no hierarchy and virtually no bureaucracy . What is more, the Paris region is the world's leading mathema tics centre.' That used to be true of Moscow and Leningrad, but with PORTRAIT RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 37 the collapse of the Soviet Union the famous Russian school found itself scattered across the globe, ' ... espe\u00ad cially in the United States, but also in Europe, where France is the principal host country. At the IHES alone, with Mikhael Gromov and Nikita Nekrassov, the Rus\u00ad sians make up half the resident professors ... ' Kontsevich is also visiting professor at Rutgers University in the United States, now home to his former teacher lsrail Gelfand. Together with his fellow countrymen, he is therefore helping to keep alive, in the diaspora, some\u00ad thing of the tradition which brought such renown to the Russian school of mathematics. 'The style is difficult to define, but it can be described as very open, universal and\u00b7 intuitive. You find it more in Europe than in the United States where researchers tend to be very specialised .' This Russian eclecticism is apparent in Kontsevich's own work which covers virtually the whole spectrum of mathemat\u00ad ics: 'I have worked on almost 20 different subjects, in many fields.' In 1998, his research won him the Fields Medal, a leading, international prize awarded every four years to four mathematicians under the age of 40. Often linked to questions originating in string theory and quantum field theory (the theoretical and mathe\u00ad matical field which describes the world of elementary particles), the work of Maxim Kontsevich deals with general mathematical structures that appear in fields which do not seem at first to have a great deal in com\u00ad mon. But it is not the possible applications of a partic\u00ad ular field of physics or technology which interests him, nor the rig-our of mathematical demonstrations. What Maxim Kontsevich likes in mathematics is what he calls its 'beauty'. And especially the beauty of the structures he discovers in it.

This involves characterising the deformation and displacement of the materials which make up the rods, following their partial liquefaction. These tests are carried out using tomographic techniques (transmission tomography, y-ray emission tomography, etc.) which make it possible to reconstitute the internal and three\u00ad dimensional structure of the fuel cluster. Above: 3-D tomography of the fuel cluster degraded during the FPT-1 test. \u00a9IPSN. Anticipating -an -the wors At Cadarache, in the south of France, the Phebus reactor is being used to simulate nuclear accidents. Conducted as part of an ambitious international programme, these experiments aim to anticipate the effects of such incidents, hopefully to prevent them from happening in the first place, and to avoid the worst if they do. 12 OCTOBER 2000: the staff at the lnstitut de protec\u00ad tion et surete nucleaire (IPSN) in the con\u00ad trol room of the Phebus experimental reactor. After long months of preparation, the time has come for the 'FPT-2 test'. At 09.23, the operators start up the reac\u00ad tor, progressively increasing the power. The flow of neutrons heats up the main 'guinea pig' in the exper\u00ad iment: a 'bundle' of 20 nuclear-fuel rods -containing uranium oxide pellets -placed at the centre of the reactor, where the temperature starts to climb to over 2 500\u00b0C. This simulation causes a degradation in the materials tested similar to that caused by the very worst nuclear accidents. The process ends at 14.52 when, having consulted the many instruments placed in the device, it is decided that the fuel degradation and related emissions of dangerous materials have reached the expected levels. The drama of the experiment was followed by a vari\u00ad ety of operations and physico-chemical examinations of the aerosols emitted and the chemistry of the radioactive products . Throughout the test, samples were taken -at regular intervals and at different loca\u00ad tions inside the circuits and the container shell -of the elements released as a result of the intense heat and the melting of part of the test fuel bundle. These oper\u00ad ations continued until 1 7 October. The researchers then started to collect the samples taken for analysis and to examine the cluster and its components. The post-experimental phase is still continuing. It will be another two or three years before the final conclusions of the FPT-2 are available, when all the experimental results have been acquired, analysed and interpreted. Nu CLEAR s A FE Ty RTD info N\u00b0 29 April 2001 39 Phebus is a small experimental reactor (40 megawatts), able to hold a zircaloy-clad test bundle of 20 one-metre fuel rods in a centralised watertight cell and to heat it by neutronic irradiation . An absorbent rod in a silver\u00ad indium-cadmium alloy lies at the centre. This represents the control rods which are inserted to various depths into the heart of a nuclear reactor to absorb the neutrons and thereby regulate or stop the fission reactions. The test bundle is contained in a sealed cylindrical enve\u00ad lope, cooled by circulating water, and irrigated by steam voiding Six global experiments This simulation was carried out under the European Phebus FP programme,<1J the most important interna\u00ad tional research project in the field of nuclear safety. The aim? To study as closely as possible what happens to fis\u00ad sion products -the substances created by the fission reac\u00ad tions of the atomic fuel core -in a situation that simulates a serious accident in which the reactor fuel melts, in full or in part. In other words, it is a question of evaluating what quantity of extremely harmful radioactive products are likely to be emitted into the environment and in what form -gas or dust. Phebus FP is distinctive in that it carries out research on safety by means of global experiments at an installation (see box) which reproduces on a reduced scale, in the region of 1 /5000, the principal configurations of a pres\u00ad surised water reactor (the most common type in the West). Phebus FP therefore complements experimental studies that focus on specific effects but are incomplete and on a smaller scale. FPT-2 is the fourth in a series of six simulation exercises, the first of which was carried out in 1993. The main dif\u00ad ferences between them lie in the fuel tested and the flow rate of the steam. The irradiated fuel (i.e., fuel which has already been used in a reactor) employed in last October's which collects the products formed and carries them to a section of the cooling circuit. This represents the princi\u00ad pal elements of the primary cooling circuit of a pres\u00ad surised water reactor. The steam carries the fission prod\u00ad ucts and other materials which escape from the fuel clus\u00ad ter to a containment system measuring 10 m3, which represents the container building in a nuclear reactor. This is a way of reproducing a rupture in a reactor's pri\u00ad mary circuit resulting in the steam and the substances it is carrying being released into the container building. In Phebus, the fission products are deposited on painted sur\u00ad faces (making it possible to study the action of the paint which reacts to the iodine) or in the sump at the bottom of the container. The circuit, the container and the sampling devices are placed in a watertight housing known as a 'caisson' mea\u00ad suring 350 m3 , which isolates them from the exterior and prevents any emissions into the environment. The cais\u00ad son itself is situated in an experimentation hall protected by concrete one metre thick. The experiment installation is also equipped with approximately 250 measuring and sampling instruments: several dozen thermometers dis\u00ad tributed throughout the fuel cluster and enveloping structures (to monitor the state of degradation of the test cluster), gamma ray spectrometry devices (to monitor the length of the circuit, and in the container changes to the fission products carried by the steam), and devices mea\u00ad suring the aerosols and the composition of the gaseous and liquid phases in the container.

The variation in the steam-flow rate determines the degree to which the fuel and its zircaloy (an alloy of zirconium) cladding is oxidised. The oxidation of zircaloy is an exothermal reaction which emits hydrogen and thus poses two major threats in a damaged reac\u00ad tor where the core is excessively hot: the physical degradation of the fuel, and the production of hydrogen which can lead to the build-up of excess pres\u00ad sure in the container building. Confirmations and surprises The results obtained to date by the Phebus FP programme confirm much of what was already known, but also indicate a number of important effects which were not expected and had not been taken into account by the model\u00ad Ii ng and computing codes used to study serious accidents: the hydrogen produced by the oxidation of the cladding had been underestimated; the melting at the core, that is the liq\u00ad uefaction of the fuel rods, occurred at temperatures several hundred degrees lower than anticipated; and a small part of the radioactive iodine -one of the principal products of highly radioactive fission -penetrated the container shell in the form of a gas (bringing an increased risk of emissions in the environment) when it was believed that it would be in the form of solid caesium iodide particles. On the other hand, the silver produced by the melting of the control rod proved to have a positive effect as it trapped the rest of the iodine in solution in the sump water, thereby reducing the quantities released in gaseous form. These results demonstrate the benefits of the research. They are already being included in the accident computing codes used throughout the world, such as the ICARE 2 core deterioration code developed and used in France by the IPSN, or the ASTEC global code which the IPSN developed in cooperation with its German partner the GRS (Gesellschaft fur Anlagen und Reaktorsicherheit) . The next experiment (FPT-3) is sched\u00ad uled for 2003. It will be similar to the test which has just been carried out, but with a control rod made of boron carbide (84 C) -as used by many reac\u00ad tors -rather than Ag-ln-Cd alloy. The aim is to study the deterioration of the fuel in the presence of boron carbide as well as changes to the chemistry of the fission products, particularly the iodine. Scheduled for 2006, the final test is still being defined. It should simulate an A pro ramme of global interest accident scenario in which the air pen\u00ad etrates the interior of the reactor core (following an accident when recharg\u00ad ing the core or rupture of the vat by the melted core, for example). Once all six Phebus FP experiments have been car\u00ad ried out, analysed and interpreted, the world community will have the knowl\u00ad edge necessary to significantly improve the prevention, evaluation and man\u00ad agement of serious nuclear accidents. But Phebus FP will not have the last word. The Phebus-2000 programme, currently being developed, will con- tinue the work.
