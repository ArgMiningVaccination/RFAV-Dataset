Aim This study aimed to determine the protective and therapeutic effects of heat-killed preparations of Lactobacillus casei and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a breast cancer mouse model. Methods Forty-two female BALB/c mice (7-8 weeks old) were divided into six groups (seven mice per group). Four groups were injected with 107 Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) subcutaneously into the left side of the mammary fat pad. Tumor growth was monitored weekly until all animals developed a palpable tumor. The tumor-bearing mice in the experimental groups received heat-killed L. casei or S. cerevisiae three times per week for 35 days. The mice in the control group received PBS. The remaining two groups received heated L. casei or S. cerevisiae and then were injected with EAT cells. After 35 days, all mice were sacrificed to determine the immune response. Results Animals that received heated S. cerevisiae exhibited the lowest rate of tumor growth compared with the other groups. TGF- and IL-4 secretion was increased in all mice, whereas the secretion of INF- and IL-10 was decreased in breast tissues. Moreover, at the histopathological level, the volume of viable tumor in the control group was higher than in the treated groups. Conclusion Supplementary treatment with S. cerevisiae resulted in the best outcome in the breast cancer model compared with other treated and vaccinated groups.", "sitename": "AIMS Microbiology", "date": "2021-12-13", "cleaned_text": "| [1] || Machaalani M, El Masri J, Ayoubi E Lm, et al.
