These symptoms can greatly affect a person's quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks. Luckily, the majority of vestibular disorders can be helped through vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Banner Health's vestibular disorder treatment and rehabilitation program can offer patients relief from these debilitating symptoms. Our team of highly skilled physical therapists uses the latest techniques to help patients increase strength, balance, and stability to reduce the symptoms and effects of a vestibular disorder. Vestibular disorders affect the vestibular system, which includes parts of the inner ear and brain that help control your balance and eye movements. Vestibular disorders can be because of age, disease or injury. The most common signs and symptoms of vestibular disorders include vertigo, dizziness, visual disturbance, hearing changes and cognitive or psychological changes. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy can help control symptoms, increase function and improve quality of life for patients experiencing vestibular disorders. The goal of vestibular disorder rehab and treatment is to restore normal function to the vestibular system, minimize dizziness, improve balance and prevent injury. If you have symptoms consistent with a vestibular disorder, you should talk to your doctor. If diagnosed with dizziness, imbalance, vertigo or other conditions, your doctor may recommend vestibular rehabilitation. Symptoms vestibular rehabilitation can help include: A vestibular rehab program helps patients by teaching the brain how to compensate using other senses when the vestibular system is deficient. The goal of therapy is to enhance stability, reduce vertigo and help patients safely manage activities of daily living. Through an exercise-based treatment program, help patients learn to control symptoms, reduce functional disabilities and improve quality of life. Approximately 90 percent of patients show improvement from vestibular rehabilitation. Following an initial discussion of your symptoms and review your medical history, a Banner Physical Therapy physical therapist will assess your balance, strength, flexibility, walk, vision and mobility and develop your individualized treatment plan based on your overall goals. Your treatment plan includes exercises to strengthen posture, gait and balance, including the eyes, ears and legs. In addition to in-office sessions, Banner Health will design an at-home exercise plan to further aid your progress. These exercises help retrain the brain to recognize and process signals from the vestibular system, reducing the effect movements have and strengthening muscles.
