Although it's possible to just randomly take a few of the recommended supplements here and there and you probably will see positive results from that, for the greatest chance of success (or complete healing), you really do need to implement the complete healing program. Holistic healing does not work like drug therapy; to heal eectively you need to heal all the varied aspects of your self. /T_he implementation tools on the CD help you to organize your unique treatment protocol (because we're all dierent), to action it step-by-step, and to evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed. /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 MY HEALING JOURNEY It is my hope that the contents of this program can be for you, as they were for me, the pathway to autonomy and peace. I initially began work on Listen To Your Gut at the suggestion of various healthcare professionals (medical doctors, massage therapists, physiotherapists, etc.) who compared me to all of their other clients diagnosed with Crohn's Disease or ulcerative colitis and couldn't believe how healthy I was. I kept hearing again and again, 'You should write a book about your methods'. During my initial diagnosis in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle, the exploratory tests revealed a fairly severe or widespread case of Crohn's with ulceration present throughout the small and large intestine. Coming from a family of physicians and pharmacists, I had complete faith in the sophistication and ecacy of medical science. At the time of my diagnosis, I knew absolutely nothing about alternative medicine. I merely assumed it was a substandard system of healthcare used by people in third world countries who were uneducated and did not have access to modern medicine, or couldn't aord it. /T_herefore, in complete faith, I did everything the medical establishment told me to do (and not do) for the /f_irst three years a/f_ter being diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. I /f_inally reached my breaking point when I was ingesting thirteen pills per day, terribly weakened from all the diagnostic and exploratory tests and basically had a life that consisted of thinking or dealing with pain and discomfort on a daily basis. Or I would engage in the /f_lip-side of that, which was desperately trying to ignore my physical body in the hope that it would all just go away. Practically everything I ate made me ill (intestinal bleeding, pain, cramping, etc.). By this point my doctors suspected I had Crohn's in my stomach as well, and were pretty much insisting I have surgery. A/f_ter three years, I /f_inally decided that living like this was no longer acceptable; there had to be something else I could do, something that would give me my life back. So I went to my gastroenterologist, who headed up a national research team on Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis, and I asked him for all the books and papers he had on the subject (this was before the Internet). He After three years, I /f_inally decided that living like this was no longer acceptable; there had to be something else I could do, something that would give me my life back. /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle\u0003Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT loaded me up with a stack of textbooks and some of his latest research and I took it home and read everything. /T_hat's when I realized that the medical profession had very limited information/knowledge about in/f_lammatory bowel disease. I didn't /f_ind anything that could even possibly help me, in my present condition, that I hadn't already tried. /T_hat realization, coupled with a horrible course of steroids (Prednisone) and the alarming statistics of recurrence rates following surgery, prompted my departure from the medical establishment. /T_he medical treatment protocols did not work for Notes: me and I knew I had to /f_ind something that did. I spent the next seven years researching and experimenting with alternative and indigenous healing therapies as I lived and worked in Japan, England, and Canada. I developed my own methods of dealing with each phase of symptoms. I learned to listen to my body and take responsibility for it. Constantly seeking new knowledge and techniques, I used myself as my guinea pig and conducted multiple, controlled trials to ascertain what worked and what didn't. However, I didn't want to write and sell a book about healing methods that worked for me, without /f_inding out /f_irst whether they worked for others as well. So, in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle I drew up a brief sixty-page booklet of my methods and circulated about /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle copies via friends, family and the Internet for the next three years. My main concern was that my diets, techniques, and methods would actually work and help people other than just myself. I wanted to know that the therapies and process that worked for me would also work for others. Based on the positive, arming feedback I received (along with emails from people exclaiming, 'please publish this!'), I then decided it was time to gather all my information together into a comprehensive book format. /T_hat book was the /f_irst edition of Listen To Your Gut , published in /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle. /T_his current program is the result of that initial research, plus subsequent feedback from thousands of readers and consultation clients, evolving scienti/f_ic research, improved nutritional information and improved healthcare products and protocols. /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 The Importance Of Emotional Healing In detailing my healing process and techniques, I soon realized that I had not one book, but two, and that to relay all the information together in a single volume would simply be too overwhelming for the reader. My healing process is based upon a mind/body/spirit paradigm; in order to heal, we must heal all aspects of the Self, not just the physical body. /T_herefore, I decided to have this program deal primarily with healing the physical body - although I do address the importance of emotional healing throughout the program as well. /T_here are many excellent books already on the market that \"Doctors now see intricate deal speci/f_ically with emotional/mental/spiritual healing (see Appendix A links between the nervous system for my suggestions) and I strongly encourage you to look at these aspects of and the digestive system. your healing simultaneously. Disease is not just a physical phenomenon. By The two realms constantly using the diets, therapies and protocols in this program in conjunction with exchange streams of chemical and increasing awareness of the emotional/mental contributors to your dis-ease, electrical messages, and anything you should experience fairly direct results in your physical body. You may \u0003 be able to reach the stage where you're o all drugs and managing the cycle that aects one is likely to aect \u0003 of your disease, along with /f_lare-ups, by yourself and without the other.\" (or rarely) having to resort to drugs and hospitalization. Chris Woolston, Medical Journalist The Brain-Gut Axis However, for full and complete healing to take place, I cannot emphasize enough that you must also address the emotional and psychological components of your dis-ease. Many people refer to the gut as 'the second brain' and indeed there is even a book by that title that details exactly how the gut biochemistry parallels and interacts closely with the brain. For example, /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the neurotransmitters in your body are not found in your brain, but in your gut! Medical journalist Chris Woolston presents this concept well in his article, Gut Feelings: /T_he Surprising Link Between Mood and Digestion . Here are some pertinent extracts from his article: \"If you've ever felt your insides twist in knots before a big speech, \u0003 you know the stomach listens carefully to the brain. In fact, the entire \u0003 digestive system is closely tuned to a person's emotions and state \u0003 of mind, says William E. Whitehead, PhD, a professor of medicine \u0003 /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle\u0003Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: and an adjunct professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina...Doctors now see intricate links between the nervous system and the digestive system. /T_he two realms constantly exchange streams of chemical and electrical messages, and anything that aects one is likely to aect the other. /T_he connections between the two systems are so tight that scientists o/f_ten refer to them as one entity: the brain-gut axis. (/T_he brain-gut axis is a hot topic in medicine. In the summer of /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle, more than /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle researchers from around the world gathered in Los Angeles for a convention called \"/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle: A Brain-Gut Odyssey.\")... It may surprise many people to learn that the gut actually contains as many neurons (nerve cells) as the spinal cord...With all these messages, the connection between the brain and the digestive system is a busy two-way street. /T_he central nervous system releases chemicals (acetylcholine and adrenaline) that tell the stomach when to produce acid, when to churn, and when to rest. Similar signals help guide the movements of the intestines. /T_he digestive system responds by sending electrical messages to the brain, creating such sensations as hunger, fullness, pain, nausea, discomfort, and possibly sadness and joy... /T_he in/f_luence of the mind on the gut goes beyond functional diseases. For instance, people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis - two conditions with clearly physical origins - o/f_ten suer /f_lareups during times of emotional stress. And in a recent survey, /six.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle percent of people with basically healthy digestive systems said stress gives them stomachaches.\" /one.superior In fact, the brain-gut axis (that Woolston refers to in this article) and the undeniable interplay between the mind/emotions and the gut have become so important that a new /f_ield of medicine has emerged to speci/f_ically study and research this interplay, called Neurogastroenterology. Before I have my /f_irst phone consultation with a client, I ask them to email me their history, if they wish. Most of the time, people send me just the physical information and data about their bodies. Occasionally, a client will mention that a /f_lare was likely triggered by the stress of a particular situation. But I have yet to have anyone write with full awareness of how /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 much and how crucially their mind and emotions aect their physical body. And no one has told me about any therapies or techniques they're implementing to eect healing of their emotional body. When I bring up this important aspect of healing during sessions, some clients get it right away and immediately begin implementing Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), or craniosacral therapy, or hypnotherapy - and they are the ones that get the quickest results in their healing path. Some clients have the belief that emotional healing is something they might look at a/f_ter their physical symptoms are resolved. And these clients o/f_ten have very frustrating Some clients have the healing journeys, where for long periods of time it doesn't seem like they're belief that emotional healing is making any progress at all, even though they're doing everything physically something they might look at possible to heal themselves. You 'll hear me say this o/f_ten throughout this after their physical symptoms program: Until you heal your emotional/spiritual body, you will not see are resolved. And these clients the desired results in your physical body, or even if you do, they will not often have very frustrating last long-term. You must heal all the roots of your illness - physical, mental, \u0003 emotional and spiritual - to eect long-term healing. healing journeys. Please try to understand this concept that emotional events, trauma or \u0003 feelings (past or present) produce clear, measurable results in the gut. \u0003 When you fully accept and 'get' this concept, your healing will move to \u0003 a whole new level. Dr Emeran Mayer at the UCLA School of Medicine \u0003 outlines some of these very real physical consequences of emotions and \u0003 stress in the digestive system in his article /T_he Neurobiology of Stress and \u0003 Emotions : \"...the emotion of fear is associated with inhibition of upper GI \u0003 (stomach and duodenum) contractions and secretions, and with \u0003 stimulation of lower (sigmoid colon and rectum) motility and \u0003 secretions. /T_he former may contribute to a sensation of fullness and \u0003 lack of appetite, the latter to diarrhea and lower abdominal pain. \u0003 Interestingly, when the emotion shi/f_ts to anger, the pattern of upper GI \u0003 activity is reversed, with stimulation of gastric contractions and acid \u0003 secretion...in humans living in modern societies we are increasingly \u0003 beginning to realize a phenomenon that has been referred to as \u0003 the wear and tear, or the allostatic load, of stress. /T_his detrimental \u0003 /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT eect of stress may manifest following a one time severe stressor (life threatening situation), following repeated smaller stressors, or following a major sustained stressor over a period of time...while acute stimulation of the immune system has a bene/f_icial eect, chronic stress can be associated with suppression of cellular immunity, and detrimental eects on health. /two.superior We were on holiday in Mexico one year with my parents and my Dad was in a grouchy mood one evening. /T_hen he had some wine with dinner (alcohol makes him more aggressive) and at some point vented some of his bad energy on my two year old son by shouting at him. I didn't think much of it as it was a very mild expression compared to what I'd grown up with. But when we were back in our room my son told me that, \"Grandad made my tummy feel bad.\" I was stunned and enlightened at the same time. At that point, I hadn't talked to my son about mind/body connections or feeling via the gut, or anything of that nature. But there it was, the plain truth, in his own words. He was able to recognize immediately the emotional eect of that hurtful experience in his gut. And what would years and years of living with someone who 'makes your tummy feel bad' do to your digestive health? If you want to achieve full healing, you'll also need to look at, connect with, and heal the emotional woundings, fear, anger, etc. that have lodged themselves in your gut. I once had a series of sessions with an advanced rol/f_ing practitioner (a type of bodywork therapy), named Jerey Maitland, who lives in Scottsdale, Arizona. Jerey treats professional athletes, dancers, and NBA stars like Charles Barkley, and he is also a Buddhist monk who holds a doctorate in Philosophy. He explained a bit of his view on the mind/body interplay (based on twenty years of treating people's bodies): \"All thought/emotion originates in the gut and travels upward through the torso and then through the neck for expression through the mouth. People tend to experience problems in their body dependent on where their blocks or wounds are along this pathway.\" If you take the time or utilize a therapy that allows you to connect with your gut, I guarantee you'll /f_ind past traumas or woundings that are still held in your gut. /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle\u0003 CURED VS. HEALED in your gut. TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 You will have the best results from this program if you simultaneously pursue emotional/mental healing along with physical healing. Talk therapy (most forms of counseling and psychoanalysis) are of limited use and not very eective. You need to pursue forms of healing that integrate your mind and body. You need to release the trauma or wounding from the cells and tissues of your body, as well as your mind. /T_herefore, the types of healing therapies that I've found work best are: Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), hypnotherapy, spiritual or energy healing, craniosacral therapy and acupuncture/acupressure that is combined with emotional release If you want to achieve full (the craniosacral therapist and acupuncturist needs additional, special healing, you'll also need to look training in somato-emotional release). /T_hese therapies will be explained in at, connect with, and heal the detail in Chapter Six. emotional woundings, fear, anger, etc. that have lodged themselves In developing and following the methods and therapies outlined in this program, I have improved my own health to the point where I have been drug and surgery-free for over /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle years. For the most part (although I have my down spells too, which I'll talk about in other chapters), I live a full and active life; I have two children, own my own business, travel every month or two, exercise regularly, etc. As far as I'm concerned, I no longer have Crohn's Disease. However, I eat mostly organic, unprocessed food, live in a toxin-free home, take supplements when needed, utilize EFT when needed, and attend an advanced yoga class where we work with the prana (lifeforce energy) for two hours a week. My digestive system is the most sensitive part of my body and I will always take special care of it. I still experience intestinal disturbances from time to time and still use some of the therapies in this program when required. But, the spectre of \"disease\" and all its accoutrements (drugs, surgery, hospital visits, exploratory tests, etc.) is no longer a part of my life. Actively seeking better health by hiring a part-time housekeeper, visiting my naturopathic doctor, being careful to eat mostly unprocessed, organic food and seeking ongoing emotional healing is still very much a part of my life. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson No matter how bad my condition has been over the years I have never resorted to drugs or surgery, but have always healed myself using the natural methods in this program. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT People ask me, 'are you cured?' /T_he word 'cure' to me means that your body is so healthy that you never even have to think about your body again, let alone treat it specially or support it with healing herbs and treatments. If I were to say I was 'cured' then I would be able to eat processed, crap food, drink copious amounts of alcohol and stay up all night for a week - and feel no ill eects. So, I don't use the word 'cured', I prefer the word 'healed'. I can go out and eat a hamburger and fries whenever I want to and feel no ill eects. But, if I ate fast food for a week non-stop I'd feel pretty bad! I can also travel anywhere in the world (except India) and eat the local food with no trouble. But, by the end of two weeks, I'll be feeling the need for better quality food. Actually, the United States is one of the most dicult countries to travel in, since the average restaurant uses a lot of chemical, arti/f_icial and processed foods in its cooking. Whereas the average restaurant in /T_hailand, for example, uses fresh vegetables, seafood, noodles and the only irritants are the hydrogenated oil used for frying and sometimes some MSG in the sauces. I once spent three weeks in /T_hailand and felt great. Taking special care of my digestive and immune system will always be a part of my life. I don't have the tolerance levels for toxins that other people have. I can't be stressed or sleep-deprived for months without the eects showing up in my body in the form of colonic or rectal bleeding or low hemoglobin, or /f_latulence, etc. However, I can heal all those things, very quickly, by addressing the corresponding emotional/lifestyle issue and then following the applicable healing therapies in this program. No matter how bad my condition has been over the years I have never resorted to drugs or surgery, but have always healed myself using the natural methods in this program. I wish for each of you this same freedom and control over your life, body and health. Instead of viewing your health and healing as an end-point, it will help you immeasurably to view it as a journey. You will be much happier along this holistic healing path if you can view it as a process and celebrate each improvement along the journey - rather than anxiously rushing, pushing and waiting for your body to be cured/healed so you can get back to your /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 'regular' life. Instead of looking at how far you still have to go, if you can focus on how far you've come and all the improvements you have made, you will have a lot more peace and happiness along your Healing Journey. Holistic healing is a long, winding path and there are no quick-/f_ixes or silver bullets here (like in drug therapy). /T_he initial phase of your healing may take the longest and produce the least 'visible' results because you have to build your foundation /f_irst. You have to start at the roots of your dis-ease and just like building a house, laying You will be much happier the groundwork and pouring the foundation don't look like much, but they along this holistic healing path if are of crucial importance. For example, let's say you have a mycobacterial you can view it as a process and (fungal-bacterial hybrid microorganism) infection as one of your 'causative roots'. Treating and resolving such an infection can take anywhere from celebrate each improvement along six months to two years (see Chapter Two), but once you get that infection the journey - rather than anxiously under control, you'll see improvement. And by the time you completely rushing, pushing and waiting eradicate that infection, you'll probably have automatically eliminated your for your body to be cured/healed diarrhea and colonic bleeding. You will also have restored the integrity of so you can get back to your your intestinal walls, mucosal lining, and bacterial /f_lora throughout your 'regular' life. gut. /T_herefore, your digestive and absorptive abilities will now be up to normal. Because you have treated your whole body holistically, you will most likely have cleared up other health issues as well. And by healing your past and present emotional woundings, you will now be creating a job and relationships that support you as a healthy, vibrant person - not as a sick, wounded person. Initially, it may seem very scary to you to be completely in charge of your own health and to have all the tools and responsibility to heal yourself, no matter what arises. Some people /f_ind it easiest to quit the drugs and surgery cold turkey (although strong drugs must always be weaned o gradually) and completely remove it as a treatment option, while others /f_ind it easier to go o and on their drugs while incorporating more and more natural healing methods. /T_he /f_irst way is de/f_initely a much quicker way of healing, but it has to suit your personality. Remember that stress is a huge component of these dis-eases and anything that causes you stress is not /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson I hope this program will stimulate your own thought process and encourage you to open up to unconventional possibilities and ideas, to pursue the many layers of truth and the many facets of reality, rather than latching onto the /f_lat, easy, one-dimensional answer. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT going to help you heal. /T_herefore, /f_irst and foremost, you must always follow your own gut and introduce change at a pace that feels right for you. ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF IBD AND IBS Many people spend a lot of time and energy searching and hoping for the etiology (cause) of in/f_lammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to be revealed. I suppose that most people believe that if we knew what caused IBD or IBS, we would know how to cure it. /T_his is because we are still looking to ful/f_ill the equation of one pathogen (disease-causing agent) equals one disease, which can be cured with one drug. /T_his is the mindset bestowed on us by the commercial medical and pharmaceutical industries that we have accepted easily (even though the scientist knows the truth to be far more complex). However, ascribing to this model leaves many questions unanswered. For example, autopsies reveal that most people have an average of /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle viruses in their brain. So why is it that most of us experience no abnormal symptoms or diseases as a result of these viruses? In addition, let's say for example, that it is discovered that Virus X causes ulcerative colitis. Okay /f_ine, but that still doesn't explain why you contracted that virus and your twin sister didn't - similar genetic makeup, similar environment, why the dierence in susceptibility? If you look at some of the most contagious diseases on our planet, there are always some people who, although exposed, do not contract these diseases. Even when they're living and working in the midst of an entire community of people manifesting a particular illness, some people will not contract that illness. Why not? /T_he current medical/pharmaceutical model of illness cannot answer any of these questions. Perhaps this is because their construct of disease is /f_lawed. Personally, I think the popular medical model is far too simplistic to adequately portray and understand all the factors involved in the disease/healing/balancing process. I hope this program will stimulate your own thought process and encourage you to open up to unconventional possibilities and ideas, to pursue the many layers of truth and the many /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle\u0003TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 facets of reality, rather than latching onto the /f_lat, easy, one-dimensional answer. Our bodies are not machines, where one plus one equals two. We are complex, many-layered entities capable of containing any number of apparent contradictions simultaneously. We can be both hot to the touch on the outside with sweat pouring o our skin, whilst being freezing cold on the inside - so cold our bones ache and it hurts to breathe. We can feel a well of deep love and attachment to a dysfunctional parent whilst This is your Healing Journey simultaneously hating them for what they have done to us. A father loses and no one else can walk it for you. his child and his hair turns completely white overnight. A mother li/f_ts a truck single-handedly to save her child trapped beneath it. How are these things possible? As you begin to open to the expansiveness of humanity, you begin to understand. You also begin to glimpse the possibilities that are present within yourself. What does all this have to do with healing your dis-ease? Quite simply, it opens you to the possibility of delving into and collaborating with your body. Merging with all aspects of your body/self and treading the pathway of healing together - as a multi-dimensional but uni/f_ied being, with all parts relating to and supporting each other. It releases you from viewing and treating your body or your intestines as something functioning independently of you and your desires. Subscribing to the medical model will cause you to view the malfunctioning parts of your body with impatience and annoyance, even anger. If you see your body in this manner, you'll just want to feed it the right pill and have it perform properly, damnit! But your body is not a machine, you can't separate the parts from the whole. And what place has healing in the midst of anger and resentment? Opening yourself up to the possibilities of humanity and your unique reality will also create a space for you to integrate the dierent levels of yourself and begin taking some responsibility for your present state. Taking responsibility for the state of your body and your health may be as simple as saying, \"Okay, well, since I got this particular disease and not some other, /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT There is seldom just one factor (pathogen) in isolation that causes IBS or IBD. there must be a reason for that. I'm going to start looking at the lesson(s) here for me.\" If there was no point in your developing IBS or IBD, no lessons for you to learn, no journey for you to take, then why did you develop this illness? A scientist identifying Virus X as the pathogen (agent of disease) is not going to answer this question. If all the members of your family, or your class, or your community were exposed to the same environment, then why did you contract IBS or IBD when they didn't? Looking for the missing pathogen is not going to give you the answer. Only you can answer these questions. Only you can unite and integrate all the levels of yourself to identify all the contributing and in/f_luencing factors in your particular pathogenesis. /T_his is your Healing Journey and no one else can walk it for you. My Opinion On IBS/IBD Etiology I have had many readers ask me, 'what do you think caused my colitis/ Crohn's/IBS etc.?' Well, I see each of these conditions as points along a continuum, from mild to severe. With IBS at the far le/f_t side and Crohn's at the far right. So it would look like this: Medical doctors maintain that each of these diseases are separate and distinct from each other. But I've heard from far too many people whose IBS has turned into colitis, or whose diagnosis of colitis has metamorphosed into Crohn's. When this happens, doctors tend to say 'oh, well you were misdiagnosed in the /f_irst place'. In my opinion each point along this continuum - with it's accompanying symptom pro/f_ile - is merely an indication of how much your health has been compromised to date and which areas of your body need healing. As you progress along the continuum (from le/f_t to right), the symptoms indicate that the damage is not just localized but increasingly more systemic. /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 I believe the causative factors of these conditions are varied. If you go back over your own personal health history, I think you'll /f_ind a mix of the following damaging events, that singly or in combination have degraded the health of your gut and immune system: Vaccination - childhood, adult, flu vaccines, etc. Causes direct damage to bacterial flora of the gut and long-term, immune system damage. See Chapter Four for more details. Each of us is capable of spectrum probiotic therapy causes lasting, pervasive damage to the identifying our own particular bacterial flora of your gastrointestinal tract (from mouth to anus), which Antibiotic Use - any antibiotic therapy that is not followed by full- pathology, or the causative in turn leads to increased infestation of yeast, parasites, viruses, bad factors of our own ill health and bacteria and other pathogens. These pathogens degrade the mucosal then taking the steps that will be lining and damage the intestinal wall (symptoms include bloating, gas, particularly healing to each of us. inflammation, bleeding, etc.) which leads to Leaky Gut Syndrome, \u0003 which then triggers allergic and auto-immune response. Certain \u0003 antibiotic drugs can cause ulcerative colitis all by themselves (like Novo \u0003 Clindamycin), and the pharmaceutical information that comes with \u0003 these products even explicitly warns of this. Yet medical doctors continue \u0003 to prescribe them and also don't follow usage with probiotics. Environmental and Food-borne Toxins - processed foods with preservatives, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG), artificial sweeteners and flavors, proven toxins and carcinogens, microwaved foods, toxins contained in skin care products, shampoos, cosmetics, furniture, carpets, and the air (to name a few sources) all cause cellular and systemic damage. Lots more on this in Chapter Four. Emotional Trauma or Abuse - don't underestimate the damaging effects of abusive or traumatic emotional experiences on the body, and the gut in particular. For some of you, this may be damage from your past that was never resolved/healed, and/or ongoing emotional patterns or experiences that continue to degrade your health daily. /two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: Parasites & Pathogenic Microorganisms - if your gut ecology is already weakened or imbalanced, travel to a foreign country or ingestion of tainted food/water can be the 'straw that breaks the camel's back'. If your bacterial flora is already imbalanced with a deficit of beneficial bacteria, then it's very easy for parasites, yeast, molds, bad bacteria, or fungus to flourish. These pathogens then degrade the health of your intestinal mucosal lining, which can result in ulceration, inflammation, bleeding and subsequent damage to your systemic health. Each of these causative factors - including lesser factors like whether or not you were breastfed, your mother's health while you were in utero, hereditary/genetic weaknesses, heavy metal levels in your body, mercury amalgam /f_illings in your teeth, pesticide exposure, etc. - will contribute in varying degrees and combinations to your particular pathology. Dierent people are susceptible to dierent factors and something that strongly aects your friend adversely, may only mildly aect you adversely. /T_here is seldom just one factor (pathogen) in isolation that causes IBS or IBD. However, I believe each of us is capable of identifying our own particular pathology, or the causative factors of our own ill health and then taking the steps that will be particularly healing to each of us. /T_his program is designed to assist you in identifying the physical contribu - tors to your dis-ease (or unease) and to provide you with some tools and ideas to correct and balance your physical environment. /T_here are many books available to help you identify the mental, emotional and spiritual elements of your dis-ease and I've listed a few really good ones in the Recommended Reading list (Appendix A) at the back of this book. Maybe you've become very wrapped up in searching for the cause of your illness, thinking that if science could only identify the pathogen, you could then take a drug that would cure you. If this has been causing you stress, for the sake of your own healing, I encourage you to put aside the quest for the etiology of these diseases. Don't worry about it, don't let it frustrate you, don't devote any more time and energy to it. Turn your focus instead to healing yourself, getting in touch with your body and allowing it to heal itself no matter what the cause. /T_he great thing about this program is that /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 the process and therapies will work irrespective of the cause of IBS and IBD. In fact, since all treatment is based on easily identi/f_ied symptoms, you don't even need an ocial medical diagnosis to use and bene/f_it from the healing tools provided in this program. All you need is the willingness to connect with your own body and to open yourself to your own wisdom and intuition. HOW DO YOU SEE YOURSELF? Please be aware that you also have a choice as to which label or diagnosis you accept for yourself and your condition. How do you de/f_ine yourself and your health? Do you see your intestinal malfunction as you simply experiencing intestinal problems, or do you see your intestines as diseased, do you see or de/f_ine yourself as a diseased person? /T_hen think of the implications your mindset has on your healing process. Does your de/f_inition or label of yourself and your condition place you in a position of positivity, does it foster a healing environment for your mind/body? Or does it carry an inherent negativity and place you in a defeatist disease environment? Most of us have accepted the label given to us by the medical community, that of irritable bowel syndrome, or ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's Disease or some other variation. If these labels were used simply as a classi/f_ication system, as a symbol representing a collection of symptoms, that would be /f_ine and it would be truthful. But there is an insidious aspect to these labels or diagnoses; each one of them also comes with the quali/f_ier of \"chronic\" or \"incurable\". /T_his is ridiculous, because it means that no matter how healthy I am, or how long I've been healthy for, doctors will still say to me, \"Oh no, you still have Crohn's Disease, you're simply in remission.\" I ask you, does any part of this approach or mentality help you? Does any part of this labeling process, this insistence that you are permanently diseased, lead you to positivity? Does it encourage health and a healing environment? Or does it promote despair, negativity and an ongoing disease-environment for your mind and body? I have always felt Does your de/f_inition or label of yourself place you in a position of positivity, does it foster a healing environment for your mind/body? Or does it carry an inherent negativity, and place you in a defeatist disease environment? /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: that words are very powerful. By accepting the medical profession's label of you as being a permanently diseased person, you are also accepting all the negativity and limiting parameters inherent in a profession that has tended to focus on the disease-process as opposed to the healing process. In Dr. Andrew Weil's book, Spontaneous Healing , he relates a story told by a patient of his with HIV who experienced a similar frustration with medical diagnostics and doctors trying to de/f_ine his reality for him: \"/T_he medical professionals gave me six to eighteen months to live when I was /f_irst diagnosed,' Mark told me when I met him. 'Since /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/five.oldstyle I can't tell you how many doctors have shown me the Curve - that is, the graph showing the percentage of people per year who develop AIDS a/f_ter infection. /T_hey all try to tell me I'm somewhere along it, headed for destruction. /T_his is really Western medicine's fascination with illness. Here I am with normal T cells, in great health, and they have the audacity to tell me I'm on this curve heading for death. When I see doctors now, I tell them right at the start: Look, I don't even want to hear about your curve. Just check me out, answer my questions, and keep your opinions to yourself! /T_hey have also all tried to get me to take AZT [the antiviral drug that is conventional medicine's current treatment of choice for HIV], but all of the people I've known who have used it are dead, so I've refused. And none of them have been interested to hear what I'm doing to stay healthy. /T_hey pat me on the head and say, \"Whatever you're doing, just keep it up!\" I have developed an ability not to buy into the medical system...\" /three.superior New Label - New Framework My hope for each one of you following this program, is that you get to the point in your healing process where you don't feel you need to accept these medical labels anymore (and maybe you're already there!) and you throw them away. What a wonderful, liberating move to a healing environment for your mind/body/spirit that will be. Keep in mind that this does not involve denying your existing state and physical health, or deluding yourself with positive talk or thinking. It involves full recognition of your existing /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 physical symptoms, but within a framework of healing and positivity. It's the dierence between saying, \"I'm suering from an incurable disease\" and \"I'm having some gastrointestinal problems\". Or how about a Chinese Medicine diagnosis: \"I have excess wind and /f_ire in my bowels\"? Sure you can use the medical label for your condition when dealing with health professionals or people who want the quick answer to, \"What's the problem?\" But for dealing with and relating to yourself, you may want to use dierent terminology. When I use the medical labels of Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, IBS and diverticulitis throughout this program, I am Keep in mind that this does using them in reference to a previously de/f_ined set of symptoms. However, not involve denying your existing please keep in mind how I really view and treat intestinal malfunctions and state and physical health, or that I do not label any bodily imbalance as \"incurable\". deluding yourself with positive You can label and de/f_ine your own reality using words of positivity within talk or thinking. It involves full a healing framework that gives you access to positive action. Instead of recognition of your existing talking about your disease, you can talk about your healing pathway or physical symptoms, but within your healing journey. /T_his will also help you to start viewing your body as a framework of healing and a whole, instead of as separate compartments where the parts and systems positivity. of your body function separately and independently. Your digestive tract is not the isolated \"bad\" part of your body, it is merely the area where your whole-body imbalance is evidenced, or displayed /f_irst. I was once talking to Karen Stewart, the owner of NutritionWorks health store in Scottsdale, Arizona, and she said, \"All illness is simply an opportunity for growth. It's the body pointing out what you need to work on next. And the body uses the strongest parts of itself to deliver the message.\" I stared at her, fascinated, as the realization of what she was saying gradually grew in me. \"Well think about it,\" she said, \"the body wouldn't use its weakest part to give you the message, it wouldn't risk its life like that, it's going to use the strongest part.\" I found her words very empowering. Instead of viewing your gut as the weak part of your body, where illness shows up /f_irst, you can view it as the strongest part of your body, willing to sacri/f_ice itself for your growth and understanding. Regarding your gastrointestinal tract in this manner will also foster a spirit of teamwork within you and gratitude towards your /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle\u0003Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT gut for oering itself up for your growth and development. In her fantastic book, Mutant Message Down Under , Marlo Morgan relates that: \"/T_he Real People tribe believes that we are not random victims of ill health, that the physical body is the only means our higher level of eternal consciousness has to communicate with our personality consciousness. Slowing down the body allows us to look around and analyze the really important wounds we need to mend: wounded relationships, gaping holes in our belief system, walled-up tumors of Notes: fear, eroding faith in our Creator, hardened emotions of unforgiveness, and so on.\" When I /f_irst began healing myself, I found my healing required equal attention and resolution of both physical and emotional/spiritual/mental issues. However, I'm now at the point in my Healing Journey where symptoms I experience are rarely related to my physical body at all, but rather they are just messages, or indicators of something I need to resolve emotionally or spiritually. As soon as I address the emotional component - for example, resolve a con/f_lict, forgive someone, connect with and share my deepest feelings with a loved one, speak my truth, say 'no' where I need to, etc. - the physical symptom instantly disappears, with no physical intervention necessary. I've also noticed that my body will /f_irst give me a feeling, or intuition. If I explore that and connect with my deeper self (or higher/spiritual self), and take appropriate action, the issue is resolved there. However, if I don't, my body will then give me a mild symptom. If I ignore this, a stronger symptom, or escalation of that same symptom will occur, and so on with increasing rami/f_ications in my physical body until I /f_inally stop, connect with my body and my higher self (or subconscious) and receive the message or follow the pathway of emotional/spiritual healing that needs to take place. As soon as I do this, the symptom begins to heal/ resolve and in many cases disappears instantly - unless I've allowed things to escalate to the point where physical healing is also necessary. /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 Give Your Body Time & Space To Heal I once had a series of consultations with a reader who was following the exclusively elemental diet and supplementation plan outlined in my second book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet , but he was /f_inding progress depressingly slow with lots of ups and downs and he was becoming quite discouraged. I was really mysti/f_ied as to why he was seeing so little improvement until about the third session when he said, \"I'm /f_inding it very hard to concentrate at work...\" At work?? It never even occurred to me that he would be working full-time whilst suering from malnutrition and colonic We really need to put aside the bleeding!

In addition, it then came That of using drugs to suppress out that his family was paying for him to be on the IBD Remission Diet so symptoms so we can go about our that he would be perfectly strong and healthy for his wedding in about two business as usual. months time. Since he was of a certain ethnicity, he had only met his bride once, the wedding would last for three days solid, and there were /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle people invited. Talk about pressure! A normal, healthy person would probably get ill under that kind of stress. How could he possibly expect his body to heal under that tremendous workload, emotional stress and pressure? We really need to put aside the western concept of 'healthcare': /T_hat of using drugs to suppress symptoms so we can go about our business as usual. If your body is ill, it is crying out for you to pay attention, slow down and listen to it, and give it the time and space to heal. Another reader said to me, \"I can't take any time o, I can't aord it.\" Nonsense! If you were in the hospital you wouldn't be going to work, would you? /T_he longer you let things escalate, the longer it will take you to heal. Natural healing cannot take place without giving your body adequate rest. True, root-level healing requires a lot of energy. If you use up your available energy by going to work or looking a/f_ter your kids and household full-time, or being completely stressed out, how will your body get the energy it needs to heal itself? Try to remember that your physical body (although responding to physical factors) is also being directed by your higher/spiritual self - which is not trying to punish you or make your life hard, it is simply trying to communicate a very important message to you and really has only your best interest at /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT heart. /T_he sooner you slow down, take some time out, connect with your higher/subconscious self (see Chapters Six and Seven for details on how to do this), and resolve your emotional distress, the sooner your physical body will begin to heal. THE HOLISTIC HEALING JOURNEY As you tread this path of holistic healing, keep in mind that healing of any Notes: sort is rarely a linear, progressive process. Usually it occurs in cycles or spirals, but it's important to keep in mind that the spirals do spiral upward, so there is continuous improvement overall. Alternatively, you could view the healing process as one where you're doing well, moving in a straight line upwards, then you have a rough spot (o/f_ten referred to as a healing crisis), so the line dips down for a bit, but then the line climbs upwards again as your healing continues. Symptoms experienced during a healing crisis can include skin eruptions, nausea, headache, sleepiness, unusual fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, head or chest cold, ear infections, boils, or any other method the body uses to loosen and eliminate toxins. A healing crisis will usually last around three to seven days - and occasionally longer if you're very run down and weakened. /T_here are numerous dierent theories as to why the body doesn't just heal in a straight, uninterrupted manner. Personally, I think it's because the body heals in layers, starting with the easiest imbalances and then moving progressively deeper into the more dicult, serious imbalances or malfunctions. As well, part of the healing and balancing process involves the periodic release of toxins, which may make you feel sicker and temporarily worsen your symptoms. As unpleasant and scary as this may be, toxin release and elimination is still an integral part of the healing process. When this happens, even though it feels like you're getting sicker, you've got to try to remember that it's actually part of you getting better. At times like this, you can get really scared and it's very tempting to feel that the natural healing methods just aren't working for you and to get back on your drugs again. But whilst the drugs will suppress the symptoms (in the /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle\u0003TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 short term) and relieve your immediate fear and worry, they will continue to damage your body and degrade your health overall. Drugs do not heal. /T_hey merely suppress symptoms whilst damaging the body further. True, root-level healing (healing the cause, not just masking symptoms) is a winding pathway with ups and downs along the way, but always improving overall. I know this is a very confusing process. Discerning between whether you just need to give your body time, or whether the treatment you're pursuing isn't working for you, is a very dicult decision to make. Keep in mind that healing Unfortunately, there's no simple formula I can give you in these instances, of any sort is rarely a linear, since everyone's body is unique and there are so many factors involved in progressive process. Usually it the healing process. You're just going to have to really tune in to your body and your intuition during these times (see Dialoguing With Your Body in occurs in cycles or spirals, but it's Chapter Six) and trust your body and higher/spiritual self to lead you step important to keep in mind that the by step along your healing pathway. I cannot emphasize enough how much spirals do spiral upward, so there is it helps to have a support network of family, or friends, or like-minded continuous improvement overall. healthcare practitioners around you at these times. When you get really scared or frustrated, nothing is as valuable as someone who can pray with you, or give you a bodywork treatment that helps you connect with yourself and your strength, or just be there to listen, or hold you while you cry or vent. Having a caring support network will greatly increase your chances of success with natural healing. I think there's also another more nebulous phenomenon at work in the healing process, and the best way I can describe it is to give you an analogy. Let's look at a middle-aged man (for example) who's got a good career, a nice house, a wife and kids. /T_his man appears to be leading a pretty good life. What the outsider can't know is that this man was sexually abused as a child, but he's never discussed it with anyone or dealt with the memories. He was bullied terribly at school and had few friends in college. All his life, he's held himself tightly wrapped and under control and so appears fairly stable and 'together'. However, severe interpersonal problems with his wife lead this man into counseling. It's only when he begins to acknowledge his trauma, when he /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT begins the process of healing his wounds, that the tight, rigid bonds that have held him together begin to unravel. All of a sudden, this apparently healthy, successful man can't sleep at night and begins to perform poorly at his job. He doesn't get his yearly bonus so he and his wife have to sell one of their cars. You see, this man seems to be degenerating, he seems to be falling apart and getting worse, but what is really going on is that he is healing himself. He is actually getting better. For the /f_irst time in his life he is actually dealing with and healing all the deep-seated, tightly controlled Notes: wounds he's been carrying around. I believe a similar process occurs when we start to access and heal the deeper layers of our physical body. Regardless of the depth and severity of your dis-ease, the balancing homeostatic mechanism will have caused your body to hold on tightly for as long as possible, to assume some form of control or pseudo-balance in order to keep your body functioning. Although there may be very serious long-term imbalances present in your system, they may not be apparent initially. However, as you start to heal your body and nurture and support it in its natural healing process, your body will gradually release its hold over these imbalances and oers them up for healing. When your body unmasks a long-term, systemic imbalance, you can become very ill quite suddenly. It may appear that your condition is suddenly and drastically worsening, and you may panic thinking the holistic healing methods aren't working at all. I know it's hard (especially the /f_irst time it happens) but try to remember that it's probably only temporary and your body needs your support and positivity the most at this time. I really encourage you to try not to panic when this happens. It helps to have someone close to you who can act as your sounding board, to help you stay rational and determine whether you actually do need additional help, or whether you just need to give it a few more days to settle down again. It's helpful if you can /f_ind a very skilled and empathetic naturopathic doctor to help you assess whether you're in danger, or whether you're just going through a healing crisis. Someone who can pray with you or oer some kind of spiritual healing is also invaluable at this time and will really help you to get through the fear that may overwhelm you, without resorting /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 to drugs (which will only set your healing back). As you implement more and more of the therapies and diets in this program, you'll come to have a lot more con/f_idence in the methods listed and in your own healing ability. But again, only do or don't do what you feel is right and safe for you. Don't give your power and authority over your own body away to anyone, especially not to me or the guidelines in this program! CHILDREN WITH IBD OR IBS As the parent of a child with IBD or IBS, you're going to have to walk a /f_ine line between ministering to your sick child, and not letting their dis-ease take over your family or obliterate your other children's needs. Please try to spend quality time with your other children and remember that just because they're physically healthy, it doesn't mean they don't have needs that are just as crucial to their mental, emotional and spiritual health. Devoting all your time and energy to your sick child doesn't serve them or their siblings (or your spouse/partner) in the long run. Strive to maintain a balance of inter - action and attention within your family and it will only impact positively on your child with IBS/IBD. Dr. John Harrison, MD, who wrote one of my favorite books, Love Your Disease - It's Keeping You Healthy , has a wonder - ful approach to maintaining a healthy family dynamic: \"Children respond very quickly to a change in the reward system and are very aware of its rami/f_ications, as demonstrated by the /f_ive-year - old client of mine overheard by his parents as he pointed out to his three-year-old sister: 'If you want Mummy to look a/f_ter you, just get sick, that's what I do.' When children come into my oce and one member of the family is ill, I am careful to pay equal attention to the healthy. Since some of them like coming to see me, I arrange times for them to visit when they are well. /T_hey begin replacing illness with wellness.\" /T_here are entire books written on the family dynamics surrounding and o/f_ten supporting illness, but for now, the main factor to be aware of is to spend quality time with and give attention to your healthy children as Remember that children are mirrors and our greatest teachers. If your child is ill, also look to yourself and your own actions. What message, or gift of teaching is your child trying to give you? What do you need to change or heal within yourself? /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Help your child to feel that he/she is in control, that she has options, that he has the strength to make decisions and reclaim his body. well. Your ill child can also be a caring, contributing member of the family too. Look for and point out ways (no matter how small) that they can demonstrate caring and concern for other family members. /T_his will help your child to feel like a more equal, capable member of the family, whilst balancing the family dynamic. Also, waiting on your sick child night and day and catering to their victim status is not going to help them be well. It's just going to help them be weaker. Try to come up with words and actions that make your child feel strong. Give them as much autonomy and decision-making responsibility as you can. Help your child to feel that he/she is in control, that she has options, that he has the strength to make decisions and reclaim his body. A child that's been subjected to the damaging, invasive, traumatic exploratory tests, drugs, or surgery involved with an IBD diagnosis is going to feel very violated and probably victimized and helpless. It's up to you to restore your child's feelings of control, safety, and empowerment with his/her body. I once read a letter in Mothering magazine (www.mothering.com) from a mother whose two year old son began having violent epileptic seizures along with various other symptoms. /T_hey gave their child, at the age of two, complete control over his health and healing. He made the decisions regarding which doctors he wanted to see (they took him to medical, naturopathic and homeopathic physicians) and also which drugs, herbs, or homeopathic remedies he wanted to take and when. /T_hey basically gave him complete and total control, trusting that he was able to connect with and know his body better than anyone. At the end of a year they discovered that he had some very rare but severe allergies and if they had made him take the prescription drugs (which would have suppressed the frightening seizures, but not addressed the root cause), he would have suered permanent brain damage as a result. It took a winding journey, or healing pathway, of a year to pinpoint the exact problem, but then the child was then completely healed and symptom free. I was awed by their story, and to this mother (and father) I give the utmost respect and admiration. So if you think your child is too young to make his/her own decisions about their health and body, keep this testimonial in mind. /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 Remember that children are mirrors and our greatest teachers. If your child is ill, also look to yourself and your own actions. What message, or gi/f_t of teaching is your child trying to give you? What do you need to change or heal within yourself? If your child is hyper and stressed, look to your own energy - are you stressed, or tense, or controlling, or worried, etc? How's your relationship with your spouse or partner? When my husband and I are in con/f_lict, our kids go nuts. As soon as we resolve the issue between us and restore an energy of peace and joy to the home, our children instantly, automatically, follow suit. Healing your child will also involve healing yourself in some manner. Pursuing a pathway of natural healing together will also involve lessons and gi/f_ts of wisdom for you as well as your child. Notes: PROGRAM RESOURCES /T_he contents of this program comprise the results of my personal research and experimentation into alternative, natural healing methods. /T_heir results and eectiveness have now been con/f_irmed by thousands of readers worldwide. But like any endeavour in life - whether it's a weight- loss program or an innovative business plan - people o/f_ten feel the need for additional support and resources along the way. /T_herefore, I've set up a website: www.ListenToYourGut.com with many useful resources and services available - be sure to check it out. I've also set up a blog (linked to from www.ListenToYourGut .com) where people speci/f_ically post their experience or results with certain experimental treatment protocols (you'll learn more about this in Chapter Two). So you can check here for ideas and feedback, and also to post your own experience so others can bene/f_it. Telephone Consultations A private telephone consultation can be helpful if you get stuck, or need some additional ideas, or the bene/f_it of my experience. I o/f_ten consult to people who have a good healthcare team in place, but they want to discuss their particular situation with me and also reap the bene/f_its of information /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT I can provide on other clients (all con/f_idential, of course) and what they did in a similar situation. Alternatively, I o/f_ten have clients who are in smaller towns who simply cannot /f_ind supportive healthcare professionals, so they use me as their support and feedback person. Information and booking for private phone consultations is available at: www.LTYGShoppe.com . THE LISTEN TO YOUR GUT CD Notes: Axed to the cover of this manual, you will /f_ind a computer disc containing all the companion workbook and implementation materials that are an integral part of the Listen To Your Gut program. /T_his manual gives you all the knowledge and information you need to heal yourself using natural methods, but the CD gives you all the tools to actually put that information into action and apply it to your life, body, and self. /T_hese tools are presented on a computer disc that you can insert into your computer and print out the various tools as o/f_ten and repeatedly as you need to. Following are descriptions of exactly what's on the CD: Healing Journey Workbook /T_he Healing Journey Workbook consists of a list of questions or activities to help you explore for yourself the contents of each chapter of Listen To Your Gut . /T_his Workbook is where you take the techniques and concepts presented as a result of my experience, and other readers' experience, and turn them into the techniques and concepts that will work for you, as a result of your experience, who you are, and where you're at in your life. In short, the Healing Journey Workbook is where you take all the information presented here and make it your own. /T_his is where you will organize and integrate all this new information, and map out a detailed, clear treatment program for your unique body. /T_he Workbook is perhaps the most important part of this program. Don't let this be just one more book that you read and say, \"Oh yeah, great ideas, I'm really excited, this sounds as if it will actually work!\" and then put the program aside and never do anything with it. /T_he knowledge and techniques in this program can only help you if you put them into practice. /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 Begin while the feeling and motivation is still fresh within you. You can do the Workbook sections in order as you read through Listen To Your Gut , chapter by chapter, or you can read the whole manual /f_irst and then go back and do the Workbook sections. If you read the entire manual /f_irst, you may want to re-read each chapter of Listen To Your Gut again right before beginning the corresponding Workbook section in order to stimulate your thoughts and feelings. /T_he Workbook is formatted so that you can print it out and write your The Healing Journey Workbook answers directly on the pages. I suggest you get a binder for your Healing is perhaps the most important part Journey Workbook , and if you need extra room to write certain answers, of this program. The knowledge then just insert a blank page where needed. Alternatively, if you prefer, you can get yourself a spiral-bound notebook, or an esthetically pleasing diary and techniques in this program notebook of some sort (something that feels special), and write down your can only help you if you put them Workbook answers, thoughts and ideas in your special notebook. into practice. You could title the notebook \"My Healing Journey\" (or something similar) and keep it for any future exercises or writings you might have. /T_he important thing is to actually write down your answers to the questions in the Healing Journey Workbook . Just answering them in your head will not result in the same enlightenment and integration as that of committing your thoughts to physical form. Also, you'll need to have your answers written down, as you'll be using them to compile your summary for Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan - outlined below. Yes, it will be dicult. Yes, you'll probably be tempted to put o actually doing it. Wading through the jungle of our Self is a dicult and time- consuming process. But if you want to restore yourself to wholeness, then you must take the time and you must discipline yourself to face your tangled jungle, one step at a time. Don't be discouraged, you don't need to sit down and go through every page at once. You could choose the easiest chapter for you to start with and simply begin there. Take as much time as you need to thoroughly work through your issues and practices involved with that section of the Workbook and make the necessary changes. /T_hen you may need to take a break and just 'be' for a while. Excellent! /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /T_hen, when you feel ready to handle the next step, go back and choose another chapter to work on. Get ready to see your weaknesses transformed into strengths and your limitations into opportunities as you reclaim your natural state of wholeness and completeness. Treatment Summaries By the time you /f_inish reading Listen To Your Gut your head will probably be swimming with the mass of information contained here. /T_he Treatment Summaries folder provides you with a bullet-point outline, or broad- strokes map, of how to pull all the relevant information together for your particular condition. /T_here are three separate action plans in the Treatment Summaries folder that give you a step-by-step summarized treatment plan for what you need to do to heal yourself. Some plans are more thorough and comprehensive than others. For example, for the /f_irst plan, you'll need to have completed the Healing Journey Workbook . /T_he other two plans are for you to use if you haven't yet completed the Workbook. /T_herefore, you can choose which plan to follow depending on your current motivation, energy, and time available: Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan - This is the best plan to ensure whole body healing. It guides you through creating your unique, customized, Optimum Treatment Plan based on your answers in the Healing Journey Workbook . This is the best treatment plan of the three offered, since it is the most thorough plan, and completely customized to your specific needs. Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan presents you with the highest chance of success in implementing the healing protocols in this program. However, you need to have completed the Healing Journey Workbook in order to fill out this plan. Jini's General Treatment Plan - If you haven't had time yet, or don't want to complete the Healing Journey Workbook , then this plan contains a summary of generalized treatments for each illness (IBS, diverticulosis, colitis, Crohn's). Using a General Treatment Plan is not as good as compiling your own, individualized Optimum Treatment Plan, but it is the next best thing. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK CHAPTER 1 Jini's Quick & Easy Treatment Plan - This plan is a list of quick-action points, for those of you who don't have the time or energy to follow either the Optimum Treatment, or General Treatment plans. Even if you just implement the first item on this list, you'll see an improvement in your health. Once you see an improvement, maybe you'll then have the energy or motivation to implement one of the more comprehensive treatment plans. Get ready to see your /T_hese are a collection of charts and questionnaires that give you a weaknesses transformed into self-assessment method of mapping out your current symptoms and Health Assessment & Tracking Tools strengths and your limitations into understanding what your symptoms are telling you about your state opportunities as you reclaim your of health or dis-ease in the various systems of your body (e.g., nervous, natural state of wholeness and endocrine, digestive, etc.). I have also included some tests to evaluate completeness . whether you have a Candida albicans (yeast) infection underlying your IBS or IBD. /T_he Symptom Tracking Charts then provide you with a concise way of tracking and monitoring your symptoms at a glance. You will be directed in the Healing Journey Workbook , and in the Treatment Summaries, to /f_ill out these tests and charts at various points throughout the program. Since the tools are on CD, you can print them out and /f_ill them in as o/f_ten as you need to, and then keep them in a /f_ile for reference and comparison. /T_his will help you to track your progress and also to pinpoint areas that need addressing. Again, remember what I wrote earlier in this chapter about the holistic healing process: As your body heals, it can suddenly unmask a deeply-seated imbalance that you were not previously aware of, and oer it up for healing. When your digestive system is so ill (for example) you may not be aware that your endocrine/hormonal system is in serious trouble - because your digestive system is more urgent, and healing that takes all your attention and energy. However, as you heal your digestive system, your body may feel it's time to draw your attention to your endocrine system, so you can focus on healing that. /T_he Health Assessment & Tracking Tools will provide you with methods of assessing and tracking this process, and guiding you on what to address next. /four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION Notes: Choose the area from this program that is easiest for you to work on and begin with that /f_irst. As anyone with intestinal problems knows, stress is the number one trigger and in/f_lamer of these disorders, so don't increase your stress (or your child's stress, if your child is the one who's ill) in your eorts to heal yourself or your child! Just take it slowly and easily, realize and accept that you're on a long, winding path and there are no miracle cures or quick-/f_ix remedies. Your dis-ease (unease) encompasses your environment, upbringing, past issues/occurrences, /f_inancial state, career satisfaction or lack thereof, diet, family, intimate relationships, lifestyle, stress, stability, security, peace, self-love, exercise, genetic make-up, your doctor-patient relationship and drugs ingested, to name a few. /T_he diets, therapies, and techniques in this program demand that you take full responsibility for your health and healing, and appoint only yourself as your /f_inal, ultimate authority. Do not give this authority away to anyone, not to me, not to your physician, your naturopathic or homeopathic doctor, your spouse or parent. You have everything you need to heal yourself - it is your responsibility, and you are the only trustworthy repository of /f_inal authority for your body/mind/spirit. /T_here are many pathways to healing. /T_his program may comprise part, or all, of your pathway. Only you know what's best for you, only you possess the map of your Healing Journey. All the information included in this program is of my own personal opinion and experience. My only intent is that you examine it from your point of view, take what you need, adapt whatever you want, and feel free to discard whatever you don't need. Some of the information and ideas presented in this program may be dicult for you to accept. Some of my approach (e.g., no pharmaceutical drugs) may be too radical and you may feel it's not safe for you - no problem! Just listen to yourself and only do what you feel comfortable with. You know yourself better than I do and you should certainly stick to what you feel is true and works best for you. I o/f_ten got emails from readers saying, \"I'm going to follow your program because I feel I can trust you, so I'm going to do what you say.\" And I would write back saying, \"No, do NOT give your power and authority away! Use my /four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle\u0003 TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK programs as a resource or guidebook, but always trust yourself /f_irst and foremost. You are the only one who knows the best/right path for your body.\" It will probably take you quite a while to work through and incorporate the diets, protocols and therapies outlined in this program, but it will also be well worth it. Imagine what it would be like to be /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle drug free. Imagine what it would be like to go for years without seeing your gastroenterologist (intestinal specialist), or having to go through any more torturous scans and scopes. Imagine what it would feel like to go to yourself /f_irst whenever you have a /f_lare or attack (or healing crisis) and be able to deal with and heal the fear and pain without having to rush to the emergency room or resort to damaging drugs or surgery. Yes, the path is dicult, and time-consuming, and at times nothing can be more frustrating than having to face your own self. However, as you begin to achieve this freedom, you'll also come to realize, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that nothing is more worthwhile. Turn now to the Healing Journey Workbook - on the Listen To Your Gut CD - and complete the section for Chapter One. CHAPTER 1 As anyone with intestinal problems knows, stress is the number one trigger and in/f_lamer of these disorders, so don't turn 'healing yourself' into one more stressor! /four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle\u0003 2 Supplements & Treatment Protocols \"/T.swashhe mo commonly accepted fallacy is that using herbs is really a primitive form of medicine. /B.swashut what would you say if /I.swash told you that in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/five.oldstyle, over /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle million prescription drugs were written whi/c_h came from plants? /O.swashr if /I.swash told you that over /seven.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the hormones used in medicine today are derived completely from plants? /I.swasht hardly does juice to herbs to call them primitive and ba/c_kward, and at the same time, to label drugs as advanced and modern, when so many drugs are in fa/c_t derived from herbs. /B.swashut there's more. /A.swashll drugs whi/c_h are extra/c_ted out of plants are not in a whole natural ate. /T.swashhis is the reason there are so many side effe/c_ts, whi/c_h is a medical problem in itself. /F.swashor example, everyone has heard of quinine. /Q.swashuinine is very efficient in reducing fever, e/s_pecially malarial fever. /T.swashhis drug comes from the /P.swasheruvian bark in /S.swashouth /A.swashmerica. /Y.swashou can take all the /P.swasheruvian bark tea you want and you won't have any problems. /B.swashut take a little too mu/c_h of the quinine extra/c_ted from the /P.swasheruvian bark and you will grow deaf. /T.swashake a ill larger dose and you will die.\" Dr. John R. Christopher, ND, MH Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT The herbal remedies in this chapter have been organized according to which symptom they relieve or heal. /T_herefore, certain multi - functional remedies are listed more than once, as they're useful for relieving more than one symptom. In this way, you can pick and choose the healing remedies that are appropriate for your speci/f_ic set of symptoms. Or, if you have a new symptom appear, you can quickly look up what you need to do to heal that particular condition. Supplementing with these herbs is a Notes: relatively easy endeavor that you can get started on right away and see a signi/f_icant improvement in your health and well-being fairly quickly. USING THE SUPPLEMENTS IN THIS PROGRAM Make a list of your current symptoms now, and as you read through the chapter you can note down which herbs and supplements will address your particular condition. Of course, many symptoms are o/f_ten interrelated and/or share a common root cause, and I've tried to point this out where applicable. A cornerstone treatment for healing the root cause of many IBD symptoms is eradicating pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms (like yeast, fungus, bad bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc.) from the gut environment, and then re-populating the gut with bene/f_icial bacteria. Also key is healing the mucosal lining and restoring/repairing the intestinal wall. /T_his is accomplished by eliminating pathogenic or infectious microorganisms (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) followed by probiotic supplementation (see Probiotic Supplementation section), and supplementing with substances that speci/f_ically heal the mucosal lining and repair gastrointestinal tissue. As this process takes several weeks (or months) to complete, along with this foundational treatment I also provide other remedies that provide quick relief from the symptom. /T_herefore, you can obtain immediate relief from your diarrhea (for example) whilst simultaneously addressing the root cause, which will provide long-term resolution of the problem. /four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Use Herbal Medicines Holistically Many people in the Western world who have embraced herbal/plant-based medicine are still automatically using it within the parameters of Western (modern) medicine. People are using herbal supplements in the same manner as they use drugs - once they /f_ind a supplement that helps them, they take it every day, inde/f_initely. /T_his does not /f_it the paradigm of holistic healing. Proper use of herbal medicine involves using the supplement(s) to address/heal the root cause of the imbalances in your body. Once your body is balanced (i.e. healed) then you don't need to keep using those The point of this program is to supplements. If you continue to use an herbal medicine your body no help you to heal the root cause(s) longer has a need for, you'll just unbalance your body again in another of your dis-ease and lead a strong, way. Holistic (whole body, integrated) health is about balance. It's not about healthy, natural life - where taking handfuls of supplements for the rest of your life. Now, in order to ongoing health is maintained heal yourself you may very well have to take a lot of supplements, for a via natural foods, exercise, and number of years even (depending on how ill, or out of balance your body is). But know this: /T_he point of this program is to help you to heal the root emotional and spiritual health, cause(s) of your dis-ease and lead a strong, healthy, natural life - where not by being reliant on handfuls ongoing health is maintained via natural foods, exercise, and emotional and of supplements, the way everyone spiritual health, not by being reliant on handfuls of supplements, the way else takes handfuls of pills. everyone else takes handfuls of pills. Don't necessarily look to supplement companies for guidance on this, as like pharmaceutical companies, they make their money from your illness or imbalance, so they have a vested interest in your ingesting their products on an ongoing basis. It's worrying that medical doctors (MDs) gain money/perks from getting us to use certain medications. But likewise, many naturopathic doctors (NDs) sell products right from their clinics - while I realize this practice helps to keep the actual visit with the naturopath aordable, this arrangement hardly fosters an unbiased view of supplement use. Make Sure Products Meet Label Claims If a product that I've recommended is not available at your local health pharmacy, consult Appendix C for the relevant contact information so you or your pharmacy can order the product in. Also, keep in mind that when buying products from a health pharmacy (particularly liquid or chewable /four.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT products) you can usually take the product back if you don't like the taste of it. Ask about the store's refund policy before purchasing and be sure to keep your receipt. You also need to make sure that the supplement you're buying actually meets its label claims. Up to /eightoldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of the supplements on the market today do not contain what they claim; in fact, many of them only contain /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of their label claim. /T_herefore, it's important to purchase products from reputable companies who carry out independent testing/con/f_irmation of their label claims. Some reliable supplement manufacturers at this time include Nature's Way, Eclectic Institute, Enzymatic /T_herapy, Allergy Research Group, and AOR (Advanced Orthomolecular Research). However, health companies are bought and sold all the time and new owners may not adhere to the same standards of quality. You can ask the health store personnel which companies carry out independent testing to Remember, you can order con/f_irm product quality, or, you can contact the supplement almost every product recom -companies directly and ask them to fax you the independent lab mended in this program from my online health store, we're open /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle assay con/f_irming their product meets their label claim. hours a day, /seven.oldstyle days a week, and we ship worldwide: Now, having said all that, I have also put together an online Holistic Health Shoppe in response to readers telling me of their LTYG HOLISTIC HEALTH SHOPPE www.LTYGshoppe.com frustration, diculty and hassle in /f_inding all the recommended Toll free: /one.oldstyle./eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle./eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle./seven.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle products.

For those of you that prefer to source your own products, or have your local health store order them in, I've provided detailed contact information for every recommended product manufacturer in Appendix C at the back of the book. /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Products I've Formulated I have personally formulated three of the products recommended in this program: Absorb Plus, MucosaHeal and FissureHeal. I'm approached every so o/f_ten by people/companies wanting me to formulate a product (especially probiotics!) but my response is very simple: Is someone already doing a top quality product of that type? If the answer's yes, then I'm not really motivated to add just one more of the same to the marketplace. However, I do get really excited about formulating products for which there is a clear need, but nothing decent available. I also like to innovate, to take something I get really excited about and make it ten times better. /T_he story of how I came to formulate Absorb formulating products for which Plus is available online at their website (www.absorbplus.com) so I won't there is a clear need, but nothing repeat it here. /T_he story of how FissureHeal came to be is quite funny, so I decent available. will relate it here. My motivation for developing FissureHeal suppositories came from myself. I would repeatedly get rectal /f_issures and there was nothing available to heal them aside from steroid suppositories (which I would not use) and some herbal suppositories for hemorrhoids that might have worked; but once I got a look at the size of them, there was no way I was going to insert them into my narrowed, already wounded rectum! So I put on my thinking cap, and a/f_ter numerous experiments, came up with my own formula that I melted down and poured into drinking straws as the mold. Perfect width and I could make them really long to reach a /f_issure that may be higher up in the rectal canal, if I wished. However, getting them out of the drinking straws was a very dicult endeavour; involving much struggle, mess and breakage. Nevertheless, I was happy because at last I had a suppository that would heal up my /f_issures very quickly. Of course, word spread once I started giving a few suppositories to people who were really desperate. But no one wanted to cook them up in their kitchen as I was doing. As one guy said a/f_ter I gave him the recipe to make his own, \"I can hardly cook, there's no way I'm gonna be able to make these! Can't you do them for me and I'll pay you?\" /T_hen a local midwife and some postpartum mothers asked me for some as they all had rectal /f_issures that wouldn't heal since giving birth from /twooldstyle - /sixoldstyle /five.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: years ago! How could I turn down people in pain like that? Well, the night I found myself struggling to remove suppositories from drinking straws at midnight, I turned to my husband and said, \"/T_his is ridiculous. We've got to /f_ind someone who'll manufacture these properly and then I can just tell everyone to go buy them from there!\" My husband is a former advertising executive and he's the salesman and dealmaker in our family, so he went to work. /T_he result is that FissureHeal suppositories - which took six months to /f_ind a way to mass-produce and are still made by hand - are now available to anyone who wants them and I'll never have to squeeze them out of a drinking straw mold again! /T_he company that makes FissureHeal (www./f_issureheal.com) also manufactures an intestinal/mucosal lining product I formulated called MucosaHeal. /T_here are other products in this category already on the market (Robert's Formula being the most well-known) but MucosaHeal is my ideal formula, designed to minimize the risk of any adverse reactions (always a concern with multiple-herb products), whilst containing the substances that I feel are most bene/f_icial. When you read the list of ingredients and what they do (in the sections below) you'll see why I feel it's currently the best product in its class. What If I'm Not Seeing Results? Herbal therapies can be very eective. However, I've found that dosages and concentrations that are /f_ine for most people are not always /f_ine for people with sensitive digestive tracts. Keep these factors in mind when you're trying a new remedy. Go slowly - maybe starting at half the normal/ prescribed dose - and watch closely for any adverse reactions. I've received countless emails from readers who are following the guidelines and supplements in this program, but not experiencing the desired relief. When I ask them for a complete list of all the supplements they're taking, I discover they're also simultaneously ingesting supplements that directly aggravate the symptom they're trying to resolve! I had a phone consultation once with a reader named Eric who had colitis. At the time he called me, he was bedridden from weakness and weight /five.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 loss. Eric was having approximately forty bloody bowel movements per day, and could no longer even get up to go to the toilet. He wore diapers constantly, which his wife changed for him throughout the day and night. I had his wife go and get all the supplements, vitamins, protein powders, etc. that he was ingesting and we went through the ingredient list on each one. We discovered that Eric was ingesting four dierent supplements that cause diarrhea in people with sensitive digestive systems! Obviously, the supplements were not the sole cause of his extreme diarrhea, but they certainly were contributing to, and exacerbating the problem. In every single phone consultation I've had to date, You'll see the best results from this program if you only take the the client has been ingesting supplements recommended here. A/f_terwards, if your naturopathic doctor recommends other supplements that you want to try, then test them one herbal supplements that directly by one, making sure they're safe and compatible with your body. Also, aggravate the symptoms they're keep in mind that many of the drugs your medical doctor prescribes will trying to resolve. cause problems in your body that are just as bad, and o/f_ten worse, than the symptom you're using them to suppress - pharmaceutical companies refer to this damage as 'side eects'. I'll discuss this more in detail in Chapter Five. For now just keep in mind that if you're not seeing the desired results from these supplements, you need to take a look at what else you're ingesting that might be interfering with their healing action. Unfortunately, medical, naturopathic and homeopathic physicians do not always know what's safe for people with IBD/IBS. /T_hey will recommend a supplement that works well for most people, but unbeknownst to them, it will aggravate the sensitive gut of someone with IBD. For example, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) is routinely used as an anti-in/f_lammatory. However, as it is a sulfur-based compound, it o/f_ten causes gas, bloating and sometimes spasming in people with IBD or IBS. Aloe vera is another problem remedy - most brands of aloe vera do not have all of the aloin removed. Now in most people aloin is very healing and contains many powerful and active components that greatly assist the body - hence the reason it's usually included in aloe vera products. However, for people with IBD, aloin is a very aggravating substance and can result in increased diarrhea and cramping. /T_herefore, when I recommend aloe vera juice, I /five.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT stipulate that it must be George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice as this is the only brand I've found that removes /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of the aloin, whilst leaving the rest of the highly bene/f_icial healing compounds in place. When I stipulate that you must buy a certain brand, I'm doing so for two reasons: Firstly, it's the only brand I know of that will give you the desired results, and secondly, other brands could be ineective, or aggravate your condition. My recommendations are based on years of testing by thousands of people with IBD or IBS, so please do not try to substitute another brand Notes: where speci/f_ied, or you may risk aggravating your condition and setting your healing back considerably. I do not receive /f_inancial compensation from the products I recommend and if a product suddenly changes quality or formulation, I will notify you as soon as I become aware of it.

In every single phone consultation I've had to date, the client has been ingesting herbal supplements that directly aggravate the symptoms they're trying to heal. To help you avoid making this mistake, stick to only the supplements recommended in this program, and make sure any supplement you ingest does not contain any of the following: Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), inulin, Betaine HCL Peppermint (unless enteric-coated) Blueberries, cherries or citrus fruits Ascorbic Acid High levels of Magnesium /five.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 You must carefully read the labels on every single supplement you take, including vitamins and minerals. Or, you can simply buy your supplements at my online LTYG Holistic Health Shoppe, where I've already screened all the supplements for you, to ensure they're safe for people with IBD and IBS: www.LTYGshoppe.com . HOW TO INTRODUCE SUPPLEMENTS Herbs and other natural substances can be just as powerful as drugs, so you want to be sure you're eecting the appropriate action in your body and gut - and not simultaneously sabotaging your healing with an aggravating supplement. In light of these factors, I recommend you follow this regimen for putting together your herbal supplement treatment protocol: /oneoldstyle. Immediately stop taking ALL herbal and natural supplements (even if prescribed by a naturopathic physician, Chinese medicine doctor or herbalist). Allow one week to clear any effects. /twooldstyle. Then, introduce the supplements recommended in this program, one at a time, leaving a few days to a week in between to check for any adverse reactions. The supplements recommended in this program are the safest and have been trial-tested by thousands with IBD. When you've introduced all the supplements you want to try from this program, stay on just these supplements for a month. /threeoldstyle. Next, introduce any other supplements you wish (or those recommended by other sources, physicians, etc.) but make sure you test them one at a time, leaving at least two weeks in between each one to test for adverse reactions or signs of intolerance. Be especially cautious when testing Chinese or Ayurvedic remedies that often contain a number of herbs or substances mixed together - these have the highest possibility for aggravation or intolerance. When I stipulate that you must buy a certain brand, I'm doing so for two reasons: Firstly, it's the only brand I know of that will give you the desired results, and secondly, other brands could be ineective, or aggravate your condition. /five.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Young Children Or Pregnancy For very young children and babies, or if you're pregnant, it's very important to check with your naturopathic physician (or do some quality research online) before supplementing with these or any other herbs. I can't possibly advise you on whether a supplement is safe for your baby, or if you're pregnant, because I don't know what other conditions/complications you or your baby may have. Since babies are so precious, it's best to err on the side of caution. Before each Symptom Treatment Summary (below) I do tell you when I have personally used a supplement whilst pregnant or breastfeeding , or on my own babies/children. But keep in mind, I am only relating my own, personal experience and beyond that you will have to take responsibility and check with your naturopathic or holistic physician before using any supplement. /T_here are no clinical trials that have been conducted on any of these herbal products on babies or pregnant women, so any examples I give you are strictly anecdotal. When in doubt about the appropriate dosage for children, either start really low and gradually work up to /oneoldstyle//fouroldstyle of the recommended adult dosage to begin with, or use this simple formula to determine the appropriate dose: Young's Formula Age in years = portion of the adult dose Age + /oneoldstyle/twooldstyle For example, the correct dose for a /sixoldstyle year old child would be: /sixoldstyle /sixoldstyle /oneoldstyle = + /oneoldstyle/twooldstyle /oneoldstyle/eightoldstyle /threeoldstyle \u0003 Again, your naturopath will also be able to give you some guidelines on which herbs are safe for your child and a recommended dosage. For optimal absorption, it's best to ingest a smaller amount of the supplement, several times a day, rather than one dose all at once. However, if this is too much hassle for you, then take it only once or twice a day, or whatever works best for your schedule. It's better to take a supplement once a day than not at all. /five.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Formulation Guidelines When buying any herbal preparation or vitamin/mineral, make sure it's free of additives and /f_illers (yeast, starch, sugar, etc.). Look /f_irst for a brand that's certi/f_ied organic, or harvested in the wild. If you're like me and can't or hate to swallow pills, check around because most herbal remedies are available in liquid form. Liquids are also easier to digest and absorb, as people with IBD can have very rapid transit times through the gastrointestinal tract. /T_herefore pills or capsules o/f_ten do not have enough time to be broken down or absorbed properly. So even if you can swallow pills, I recommend Through trial and error, from you use liquid or powder preparations whenever possible. Some liquid myself and thousands of readers, herbs are only available in a high alcohol base and the alcohol can trigger we have sifted through those intestinal bleeding. /T_he solution is to put the herb in warm/hot water, herbal treatments that produce which causes the alcohol to evaporate (let it sit for a few minutes), and then positive results to /f_ind the most drink it. However, don't buy a liquid preparation of an herb or vitamin eective treatments with the that also contains a lot of other ingredients (usually to make it taste better or improve absorption for normal people) as these other ingredients can lowest possible risk of intolerance. o/f_ten aggravate your sensitive gut. It's best to get either an herbal tincture (prepared in just alcohol or glycerin) or a straight powder (or capsules that you can open to release the powder) that you can then mix in water or apple juice. A very easy way to take your supplements is to whip them all in a blender in a protein or weight gain shake (more on this later in the chapter). SYMPTOMS & RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS Following are the herbal treatments that I have found most eective, listed under the speci/f_ic symptom or condition that they relieve. /T_hrough trial and error by myself and thousands of readers, we have si/f_ted through those herbal treatments that produce positive results to /f_ind the most eective treatments with the lowest possible risk of intolerance. /T_hose of you who have the /f_irst edition of this book will notice that there are a few remedies recommended in the earlier edition, that are no longer recommended here. /T_his doesn't mean that those remedies don't work; it means that together we've narrowed it down to the remedies that work the best. And those are the remedies that are listed here in this Revised, Expanded Edition. /five.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Herbal supplements can also be loosely categorized into those that primarily address the symptom, and those that address the root cause of the symptom. In general, supplements that alleviate symptoms tend to work very quickly and those that heal the root cause take much longer. /T_herefore, I've tried to provide a good balance of both of these healing tools for each symptom, so that you can still get quick relief whilst working on the root-level, long-term healing of your condition. Obviously, because these substances are healing by nature, there will be a fair amount of overlap between categories. Notes: To give you an example: For Heartburn (Acid Re/f_lux), George's Aloe Vera Juice and DGL lozenges both provide very eective, quick relief (symptoms). And over time, both will provide some healing of the root cause of heartburn. But, L. acidophilus is what's needed to really heal the root cause of acid re/f_lux, because until you balance the bacteria in your stomach and achieve the pH needed for proper digestion and acid production, you will always tend towards heartburn. However, although a proper implantation and colonization of good bacteria can take two to three months to establish, acidophilus will also provide varying degrees of immediate symptomatic relief as well (how much, how quickly, depends on the person). So, at the end of the list of treatments for each symptom is a Symptom Treatment Summary ; which gives you a quick-action plan for relieving that particular symptom. Please note that the points in these Symptom Treatment Summaries are listed in order of importance, or, according to which supplement I feel will deliver the most eective relief, or, in the shortest amount of time. I have also tried to point out (wherever applicable) the delineation between supplements that primarily address symptoms (and therefore provide the quickest relief) and those that may take longer to work, but are still crucial, since they address the root cause of the symptom. A/n.sc/e.sc/m.sc/i.sc/a.sc /T_his is a condition with a fair degree of controversy involved. \u0003 Some researchers and naturopathic doctors say that it's very dicult for \u0003 /five.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 the body to absorb iron supplements and that taking extra iron actually promotes intestinal infection. /T_hey maintain that the only way to treat anemia is by improving absorption. However, your medical doctor and other naturopaths will still stick with iron supplementation as the best way to treat anemia. My own experience over the course of ten years with anemia has led me to a combined position: I've found you need to both take an iron supplement and improve absorption to see any signi/f_icant results. You also need to make sure that the type of iron you're taking is one that can be easily absorbed by your body. However, before you begin any iron Large doses of iron can supplementation, have your doctor do a blood test to ascertain that your be irritating and unless anemia is not just due to a vitamin B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle or B/sixoldstyle de/f_iciency, which can be you're quite healed it may remedied simply with B/sixoldstyle/B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle supplementation. re-open your wounds and Inorganic iron derived from rock or 'iron salts' is not compatible with our trigger intestinal bleeding bodies and therefore we can only absorb about /threeoldstyle/percentoldstyle of this type of iron. /T_his is why many forms of iron are hard on your body and cause constipation and iron toxicity. Some manufacturers add amino acids to these types of iron in an attempt to improve absorption, but this only increases the absorption ratio to about /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle. Alternatively, organic iron derived from plants and vegetables is much more readily accepted by our system. It sometimes comes in a complex of other minerals, amino acids, enzymes and vitamins and/or is already protein-bound for easy absorption and utilization by the body. /T_his type of iron is also less likely to constipate you. Following is what I've found to be the most eective way of increasing your hemoglobin: If you're taking an iron supplement and experiencing intestinal bleeding, stop. Large doses of iron can be irritating and unless you're quite healed it may re-open your wounds and trigger bleeding. /T_his may be because iron is one of the more powerful free radical generators. If it is not used or absorbed properly, excess free radicals can cause tissue damage (and premature aging). /T_herefore, my recommendation is to adhere to the Healing Diets and take the recommended healing supplements until you've had no bleeding for one month. /T_hen you can start to slowly re-introduce the iron supplement. You should also be drinking \u00bc of a cup of George's /five.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT aloe vera juice every day. Begin with one capsule or one teaspoon of liquid iron at lunch or supper every other day. Auxima Fera is the liquid brand I prefer, or Floradix brand with no alcohol and no preservatives is also good. However, the absolute best iron supplement I've ever found is Ferrasorb by /T_horne Research Inc. (in Canada it's now called Ferra-Complex by Selekta). It comes in capsule form together with vitamin B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle and folic acid. /T_he powder in the capsules dissolves easily into liquid and is by far the most easily absorbed, non-irritating brand I've ever tried. I've used Ferrasorb to Notes: raise my hemoglobin /threeoldstyle points in one month (/threeoldstyle - /fouroldstyle capsules per day), and I've heard nothing but good reports from all my readers who have used it. It really is a fantastic product and I recommend you try it /f_irst. /T_he only diculty with this product is that /T_horne Research Inc. does not sell directly to consumers, they only sell to physicians and some herbal pharmacies that carry it require a prescription from a naturopathic or medical doctor before they'll sell it to you. If you have diculty getting it, you can order it online from our LTYG Holistic Health Shoppe (www.LTYGshoppe.com ). If you're worried about iron triggering bleeding, then drink your aloe vera juice /f_irst, followed by your iron, followed by your meal. It's best if your meal also contains certi/f_ied organic liver or some other iron-rich food. Take one capsule or one teaspoon every other day, or, once every three days. Pay attention to your body, if you see any streaks of blood in your stool or in the toilet bowl, stop taking the iron and see if the bleeding ceases fairly quickly. If it does, it may have been caused by the iron supplementation and you might want to give your body more time to heal and then try again in another month or two. If you're tolerating the iron well, continue on the dosage for a week or two and then increase it to one teaspoon or one capsule (/twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle mg.) every day. Again, monitor for signs of intolerance and either lower the dosage, or stop for a week or two and then begin again. /T_he key is to listen to your body. If all goes well, keep increasing the dosage slowly until you're up to a tablespoon per day (or three /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle mg. capsules per day) or every other day - whatever dosage works best for you. Remember to keep taking /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 the George's aloe vera juice for as long as you're taking the iron (if you're prone to bleeding). At the same time as you're supplementing with iron, try to eat as much and as many iron-rich foods as you can tolerate (depending on where you're at in your healing process). /T_hese include red meat, spinach, green seaweed (particularly dulse), broccoli, blackstrap molasses, cow's liver, etc. Try to eat organic produce and hormone/drug-free meat and liver - if you can't get certi/f_ied organic liver, then it's best not to eat it at all since the liver is a Iron-rich foods include organic storehouse for all the animal's toxins. red meat, spinach, green seaweed You also simultaneously need to increase your absorption of iron. (particularly dulse), broccoli, /T_he following vitamins are absolutely necessary in order for your body to blackstrap molasses (use in baking absorb iron: or on hot cereals in place of sugar) Vitamin C and organic cow's liver. Vitamin B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle Folic Acid B Group of Vitamins If you go to a health pharmacy, you should be able to get folic acid and B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle together in a liquid and you just put a few drops under your tongue each day. Otherwise, get your doctor to give you a prescription for /fouroldstylemg. pills of folate (folic acid), then go to a health store and get some sublingual B/oneoldstyle/twooldstyle pills. Also get a vitamin B group capsule or liquid and /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle-/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstylemg chewable tablets of vitamin C. If you /f_ind vitamin C gives you diarrhea, only take /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg, or make sure you take your vitamin C in mineral ascorbate form (e.g. vitamin C as calcium ascorbate). Vitamin C in mineral ascorbate form causes no diarrhea whatsoever unless it's in magnesium ascorbate form, in which case large amounts of magnesium may contribute to diarrhea. Numerous companies make a powdered Vitamin C that dissolves in water (some contain additional vitamins and minerals as well) so you can drink it along with your dinner for added absorption. A really easy and delicious way to take your vitamin C at dinner (or any other time) is by using Emergen-C drink packets by Alacer Corp. You just add water and it makes /six.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT a really delicious drink. /T_he vitamin C is in mineral ascorbate form so you may be able take up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle,/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg per day with no diarrhea. I've been using this product for years (my favorite /f_lavors are raspberry, cranberry and cola) and I regularly take /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg per day (/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg per packet) and when I'm sick or stressed I increase it to /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg per day. Try to sip these drinks slowly as vitamin C is absorbed very rapidly, but also goes through rapidly to urine if your body doesn't use it right away. Sipping slowly gives your body more time to actually utilise the vitamin C. Notes: If you're de/f_icient in folic acid, then don't take it at the same time as vitamin C. Both folate and vitamin C are essential for iron absorption, however, they tend to interfere with the absorption of each other so don't ingest them at the same time. If you don't have a folate de/f_iciency, then don't worry about this. To facilitate absorption further, liquid chlorophyll and homeopathic iron supplements work very well also, but are not essential. Chlorophyll Best absorbed in liquid form. /T_his is an excellent blood-builder, it promotes energy and is an internal disinfectant. It also improves all blood disorders (including blood sugar disorders and anemia), cleanses the liver and the digestive tract. Because it has a cleansing action on the digestive tract, it may trigger diarrhea for some people. If you /f_ind yourself sensitive to this either reduce the dose or take it every third day. If your diarrhea continues, then stop taking the chlorophyll and save it for a later date when your system's had a chance to heal and calm down a bit more. Make sure you get a brand of chlorophyll that has no added /f_lavors, preservatives, etc. It should be just pure chlorophyll and water. Follow directions on the bottle, but start with only \u00bc - \u00bd of the recommended dose, and slowly increase according to tolerance. If possible, it's best to divide up the dosage so you're ingesting it /twooldstyle-/threeoldstyle times a day (better for absorption than taking the whole dose at once). Continue taking until your hemoglobin levels are normal-high and you have plenty of energy, or until your intuition tells you to stop or take a break for a while. /T_he taste is very mild, even pleasant - unlike wheatgrass (another source of chlorophyll), which is very strong-tasting and made me /six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 gag a/f_ter a few doses. Don't use it if you're having intestinal bleeding or severe diarrhea and don't buy a brand that has other ingredients added (e.g., peppermint). Refrigerate a/f_ter opening. Homeopathic Iron Homeopathic Iron (Ferrum phosphoricum) supplements are also very easily absorbed. /T_hey do not actually contain iron, but work energetically to facilitate the uptake of iron. Take /f_ive pellets, twice a day. Don't touch the pellets with your hands, shake out /fiveoldstyle pellets into the cap of the bottle and Both folate and vitamin C then drop them directly into your mouth, under your tongue, and let them are essential for iron absorption, dissolve. Take homeopathic remedies /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before or a/f_ter you've had however, they tend to interfere anything to eat or drink. Don't use strong essential oils (like peppermint, with the absorption of each eucalyptus or wild oregano) or coee whilst using homeopathic remedies. other so don't ingest them at the /T_he pellets are quite palatable and just taste like sugar pills. /T_he point is to allow the pellets to be absorbed directly by the blood vessels that are same time. near the surface under your tongue (sublingual). Continue this process of supplementation until your hemoglobin levels are normal-high, you have plenty of energy, or until your intuition tells you to stop or take a break for a while. Intravenous Iron Infusion If your anemia is extreme enough (around /sixoldstyle./zerooldstyle g/l or lower) for your doctor to strongly recommend a blood transfusion, then suggest trying an intravenous iron infusion /f_irst (carries less risk than a blood transfusion). /T_his procedure is usually done on an out-patient basis and requires /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle treatments lasting approximately four hours each. A down-side to this treatment is that some people can have an allergic reaction to the iron. For both blood and iron infusions, I've found it really helpful to prepare my body to receive the substance. I hold the bag of iron (or blood) in my hands and lay it on my body. I thank the iron/blood for its gi/f_t to my body, I tell it that it is welcome in my body and that we're looking forward to it becoming one with us. I then 'sweep out' any negative or harmful elements that may be present (or you can pray that these be removed), thank it again for its gi/f_t to me and then hand it to the nurse to be hooked up. Whether /six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT this works because it actually eects change of some sort on an energetic level, or because it psychologically prepares my mind/body to accept the substance, I don't know. I just know that it works really well for me. If you have this treatment done, make sure you also follow the guidelines above for increasing iron absorption. During the infusion you may want to sip some liquid chlorophyll and vitamin C as well. Also, here are a few tips to make the IV needle insertion easier: Drink /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle glasses of water prior to your session and take a hot water bottle along with you. Lay the hot water Notes: bottle on top of your forearm (or wherever they want to insert the needle) for at least /fiveoldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes prior to insertion. /T_he combination of the water ingested and the heat from the hot water bottle will cause your veins to swell up nice and big, so the nurse will be able to insert the needle quickly and easily. Take along a good book or a friend/spouse to chat to, as four hours sitting in a chair can be a long time! Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used Ferrasorb Iron, George's Aloe Vera and Emergen-C whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given all three to my kids as babies and toddlers (the Ferrasorb in very small amounts). A George's Aloe Vera distributor once told me about a customer who gave all three of her infants George's in a bottle or mixed with breastmilk/formula.

Drink George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice before taking iron, if necessary. Make sure you're also taking a vitamin supplement that contains all the B vitamins, or, supplement separately with B complex. Use liquid chlorophyll or homeopathic iron to further facilitate absorption if needed. /six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 C/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/p.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc You may /f_ind it easier to defecate if you place your feet on a child's stepping stool (or a couple of phone books). /T_his raises your knees higher than your hips and more closely approximates a squatting position - the ideal position for opening the rectal canal and facilitating the quick passage of stool. Also, be sure and use the Colonic Massage method (in Chapter Six) before and during a bowel movement.

Certain strains of bacteria help produce digestive enzymes, peptides, amino acids and B vitamins for your body's use. /T_hey also inhibit or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, like yeast, fungus, parasites, and bad bacteria. See the expanded section on Probiotic Supplementation later on in this chapter for more information and details. Currently, I only recommend Natren brand probiotics as they are the only company that currently meet basic, essential standards for quality and ecacy (see Probiotic Supplementation section for quality standards). You need to take the full spectrum of probiotics in either capsule (Healthy Trinity) or powder form (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac). Ideally, take /oneoldstyle capsule /oneoldstyle-/twooldstyle times per day on an empty stomach. Or, take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder mixed together in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature /f_iltered water three times per day on an empty stomach (/twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or two hours a/f_ter food) until you're no longer constipated. /T_hen take one capsule once a day, or, the powders /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day for the next three months. /T_hen take as needed - let your bowel movements be your guide, if you start to get constipated again, start taking probiotics once a day (or more as needed). For faster treatment/results, kick o your probiotic regimen with a Probiotic Retention Enema (see Probiotic Supplementation section below for details) and then follow with the oral supplementation outlined here. /six.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Psyllium An eective remedy for constipation consists of using a psyllium-based /f_iber supplement mixed with half George's Roadrunner Aloe Vera Juice and half fruit juice. Take it /f_irst thing in the morning on an empty stomach. I recommend Aerobic Bulk Cleanse (ABC) from Aerobic Life Industries, which contains psyllium seed husks, licorice and hibiscus. Or, you can just buy straight psyllium seed powder from your health store (very inexpensive). If you don't like psyllium /f_iber supplements, then take apple pectin (/fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstylemg) instead. You may also want to experiment with herbal laxatives like senna leaf, but do not use them long-term. Equally important is to drink lots of spring or /f_iltered water (/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle glasses per day) and exercise regularly (at least do a daily stretching routine). Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid Form) & Magnesium A quick and easy short-term remedy for constipation is to increase your vitamin C in ascorbic acid form (up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle,/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg/day) and/or magnesium (up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg/day) intake, drink lots of water, and exercise (even if this just means walking around and stretching). Ascorbic acid and magnesium both have a laxative eect in higher doses. If you're still constipated a/f_ter two weeks of that, then in an emergency, you can resort to an herbal laxative, like senna. For many people I suspect simply raising your intake of vitamin C and magnesium (up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg/day) and drinking extra water (/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle glasses/day) should alleviate your constipation. Remember though, for long-term permanent resolution of constipation, you need to ingest a full spectrum of Natren brand probiotics. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used George's probiotics and Emergen-C whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given them to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers. A George's Aloe Vera distributor once told me about a customer who gave all three of her infants George's in a bottle or mixed with breastmilk/formula. /T_here are no known contraindications for psyllium seed, but you would need to check with a naturopath before giving a baby high doses of mangnesium. /six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 S/y.sc/m.sc/p.sc/t.sc/o.sc/m.sc T/r.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc/m.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc S/u.sc/m.sc/m.sc/a.sc/r.sc/y.sc - C/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/p.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc Take a full powders (Megadophilus, Bifido Factor, Digesta-Lac) /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle times per day until no longer constipated, or, take /oneoldstyle Healthy Trinity capsule /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day.

Take psyllium seed mixed with aloe vera juice and fruit juice. Cramping and spasming in the intestines is usually due to the painful passage of gas and/or pain from intestinal in/f_lammation or ulceration. For some reason, trapped gas hurts much more than trapped stool.

For some reason, trapped gas hurts much more than trapped stool. See Gas & Bloating if you suspect your pain is due to copious or trapped gas. If you suspect your cramping is due to intestinal in/f_lammation and/or ulceration, then see Intestinal In/f_lammation, Ulceration, Bleeding for remedies. When you solve the underlying problem, the pain will automatically disappear. Also, be aware of and look for emotional triggers that may need to be addressed. /T_he fastest, most eective therapy for resolving emotional issues is EFT (see Chapter Six for more details). Don't underestimate the eect of emotions on the gut and keep in mind that pain pretty much always has an emotional component. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: EFT can be used very eectively on babies, toddlers and children (see Chapter Six for more details) and I've /six.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT used it with both my children. If you think the cramping/pain is due to trapped (or excessive) gas or stool, then please see my BABY FART AEROBICS: And Other Natural Treatments for Colicky Babies DVD. You can read all about it and watch a sample video clip of me demonstrating techniques on my /eightoldstyle-week-old daughter, Zara, by Pain always has an emotional component - use EFT (see Chapter Six) to resolve and release emotional issues from both the mind and body. If your cramping is due to abundant or trapped gas, then see /gsc/asc/ssc /ampersandsc /bsc/lsc/osc/asc/tsc/isc/nsc/gsc for remedies.

D/i.sc/a.sc/r.sc/r.sc/h.sc/e.sc/a.sc Diarrhea can be caused by many, many factors. /T_hese can include any combination or singular occurrence of any of the following: Food allergies or intolerances A damaged mucosal lining Impaired digestion and absorption resulting in very rapid food transit times through the gastrointestinal tract Infection by pathogenic microorganisms - diarrhea is one of the mechanisms your body uses to expel pathogens or poisons as quickly as possible A colon that is incapable of absorbing water/fluid from stool /six.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Result of prescription drug use Lack of 'good' bacteria in the gut Tense, spasming intestines You can use the Colonic Massage method in Chapter Six whilst sitting on the toilet, to help you reduce bowel movement frequency. If your bum is getting sore from frequent bowel movements, then wipe your anus with /twooldstyle-ply tissues (Kleenex) moistened with warm tap water a/f_ter each bowel movement. Wear only /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle cotton underwear and natural fabric trousers, Do not ingest any capsules or shorts, etc. Sleep bare-bum at night and make sure your sheets are /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle tablets if you're having more than cotton.

Open all properly. Open all capsules, mix the capsules, mix the contents in liquid, and then drink. contents in liquid, and then drink. Probiotics For a long term resolution of diarrhea to take place, you need to improve the bacterial /f_lora in your gut. /T_he other remedies below will produce fairly quick results, but they are largely treatments that address the symptom, not the cause. Probiotics are one of the remedies that will address the cause of your diarrhea. Ingesting good bacteria improves digestion, absorption and elimination of food. Certain strains of bacteria help produce digestive enzymes, peptides, amino acids and B vitamins for your body's use. /T_hey also inhibit or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, like yeast, fungus, parasites, and bad bacteria. See the expanded section on Probiotic Supplementation later on in this chapter for more information and details. Currently, I only recommend Natren brand probiotics as they are the only company I know of that currently meets the basic standards for probiotic quality and ecacy (see Probiotic Supplementation section for quality standards). You need to take the full spectrum of probiotics (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac) in powder form only. Do not take the probiotics in capsule form as diarrhea indicates rapid transit time through the gut and the capsule may not have a chance to dissolve and disperse properly. Ideally, and for fastest relief, start probiotic supplementation with Jini's Probiotic /six.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel GUT Retention Enema (see Probiotic Supplementation section below) /T_hen follow with oral supplementation: Take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder mixed together in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature /f_iltered or spring water (no tap water!) /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food) until you no longer have diarrhea. Depending on your whole-body health, you'll see improvements fairly soon, but complete elimination of diarrhea may take a year or more of supplementation, or it can be as quick as a couple of months. /T_hen take /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day for the Notes: next /threeoldstyle months. /T_hen take as needed - let your bowel movements be your guide, if your stools start getting loose again, start taking probiotics once a day (or more as needed). While waiting for your gut /f_lora to improve, you can also use the remedies below for quick relief - but keep in mind that you don't want to just take L-Glutamine or Bentonite Clay for the rest of your life. /T_he goal is to heal the root cause(s) of diarrhea so that you can pass normal stool without having to use a supplement for years and years. Dry Curd /T_his is simply cottage cheese without the surrounding milky liquid and it works well for mild diarrhea. Try to eat some for breakfast and you'll notice it begin to take eect within /twooldstyle/fouroldstyle - /fouroldstyle/eightoldstyle hours. It's quite dry so a good way to eat it is with a well-ripened banana (which will also help alleviate diarrhea). If you have a lactose intolerance, you can still eat this dairy product as it contains virtually no lactose. L-Glutamine /T_his is one of the best remedies for quickly alleviating diarrhea that I have found. However, while it resolves the symptom, it does not completely address the cause of diarrhea, for that, you also need to take the probiotics. I initially heard about L-glutamine from a health pharmacy owner and then discussed it with my naturopath, who said he'd been having real success with some IBD clients using it. I've since heard from hundreds of readers who've also had good results from using L-Glutamine. Here's an overview /seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 for your information or experimentation, and I really encourage you to give it a try. Glutamine is very well known to athletes and body builders as a key to the metabolism and maintenance of muscle. It can be considered (along with numerous other amino acids) as a primary fuel, or energy source, for the entire immune system. It is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division and cell growth; which are all necessary for wound healing and tissue repair. L-glutamine is of particular interest to people with digestive disorders because it's also the primary nutrient for the cells that line the gastrointestinal tract. It's an important nutrient for the large bowel and helps maintain normal functioning of the mucosal cells that line the colon. One of L-glutamine's primary eects is the increased transport of water from the inside of the colon back into the body. /T_his diminishes the loss of electrolytes and water from the intestines that usually occurs with diarrhea. However, it's important to keep in mind that L-glutamine only has this eect when taken on an empty stomach. When it's mixed with other foods (including protein shakes and elemental diet shakes) it functions more as a protein (amino acid) that particularly nourishes the mucosal lining and does not produce the anti-diarrhea eect. /T_herefore, for people who tend towards constipation, L-glutamine is perfectly safe and bene/f_icial to ingest when mixed with food or added to shakes. Several trials conducted on patients with Short Bowel Syndrome found that with the supplementation of L-glutamine, people who had been on intravenous feeding for six to eleven years were able to make the transition to a modi/f_ied diet. /T_hey also had two to three semi-solid bowel movements per day, instead of numerous bouts of watery diarrhea. In another trial conducted at the Mayo Clinic, patients with recurring pouchitis put \u00bc teaspoon of L-glutamine in their pouches twice a day and showed a much greater reduction in in/f_lammation than the control group. Also, the patients using glutamine were able to eat without incurring infection or requiring long-term antibiotic therapy. Notes: /seven.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Here are two of my favorite anecdotes from the book, /T_he Ultimate Nutrient Glutamine by Judy Shabert MD, RD and Nancy Erhlich: \"/T_he baby had had colic and bloody diarrhea since she was /f_ive months old. Crohn's disease, the doctors had said, making her the youngest patient diagnosed with this ailment in the country. Steroids had been prescribed, and they helped, but the baby did not grow. By the time the child was six years old, her now-desperate mother took matters into her own hands. She had heard from other patients about the Notes: importance of glutamine for bowel growth, so at night, she gave her child a liquid feeding containing glutamine. During the day, she added glutamine powder to the child's cold drinks. A/f_ter /f_ive months of glutamine, the child's bowel symptoms reversed, and the physician reduced the steroid medication. Unlike the /f_ive previous times when the anti-in/f_lammatory drugs had been reduced, the child's symptoms did not recur. /T_he steroids were stopped, but the glutamine was continued. /T_he child has had only minor gastrointestinal symptoms and has been o steroids for one and a half years. Additionally, she has had a signi/f_icant growth spurt.\" /onesuperior \"/T_he patient, who needed to get his food in liquid form because he had a gastrointestinal problem, had developed a heart condition. He had cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), and he needed a medication called quinidine. But quinidine can cause diarrhea, and in this patient, the consequences were disastrous. /T_he doctors tried switching the patient's liquid diets, but the diarrhea got worse and worse. /T_hen, the doctors gave the patient a liquid feeding that contained glutamine. Within thirty-six hours, the diarrhea decreased by two-thirds. /T_he patient continued the glutamine-supplemented feedings, and he was able to take the heart medication and resume his normal life.\" /twosuperior Recommended Dosage: /T_he book recommends anywhere from /oneoldstyle - /sixoldstyle teaspoons of glutamine per day (typical concentration is \u00bc teaspoon equals /oneoldstyle gram of glutamine), mixed in cold or room-temperature water. You can /seven.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 buy it in powder form, and the great news is it's practically tasteless and odorless. You can also mix the glutamine with cold or room-temperature, non-acidic juice if you like (e.g., apple or pear juice). Again, it's best to break the dosage down as much as possible (e.g., /oneoldstyle teaspoon, /sixoldstyle times per day). Take it on an empty stomach. Store your glutamine in a cool, dry place, but do not refrigerate. Let me add one word of caution here: If you've had diarrhea for a long time, your rectal canal and other parts of your colon will have grown used to Notes: only so/f_t, watery stool passing through. I found the glutamine took eect very quickly and within a few days (at a dosage of one and a half teaspoons per day) my stool was formed and semi-solid. /T_his actually was not such a good thing as it caused pain in my colon as the harder, larger stool passed through a colon that had grown used to only so/f_t, mushy stu passing through. It also opened up some anal /f_issures as my rectal canal was quickly stretched much wider than it was accustomed to, in order to pass the larger, /f_irmer stool. Also, the number of my bowel movements increased initially as the glutamine caused a lot of the water that was normally in my colon to be re-absorbed. I think my peristaltic mechanism (rhythmic contractions of the intestinal wall) had gotten used to lots of water helping it do its job, and then had to readjust to moving the stool along by itself. /T_his resulted in more frequent bowel movements of just a small amount of formed stool each time. Basically, expect a bit of an uncomfortable period as your colon learns to adjust to a new type and process of passing stool. It's best to take it slowly, and give your colon plenty of time to adjust gently to the changes. My recommendation is to start with only \u00bc teaspoon of glutamine per day in half a glass of cold or room-temperature water, on an empty stomach, for the /f_irst two weeks. If your colon is handling that dosage well, then increase it to \u00bd teaspoon per day; if not, stay at \u00bc teaspoon until your bowel has adjusted. Gradually increase the dosage by \u00bc teaspoon at a time as your colon adjusts to the /f_irmer stool, until you're up to a dosage that works well for you. I reached my maximum at /twooldstyle teaspoons per day (any more began to constipate me), you may need more or less, just follow your body. Also, I noticed when I took a dose right before bed I would need to get up /seven.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT several times during the night to urinate, but who knows, your body may respond dierently. Take it on an empty stomach, mixed with cold or room- temperature water. L-glutamine purchased at a body-building supplement store can be a lot cheaper (sometimes half the price) than glutamine purchased at a health food store/pharmacy. However, the more expensive L-glutamine powder (pharmaceutical grade) is usually more /f_inely ground and dissolves better in water. If you have chronic renal failure (kidney disease) or liver disease, you Notes: should not take L-glutamine. If you have problems with constipation, make sure you don't take glutamine on an empty stomach, but always mix it with other foods or put it in a protein or elemental (pre-digested) diet shake. Psyllium Seed You can buy /f_inely ground (powdered) Psyllium Seed in a health store. Some grocery stores carry it in their bulk bin section as well and it's very cheap. Or you can buy a commercial product that contains Psyllium Seed (like Metamucil) but make sure it has no arti/f_icial ingredients or sweeteners. Start with /oneoldstyle tsp. mixed in /fouroldstyle ounces of non-acidic juice, like apple, pear or mango (I /f_ind the taste is too strong to just mix in water) and then increase dosage as needed, up to /threeoldstyle times per day. People with Short Bowel Syndrome sometimes /f_ind Psyllium works better for them than L-Glutamine. Best if taken on an empty stomach, just before a meal. Bentonite Clay Some people /f_ind they prefer Bentonite Clay to Psyllium Seed and some /f_ind the reverse to be true. /T_he easiest thing is to test both and see which works best for you. /T_he Bentonite has the blander taste of the two - I /f_ind it's easily drinkable just mixed in water and it's certainly my preference, taste-wise. Bentonite Clay is a volcanic ash containing many minerals and it also has the added bene/f_it of being a good detoxi/f_ication agent. Good quality Bentonite Clay should be grey/cream in color. It has a very /f_ine, velveteen feel and is odorless and non-staining. /T_he value of montmorillonite /seven.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 (the active ingredient in Bentonite) lies in its ability to adsorb (not absorb) many times its own weight and volume in a liquid medium. It has a predominantly negative charge that is capable of attracting many kinds of positively charged particles. Bentonite Clay's structure assists it in attracting and soaking up toxins and contaminants on its exterior wall and then drawing them into the interior center of the clay where they are held and then excreted out in your stool. It is this sponge-like quality of the Clay that makes it a good anti-diarrhea substance whilst detoxing your body! However, the only drawback is that montmorillonite has been shown in studies to also draw bacteria out of the intestines. So, if your bacterial /f_lora is unhealthy, this is a good thing. But, if you're supplementing with probiotics, trying to implant a healthy bacterial /f_lora, then you certainly don't want to be ingesting a substance that's going to pull all these good bacteria out of your gut as well! /T_herefore, I would only use Bentonite Clay short-term and then get yourself on the high dose probiotic supplementation that will address the root-cause of your diarrhea. Start with one teaspoon mixed in /fouroldstyle ounces of spring or /f_iltered water once a day on an empty stomach. Increase the dosage and/or frequency as needed. If you've been on drugs or been living a toxic lifestyle (i.e. a normal western diet and environment!) then go slowly as you don't want to detox too quickly or you'll make yourself sick (nausea, headaches, bloating, etc.). If you're simultaneously taking probiotics, then take the Bentonite Clay /f_irst. For example, upon waking, take the Bentonite Clay, wait /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes and then take the probiotics, wait /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes and then have breakfast. I used George's Aloe Vera, Natren probiotics, L-Glutamine and Emergen-C whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given them periodically to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers. A George's Aloe Vera distributor once told me about a customer who gave all three of her infants George's in a bottle or mixed with breastmilk/formula with good results. Notes: /seven.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /T_here are no known contraindications for Psyllium Seed or Bentonite Clay. Avoid giving babies any cow's milk products.

Then take /oneoldstyle tsp., /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours after food) for the next three months. Then, take as needed - let your bowel movements be your guide. For detailed guidelines and information, see the Probiotic Supplementation section later in this chapter. Take \u00bc teaspoon of L-glutamine powder per day in half a glass of cold or room-temperature water, on an empty stomach, for the first two weeks. If your colon is handling that dosage well, then increase it to \u00bd teaspoon per day; if not, stay at \u00bc teaspoon until your bowel has adjusted. Gradually increase the dosage by \u00bc teaspoon at a time as your colon adjusts to the firmer stool, until you're up to a dosage that works well for you. Take it on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours after food), mixed with cold or room- temperature filtered water. Take /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle tsp. of Psyllium Seed powder mixed with apple juice, /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle times per day, on an empty stomach, just before food. If you have Short Bowel Syndrome, try Psyllium before trying L- Glutamine. You may also prefer Bentonite Clay, /oneoldstyle tsp. - /oneoldstyle tbsp. /seven.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 mixed with water, /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle times per day, but go slowly to avoid rapid detoxification, and don't use for longer than two weeks. F/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/u.sc/l.sc/a.sc/s.sc Fistulas are cracks or /f_issures that penetrate right through the intestinal wall. /T_hey can tunnel through one section of intestine and then into an entirely new section of intestine - thereby bypassing a loop of intestine (for example) that would normally be used for the passage of food. Or, /f_istulas can tunnel through the rectum and exit into either the vagina, or, outside the body in the tailbone region (for example). Fistulas are usually formed as a result of chronic infection. Whenever there is infection in the body, the body will need to /f_ind a drainage hole for the pus and /f_luid containing the infectious microorganisms. /T_he most common place you see this mechanism at work is with a cold. When you have a cold (whether caused by bacteria or virus), the body will produce mucus to trap the infectious microorganisms and then it will cause you to expel the mucus via the nose and throat. /T_his is why you must never suppress a moist, chesty cough - the body needs you to cough up that mucus from the lungs and expel it. If you don't, and you suppress the body's natural drainage/ elimination mechanism, you risk developing a serious bronchial infection. Likewise, the /f_luid and pus from a deep, chronic infection within the GI (gastrointestinal) tract must be somehow drained or expelled from the body and if the infection is not resolved, the body will create a drainage hole for itself. It's quite an amazing mechanism really, that the body can tunnel through tissue, muscle and even bone to create a drainage hole, rather than risk death via infection. Keeping this in mind, it doesn't do any good to just heal the tissue, or surgically close the /f_istula path/hole. Because if the underlying infection is not resolved, the body will just create another drainage hole (or two or three). To heal infection naturally, without resorting to drug antibiotics or antifungals, see the section below on Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials . Notes: /seven.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson It's quite an amazing mechanism really, that the body will tunnel through tissue, muscle and even bone to create a drainage hole, rather than risk death via infection. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Many people use Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol both topically and orally to help heal their /f_istula infection. I'd like to oer you an additional experimental procedure that you may want to try. If you don't have a /f_istula yet, but you have a rectal abscess that your doctor is afraid is going to develop into a /f_istula, /f_ind out whether the abscess is still accessible from (open to) your rectum, and approximately how high up your rectum it is. If you can still access your abscess via your rectum, you may want to try syringing diluted Wild Oregano Oil (see the section on Wild Oregano Oil for dilution instructions) up your rectum, to the area of the abscess. One of the main problems with a rectal abscess or /f_istula is that it's very hard for the antibiotics to reach it, hence medical treatment is o/f_ten ineective. However, if you can regularly (three times per day, or as much as you can manage) syringe diluted Wild Oregano Oil up into the area of your abscess, you have a very good chance at killing o the infection. Syringes (with a plastic tip - the longer, the better - not a needle) can be obtained from any pharmacy. Now, if your abscess has been walled o from your rectum (the body commonly does this) into an isolated pocket, then you have two options. Firstly, depending on the size of your /f_istula hole, you can try inserting the syringe into your /f_istula and then depressing the plunger to release the Wild Oregano Oil as far up into the abscess pouch as you can. Or, if you've had surgery already to drain the /f_istula (or are planning on it) then post-surgery the doctor will usually leave a drainage tube inserted in your /f_istula. You can then syringe the diluted Wild Oregano Oil up this drainage tube to ensure the infection is eliminated completely and does not recur. For both procedures - syringing an abscess or a /f_istula - dilute the Wild Oregano Oil according to the instructions in the Wild Oregano Oil section below (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle:/oneoldstyle or /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle:/oneoldstyle). However, then try to increase the concentration of the dilution, one drop at a time, to see if you can get the concentration of Oregano Oil stronger, without causing pain. Keep increasing the concentration until you reach your own pain/tolerance threshold, as the stronger you can get it, the more eective it will be at eliminating the infection. Continue to take the Wild Oregano Oil orally as well for the /seven.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 duration of the Protocol. As these syringing procedures are experimental and have not been trial-tested by many people yet, you may want to consult with your doctor before proceeding. Fistulas require a multi-pronged approach to treatment as you need to /f_irst eliminate any infection, then heal the mucosal lining and the intestinal wall and simultaneously restore proper bacterial /f_lora throughout the gut. Again, you must maintain a healthy, balanced bacterial /f_lora to prevent future infection and damage to the intestinal lining. Elemental Diet /T_he fastest method for healing /f_istulas may be employing the other remedies listed here whilst on an elemental diet. An elemental diet can aid in the healing of /f_istulas because it reduces food matter and fecal waste to a watery minimum. /T_herefore, there is no bulky food or waste to push through a /f_istula hole, keeping it active or open. However, make sure there is no infection present in your /f_istula or region before beginning the elemental diet, as this will prevent the body from healing. /T_he body will not seal up a drainage hole (the /f_istula) for infection, it will not seal infection inside the body as this could endanger your life. Also, keep in mind that while some people /f_ind the liquid diet and liquid bowel movements help their /f_istula to heal, other people /f_ind it aggravates their /f_istula. I once had a consultation with a reader who told me that if his bowel movements were formed, then none of the feces came out the /f_istula hole. However, if his bowel movements were liquid, then some of the stool would exit through the /f_istula and aggravate it. So, obviously for him, an elemental diet would not be a good idea. Another reader with a /f_istula that exited in his tailbone region followed the IBD Remission Diet and used the FissureHeal suppositories in the manner recommended here. However, he had a long-running infection present in the surrounding tissue and pus would o/f_ten drain from the /f_istula hole. He suered numerous unpleasant side-eects from antibiotics, so he didn't want to go on a course of antibiotics to clear up the infection. As this was Notes: /seven.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT several years ago, I had not yet developed Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol . At that time, he hoped that being on the Diet, using Tea Tree Oil topically and taking Epsom salt baths would look a/f_ter the infection. Unfortunately, it didn't work suciently and a/f_ter six weeks on the elemental diet, his /f_istula was only /eightoldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle healed. He couldn't bear the liquid diet any longer and was desperate for real food, so he ended it and then eventually went for surgery. I talked to him a few months a/f_ter the surgery and he felt it had been successful. However, because he didn't resolve the underlying Notes: infection that caused the /f_istula in the /f_irst place, within /oneoldstyle/eightoldstyle months he had a severe /f_lare, could no longer work and was facing surgery, or long-term prescription drug use again. /T_here are more aggressive and highly eective natural ways to combat infection without resorting to antibiotics (Grapefruit Seed Extract, Olive Leaf Extract, Wild Oregano Oil, high doses of probiotics, etc.). About one year a/f_ter the reader mentioned above used Tea Tree Oil and Epsom salt unsuccessfully to try and clear his infection, I discovered Wild Oregano Oil and within another year and a half had used it for numerous yeast, fungal, bacterial and viral infections on myself and family members. I then felt experienced enough in its use to develop Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol oered here (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) where I combine Wild Oregano Oil with probiotics. It's best if you can use this protocol or another antimicrobial treatment (some prefer Olive Leaf Extract) to /f_irst heal the infection. Depending on your overall state of health, you can use Jini's Wild Oregano Protocol in conjunction with the IBD Remission Diet (do this if you're very sick, or malnutritioned, or have had active IBD for two years or more), or you can use a natural antibiotic/ antimicrobial treatment on its own combined with other remedies listed below. If your health is quite compromised, I recommend you /f_irst start on a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) and then in Week /T_hree of Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol , or, similar appropriate point in whichever other antibiotic/ antimicrobial treatment you may choose, begin the IBD Remission Diet. Once you've ascertained that there is no remaining infection, and it has /eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 completely cleared up, then the IBD Remission Diet combined with the other remedies listed here may oer your best chance of healing /f_istulas. See Chapter /T_hree for more information on an elemental (liquid, pre-digested) diet, or see my book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet (www. IBDremissionDiet.com). FissureHeal Suppositories Remember: You /msc/usc/ssc/tsc be completely free of any infection before beginning the treatments below. /T_his healing protocol is to be used by people whose /f_istulas exit either into their vagina, or, outside their rectal/tailbone area. Once your infection is cleared up, if your /f_istula still hasn't healed, massage Doctor Burt's Res-Q Ointment (available from Burt's Bees Inc. in health stores or at www.LTYGshoppe.com ) all over the wound and surrounding tissue. Rub in as much as possible. /T_hen leave the wound open to the air for as long as possible (sleep with your bum naked overnight). If you get leakage then sleep on a big towel or washable mattress pad, but make sure it's /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle cotton so the wound can breathe adequately. Comfrey is the most fantastic wound healer I've ever encountered and both Dr. Burt's Res-Q Ointment and FissureHeal suppositories contain good amounts of Comfrey. In conjunction with the topical Comfrey treatment, get a supply of FissureHeal herbal suppositories from www.LTYGshoppe.com (or see Appendix C for order details) to help heal the /f_istula from inside the body as well. Insert the suppository and push it up far enough so the suppository is as close to the area of the /f_istula as possible. /T_he suppositories contain eective wound healers like Comfrey, Slippery Elm, Marshmallow Root and Cocoa Butter. /T_his will help to heal your /f_istula from the inside while you sleep. I've used them myself on two separate occasions for rectal /f_issures and they work very well. If you have a /f_istula that exits into your vagina, then insert a FissureHeal suppository into your rectum and another into your vagina and position both in the area of your /f_istula. /T_he suppositories contain Cocoa Butter which is a very rich emollient, so if you get vaginal Notes: /eight.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT itching due to too much moisturizer, then discontinue vaginal use and just insert the suppository into your rectum. Also, the Cocoa Butter can damage condoms so switch to another method of birth control if that's what you're using - or better yet, just abstain from intercourse to give your /f_istula the best chance for undisturbed healing. If you've used the FissureHeal suppositories vaginally and they've resulted in severe or chronic itching, then chances are the area has become infected. If this is the case, then douche using the Wild Oregano Oil as described in Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) until there is no more itching. /T_his will not hinder your healing as Wild Oregano Oil is also an anti-in/f_lammatory and wound-healing agent. Heal The Mucosal Lining & Intestinal Wall /T_he following supplements are all eective for healing the mucosal (EFA), and L-Glutamine. See the sections on In/f_lammation, Ulceration & Bleeding and Diarrhea for detailed descriptions of each of these supplements. If you're using MucosaHeal, you don't need to take N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) because it's already contained in MucosaHeal. If you're simultaneously on the IBD Remission Diet (elemental diet) then you don't need to take L-Glutamine because you automatically get /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg of L-Glutamine per serving of Absorb Plus. And you'll also already be getting your Essential Fatty Acids (EFA) from adding the Udo's or /f_lax oil to your shakes. If you're not on the IBD Remission Diet, then I recommend you use MucosaHeal and George's Aloe Vera juice - a tablespoon of Udo's oil per day and/or /f_ish oil would also be great if you can manage it. Probiotics For long term healing of /f_istulas and the conditions that create them, you must improve the bacterial /f_lora in your gut. Having a healthy bacterial /f_lora will also help to prevent future or recurrent infection of the GI tract. Ingesting good bacteria also improves digestion, absorption and elimination of food. Certain strains of bacteria help produce digestive enzymes, /eight.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 peptides, amino acids and B vitamins for your body's use. /T_hey also inhibit or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, like yeast, fungus, parasites, and bad bacteria that wound or burrow through the intestinal wall - possibly the beginning of /f_issures and /f_istulas. See the expanded section on Probiotic Supplementation later on in this chapter for more information and details. Currently, I only recommend Natren brand probiotics as they are the only company that meets the basic standards for quality and bio-availability (see Probiotic Supplementation section for quality standards). You need to take the full spectrum of probiotics (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac) in powder form only. Do not take the probiotics in capsule form as you want to reap the bene/f_its of the probiotics beginning in your mouth and esophagus and on down from there. Take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac) mixed together in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature /f_iltered or spring water (no tap water!) /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food), until your /f_istula is healed. /T_hen take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (or you can now take the capsule if your bowel movements are not loose or watery), /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day for the next three months. If you're going on the IBD Remission Diet, then make sure you stay on this probiotic supplementation throughout the course of the Diet. For ongoing probiotic supplementation, please see the section on Probiotic Supplementation whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given them periodically to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers. A George's Aloe Vera distributor once told me about a customer who gave all three of her infants George's in a bottle or mixed with breastmilk/ formula with good results. I have used Wild Oregano Oil on my daughter from /fouroldstyle months topically, and very sparingly internally from /oneoldstyle year old. I used it with my son internally (when necessary) from /threeoldstyle years of age. See the Wild Oregano Oil section (later in this chapter) for more guidance on Wild Oregano Oil usage for children.

However, doctors now say that heartburn is actually caused by not enough acid present in the stomach to digest food properly and therefore the food sits in the stomach for too long and/or the esophageal valve is not functioning properly and so fails to keep the contents of the stomach from rising up Antacid use embodies the into the esophagus. /T_hen, you have to go one step further and ask yourself: What's causing my esophageal valve to malfunction and what can I do classical medical/pharmaceutical about that? And, why am I not producing sucient stomach acid to digest approach of suppressing the my food properly? symptom, whilst deepening and worsening the root problem. /T_he remedies below will provide both immediate and long-term healing for both these issues. However, you must discontinue any heartburn medication (either prescription or over-the-counter - that means not even Tums are allowed) since all these anti-acids impair or shut down stomach acid production. Shutting down your stomach acid production is never going to heal your condition, all it's going to do is impair your digestion. It's a classical medical/pharmaceutical approach of suppressing the symptom, whilst deepening and worsening the root problem. Also do not take any natural acid supplements, like Betaine HCL, for example. Naturopaths o/f_ten prescribe acid supplements to improve the acidity of the stomach, however, for people with IBD this can easily trigger intestinal bleeding and I suggest you avoid it. Lactobacillus Acidophilus /T_his is an extremely eective remedy for heartburn. /T_here is mounting evidence that acid re/f_lux is caused by a lack of good bacteria in the stomach and/or too much bad bacteria. Drugs like Zantac or Prilosec (and even Tums) that suppress stomach acid production also contribute to unhealthy stomach /f_lora - since good bacteria need an acidic environment and many species of bad bacteria /f_lourish in an alkaline (non-acidic) environment. Take L. acidophilus whenever you tend to get heartburn. For example, if you /eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT get heartburn a/f_ter every meal, then take L. acidophilus /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before every meal. If you only get heartburn at night when you go to bed, then take it just before bed. /T_he only restriction is that you have to take L. acidophilus on an empty stomach (otherwise it's destroyed by digestive stomach acid). Only use Natren Inc.'s Megadophilus ( /sixoldstyle - /eightoldstyle ounces of room-temperature spring or /f_iltered water, sipped slowly , /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before meals, and/or before bed on an empty stomach. For more information on how probiotics like Notes: L. acidophilus bene/f_it your body, see the section on eective relief for acid re/f_lux. I'm not sure of the exact mechanism by which DGL provides relief, but here's what DGL does for the body in general: It reduces muscle spasms (perhaps it relaxes the esophageal valve, allowing it to function properly and prevent acid from washing back up into the esophagus). It promotes adrenal gland function, soothes in/f_lammation and /f_ights bacterial, viral and parasitic infection (there is evidence that acid re/f_lux is caused by a lack of good bacteria in the stomach and preponderance of bad bacteria). DGL also increases the number of mucus- secreting cells in the intestine which improves the quality of the mucosal lining, lengthens intestinal cell life and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal tract. /T_he fact that the licorice root is deglycyrrhizinated means that there's no risk of it increasing your blood pressure (as can happen with regular licorice root), so it's safe for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure problems. Experiment to /f_ind the best time to chew/suck the lozenges. Try slowly chewing or sucking one lozenge before a meal, and then again a/f_ter you've eaten. Depending on how long you've had acid re/f_lux and whether you've been on a prescription drug (e.g., Zantac, Prilosec, etc.) that's shut down your natural stomach acid production (and thus exacerbated your unbalanced stomach bacteria problem), you may need to chew the lozenges /eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 more or less frequently than someone else. Also, keep in mind that even over-the-counter heartburn drugs (like Tums, etc.) alter the pH balance in your stomach making it overly alkaline and thus favorable for bad bacterial growth and inhibiting the growth of good bacteria, which only makes heartburn worse over time. Make sure your DGL lozenges don't have /f_lavoring agents added (like peppermint). If you're diabetic, then make sure they're unsweetened as well. Craniosacral Therapy Sometimes heartburn is simply caused by an esophageal valve that is stuck or malfunctioning due to tissue adhesions or visceral strain in the region. Also, your diaphragm can (for various reasons) push up in your chest cavity, causing pressure and malfunction with your esophageal valve. In these cases, craniosacral therapy can be very eective at quickly and easily solving the problem. Whenever I used to get heartburn (except when I was pregnant), ten minutes of craniosacral completely cured the condition. Look for either an osteopathic doctor, or, a massage therapist with certi/f_ication in craniosacral therapy. /T_hey must be at least Level II or higher, certi/f_ied by the Upledger Institute. For a listing of therapists in your area, go to www.upledger.com . Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used Natren probiotics whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. Herbal literature states that DGL is also safe for pregnant/breastfeeding women, while regular licorice is not (it can elevate blood pressure). I have also given Natren probiotics to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers. I have also taken both my children for craniosacral therapy from newborn to present - it is an invaluable tool for assisting children to be able to grow and develop unhindered. See my DVD, BABY FART AEROBICS: And Other Natural Treatments for Colicky Babies for an entire section on how/why craniosacral treatments are good for your kids and also to see a live demo on my daughter, Zara (available at www.ColicInfant.com ). Notes: - H/e.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/b.sc/u.sc/r.sc/n.sc /T_he most eective a multi-pronged approach: Take Natren's Megadophilus (L. acidophilus) in tsp. mixed in /sixoldstyle-/eightoldstyle ounces of room-temperature spring or filtered water, /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before meals, and/or before bed on an empty stomach. Sip it slowly. Notes: If you can't take the acidophilus , or you still need additional relief, chew slowly or suck a DGL Lozenge (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes after you've taken your acidophilus ) right before you eat, and then again after your meal. Experiment with how many lozenges you need to chew and how often, to provide the relief you need. George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice is also helpful when sipped slowly before eating, or before bed. Do not eat less than two hours before bedtime and don't lie down after eating - remaining upright uses gravity to help your system digest properly. Follow the guidelines in the Reduce Diarrhea Diet (see Chapter Three); this will eliminate the citrus, acidic and tomato-based foods that are primary triggers of heartburn. Also avoid peppermint, spearmint, coffee, chocolate and high fat meals (particularly before bed). Visit a craniosacral therapist to have your diaphragm released and to un-stick and heal your esophageal valve (see Chapter Six for more details). Follow up with self-massage to your solar plexus, stroking downward towards your navel. /nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 H/e.sc/m.sc/o.sc/r.sc/r.sc/h.sc/o.sc/i.sc/d.sc/s.sc Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in and around the anus and lower rectum that stretch and bulge out under pressure, similar to varicose veins in the legs. Hemorrhoids o/f_ten result from straining to have a bowel movement, or, from chronic diarrhea or constipation. Other contributing factors include pregnancy, heredity, aging and toxicity. Hemorrhoids are either inside the rectum (internal) or under the skin around the anus (external). External hemorrhoids are o/f_ten painful, but internal External hemorrhoids are often hemorrhoids rarely hurt at all. If you don't have any pain but /f_ind yourself straining to poo (even though the bowel movement may be so/f_t or liquid), painful, but internal hemorrhoids or, you have your bowel movement and there's no blood whatsoever rarely hurt at all. and then all of a sudden at the end there's anywhere from \u00bd a teaspoon to several tablespoons of blood, it's likely you have a bleeding internal hemorrhoid. With internal hemorrhoids, you may also feel a pressure in your rectum (almost like there's a large stool coming through), and then a gush of blood. You may also feel a 'popping' type of sensation and then the blood appears. /T_he blood from an internal hemorrhoid will be bright red and can be loose in the water, streaked along the sides of the stool, and/or on the toilet paper when you wipe. It's a good idea to experiment with dierent positions whilst defecating to discover which positions increase or lessen the pressure on your hemorrhoids. For example, I found that if I sat straight up, or leaned forward, the stool would almost always tear open my hemorrhoid(s). However, if I leaned all the way back and did not push at all (just used deep breathing and colonic massage to move the stool along) then the hemorrhoid would not bleed - unless I was really stressed. Remember that stress causes tissue to tense up or become rigid. You may /f_ind it easier to defecate if you place your feet on a child's stepping stool (or a couple of phone books). /T_his raises your knees higher than your hips and more closely approximates a squatting position - the ideal position for opening the rectal canal and facilitating the quick passage of stool. If this makes your stool move too quickly though, and thus tears your hemorrhoids(s), then try another position. /nine.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Liver Tonic According to Chinese and naturopathic medicine, hemorrhoids are a sign of liver congestion which in turn can lead to weak blood vessels. Milk /T_histle (Silymarin) is an excellent herb for /f_lushing and strengthening the liver, however, people with IBD need to proceed very slowly with liver support measures since their systems are so weakened and their livers are usually weak or damaged from prescription drugs. Start with only /threeoldstyle - /fiveoldstyle drops of Milk /T_histle tincture in a bit of warm water once a day (Herb Pharm is my favorite brand), and gradually increase from there as your system can tolerate it, up to the recommended dose on the bottle. An excellent tonic for relieving liver congestion is to juice together: /twooldstyle carrots /oneoldstyle bunch of kale /twooldstyle beets /oneoldstyle stalk of celery If you need the juice to be sweeter, then add more carrots. /T_his is a very potent tonic though, so only drink \u00bc - \u00bd cup per day. Freeze the rest immediately to keep it fresh. I like to pour the juice into empty ice cube trays and once frozen transfer the cubes to a ziplock freezer bag. /T_hen it's easy to just defrost /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle cubes in a glass each day - either put the cubes in a glass bowl or cup in the fridge overnight, or, just let them sit at room temperature until thawed and then drink. Do not thaw the juice by heating it, or you'll lose the health bene/f_its. Again, start slowly and gradually build up the amount as you can tolerate it. If all you can tolerate is a tablespoon per day, this will still really bene/f_it you. If it gives you diarrhea, even at a low dose, then leave it until your system's healed and you're stronger, and then try again. Remember that beets turn your stool (and sometimes your urine) pink or red, so don't confuse this with bleeding. Rutin & Horse Chestnut Horse Chestnut is a very eective herb for strengthening blood vessels (works really well for varicose veins as well) - take /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg twice a day, standardized to contain /oneoldstyle/sixoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle aescin. Bio/f_lavonoids (Rutin, Hesperidin, /nine.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Quercetin) also strengthen vein and capillary walls so they don't tear and bleed so easily. Rutin is one of the most eective for hemorrohoids, so you can either take just Rutin, or, you can take a mix of all three. Take /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg of Rutin, or a mixed bio/f_lavonoid, twice a day. /T_hey're not a quick cure though so allow /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle months of supplementation to see results. Research shows that taking bio/f_lavonoids can also reduce leg and back pain, promote circulation, treat and prevent cataracts, stimulate bile production, and lower cholesterol levels. By strengthening your blood vessels, you will not only heal your hemorrohoids, but you will be addressing the root cause and thereby prevent recurrence. FissureHeal Suppositories /T_he other remedy you can try for is FissureHeal suppositories (www./f_issureheal.com) . FissureHeal contains comfrey, which is an excellent wound-healer, and the cocoa butter base is a very rich emollient so it will help the rectal tissue to be more supple. /T_his is a symptom-based treatment though, so while it will help stop the bleeding quickly and help your rectal canal to stretch for the next bowel movement, it won't heal the root cause (weakened, swollen blood vessels). Be cautious when using them though as you don't want insertion of the suppository to open up the hemorrhoid. Insert them very slowly and gently, allowing your body heat to melt the cocoa butter and lubricate your rectum. Take deep breaths to relax the tissue during insertion. Also, only use once or twice per day to avoid aggravating the hemorrhoid. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used FissureHeal whilst pregnant and breastfeeding and used FissureHeal suppositories on my daughter at /sixoldstyle months for a few days. Bio/f_lavonoids in the appropriate dose should be /f_ine for toddlers/children, but check with your naturopath for guidelines before supplementing toddlers with Milk /T_histle or Horse Chestnut. Milk /T_histle is probably not good to use whilst pregnant (especially during the /f_irst trimester) since your liver is already working hard - unless under the supervision of a physician. Likewise, use the Liver Tonic sparingly whilst pregnant.

If our immune system was in \"attack\" mode all the time our body could actually kill itself, so a very important component of the immune system is its suppressive mechanism. When these two facets get out of balance, disease manifests in the body.

Partial improvement in immune response was accomplished with CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle therapy. /T_he healing and repair of the gastric mucosa are very energy dependent and presumably would depend upon antioxidants like Coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle. Early research in Japan showed that CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle protects the stomach lining and duodenum. Healing of gastric ulcers has been demonstrated in animals but not humans - further studies are in progress. Cellular health is crucial to the balanced /nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT and healthy functioning of your body and antioxidants (including Selenium, Vitamins A, C, E, Grape Seed Extract, Pycnogenol, and Coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle) play a vital role in cellular energy, respiration and reduction of free radicals. People participating in clinical studies (for breast cancer) have taken up to /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg. of CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle per day with no harmful side eects, but /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle mg. per day should be sucient for maintenance. Absorption is substantially increased if you take it with a cold-pressed oil containing Omega-/threeoldstyle or Omega-/sixoldstyle essential fatty acids and many preparations now come in capsules Notes: where the CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle is already mixed with an EFA (essential fatty acid) and vitamin E oil. Vitamin C An antioxidant required for at least /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle dierent metabolic functions in the body, including adrenal gland function, tissue growth and repair, protection against infection, and cancer prevention. Literally hundreds of clinical (including double-blind and placebo controlled) studies have been done on vitamin C to determine its safety and ecacy. It is one of the most bene/f_icial substances you can take for your immune system. In one particularly memorable trial, researchers gave /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle patients with Polio intramuscular vitamin C shots (/oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle grams every /twooldstyle - /fouroldstyle hours, depending on the age of the patient, for the /f_irst /twooldstyle/fouroldstyle hours, then /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle grams every /sixoldstyle hours for the next /fouroldstyle/eightoldstyle hours) and within /sevenoldstyle/twooldstyle hours every single one of them was diagnosed \"clinically well\". /threesuperior If a drug could accomplish what vitamin C does for our bodies, it would be all over the media, every doctor would prescribe it, and it would be part of nearly every hospital visit. Alas, as it's a natural, non-patentable substance, there's no exclusive, economic reward for promoting vitamin C and, more importantly, its widespread use would cause billions of dollars in lost revenue for drugs and vaccines. Vitamin C in its common ascorbic acid form causes diarrhea. /T_herefore, make sure you get a vitamin C powder in mineral ascorbate form (e.g., calcium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate, etc.). High doses of magnesium can also cause diarrhea so get a higher proportion of calcium ascorbate if the two are mixed, or just get vitamin C in calcium ascorbate form. /nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 /T_he mineral ascorbate form is also preferable as it's more readily absorbed - ascorbic acid has to /f_irst be converted to mineral ascorbates by the body prior to absorption. However, some people with IBD do report increased diarrhea from the mineral ascorbate form as well, so test it and see how you respond. Another delicious way to get your daily vitamin C in mineral ascorbate form (for ongoing use) is by using Emergen-C (by Alacer Corp.) handy single-serving packets, naturally /f_lavored in your choice of tangerine, cranberry, raspberry, lemon-lime, etc. Emergen-C is a common product in any health store or see Appendix C for order details. If you're taking Notes: vitamin C regularly, or in high doses, make sure you don't just suddenly stop taking it, or you'll experience a rebound eect where your immune system becomes depressed. If, for some reason, you want to stop taking it, then wean o gradually to prevent this rebound eect. If you don't like or can't tolerate oral vitamin C supplementation, then see your Naturopathic Physician for intravenous vitamin C. Start with /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle grams and then increase to /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle grams per session. Intravenous vitamin C is also great if you have any other kinds of immune system malfunction; lupus, herpes, AIDS, etc. I've had it done myself and it is very safe with no side eects. *Astragalus and Maitake are medicinal herbs and therefore should not be taken non-stop. Just like drugs, if you use them long-term, your body may develop dependencies on them and they may gradually lose their eectiveness. Remember that health is a state of balance. Use these herbs to help your body regain its state of balance, but remember that using them non-stop or long-term can throw your body out of balance in another way. A good naturopathic physician could guide you in how much for how long, or, you could just listen to your body and when you feel you've had enough, stop taking it and then resume when/if you feel you need it again. I generally use the Astragalus or Maitake for a maximum of /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle weeks at a time, then I take a break of a week or so before resuming use (if needed). To prevent the onset of a cold or /f_lu, ingesting /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle drops in warm water twice a day for three to four days is usually sucient, or, you can take it while you have a cold or /f_lu to reduce the duration of illness. Mix herbal /nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT tinctures with warm or hot water whenever possible as it facilitates their action and evaporates the alcohol. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used Astragalus sparingly and CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle, Pycnogenol, Grape Seed Extract and Emergen-C whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given all of them to my children periodically from /oneoldstyle year onwards. Herbal literature states that DGL is safe for pregnant/ breastfeeding women, whilst regular licorice is not (it can makes excellent quality tinctures, take /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle drops in warm or hot water, or in your favorite herbal tea, two to three times per day. Some companies make a liquid tincture mix of Astragalus, Maitake and Reishi mushrooms, and deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), which is very good. Take as directed on the bottle. Take CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle with either Pycnogenol or Grape Seed Extract, to a combined maximum of /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg per day. Take as much vitamin C daily, in mineral ascorbate form, as you can tolerate, or, see your naturopath for intravenous vitamin C.

Whether a bad bacterial /f_lora is the cause of IBD or the result , doesn't matter. For your digestive system to become healthy again, it is a vital component that must be addressed/ balanced. In severe cases - and any IBD indicates a severe case - balancing /nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 the bacterial gut /f_lora requires two steps: First, you need to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (yeast, fungus, bad bacteria, parasites, viruses, etc.) and heal the infection. /T_hen, you need to repopulate the gut with good, healthy bacteria to ensure ongoing good digestion and prevent recurrence of infection with pathogenic microorganisms. /T_his can be accomplished using a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section below) to clear any infectious microorganisms, followed by high doses of probiotics. However, If you're experiencing intestinal if you have heavy bleeding or hemorrhaging, I believe it's best to /f_irst get bleeding and/or diarrhea, then the bleeding stopped before starting a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial you're losing a lot of /f_luids and treatment. If your colonic bleeding is very light and infrequent, or, if your bleeding is just from a /f_issure in your rectum, then you can begin electrolytes. It is absolutely vital a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment right away, combined with that you remain adequately the other remedies in this chapter that address your particular symptom hydrated during this time or your pro/f_ile. Remember that if you're experiencing intestinal bleeding and/or body may go into shock. diarrhea, you're losing a lot of /f_luids and electrolytes. It is absolutely vital that you remain adequately hydrated during this time or your body may go into shock. Drink lots of water, Emergen-C, and diluted apple or pear juice during times of bleeding. If your bleeding is moderate to severe, then you need to be drinking these /f_luids continually until you get the bleeding stopped - to avoid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. See the section below on Danger Signals for what to do if your body does go into shock. One of the most confusing things in treating intestinal bleeding can be discerning where the blood is coming from. /T_here are some guidelines to use, which I will give you, but other times the only way to know for sure is by trying dierent remedies and seeing what works. If your stool is black or green, the bleeding is coming from your stomach or small intestine. However, certain foods (like blueberries) and iron supplements can also turn your stool green or black, so don't confuse the two. Bleeding from your colon (large intestine) or rectum will be bright red. /T_his is where things can get very confusing. You may think you're having colonic bleeding but it may only be from a rectal /f_issure or internal hemorrhoid (or both!). If you have some pain in your rectum or anus upon defecating, then it's likely you /nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: have a /f_issure that's getting torn open by the bowel movement and bleeding. If you don't have any pain (or only mild pain) but /f_ind yourself straining to poo (even though the bowel movement may be so/f_t or liquid), or, you have your bowel movement and there's no blood whatsoever and then all of a sudden at the end there's anywhere from \u00bd a teaspoon to a couple tablespoons of blood, it's likely you have an internal hemorrhoid. External hemorrhoids cause pain, but internal hemorrhoids rarely hurt at all. With internal hemorrhoids, you may also feel a pressure in your rectum (almost like there's a large stool coming through), and then a gush of blood. You may also feel a 'popping' type of sensation and then the blood appears. Alternatively, depending on where your hemorrhoids are, the blood can be both mixed in with the stool and loose - this is what makes it confusing. If you're not sure whether your blood is coming from your rectum or colon, the only way to /f_ind out is to see which treatment stops the bleeding. Also, keep in mind that if your bleeding is colonic, you'll likely have other signs of more serious illness, such as fatigue, pain or cramping, anemia, gas/ bloating, etc., and the blood loss will likely be larger. If you feel perfectly /f_ine otherwise, have fairly normal bowel movements, plenty of energy, etc. then there's a good chance the bleeding is merely due to a /f_issure or hemorrhoid(s) in your rectum. If this is the case, then see the relevant sections for Hemorrhoids and/or Rectal Fissures for healing guidelines. Danger Signals If your body goes into shock from blood or /f_luid loss (dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalance) you'll need to go into the hospital to get rehydrated via an intravenous saline and electrolyte solution. When you're in shock, your body will start shaking uncontrollably (even mild convulsing) and you'll feel freezing cold. Do not get into a hot bath to warm yourself up if this happens, but go straight to the hospital where they will warm you whilst simultaneously rehydrating you with /f_luids and electrolytes. Your body becomes cold because it has pulled the blood from your extremities to your internal organs - as a life-saving device. Taking a hot bath, or some other similar action, that causes the blood to be pulled back out to the surface of your skin could have dire consequences (even death). So if /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 you get really cold and blankets and a hot water bottle can't warm you up, and/or you start shaking/convulsing, you need intravenous rehydration. Drinking a lot of water and electrolyte /f_luids at that point, is probably too late, you need to receive them intravenously - directly to the bloodstream. /T_he other warning signals you need to look out for are signs of intestinal rupture or perforation. In this case you will experience a fever, very rigid abdomen, severe shaking or shivering and constipation - where you're not passing any gas or stool. Intestinal rupture or perforation are very Notes: dangerous conditions requiring immediate surgery, so if you /f_ind yourself with these symptoms, then call an ambulance and get to the hospital right away - delaying treatment could result in death (similar to a ruptured appendix). As long as you're not experiencing either of these severe and dangerous conditions (shock or intestinal rupture/perforation) you can treat yourself using the holistic methods outlined below and in the rest of this program. Also, remember that just because you're admitted to the hospital, does not mean you have to consent to intravenous steroids or colonoscopies, etc. I've been admitted twice and just received intravenous saline and electrolytes and then gone back home the same day to continue with my natural healing protocols. On one occasion my hemorrhaging had been so severe (this was before I developed the IBD Remission Diet) that my hemoglobin was only /threeoldstyle out of /oneoldstyle/fouroldstyle (or /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle out of /oneoldstyle/fouroldstyle/zerooldstyle), so I agreed to a blood transfusion along with /f_luids, but nothing else. Remember, you are /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle in charge of your body. Doctors cannot force you to do anything, so don't give your power away. In cases of extreme pressure or intimidation, just threaten to sue them and that should cause them to back o. You can also try saying something like, 'Well, if you're right and I'm wrong, I can always come back! But I'm going to try this holistic method /f_irst.' Elemental Diet An elemental (liquid, pre-digested) diet is as eective as steroids (Prednisone) in inducing remission. My second book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet combines an elemental diet, with a targeted supplementation plan and /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: probiotic therapy to completely heal the gastrointestinal tract, repopulate with good bacteria, and ensure ongoing, long-term health. If your bleeding is moderate to severe I highly recommend you follow this program as it is the fastest route to complete healing. You should also combine the elemental diet with a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section below). If you have moderate to severe bleeding, then start the IBD Remission Diet /f_irst and don't begin a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment until your bleeding has stopped or is only intermittent and very light. Otherwise, start a natural antibiotic/antimicrobial treatment /f_irst and then in Week /T_hree, begin the IBD Remission Diet simultaneously along with ongoing probiotic supplementation. See Chapter /T_hree for more detailed information on elemental diets. You can also read Chapter One of my book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet online at www.IBDremissionDiet.com . Probiotics If you follow Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol , or, go on the IBD Remission Diet, both provide instructions for probiotic supplementation. If you don't do either, then it is imperative you follow the instructions here for supplementing with probiotics to assist your gut in healing in/f_lammation and ulceration. I recommend you don't begin probiotic supplementation until you have no bleeding, or, only light, infrequent bleeding. See the section on Probiotic Supplementation below for reasons why and how to test/slowly introduce probiotics following bleeding. Certain strains of bacteria help produce digestive enzymes, peptides, amino acids and B vitamins for your body's use. /T_hey also inhibit or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, like yeast, fungus, parasites, and bad bacteria. Currently, I only recommend Natren brand probiotics as they are the only company I know of that meets the basic standards for probiotic quality and ecacy (see Probiotic Supplementation section for quality standards). You need to take the full spectrum of probiotics (L. acidophilus, B. bi/f_idum, L. bulgaricus) in powder or capsule form. If you tend towards diarrhea, then take the powder form only (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor and Digesta-Lac). If your bowel movements are normal or tend towards constipation, then you can take the /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 capsules (Healthy Trinity), if you prefer. Take /oneoldstyle capsule /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day, or, mix /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature spring or /f_iltered water (no tap water) and take /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach, until you have no more in/f_lammation or ulceration. /T_hen take /oneoldstyle capsule once per day, or, /oneoldstyle tsp., /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food) for the next three months. /T_hen, take as needed - let your digestion and bowel movements be your guide. It is also a good idea to do J ini's Probiotic Retention Enema once per month, for three months, if you can, since you'll see the fastest results that way (see Probiotic Supplementation section for instructions). While waiting for your gut /f_lora to improve, use the other treatments below for relief and to help heal the mucosal lining and intestinal wall. Aloe Vera Juice You must only use George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice (available in most health stores or www.warrenlabsaloe.com ) because it has /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of the laxative component removed and also has no carrageenan (used in large quantities to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates) or additives. Do not buy a brand that's /f_lavored or contains citric acid or sodium benzoate (carcinogenic preservative), make sure it has the laxative component (aloin - contained in the 'middle' leaf) completely removed, has no carrageenan, and no other additives. /T_he juice should be clear and taste pretty much like distilled water - if it tastes bitter, then it's probably going to have a laxative eect. If you can only /f_ind it in gel form (make sure it conforms to all the speci/f_ications listed above), dilute the gel with plenty of /f_iltered or spring water before you drink it. Aloe vera juice soothes in/f_lammation, heals open or raw wounds, increases tissue suppleness and has antiviral properties. George's Aloe Vera Juice is especially excellent if you're having any intestinal bleeding as it helps to heal it up really fast (drink \u00bc - cup /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach). If you have mouth ulcers, swirl it around and hold it in your mouth for a while before swallowing to soothe and speed healing of the ulcers. It is also eective in soothing and preventing heartburn. I sometimes just use it for maintenance Notes: /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT as well, about \u00bc cup/day or every other day (whenever I feel I need it). Refrigerate a/f_ter opening as this will maintain its tastelessness. Coenzyme Q10 /T_he main function of CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle is as a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants reduce free radical damage and promote tissue repair. Coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle was /f_irst isolated and extracted from mammalian tissue in /oneoldstyle/nineoldstyle/fiveoldstyle/sevenoldstyle by Dr. F.L. Crane and his initial research concluded that CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle could add or remove oxygen from a biologically active molecule. /T_his is signi/f_icant because a lack of oxygen can produce a decline in cellular energy, while an excess of oxygen will result in the formation of toxic elements. Studies have demonstrated a marked CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle de/f_iciency in thymic tissue and pronounced suppression of immune response in aged mice. Partial improvement in immune response was accomplished with CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle therapy. /T_he healing and repair of the gastric mucosa are very energy dependent and presumably would depend upon antioxidants like Coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle. Early research in Japan showed that CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle protects the stomach lining and duodenum. Healing of gastric ulcers has been demonstrated in animals but not humans - further studies are in progress. Cellular health is crucial to the balanced and healthy functioning of your body and antioxidants (including Selenium, vitamins A, C, E, Grape Seed Extract, Pycnogenol - pine bark extract, and Coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle) play a vital role in cellular energy, respiration and reduction of free radicals. People participating in clinical studies (for breast cancer) have taken up to /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg. of CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle per day with no harmful side eects, but /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle mg. per day should be sucient for maintenance. Absorption is substantially increased if you take it with a cold-pressed oil containing Omega-/threeoldstyle or Omega-/sixoldstyle essential fatty acids and many preparations now come in capsules where the CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle is already mixed with an EFA (essential fatty acid) and vitamin E oil. Essential Fatty Acids (EFA) Fish oil supplements contain Omega-/threeoldstyle essential fatty acids which are anti-in/f_lammatories. You've probably heard quite a bit about their ecacy in healing/treating IBD. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 researchers gave /threeoldstyle/nineoldstyle Crohn's Disease patients with a high risk of relapse /f_ish oil capsules daily for one year. By the end of the study, /fiveoldstyle/nineoldstyle/percentoldstyle (/twooldstyle/threeoldstyle patients) experienced full remission, compared with only /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle/percentoldstyle (/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle patients) in the control group. However, there has also been some controversy regarding the source and toxicity of /f_ish oil and many people can't deal with the /f_ishy odor. If you purchase /f_ish oil capsules, buy them only from a reputable health store that can also give you some information about the source of the oil and ongoing testing carried out by some sort of certi/f_ied/registered body to determine that the oil is toxin-free. However, a pristine /f_ish oil Notes: with hardly any /f_ishy odor or taste was tolerated well by even a pregnant reader with colitis - as you know, pregnancy o/f_ten increases nausea and intolerance. Nordic Naturals is an excellent brand of /f_ish oil that tests to ensure purity and is available in many health stores. Another way to get your Omega-/threeoldstyles is by eating canned or fresh sardines, herring, mackerel or wild salmon, two or three times per week. Cold- pressed Flax seed oil also contains Omega-/threeoldstyles and hemp seed oil contains both Omega-/threeoldstyle and Omega-/sixoldstyle essential fatty acids. /T_he only restriction is that you can't heat these oils, they must be ingested cold - either swallowed straight or as salad dressings, over grilled vegetables (a/f_ter you've taken them o the grill), drizzled over cooked /f_ish, etc. Flax seed oil has a fairly mild, benign taste and hemp seed oil has a more intense, nuttier /f_lavor. You need approximately a tablespoon per day to equal the fatty acids of two /f_ish oil capsules. Your local organic grocer probably carries some salad dressings using these oils and you should also be able to get the /f_lax seed oil in capsule form if you prefer. Flora manufactures an excellent blend of these oils along with vitamin E, evening primrose oil and numerous other bene/f_icial cold-pressed oils called Udo's Choice Ultimate Oil Blend that I highly recommend (available in capsule or liquid form in most health stores). Some health professionals maintain that if you have active in/f_lammation or bleeding, you should not ingest Omega-/sixoldstyle (only Omega-/threeoldstyle) and that /f_ish is a much more bioavailable source than /f_lax. Personally, I've been very successful using /f_lax oil and Udo's Oil (which contains Omega-/sixoldstyle) as an /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT anti-in/f_lammatory and hundreds of readers have con/f_irmed this. However, as information and knowledge improves, so can treatment methods. If you've researched this topic and wish to avoid Omega-/sixoldstyle oils during active in/f_lammation, by all means do so. And if you are equally happy ingesting /f_ish oil supplements, then please go ahead - they can only bene/f_it you. You can always begin using /f_lax and Udo's Oil once your body is more balanced and your in/f_lammation is resolved, if you wish. My personal view on this whole topic is that if you regularly eat the Notes: suggested /f_ish, and use hemp oil, /f_lax oil, or Udo's Choice oil either mixed in with your food or as a daily supplement, you'll be just /f_ine for ongoing health. For healing active in/f_lammation and ulceration, you'll need to ingest higher amounts of essential fatty acids and may wish to ingest /f_ish oil rather than /f_lax. You may also wish to avoid any oils containing Omega-/sixoldstyle (like hemp seed oil, sun/f_lower oil, or Udo's Oil). You can safely consume up to eight tablespoons per day of Udo's or /f_lax oil. Depending on your level of health (liver function, antioxidant capability, etc.) you'll be able to consume more or less of these oils. Take as much as you can according to your particular tolerance level - even the smallest amount is better than none. A lot of the foods and spices recommended in /T_he Healing Diets are also natural anti-in/f_lammatories, as is the aloe vera juice. Here's a recipe for a delicious salad dressing for regular, daily use, that will give you your Omega /threeoldstyle, /sixoldstyle and /nineoldstyle essential fatty acids. However, all the oils must be certi/f_ied organic cold-pressed oils (Omega/f_lo and Spectrum Naturals are both good brands): Jini's EFA Salad Dressing \u00bc cup sun/f_lower oil (if you can't get it cold-pressed, then use cold- pressed sesame oil) \u00bc cup extra virgin olive oil \u00bc cup hemp seed or /f_lax seed oil \u00bd cup Bragg's Aminos (non-fermented soy sauce substitute) or soy sauce (organic, no wheat, no sugar) /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS \u00bc cup fresh organic lemon juice (leave this out if you're supposed to avoid citrus) /one.oldstyle tablespoon sesame seeds (no seeds if you have diverticulosis) \u00bd teaspoon ground ginger If you want to make up a sample of this dressing /f_irst, then just use /oneoldstyle tablespoon for the oils and lemon juice with /twooldstyle tablespoons of Bragg's or soy sauce. /T_his dressing also tastes great on cooled, steamed spinach or seaweed. N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) Consists of an amino sugar that is normally formed in our bodies from glucose. It is the starting point for the synthesis of many important molecules of which tissues are composed. NAG is bound with other molecules to produce glycomsaminoglycans which are then attached to oligosaccharide chains to produce proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are part of several tissues including cartilage, ligaments, mucous membranes, skin and tendons. /T_herefore, NAG is particularly bene/f_icial in restoring and healing the intestinal mucosa. You can take up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle capsules per day (/fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg each) but six per day is sucient. If you have diarrhea, then you need to empty the capsules, as they may not have enough time to dissolve properly due to a rapid transit time through the gastrointestinal tract. Break open the capsules and mix the powder with water, it tastes like powdered sugar. I /f_ind it easiest to shake the powder from the capsule directly into my mouth, then take a sip of water, swish it around and swallow. In order for the NAG to go directly to your intestinal lining you need to take the capsules on an empty stomach (\u00bd hour before a meal, or /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter a meal depending on what you've eaten). It's best to take one capsule at a time, for example, /oneoldstyle capsule /fouroldstyle - /sixoldstyle times a day. Like the L-Glutamine (listed below), NAG can also have an anti-diarrhea eect, although far less than L-Glutamine. It's an excellent therapy and I know of one person who was able to get himself o Prednisone using NAG supplementation. If you're taking MucosaHeal, then you don't need to supplement separately with NAG as MucosaHeal contains NAG already. CHAPTER 2 Notes: /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Jini's Healing Implant Enema /T_his enema mixture is excellent for wound healing if you're experiencing bleeding primarily from your colon, and it works very quickly. It will stop your bleeding the fastest of any remedy listed. It can even stop severe, steady hemorrhaging in as little as two applications. Once you've got your hemorrhaging stopped, you can then do Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema to further prevent recurrence (see Probiotic Supplementation section below). Because Jini's Healing Implant Enema is an implant enema (rather than a cleansing enema), the goal is to keep the enema mixture inside your colon for as long as possible. /T_herefore, you'll have best results if you administer it /f_irst thing in the morning (a/f_ter your morning bowel movement) or last thing at night, or whenever your bowel is likely to be the most clear of stool. You can buy disposable enema kits from any medical supply shop (or your naturopath/doctor may have some in-house). /T_he disposable kits have a much smaller nozzle than the regular, re-usable ones, so they're more comfortable and don't aggravate your rectum as much. /T_he disposable kits can also be used more than once if you rinse thoroughly with hot water and clean the tip well. If you have diculty /f_inding the powdered herbs, you can order them from LTYG Holistic Health Shoppe Elm (inner bark) powder, mixed in \u00bd litre (/twooldstyle cups) of /f_iltered or spring water. If you /f_ind you can't retain two cups of liquid, then you can cut the water to only one cup, until you can tolerate, or retain, two cups of water. An herb pharmacy should have all the ingredients, but they must be in powder form. /T_he powders mix best if you put the whole mixture in a blender and whip it for /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle seconds. If you don't have a blender then just mix them as best you can in the water by using a whisk, or squashing the lumps with a spoon. Heat the mixture on the stove until it reaches body temperature or, if you're whipping it in the blender, just use hot water. When the mixture is body temperature, or about the temperature of milk in a baby's bottle, pour it into the enema bag. You'll probably need someone to assist you in administering the enema, at least for the /f_irst few times. /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Using the clamp on the enema tube stops the /f_low of liquid, as does holding the end of the tube higher than the bag. So let the mixture /f_low down almost to the end of the tube and then clamp it about a foot and a half from the end to shut o the /f_low. You want the mixture right at the end of the tube so that when you insert it and release the /f_low into your colon you don't get a lot of air going in as well. You may /f_ind it easy to insert the tube into your anus, but I'm going to give you instructions that will make it as easy as possible for even the most sensitive of rectums. Notes: Start by rinsing a washcloth in hot water, wring it out, then press it against your perianal area. /T_he heat and moisture will cause the tissue to so/f_ten up. Next, use your /f_ingers to apply vitamin E oil (available in capsules, just puncture the end with a needle and squeeze out the oil) or a Comfrey salve all round and inside your anus. Also apply it to the tip of the enema tube and about /twooldstyle inches along the length. You can use KY jelly instead, but I prefer the vitamin E oil or Comfrey salve as they're also excellent wound healers that will prevent or help to heal any anal/rectal /f_issures. Lying on your right side, insert the enema tube gently into your rectum (about /threeoldstyle inches should be sucient) and then have your assistant slowly release the clamp, allowing the mixture to /f_low in at a comfortable rate. You may have to keep the /f_low quite slow for the /f_irst few times and stop it every now and again before you're able to continue. But as you get used to the enemas you'll be able to accept the liquid faster. When all the mixture has gone in, re-clamp the tube and withdraw the tip from your rectum. Here are some tips that will really improve the ease and ecacy of the implant enema: /oneoldstyle. Lie down on your right side with one or two pillows (covered with a \u0003 towel) under your bum/hips. Having your bum raised up enables you \u0003 to use gravity to assist the flow of the enema mixture into your colon. \u0003 Lying on your right side draws the liquid into the rest of your colon, \u0003 reducing the pressure on your rectal canal. /twooldstyle. Be sure to breathe deeply and relax your abdomen throughout (fear or \u0003 apprehension causes us to tense up). Visualize the mixture flowing in \u0003 /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT around the whole length of your colon, imagine your colon welcoming it and helping it along. /threeoldstyle. After the mixture is inside your colon and you've withdrawn the enema tube, begin gently massaging the mixture around in your colon so it gets into all the folds and ridges of the intestinal wall. However, be sure to massage and stroke in a counter-clockwise direction; up the left side (descending colon), across the top (transverse colon) from left to right, and down the right side (ascending colon) towards the ileocecal valve Notes: and the small intestine. This is the reverse order of the Colonic Massage technique outlined in Chapter Six, because you don't want to cause a bowel movement, you want to prevent one, by massaging away from the rectum, not towards it. /fouroldstyle. The point of an implant enema is to hold the mixture inside your colon for as long as possible - ideally until all the liquid has been absorbed. Therefore, it's best if you can stay lying down with your bum raised on the pillows for as long as possible. You may also want to lie first on your right side for half an hour, then on your back for half an hour, then on your left side for half an hour, allowing the mixture to saturate the different parts of your colon. /T_he /f_irst time I tried this enema, I was able to hold it in for one hour, the next time, an hour and a half. By the fourth time, I could hold it till all the liquid was absorbed and then didn't have a bowel movement until three hours later. If you're bleeding from your colon, it's best if you can do this enema once (or even twice) a day. Once the bleeding stops, do it every second day for a week, then every third day for another week, then once a week for a month. If you /f_ind your anus/rectum getting sore from the tube then you may want to discontinue or administer it less. As long as your bleeding's stopped, Jini's Healing Implant Enema is no longer crucial and you can move onto other colonic healing remedies like MucosaHeal or George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice, if you wish. Again, it's your body; do what you feel is best. /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 I know there's been a fair amount of controversy in the popular media regarding Comfrey being harmful to the liver. With all due respect, this appears to me to be another example of a pharmaceutical/medical-backed hysteria over a product that's shown itself to be very safe over thousands of years of use. Why isn't the media trumpeting the /sevenoldstyle,/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle deaths in the U.S. from Aspirin every year and demanding its use be discontinued? Always look for the /f_inancial motivation. I have consulted several respected naturopaths and herbalists and the consensus is that Comfrey taken internally in this manner is safe as long as it's not continued long-term. /T_herefore, don't use Jini's Healing Implant Enema for longer than six months at a time. You can use it for six months, take a break of a month or two to allow your liver to cleanse and then you can resume usage. Obviously, it's highly unlikely that anyone is going to administer daily enemas for six months continuously anyway! However, if you still have reservations about using the Comfrey powder, you can replace it with /oneoldstyle tsp. Plantain powder and /oneoldstyle tsp. Calendula powder - it will still be eective, but it will take quite a bit longer to heal your colon. MucosaHeal If your bleeding or in/f_lammation is primarily in your stomach or small intestine, you should experience particularly good, quick results from using a product called MucosaHeal (available online at www.mucosaheal.com ). /T_he herbs contained in this product will also bene/f_it your colon, but it will probably take a bit longer to see results. Jini's Healing Implant Enema is still your best course of quick healing if bleeding is present primarily in your large intestine. However, MucosaHeal is still an excellent product for overall healing of the mucosal lining of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Follow dosage instructions on the bottle as the dosage varies according to whether you're experiencing active bleeding and in/f_lammation, or not. If you're taking a high dosage of MucosaHeal, then you don't need to supplement separately with NAG (listed above), as there's enough in the MucosaHeal. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the product is only available in capsules, so I like to empty the capsules into diluted apple juice and drink it Notes: /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT that way - the taste isn't great, but it's fairly mild and certainly tolerable. If you have frequent bowel movements, or diarrhea, then you must open the capsules, mix with water or apple juice and drink it down. Don't swallow the capsules as they may not have enough time to dissolve properly before you defecate. Below is a list of the ingredients in MucosaHeal and how each one helps to heal your gut. Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice - reduces muscle spasms, promotes adrenal gland in/f_lammation and /f_ights parasitic infection. Increases number of mucus-secreting cells in intestine which improves the quality of the mucosal lining, lengthens intestinal cell life and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal tract. /T_he fact that the licorice root is deglycyrrhizinated means that there's no risk of increasing your blood pressure (as can happen with regular licorice root). Slippery Elm - good for diarrhea and ulcers when taken internally. Soothes in/f_lamed mucous membranes of the stomach, intestines Marshmallow - soothes and heals mucous membranes, skin and other tissues. Aids the body in expelling excess mucus and /f_luid. N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) - an amino sugar that forms the basis of complex molecular structures that are key parts of the connective tissue and mucous membranes of the body - tendons, ligaments, cartilage, bone matrix, skin, synovial (joint) /f_luid, and intestinal lining. To maintain healthy absorption and digestion of food, the body needs a healthy mucosal lining to lubricate and protect the digestive tract. To keep this lining healthy the body uses the natural amino acids and sugars L-Glutamine and N-Acetyl Glucosamine. It is also an immune system modulator with anti - tumor properties. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies: I have used Natren probiotics, CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle, Udo's Oil, Vera Juice, and pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given Natren probiotics to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers and they have also ingested George's Aloe Vera, CoQ/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle, and Udo's Oil periodically /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 from one year onwards. I used FissureHeal suppositories on my daughter at six months of age, for a few days. A reader in Canada went on the IBD Remission Diet whilst pregnant rather than use Prednisone during a /f_lare and she also added raw vegetable juices to the diet (we thought it would be good for the fetus to receive phytochemicals and other key vegetable nutrients if she could tolerate it - she could). Her baby was born healthy and has developed well with no complications. Herbal literature states that MucosaHeal and Jini's Healing Implant Enema should be safe to use whilst pregnant/breastfeeding, or with babies/toddlers. Wild Oregano Oil is contraindicated (i.e. do not use) for pregnant or breastfeeding women, and see the Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section below for more information on its use with babies/children.

For a long-term cure, you'll have to look at the factors that may be causing this condition. Most likely culprits are a food allergy, drug reaction or 'side eect', or allergy to bowel microorganisms. Ralph Golan, MD, addresses this last factor in his book Optimal Wellness : \"To make matters worse, you can become allergic to bowel microor - ganisms. In bombarding these bacteria with antibodies, your immune system can mistakenly attack your own healthy tissues and produce chronic illness in many systems of the body. Intestinal bacteria - Proteus mirabilis , for example, an organism recently implicated in rheumatoid arthritis - share some antigenic determinants with the body. /T_his means that certain aspects of the proteus cell wall resemble aspects of the synovial membrane of our joints. If conditions in the intestine cause proteus to overgrow, overwhelm secretory IgA defenses, and invade the intestinal wall, the antibodies attempting to attack it will inadvertently attack the joints as well. /T_he same kind of link has been made between another bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae) and alkylosing spondylitis, a severe form of arthritis aecting the spine. /T_here have also been reports of intestinal bacteria actually translocat - ing to joints and causing arthritis.\" /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson If conditions in the intestine cause proteus to overgrow, overwhelm secretory IgA defenses, and invade the intestinal wall, the antibodies attempting to attack it will inadvertently attack the joints as well. Ralph Golan, MD LISTEN TO YOUR GUT If you suspect an allergy of this sort, you should see good results from probiotic supplementation. Probiotics (good/friendly bacteria) will inhibit or eliminate pathogenic bowel microorganisms and also improve the mucosal lining, thereby preventing or eliminating leakage of allergens into the bloodstream. If you suspect a food allergy, the best way to identify food allergies is by performing a food clearance (going on the elemental diet, for example) for a week and then introducing foods one at a time to check for signs of food intolerance. See Chapter /T_hree for more information on testing and food reintroduction. Following is an email I received from a reader that I want to include because she addresses not only joint swelling, but also in/f_lammation in the eyes. /T_he best natural remedy I've tried, speci/f_ically for the eyes, (other than the holistic anti-in/f_lammatories listed in this program) is Euphrasia eye drops. /T_hese are a homeopathic remedy and o/f_ten used for hay-fever related eye problems, or for when eyes are sore or damaged, resulting from accident or injury. Euphrasia eye drops are widely available in health stores. If you think you might be experiencing in/f_lammation in your eyes as well as your joints, then this reader's email gives a good outline of what to watch out for: \"I also need to thank you for saving my life! My \"Crohns\" attacked my eyes & several of my joints. I was at the point with my eyes that I was running out of time with my prednisone eye-drops (if you take them for too long they cause serious damage) and my collection of Doctors (I had seven all together - from an Internal Medicine Doc to an Ophthalmologist - one specialist for each \"hot spot\") all wanted me to start taking the \"new\" immune suppressants - they were really exited about them. Well, I'm lucky enough to come from an alternative health family, and there was no way I would accept the gastroenterologists' Curse that I would be, \"Taking this medication all my life, and would probably spend time in the hospital periodically, and most likely require surgery sometime down the road. /T_his is where you saved my life - your books gave me the tools I needed to start healing .

P.S. I was wondering why you didn't talk about the eye side eects in your books. Are they that uncommon? Mine got better as my gut got better, but I wondered if you knew of any therapies speci/f_ically for the eyes? I used the standard herbal & supplemental therapies for in/f_lammation - and this helped me through until my gut healed enough to stop making me swell up. I also think it's important for people with IBD to know that their eyes may be aected. I thought my painful, swollen eyes were due to some kind of allergy. My eye-doctor said that if I had waited a day or two longer my eyes would have been permanently damaged, as it is, some of my Iris cells in one eye tore-o onto my lens, slightly impairing my vision in that eye. Please help get the word out that any feeling of pressure, sensitivity to light, swelling, or redness that may occur should be checked out when you are having an in/f_lammatory response in other parts of your body.\" Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies Guidance: I have used Natren probiotics and acupuncture whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given Natren probiotics to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers and my infant son had a 'no-needle' acupuncture treatment.

As you can imagine, at /fiveoldstyle'/sevenoldstyle\" and only /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/twooldstyle pounds, I was a pretty sorry sight. I knew I needed help, so I called my mum up and asked her if she could /f_ly over and cook for me for a couple of weeks, to help me gain some weight - she arrived the next day. /T_he next thing I did was go to see my doctor who ordered a comprehensive battery of stool and blood tests. I'd recently come back from Florida and she wanted to make sure I hadn't picked up a parasite. All the test results came back normal (except for my hemoglobin levels which were quite low), so she suggested I focus on gaining weight and increasing my hemoglobin. She then recommended a common pharmacy-stocked liquid weight gain/ meal replacement product. I asked my mum to pick up this liquid supplement and a few of the other mass-marketed weight gain and liquid meal replacement products the pharmacy stocked so I could take a look at them. Unfortunately, whilst they provide calories, the nutritional make-up of these products is far from ideal. Most of the calories are supplied by sugar and oil and some products even contain the same amount of oil as they /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT do protein - which is not a good ratio! In addition, many of the products also contain carrageenan (a seaweed derivative used as a thickening agent). Sugar is a proven depressant of the immune system and large amounts of carrageenan, in repeated trials, have been used to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates. Granted, extremely high doses of carrageenan were used to induce the colitis, but until further studies are done I prefer to err on the side of caution. In addition, most people with digestive sensitivities will /f_ind it hard, if not impossible, to tolerate the amount and Notes: type of oil in these products. /T_he result will be severe gas, cramping and diarrhea. And what kind of weight are you going to gain from consuming mostly oil and sugar anyway? True, solid and healthy weight gain should put meat/muscle on your bones, not fat. /T_he second time I needed to gain weight was following a bout of severe hemorrhaging, that le/f_t me weighing only /nineoldstyle/nineoldstyle pounds. /T_he malnutrition combined with the traumatic blood loss and ulceration of my colon required that I go on an elemental diet and consume only liquid, pre - digested food to regain my weight and health. You can read the complete story of this episode and how I came to formulate my own elemental shake product (Absorb Plus) as a result, in the Bowel Rest Elemental Diet section in Chapter /T_hree. Again, I had to formulate my own product since the hospital/pharmaceutical elemental diet products available all had the same drawbacks as the meal replacement formulas above; toxic ingredients, way too much oil and sugar, and most had quite low quality and/or allergenic protein sources as well. Two Ways To Gain Weight /T_here are two main ways to gain weight when you have IBS or IBD. Suprisingly, the fastest way to gain weight is to stop eating regular food altogether and go on a strictly elemental (pre-digested) diet using liquid shakes. /T_his is because it's much easier and simpler to drink /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle calories per day, than to eat it. Also, people with IBS/IBD tend to be intolerant of many foods, which also makes it hard to eat enough food each day to gain weight. /T_he third complication is that even if you consume /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 calories of food per day, if your digestive system is compromised or malfunctioning, you may actually absorb and utilize only half the calories you chew and swallow. All of these problems are resolved by forgoing regular food altogether and going on a pre-digested, elemental diet - where everything you drink goes pretty much instantly into your bloodstream. Pharmaceutical, elemental diet products do not typically help people gain weight, for the reasons listed above. If you try and consume large amounts of low quality, toxic food, even though it's pre-digested, you won't be able to tolerate it and your body will not make much use of it. Even when these Suprisingly, the fastest way products are pumped directly into the stomach (via a shunt) people don't to gain weight is to stop eating gain much weight on them. However, when you ingest a high quality, /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle regular food altogether and go on natural elemental diet product, your body is happy to absorb and utilize a strictly elemental (pre-digested) all the nutrients and calories ingested and weight gain is quite rapid. I used diet using liquid shakes. Absorb Plus (the product I formulated, available at www.absorbplus.com ) \u0003 to gain /threeoldstyle/sixoldstyle pounds of solid muscle in only seven weeks. I combined its use \u0003 with healing broths and targeted supplements that also assisted weight \u0003 gain and rapidly healed my ulceration and restored a healthy bacterial \u0003 /f_lora to my entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract. You can read lots more about \u0003 how I did this in my book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet (available at www. IBDremissionDiet.com , and you can read Chapter One for free online). I also \u0003 talk more about this in the Bowel Rest Elemental Diet section in Chapter \u0003 /T_hree of this book. /T_he second way to gain weight is to consume an easily digested liquid food \u0003 shake in conjunction with your regular diet. Depending on the amount of \u0003 weight you want to gain, you can drink /oneoldstyle - /threeoldstyle shakes per day in addition to \u0003 your regular food intake. If your digestion is quite compromised and you \u0003 suspect you're having diculty absorbing nutrients, then you should drink \u0003 Absorb Plus ( www.absorbplus.com ) in addition to your food. \u0003 If your digestive and absorptive abilities are functioning fairly well, then \u0003 you can use a whey protein isolate supplement (or vegetable protein) \u0003 combined with your choice of liquid (rice milk, yoghurt, water), \u0003 /oneoldstyle tsp. - /oneoldstyle tbsp. of /f_lax oil (adjust oil according to tolerance) and your choice \u0003 of fruit (a \u0003 /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT It's best if you can add the /f_lax oil because the oil is quite high in calories (/oneoldstyle tbsp = /oneoldstyle/twooldstyle/zerooldstyle calories) and the omega-/threeoldstyle fatty acids are natural anti - in/f_lammatories. You can use protein shakes in conjunction with any of /T_he Healing Diets in Chapter /T_hree. Cold-extracted whey protein isolate is the best form of protein in terms of bioavailability and uptake into the bloodstream. Be sure to use a whey protein that does not contain any casein, as casein is the protein in milk that most people with a milk allergy are allergic to. Also make sure the whey protein you choose is lactose-free. Notes: Many people with IBS and IBD that are intolerant or allergic to milk or dairy products are able to consume whey protein isolate with no problems if it contains no casein or lactose. If you can't tolerate whey protein, then try rice or hemp protein - but your weight gain will take longer since vegetable protein is not as bioavailable as whey isolate. See Soy Products in Chapter /T_hree for why you should not use soy protein or soy milk. Make sure the product is not sweetened with Aspartame, and the /f_lavor should be from natural sources. At the time of writing, Proteins+ by ehn company (available in most health stores) is an excellent quality whey protein. For myself, even though my digestion is great, I still use Absorb Plus (even though it's more expensive than mixing protein shakes with fruit) because it's simpler to mix, tastes good and it also contains a healing, free-form amino acid blend, /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg of L-Glutamine per serving, and an extensive vitamin/mineral panel (including trace minerals). I have my Absorb Plus shake (blended with water and /oneoldstyle tbsp. of Udo's oil) for breakfast along with any extra supplements I want to take blended into the shake as well. Keep track of the number of calories you're consuming each day and aim for around /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /fouroldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle per day (more or less depending on your size). It takes /threeoldstyle/sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle calories to create one pound of body weight. If you're not getting enough calories from your regular food, then use the liquid shake supplement to bring your total consumption up to your target each day. Listen to your body, begin slowly and give yourself a week or two to build gradually up to your ideal calorie count. Protein is a key element in tissue repair and weight gain, so make sure you're getting enough. Ideally, you want /fouroldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of your daily calories coming from protein. Normally, a good /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 maintenance ratio for an active person is one gram of protein per day for every one kilogram (/twooldstyle./twooldstyle pounds) of body weight. However, if you're trying to gain weight, you can supplement with up to /threeoldstyle grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. For example, if you weigh /oneoldstyle/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle pounds, your maintenance protein intake would be /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle grams/day. To gain weight, you could ingest up to /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle grams of protein/day. Weight Training /T_hese supplements will work best if you begin a weight training regimen at the same time. Don't worry if you're at a very low weight and don't have any energy - just start with /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes of weight training per session. Or while you're doing your weight routine, rest for /f_ive minutes between each set. Take it slowly and honor your body at all times. Your body will gain muscle much more rapidly if you create a demand for that muscle. If you're just sitting around, not doing much of anything, why would your body need to gain weight? You need to exercise the following muscle groups to get a good, full body workout and to create the demand for your body to gain healthy, solid weight: Biceps (the bulging muscle on the upper front part of your arm) Triceps (the opposing smaller muscle on the upper back part of your arm) Quadriceps (also known as the thigh muscle) Hamstrings (the back of the thigh) Calves Abdominals (working these will also strengthen your lower back) If you're not familiar with weight training, just take this list of muscle groups to an instructor at your gym and have them show you the machines or free weights you can use to exercise each one. Do two sets of each exercise, with /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle repetitions of the exercise per set. I like to do just one set of each muscle group and then do the whole circuit again a second time. For example, rather than doing two sets of bicep curls in a row, I'll do: Notes: /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle bicep curls one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle tricep extensions one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle leg extensions (quadriceps) one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle leg presses (also quads) one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle hamstring curls one set of /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle calf raises one set of /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle crunches (abdominals). I'll then start all over again at the beginning of that sequence and do the second set of each exercise. /T_his gives each muscle group a chance to rest while you're working the other muscles. To establish the amount of weight you should li/f_t with each exercise, experiment until you /f_ind the amount of weight that makes it really hard to complete the tenth repetition of the exercise. /T_his indicates the right threshold for your body. When it becomes easy to perform the tenth repetition, you need to increase the threshold. You can do this by either increasing the number of repetitions (up to /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle repetitions per set), or by leaving the reps the same and increasing the amount of weight you're li/f_ting. Increasing the repetitions of each exercise will result in lean, streamlined muscles. Increasing the weight li/f_ted per exercise will result in bigger, bulkier muscle, so do whichever meets your personal goals or preference for your body. Work your whole body every other day, or twice a week, whichever you can manage. You need to have a day's rest between sessions to allow your body to build the new muscle tissue; working the same muscles every day would defeat the purpose. Also, make sure you stretch your muscles thoroughly a/f_ter each weight training session for at least /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle to /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes. Stretching prevents pooling of lactic acid, which can make you feel sluggish and result in muscle pain. Controlled trials have also shown that stretching a/f_ter a workout results in increased strength. Stretching or yoga is wonderful for improving circulation, blood /f_low and toxin /f_lushing. Again, if you don't know any stretches, ask an instructor at the gym to show you a simple routine. Many /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 gyms have posters with all the stretches illustrated so you can follow the /f_igures each time in case you forget between workouts. Sometimes I'll stretch out certain muscles between exercises and then at the end of both sets I like to do about /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes of continuous stretching. Again, when you're /f_irst beginning, start out really slowly and if all you can do is a few of the exercises, then that's great! You may also want to proceed slowly with the abdominal exercises as your tummy area is likely to be quite tender - just start with /threeoldstyle - /fiveoldstyle crunches to begin with and increase as Your body will gain muscle it feels comfortable. Putting in the eort to learn weight training will pay much more rapidly if you create a dividends for the rest of your life. It's an ideal form of exercise that can demand for that muscle. If you're be used whether you're healthy, ill, pregnant, injured or elderly - again, because weight training increases bone density, it's a particularly ideal just sitting around, not doing much workout for people aged /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle and older, or those at risk of osteoporosis. of anything, why would your body need to gain weight? If you're not inclined to join a gym, devise an exercise routine for yourself at home. Use simple weight-bearing exercises like squats, push-ups (start with wall push-ups if you're not strong enough), crunches, leg extensions etc. Go to a /f_itness supply store and just buy one /fiveoldstyle-pound or /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle-pound free weight to use for bicep curls at home. Any /f_itness magazine or book will have exercise routines and detailed descriptions of individual exercises along with their proper form that you can learn from. To get the maximum mileage out of your protein shake, take it half an hour to an hour before or a/f_ter your workout. Weight training has the added bene/f_it of stimulating your appetite, which will help you gain weight faster as well. Arrange your schedule so that you can eat a big, delicious meal immediately following your weight training session. Having had to both lose and gain weight in my life, I will say that I've found it just as hard to gain weight as to lose it. So don't get discouraged if it takes you a while to gain those desired pounds. Focus on stimulating and increasing your appetite for fresh food, take a good quality protein shake (as discussed above), go to the gym for weight training at least twice a week and let your body take care of the rest. You will gain the weight, slowly but surely. Don't weigh yourself more than once a week or you'll end up /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT obsessing over your weight, which won't help you. /T_he better you feel about yourself and the more positivity you can maintain, the more weight you'll gain. If your weight is really low and you want to gain weight as quickly as possible, then see the Bowel Rest Elemental Diet section in Chapter /T_hree. Remember that going on a completely liquid diet, consisting of all the essential nutrients in a pre-digested form, is actually the quickest way to gain weight. A quick note to those of you who are trying to /lsc/osc/ssc/esc weight due to steroids or for some other reason: Follow the same workout regimen outlined above, but, instead of doing high weights with low reps, go for low weights with high repetitions. Reduce your weights to /threeoldstyle - /fiveoldstyle pounds for your arms and /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle pounds for your legs and try to do two sets of around /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle rapid (but controlled) repetitions of each exercise (or as many as you can manage). Do abdominal exercises, like crunches, between each exercise - don't bother counting them, just do as many as you can and then go on to the next machine/exercise. You'll /f_ind that following this regimen turns your weight training into a cardiovascular routine which will also help you to lose weight. Doing low weights with a high number of repetitions creates lean, streamlined muscles which are smaller and thinner but with a high capacity for endurance. /T_he cardiovascular component of the regimen along with the added muscle /f_ibre will burn up fat much more quickly than if you just did aerobics or went jogging. Don't forget to stretch all your muscles for at least /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle minutes at the end of your session. M/o.sc/u.sc/t.sc/h.sc U/l.sc/c.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc Mouth ulcers, like lip canker sores and herpes, are most likely viral in \u0003 origin. /T_herefore, the quickest, most eective way to heal mouth ulcers is by \u0003 eliminating the infectious agent that's causing them. \u0003 Wild Oregano Oil /T_he best way to eliminate infectious agents is by using Wild Oregano Oil. \u0003 Wild Oregano Oil is the /msc/osc/ssc/tsc potent antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, \u0003/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 antiparasitic (anti-everything it seems!) that I have come across in /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle years of searching and testing natural medicines. I am very enthusiastic about this herb and once you've used it, you'll know exactly why. Wild Oregano Oil can be unpleasant to use because it creates a very strong heat sensation whenever it's applied to mucous membranes (nose, mouth, genitals, etc.) - it's like a very hot chili pepper, but unlike a chili pepper the heat sensation completely disappears a/f_ter about two minutes. /T_he results are so fast and eective though, that it's worth persevering through the heat sensation (and this from someone who's allergic to chilies and never eats them!). Notes: Take a sip of water, hold it in your mouth and add /f_ive drops of Wild Oregano Oil to the water. Swish the oil and water mixture around your mouth (especially where your ulcers are) for as long as you can tolerate it. /T_hen swallow. If you can, leave the residue in your mouth for as long as possible (the heat sensation will last about two minutes), but if you can't tolerate the heat sensation, then drink water till it subsides. Alternately, if you prefer, you can put a drop of Wild Oregano Oil onto your /f_inger and apply it directly to each mouth ulcer, massage it in and leave it as long as you can (intense heat sensation will last about /twooldstyle- /threeoldstyle minutes). /T_he longer you can leave the Wild Oregano Oil in your mouth, the more eective it will be at healing your ulcers. You should see results/partial healing a/f_ter only one application of Wild Oregano Oil. Continue with treatment until mouth ulcers are completely gone (usually /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle applications). My elderly Aunt was visiting me one winter and she had not been able to eat properly for months due to ongoing mouth ulcers. Her son and his wife are both pharmacists and so had given her every drug remedy under the sun, and nothing had provided any relief or healing. She was quite wary of trying the Wild Oregano Oil rinse since she'd recently had surgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia and was scared of anything that might somehow re-trigger the pain. However, upon my repeated assurances and encouragement to listen to her own gut, she tried a half dose (two drops) of the Wild Oregano Oil before bed and didn't swallow it either. She couldn't believe the improvement when she woke up the next morning (more than /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle healed) and insisted we immediately go out and buy a bottle of Wild /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT The quickest, most eective way to heal mouth ulcers is by eliminating the infectious agent that's causing them. Oregano Oil for her to take back to London! Needless to say, she's used it ever since, and being able to chew and eat properly again has changed her life. Become tuned to your body and you'll probably notice that prior to mouth ulcers erupting, your tongue, gums and lining of your mouth become quite tender and sore. Your taste buds may even change with the result that nothing tastes the way it should. When you notice these warning signs, immediately gargle/rinse your mouth with Wild Oregano Oil (as instructed above) and you'll probably avoid an outbreak altogether. DGL (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Extract) Chewable Tablets /T_his is the second most eective remedy available for soothing and healing mouth ulcers (a/f_ter Wild Oregano Oil). Licorice extract has both anti - in/f_lammatory and anti-viral properties. Unfortunately, you have to like licorice to be able to take these. Don't get the ones /f_lavored with peppermint as that will aggravate heartburn. Just suck on one tablet at a time (take as o/f_ten as you need to) and hold the juice in your mouth and swirl it around for as long as you can before swallowing the juice. Continue this process until the tablet is completely dissolved. If you like licorice enough to pursue this treatment, you'll get an instant soothing and lessening of pain and the mouth ulcers will heal up a lot faster than usual. If you have mouth and/or throat ulcers, you should also follow the Reduce Diarrhea Diet as it eliminates all tomato-based and acidic foods (which greatly aggravate ulcers) and also go easy on spices, salt and sugar - basically, the blander the better. Licorice has also been dubbed 'nature's steroid', so you may also want to check with your naturopathic doctor about supplementing with the tablets, capsules or liquid tincture as an anti-in/f_lammatory, particularly if you're weaning yourself o Prednisone or Imuran or a similarly potent drug. DGL increases the amount of mucous-secreting cells in the digestive tract. /T_his improves the quality of mucous, lengthens intestinal cell life and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal lining. For these reasons, DGL should work particularly well for those with ulcerative colitis. /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Probiotics Bene/f_icial bacteria can also heal and control future outbreaks of mouth ulcers. Clinical trials show L. acidophilus to be particularly eective. Use Natren Inc.'s Megadophilus powder amd mix \u00bd tsp. with a small amount of water (/twooldstyle- /fouroldstyle ounces). Take a sip and then swish it round your mouth and gums and hold it in your mouth for as long as you can before swallowing. Take another sip and continue in this manner until you've /f_inished the dose. As with all probiotics, take it on an empty stomach. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding/Babies Guidance: I have used Natren probiotics whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given Natren probiotics to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers. I have used Wild Oregano Oil topically with my daughter from /fouroldstyle months of age and very sparingly internally from /oneoldstyle year old. I have used Wild Oregano Oil internally with my son from /threeoldstyle years old. Herbal literature states that DGL should be safe to use whilst pregnant/breastfeeding, whilst regular licorice is not (may elevate blood pressure). Wild Oregano Oil is contraindicated (i.e. do not use) for pregnant or breastfeeding women, however, if you just rinse your mouth and then spit it out without swallowing it, that should be okay - check with your naturopathic physician to be sure.

FissureHeal Suppositories An absolutely fantastic product for healing anal and rectal /f_issures, or hemorrhoids, is an all-natural herbal suppository called FissureHeal. I created FissureHeal suppositories and I've used them myself to heal both minor and severe anal /f_issures and they work very well. I've also heard from readers who've used them to heal /f_issures they've had for /fiveoldstyle - /sixoldstyle years continually and nothing else worked until they tried FissureHeal. A friend of mine who suers from hemorrhoids (as a result of birthing two children) uses them every time her hemorrhoids /f_lare and usually one or two suppositories is all she needs. /T_he suppositories are very thin - as thin as a regular-sized drinking straw - so no matter how sore your anus/rectum is, they will insert easily. /T_hey've also made them extra long (/twooldstyle\") so they can reach a /f_issure even high up in your rectal canal - or you can break them o at the length you need. /T_hey contain Comfrey Root, Slippery Elm, Marshmallow Root and Cocoa Butter, so the ingredients are very eective and healing.

Of course, they're also available at the LTYG Holistic Health Shoppe (www.LTYGshoppe.com) . Insert them at night - or whenever you're likely to have your longest stretch without a bowel movement - so your anus/rectum has the maximum amount of time to heal undisturbed. Fresh Aloe Vera Alternatively, you may want to consider getting an Aloe vera plant to use for rectal suppositories. Cut o a piece of the leaf, then cut away the green leaf and inside yellowish layer (bitter and astringent), leaving only the clear inside meat of the plant. Insert this fresh Aloe vera (cut to desired length and width) into your rectum and leave it there until your next bowel /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 movement when it will come out naturally. You may need to wrap the cut Aloe vera in cellophane wrap and freeze it /f_irst to /f_irm it up and make it easier to insert. If you insert this suppository before bed then the Aloe vera has all night (hopefully) to work its healing action. If using the fresh plant doesn't appeal to you, you can always use a pure Aloe vera gel or salve, coat your /f_inger with it and insert it into your rectum. Try to massage the gel or salve into the tissue gently. Re-apply a/f_ter every bowel movement, or as o/f_ten as you can.

Most comfrey salves will contain some or all of these other ingredients as well. Again, coat your /f_inger well with the salve and insert into your rectum, massaging the salve into the tissue.

S/t.sc/r.sc/i.sc/c.sc/t.sc/u.sc/r.sc/e.sc/s.sc Chronic in/f_lammation of the intestinal wall can cause scarring of the intestines. /T_his scar tissue is then not as /f_lexible as healthy tissue and as Notes: the tougher scar tissue builds up, it results in a narrowed, or constricted area in the intestine. /T_hese constricted areas are called strictures. Strictures range from mild to severe, depending on how much they block the contents of the bowel from passing through the narrowed area. You may not even be aware that you have a stricture until it shows up on an x-ray, or, you may experience pain, cramping and bloating from a severe stricture as it obstructs the passage of food. If a stricture becomes so narrow that it completely obstructs the passage of food, then the intestine can rupture as a result. Current surgical procedures for strictures (including removal of the aected section of intestine, or strictuloplasty) do not usually prevent recurrence and in my opinion should be reserved for cases of absolute emergency. Strictures require a multi-pronged approach to treatment as you need to heal the underlying conditions in the body and immune system that are causing in/f_lammation, heal the mucosal lining, heal the intestinal wall, and restore proper bacterial /f_lora throughout the gut to prevent recurrence. I also suspect that some of the drugs used in IBD directly contribute to or cause strictures, because, essentially, any drug that disrupts the bacterial /f_lora of the gut can be considered a direct contributor to strictures. Recent reports have shown that a lack of good bacteria and overgrowth of bad bacteria in the small intestine are associated with strictures: \"A variety of clinical conditions are associated with Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO): ...Small PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 The IBD Remission Diet /T_he fastest method for healing acute strictures and avoiding surgery may be employing the other remedies listed here whilst following the IBD Remission Diet.

My rectum was narrowed to the point where my stool was the width and shape of a /f_lattened pencil. If my stool was ever solid and hard, it would tear the stricture and I would have rectal bleeding. I let this condition go on for years as I had been quite traumatized about anyone inserting anything into my rectum following my initial diagnostic colonoscopy, which was very violent and abusive. Eventually though, I was ready to go the next step in healing this trauma and rectal damage. When I /f_irst started working with Lori on my rectal stricture, I could insert only the tip of my pinkie /f_inger (without causing stress or bleeding) into my rectum. A/f_ter four treatments, Lori could painlessly insert her index /f_inger past the second knuckle (about \u00be inch diameter), with no bleeding or trauma to my rectum. Scar tissue (or a stricture) does not have to be permanently rigid and in/f_lexible. /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 /T_here are eective therapies available for releasing and so/f_tening scar tissue, strictures and other areas of obstruction and restriction. Follow the kinder, gentler methods /f_irst and your body will begin to trust you and respond accordingly. For detailed information on bodywork therapies (including craniosacral) please see Chapter Six. Heal The Mucosal Lining & Intestinal Wall /T_he following supplements are all eective for healing the mucosal lining and the intestinal wall, thus preventing ongoing in/f_lammation scarring: George's 'Always Essential Fatty Acids (EFA), and L-Glutamine. See the section on In/f_lammation, Ulceration & Bleeding for detailed descriptions of each of these supplements. If you're using MucosaHeal, you don't need to take N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) because it's already contained in MucosaHeal. If you're simultaneously on the IBD Remission Diet (elemental diet) then you don't need to take L-Glutamine because you automatically get /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg of L-Glutamine per serving of Absorb Plus. You'll also get your Essential Fatty Acids (EFA) from adding /f_lax oil to your shakes. Essential Fatty Acids, or 'good fats' are also invaluable in so/f_tening scar tissue, so try to ingest Udo's oil, /f_lax, or /f_ish oil daily. Basically, if you're not on the IBD Remission Diet, you should take MucosaHeal ( www.mucosaheal.com ) and at least /oneoldstyle tablespoon of /f_lax oil, and/or /f_ish oil per day. You can also take George's Aloe Vera Juice if you like. Probiotics For a long term healing of strictures and the conditions that create them (such as SIBO), you need to improve the bacterial /f_lora in your gut. Having a healthy gut /f_lora will prevent future infection/in/f_lammation in the intestines and if your intestines are not chronically in/f_lamed, they will not build up scar tissue or thicken. Ingesting good bacteria improves digestion, absorption and elimination of food. Certain strains of bacteria help produce digestive enzymes, peptides, amino acids and B vitamins for your Notes: /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: body's use. /T_hey also inhibit or eliminate pathogenic microorganisms, like yeast, fungus, parasites, and bad bacteria that wound or burrow through the intestinal wall - possibly the beginning of in/f_lammation and ulceration. See the expanded section on Probiotic Supplementation later on in this chapter for more information and details. Again, as I recommended above, you'll have the highest degree of success if you /f_irst follow a natural antibiotic/ antimicrobial treatment (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) to eliminate the infectious microorganisms that are causing in/f_lammation in your intestines, and then ingest high dosages of probiotics to repopulate your gut with good, healthy bacteria. Currently, I only recommend Natren brand probiotics as they are the only company that currently meets standards for quality and ecacy (see Probiotic Supplementation section for quality standards). You need to take the full spectrum of probiotics (L. acidophilus, B. bi/f_idum, L. bulgaricus) in powder form only. Do not take the probiotics in capsule form as you want to reap the bene/f_its of the probiotics beginning in your mouth and esophagus and on down from there. Take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac) mixed together in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature /f_iltered or spring water (no tap water!) /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food), until your stricture is healed. /T_hen take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (or you can now take one capsule once per day if your bowel movements are not loose or watery), /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day for the next three months. If your strictures (or obstructions) commonly occur in your large intestine, then you may want to consider Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema for rapid repopulation of good bacteria in your colon. For details on how to administer Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema and for ongoing probiotic supplementation guidelines, see the section on Probiotic Guidance: Vera Juice, and FissureHeal pregnant and breastfeeding. I have also given Natren probiotics to my kids as babies (give babies /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc Life Start - B. infantis - probiotic) and toddlers and they have also ingested George's Aloe Vera and Udo's Oil periodically from /oneoldstyle year /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 onwards. I used FissureHeal suppositories on my daughter at six months of age, for a few days. A reader in Canada went on the IBD Remission Diet whilst pregnant rather than use Prednisone during a /f_lare and she also added raw vegetable juices to the diet (we thought it would be good for the fetus to receive phytochemicals and other key vegetable nutrients if she could tolerate it). Her baby was born healthy and has developed well with no complications. Herbal literature states that MucosaHeal and Jini's Healing Implant Enema should be safe to use whilst pregnant/breastfeeding, or with babies/toddlers. Wild Oregano Oil is contraindicated (i.e. do not use) for pregnant or breastfeeding women, and see the Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section below for more information on its use with babies/ children. I have also taken both my children for craniosacral therapy from newborn to present - it is an invaluable tool for assisting children to be able to grow and develop unhindered. See my DVD, BABY FART AEROBICS: And Other Natural Treatments for Colicky Babies for an entire section on how/why craniosacral treatments are good for your kids and also to see a live demo on my daughter, Zara antibiotics/antimicrobials treatment (see Natural Antibiotics / Antimicrobials section) and then go on an elemental diet. See Chapter Three, or my book, The IBD Remission Diet (read Chapter One online at: www.caramal.com ) for more information on elemental diets. Whilst on the IBD Remission Diet, supplement with MucosaHeal and George's Aloe Vera juice (you'll automatically be ingesting the rest of the supplements needed to rebuild the intestinal wall by following the IBD Remission Diet). If you don't follow the Diet, then take: MucosaHeal as directed on the bottle, and at least /oneoldstyle tablespoon of flax and/or fish oil per day. You can also take George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera juice, if you wish. /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT If you have a stricture in your rectum, then also follow the instructions in the Rectal Fissures section for using FissureHeal suppositories to speed tissue healing. Take the full spectrum of Natren brand probiotics (L. acidophilus, B. bifidum, L. bulgaricus) in powder form only. Mix /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (Megadophilus, Bifido Factor, Digesta-Lac) in /eightoldstyle ounces of room temperature spring or filtered water (no tap water) and take /threeoldstyle times per day on an empty stomach until stricture is healed. Then take /oneoldstyle tsp. /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day in powder form, or, /oneoldstyle capsule once per day (only if you defecate once or less per day), on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours after food) for the next three months. Do Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema if you have strictures or obstructions in your colon. For ongoing probiotic supplementation, see the Probiotic Supplementation section later in this chapter. Simultaneously begin craniosacral treatments to release and soften scar tissue. You don't even need to know exactly where your strictures are as a good therapist will be able to discern this themselves. Make sure the therapist is certified by the Upledger Institute at Level II or higher. Go to: www.upledger.com to search for a practitioner in your area. See Chapter Six for more details. NATURAL ANTIBIOTICS / ANTIMICROBIALS If your doctor wants to put you on antibiotics or antifungals, for either a gut or secondary infection, there are several natural alternatives you can consider. /T_hese include: Garlic, Olive Leaf Extract, Grapefruit Seed Extract and Wild Oregano Oil. All of these substances also have varying levels of anti-viral, anti-yeast, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic activity. Of these, Wild Oregano Oil and Olive Leaf Extract are the most potent and powerful. /T_he only drawback to Wild Oregano Oil is that it feels very 'hot' (like chili /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 pepper hot) for about /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle minutes a/f_ter you take it orally, therefore, it can be very dicult to use with children. Grapefruit Seed Extract is also quite potent, but I don't recommend you use it if you have any tendency towards diarrhea, as it will exacerbate your condition. It is also extremely bitter and so may be quite dicult to get children to take. If you have no problems with loose stool or diarrhea, then you can take /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle drops in /fiveoldstyle ounces of /f_iltered or spring water /threeoldstyle times per day, on an empty stomach for best results - but it still works okay when Remember to follow all taken with food. For kids under age /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle, take /sixoldstyle drops in /fiveoldstyle ounces of /f_iltered antibiotic use - whether natural or spring water /threeoldstyle times per day. To maximize antibiotic therapy, also or pharmaceutical - with high take Olive Leaf Extract at the same time. And remember to follow with probiotics during and/or at the end of treatment. dose probiotic supplementation. You can also use probiotics Garlic may also cause diarrhea and/or bloating in susceptible individuals, concurrently with antibiotics to the only way is to try it and see. However, I would only use it on mild bacterial infections. For robust infections I don't think it would be strong minimize unpleasant side eects. enough, as \"it exerts an antibacterial eect estimated to be equivalent to /oneoldstyle/percentoldstyle of that of penicillin.\" Garlic is also quite eective against yeast, fungus and viral infections. /T_herefore, it's excellent to consume garlic daily in your food. For therapeutic use, I recommend you use Kyolic from Wakunaga of America in either capsule or oil form - it is one of the most potent garlic products on the market and it is also odorless. Go to their website for lots of scienti/f_ic articles on garlic's properties and abilities: www.kyolic.com . See your naturopathic physician for dosing guidelines for your particular condition. Olive Leaf Extract is probably the most palatable of the remedies listed here. You can get it in powder (capsule) or liquid form. For children the powder can be mixed with applesauce or mashed banana and can also be mixed with an herbal salve and used as a poultice on topical infections. Dr Morton Walker, who wrote the book Nature's Antibiotic: Olive Leaf Extract , writes: \"Seagate\u00ae Olive Leaf Extract oers a /fouroldstyle/fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle mg capsule recommended to \u0003 be taken preventively in a dosage of one or two to four capsules daily. \u0003 For treatment of a microbial illness, the better dosage would be four to \u0003 /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT eight capsules daily for one week, but the daily dose must be spread out throughout the day. When the illness comes under control or disappears, the dosage may be reduced once again to one, two, three, or four capsules per day.\" /eightnumerator In the same article, Dr. Walker also relates the story of a female patient infected with three dierent mycoplasma organisms, she suered from chronic fatigue, /f_ibromyalgia and IBS. She took /twooldstyle pills (of Seagate brand Olive Leaf Extract), /threeoldstyle times a day (following meals) for three and a half Notes: months and then her lab reports came back completely clear of infection. She reported her condition as \"excellent\" and also that she was completely cured of IBS. Dr. Walker recommends you only use Seagate brand since it is a cold-extracted formulation of the whole leaf (not just an oleuropein extract) and therefore more eective than anything else he's tried. See www.seagateproducts.com for more information. Olive Leaf is antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and antiyeast. It is much more palatable than Wild Oregano Oil and so probably the best natural antimicrobial to use for children. Again, remember that anything that is an eective antibacterial needs to be followed with probiotics. If you're taking it long-term, I would also supplement simultaneously with probiotics. Wild Oregano Oil is the antimicrobial that I've had the most experience with. I can con/f_idently state that it is the most eective antimicrobial I've ever seen for topical or acute infections. However, for chronic infections such as Candida albicans (yeast), mycobacteria (bacteria/fungal hybrid), and mycoplasmas (prokaryote bacteria), it's very hard to make any kind of de/f_initive statement on the ecacy of Wild Oregano Oil vs. Olive Leaf Extract. Wild Oregano Oil is relatively new and it does not have the longer history of anecdotal evidence that Olive Leaf Extract has. Having said that, Wild Oregano Oil does have a fair amount of data regarding its ability to kill pathogenic bacteria in the food industry in incredibly minute doses. Unfortunately, I am not able to oer completely de/f_initive instructions on the use of Wild Oregano Oil for people with IBS or IBD at this time. What I can give you is a pretty good idea of what should work, a /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 summary of the research I've done, my personal experience to date, and the feedback I've had from about thirty of my consultation clients who've been experimenting with it. To further the education of all of us on this topic, please visit my blog at www.ListenToYourGut.com where I will post my ongoing feedback/thoughts on Wild Oregano Oil and other natural antimicrobials. Please post your experience with any of the antimicrobials that you try and be as speci/f_ic and give as much detail as possible. If we all pool our knowledge and experience, Typically, an anti-in/f_lammatory over time we'll be able to extrapolate some solid guidelines for IBD and IBS medicine merely controls the usage. Perhaps you'll be able to /f_ind a naturopath in your area who is /f_luent symptoms of the disease - it in the usage of both Wild Oregano Oil and Olive Leaf and he/she could guide you. doesn't cure it. That's because it rarely addresses the true cause of Doug Kaufmann (who has a TV show called 'Know /T_he Cause', which airs the disease. on Sky Angel, inspiration Network and Liberty Channel) and Dr. Dave Doug Kaufmann, Dave Holland, MD Holland, MD have written a book called, /T_he Fungus Link . I /f_irst heard The Fungus Link about Doug Kaufmann when he invited me to be a guest on his TV show. Doug and Dave both recommend Olive Leaf extract (Seagate brand) for treating the underlying infection (bacterial/yeast/fungal) of IBD and IBS. Here is a fascinating excerpt from Chapter /T_hree of their book, /T_he Fungus Link : \"We've seen thus far that, in just about every case of in/f_lammatory \u0003 bowel disease, conventional treatment involves the use of anti - in/f_lammatories. Well, researchers at the Washington University in \u0003 St. Louis took a bold step and did a study where they oered patients \u0003 with Crohn's disease an immune stimulant instead. /T_hey used a \u0003 medicine called Leukine--a naturally-occuring molecule called \u0003 Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF). And though they faced harsh criticism from scientists at other \u0003 universities for doing this, they obtained amazing results: of the initial \u0003 /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle patients in the study, /oneoldstyle/twooldstyle did \"signi/f_icantly\" better overall, while eight \u0003 went into complete remission! Every one of the half a million patients \u0003 with Crohn's disease in America should know about this study. /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT But they shouldn't feel they need to rush in to their doctor's oce to get this expensive shot (it costs around /dollaroldstyle/threeoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle per milliliter--that's /dollaroldstyle/oneoldstyle,/fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle per teaspoon). Rather, they should learn from this study: by giving an immune booster, these doctors were able to put /fiveoldstyle/threeoldstyle percent of the cases into total remission. /T_hat almost implies that an infection is at the root of the disease, and that by assisting the body's immune system the medication helped the body overcome the \"infection,\" or the disease. Typically, an anti-in/f_lammatory medicine merely controls the Notes: symptoms of the disease--it doesn't cure it. /T_hat's because it rarely addresses the true cause of the disease. In other words, if the wrong diet is constantly consumed, or if damage (i.e. yeast overgrowth) is never reversed from previous antibiotic use, a cure can almost never be achieved. In this case, we feel that the \"infection\" in the intestines of Crohn's patients is caused by fungi and their mycotoxins.\" (See Appendix D for the study referenced in this excerpt) As you can see, I'm certainly not the only one asserting that the infectious component of IBD and IBS must be addressed for complete and/or long- term healing to occur. Whether you want to use Olive Leaf Extract or Wild Oregano Oil (or perhaps a combination of the two) to address your infection, only you can decide. If you're interested in /f_inding out exactly which microorganisms you're infected with, you have to use a highly specialized lab to get reliable test results. A regular lab is not skilled enough, nor properly equipped to test for these bacterial/fungal organisms. One of the best labs I've come across is Immunosciences Laboratory in Beverly your doctor (MD or ND) to draw the blood samples needed, /f_ill out the forms, and then courier the samples to Immunosciences Lab. If you need a lab in your own country, contact Immunosciences and see if they can refer you to a reputable lab in your area. /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 WILD OREGANO OIL Most of the scienti/f_ic research on Wild Oregano Oil is currently coming from the Applied Microbiology /f_ield in the area of food preservation. Microbiologists have found that Wild Oregano Oil is so powerful that even minute amounts of it can kill common food-borne pathogens responsible for a lot of the food poisoning incidents with processed food. To give you just one example, scientists in /T_he Netherlands found that Carvacrol (one of the active ingredients of Wild Oregano) at a dilution of only ./twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle mM led to cell death of the bacterial soil organism Bacillus cereus , \"a spore-form - ing food-borne pathogen o/f_ten associated with food products such as meat, vegetables, soup, rice, milk and other dairy products. Between /oneoldstyle and /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of the total number of outbreaks of food infection in the world is caused by B. cereus .\" /T_he scientists summarized their results by saying, \"From this study, it could be concluded that carvacrol interacts with the membranes of B. cereus by /T_he dissipa - tion of ion gradients leads to impairment of essential processes in the cell and /f_inally to cell death.\" /onesuperior What this means for the layperson, is that even very small amounts of the phenolic compounds within Wild Oregano Oil (such as Carvacrol and /T_hymol) can disintegrate the cell walls of pathogenic microorganisms, resulting in their death. My Personal Experience I was /f_irst introduced to Wild Oregano Oil when my daughter developed a severe yeast infection in the folds of her skin at four months of age. Even very small amounts of the phenolic compounds within Wild Oregano Oil (such as Carvacrol and Thymol) can disintegrate the cell walls of pathogenic microorganisms, resulting in their death. /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT I tried every natural substance I knew of to try and heal it and then /f_inally consulted a naturopath who specialized in children. He immediately recognized it as a yeast infection and recommended a dilution of Wild Oregano Oil (diluted with olive oil /oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle:/oneoldstyle). I applied it to her skin and within a day could notice a dierence! Within three days, the lesions (which were several layers deep and weeping) had a complete covering of new healthy skin and within seven days her skin was completely healed and normal. None of us, including my physician father, had ever seen such a quick and Notes: total healing with any substance before - natural or pharmaceutical. We all jumped on this new wonder herb, began researching and reading about it, and started using it for everything that came up. Since that time, over the two years that followed, I and my family members have used Wild Oregano Oil with amazing results on the following conditions: Foot and Mouth Disease (viral) Herpes /twooldstyle (viral) Gum infections Mouth ulcers Flu and chest infection (bacterial and viral) Sore throats As a preventive, before and after plane journeys, or when exposed to someone with a cold or flu Skin infection (fungal) I have also used it myself ongoing for about a year (alternating with probiotics), just /fiveoldstyle drops/day in the morning on an empty stomach, followed by a glass of water. /T_hat year was /f_illed with lots of travel, sleep deprivation and diculty eating proper meals, lots of stress /f_inancially and emotionally, and a crushing work load between my businesses and two young children. And yes, there were a few months where I was de/f_initely using it as a crutch (like a drug) to keep myself going and buy myself some time to look at the root issues in my life that were resulting in such stress and exhaustion. At the time I took it, I had no overt symptoms of any gut disease, I would have /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 been classed as \"in remission\". However, the dierence was still remarkable: No more fuzzy-brain or depression, my memory got much sharper, my energy levels stayed strong and consistent throughout the day (instead of crashing around /fouroldstyle - /fiveoldstyle pm) and I was less irritable and had more patience. All these symptoms are correlated with a compromised gut /f_lora and thus I suspect that even though my health has been quite good, perhaps I have had a low-grade gut infection (yeast, mycobacteria, etc.) for years that has /f_lared up or intensi/f_ied during times of stress. In/f_lammation is usually a Infection & In/f_lammation In The Gut response to infection, or, the /T_herefore, based on my own experience, what I've researched to date, and body's attempt to get rid of the experience of a few of my consultation clients who've experimented with something undesirable. Wild Oregano Oil, I'd like to oer you the following treatment protocol as a starting point for using Wild Oregano to heal gut infection. Please post your resulting experience and experiments at: www.ListenToYourGut.com as the more information we can gather, the better we can make this protocol for all of us. Again, this protocol is based on in/f_lammatory bowel disease being an infectious disease (or having an infectious component). I have already written quite a bit about this in the sections above and I will oer even more evidence of this phenomenon in the Probiotic Supplementation section directly following this section. Regardless of where you stand on this theory, certain facts are inescapable: In/f_lammation is usually a response to infection, or, the body's attempt to get rid of something undesirable. If you get a splinter and it's not removed quickly, the body will launch an in/f_lammatory response to push out the splinter. If you cut yourself and the wound gets infected, the body responds with in/f_lammation; the wound swells up, pus forms and the body seeks to trap the infectious agent, kill it, and push it out of the body. /T_he presence of in/f_lammation in the gut likewise is probably signaling the presence of an undesirable or infectious agent that the body is trying to get rid of. Many gastroenterologists work from the premise that IBD is an auto - immune disease, whereby, for some unknown reason, the body attacks itself, thus causing ulceration, lesions, bleeding, /f_istulas, etc. However, /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT what if the body were actually attacking pathogenic microorganisms that have just not been identi/f_ied yet? /T_here is a relatively new breed of microorganisms that have evolved that are actually bacterial-fungal hybrids called mycobacterium. Another new type of bacteria called mycoplasma can actually enter and reside in the plasma of cells making both detection and elimination quite dicult. In identifying a certain type of mycobacterium called Mycobacterium avium (sub-species paratuberculosis) scientists have found the only reliable test to be one which tests for the DNA of Mycobacterium avium , rather than the physical organism itself. Personally, I suspect there is both an infectious and an auto-immune component to in/f_lammatory bowel disease and you will have the highest degree of success if you treat for both (if you follow the protocols in this program, you will address both components). /T_here are two ways to eliminate infectious microorganisms: Antimicrobial drugs or substances, or high doses of probiotics. /T_his protocol is unique in that it combines the two methods for maximum eectiveness in both eradicating infectious microorganisms, maintaining a healthy bacterial /f_lora during antimicrobial supplementation, and maintaining a healthy gut environment ongoing, for continued long-term health. /T_he following /threeoldstyle-Phase protocol should eliminate infectious microorganisms (like mycobacterium, fungi, bacteria, yeast, viruses, parasites, etc.), provide a moderate level of detoxi/f_ication, and restore bene/f_icial gut /f_lora. By healing the infection we also heal in/f_lammation. Other supplements referred to o/f_ten in this program (such as MucosaHeal, George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice, L-Glutamine, etc.) are then used to heal ulceration, bleeding, and repair the intestinal wall and mucosal lining. Supplementation with probiotics restores a healthy, balanced gut /f_lora to prevent future recurrence. Once you've /f_inished the Protocol outlined here, consult the Probiotic Supplementation section below for guidance on ongoing probiotic maintenance, or, preventive supplementation. If you are infected with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP), which is a sort of hybrid bacteria/fungus, then you may need to repeat this Protocol every /threeoldstyle - /fouroldstyle months for up to two years to completely eradicate these pathogenic /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 microorganisms. MAP has a dormant/active lifecycle that surges again in as little as /threeoldstyle - /fouroldstyle months a/f_ter treatment with aggressive antibiotics and antifungals. Doctors experimenting with eradicating this pathogen have found it takes up to two years to completely eradicate it. See the section on Probiotic Supplementation below for more details on MAP. /T_he dosage of Wild Oregano Oil recommended here in Phase /oneoldstyle is the equivalent of Vancomycin (a potent antibiotic reserved for superbugs). However, depending upon the type of microorganisms and parasites you're If you are infected with MAP , infected with, and how widespread that infection is, your length of time which is a sort of hybrid bacte -on Phase I is going to vary. Again, all of this is still largely experimental, so ria/fungus, then you may need to you really need to follow your own gut, since each person is going to have dierent levels and types of infection present. /T_herefore, a moderate dosage repeat this Protocol every protocol that may work for one person, is not strong enough for another 3 - 4 months for up to two years to person who has more rampant, or multiple infections present. And likewise, completely eradicate the infection. a powerful protocol that works for one person, may be far too strong and produce undesirable 'rebound' eects in someone with only a mild infection. Again, like every recommendation in this program: Please follow your gut! Remember that you know your body better than anyone, and if you get a feeling you should change the dosage (longer, shorter, more, less, etc.) then please do so, but keep in mind that these substances are as powerful as drugs and must also be used intelligently. Remember, it's always better to take longer to accomplish a task, yet stay balanced. Likewise, you may feel you need to slowly ease your way into the Protocol and may prefer to start with just /fiveoldstyle drops once or twice a day and see how that goes before beginning Phase /oneoldstyle. If you have a strong or rampant infection, you may /f_ind the Phase /oneoldstyle dosage causes the pathogens to die o too quickly and you get sick with the symptoms of the die-o eect (headaches, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, cold, /f_lu, etc.). /T_his is also known as the Herxheimer Reaction and it occurs when the body detoxi/f_ies rapidly as a result of a quick, massive die-o of pathogenic microorganisms. If this is the case, then you may want to ease into the Protocol by starting with /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT just /fiveoldstyle drops once or twice per day for two weeks (combined with probiotic supplementation), and then begin Phase /oneoldstyle. /T_his will help you to avoid a rapid die-o of pathogens and the resulting illness/symptoms as your body /f_lushes them from your system. Remember: Always listen to your gut and follow what feels right for your body. What Brand Should I Get? It's very important to use the correct species of oregano; as dierent Notes: species contain dierent levels of Carvacrol and /T_hymol. Please follow the speci/f_ications here to ensure you get the desired results and don't substitute brands unless they can meet the same criteria (con/f_irmed via an independent lab assay). When purchasing Wild Oregano Oil, make sure you get: For Wild Oregano Oil to be eective, it must be high in naturally occurring Carvacrol (ideally /sevenoldstyle/fiveoldstyle/percentoldstyle or more) - not just have extra Carvacrol added in later. If you get a brand with the correct species and subspecies, this will not be a problem. Eective, good quality Wild Oregano Oil should also be low in /T_hymol. /T_hymol is a naturally occurring compound in Oregano Oil that must be present as it works synergistically with Carvacrol. But, too much is hard on the liver, so check that levels do not exceed /fiveoldstyle/percentoldstyle maximum. Currently, there are only two brands of Wild Oregano Oil that I can recommend that meet these standards for ecacy and bioavailability: Oil of Oregano by Joy of the Mountains (www.LTYGshoppe.com) and Oreganol by North American Herb & Spice Company. I /f_ind Joy of the Mountains to be the better of the two, however, it also has a 'hotter' feel to it, so if you're using it for children then go with the Oreganol brand. /T_he dosage given for Wild Oregano Oil in this Protocol is for Oregano Oil that has already been diluted in a carrier oil (most brands are) like olive oil. /fiveoldstyle drops of diluted Wild Oregano Oil is equivalent to /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle drops of pure, undiluted Wild Oregano Oil. If you're using a brand other than the ones recommended here, check carefully to see whether it's diluted or undiluted. Remember to always /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 dilute pure (undiluted) Oregano Oil in a carrier oil before using internally or externally, or it can cause tissue damage. /T_he two brands recommended here have already been diluted with olive oil, so you don't need to dilute them further before using. Warning: Ideally, for best results, you should wean yourself o all drugs before beginning this Protocol (see your doctor or Chapter Five for weaning instructions).

Immediately follow with lots of water or juice, and keep drinking water till heat sensation disappears (about /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle seconds). Always shake dropper bottle well before using. If you also have mouth ulcers or a gum infection, sip a mouthful of water and hold it in your mouth. Add five drops of Oregano Oil to the mouthful of water and then swish together around your mouth and gums for as long as you can stand it, then swallow. Leave it if you can tolerate the heat, if you can't, then sip water till the heat sensation subsides. /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT In/f_lammation is usually a response to infection, or, the body's attempt to get rid of something undesirable. Alternatively, you can simply drop some Oregano Oil onto your finger and rub it directly onto the mouth ulcer(s) or infected gum/tooth. Leave it as long as possible and then drink water if needed. If you can't tolerate the taste or smell of Wild Oregano Oil (some like it, some don't) then you can take it in capsule form. But make sure the capsules contain the oil, not powdered oregano. /oneoldstyle capsule is equal to /fiveoldstyle drops.

A reader who had two fistulas in his anal area chose to use Wild Oregano Oil at full strength because the 'burning' sensation made him feel it was really killing everything and clearing them out. Hey, whatever works! For a vaginal infection, you can either apply the diluted Wild Oregano Oil directly to your labia, vaginal walls and cervix using your finger (really swab it round thoroughly), or you can add about /fiveoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle drops of the dilution to some warm water and douche with it.

If you get too many 'bad' bacteria in your gut and not enough 'good' bacteria, the bad bacteria (and other pathogenic microorganisms like yeast, fungi, parasites, etc.) will degrade the mucosal lining of your intestine and even penetrate through the intestinal wall. Aside from resulting in an increase of mucous, in/f_lammation, ulceration and bleeding, this will also result in undigested particles of food passing directly into your bloodstream - where they are perceived as allergens and trigger an immune response. Repopulating your bacterial /f_lora to contain predominantly good bacteria (via probiotic supplementation) will result in a drastic reduction - if not elimination - of many harmful pathogens like yeast, fungus, mold, parasites, viruses and /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT bad bacteria from your gut environment. /T_he good bacteria will also form a protective coating of your mucosal cell lining and produce B vitamins and digestive enzymes.

Interesting to note is that the strains of bacteria are actually listed (not just the species) and the acidophilus and bi/f_idum strains are the same ones that Natren Inc. uses in their probiotic products: \"In /oneoldstyle/nineoldstyle/nineoldstyle/fouroldstyle, Dr. Michael L. McCann and colleagues published a paper entitled, \"Recolonization /T_herapy with Nonadhesive Escherichia coli for Treatment of in/f_lammatory bowel disease,\" in the Journal of the New York Academy of Sciences . /T_his work reported on a process called \"re/f_lorastation\" and a three-year study that focused on normalizing the bowel bacteria using L. acidophilus (DDS-/oneoldstyle strain), B. bi/f_idum (Malyoth strain) and benign E. coli bacteria (Nissel /oneoldstyle/nineoldstyle/oneoldstyle/sevenoldstyle strain). Remember, E. coli is a common bowel bacteria that we all carry. With the exception of the lethal H:/zerooldstyle/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle/sevenoldstyle strain, which contaminates the food chain, most strains of E. coli are harmless. Because they are normal bowel residents they can even be considered bene/f_icial. Dr. McCann's study involved patients who suered from an in/f_lammatory bowel disease, either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. His re/f_lorastation protocol began with the use of heavy- duty antibiotics and antifungals to completely rid the body of all bacteria - the good as well as the bad. Once the intestines had been thoroughly denuded, the normal bacteria were reintroduced, both orally and via retention enemas. As a result, each patient so treated /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 went into remission, and those who continued with the bacterial \u0003 supplementation remain disease-free at the time of this writing [/oneoldstyle/nineoldstyle/nineoldstyle/eightoldstyle]. /T_he paper concludes, \"A subset of patients with in/f_lammatory bowel \u0003 disease who are successfully recolonized with nonadhesive E. coli \u0003 [and the friendly bacteria] achieved complete, sustained, drug-free \u0003 remissions....Re/f_lorastation is not only a method that has the potential \u0003 to identify putative etiologic antigens, but is also a clinical method to \u0003A 1994 clinical trial used induce long-term remissions without the use of toxic drugs.\" /onesuperior antibiotics and antifungals folllowed by high dose Are Crohn's & Colitis Infectious Diseases? /T_here is also a growing /f_ield of research suggesting that Crohn's and probiotic supplementation to ulcerative colitis are not auto-immune diseases, but rather, infectious induce remission in patients diseases as a result of harmful bacteria or other pathogens in the with ulcerative colitis and gastrointestinal tract. Doctors who are treating patients from this position, Crohn's Disease. like Dr. McCann above, are using potent cocktails of antibiotics to wipe out the existing /f_lora in the gut. Some then repopulate the gut with good bacteria, and some don't. Personally, I'm convinced the permanence of the cure or remission would be directly related to whether or not the gut was repopulated suciently (and perhaps supplementation maintained inde/f_initely) with bene/f_icial bacteria. Also, keep in mind that Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol above is as potent and eective (and in some cases moreso) than pharmaceutical antibiotics, antifungals, antiyeast, antiparasitic, etc. products. Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) is a bacterium whose RNA has consistently been isolated in /nineoldstyle/twooldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of patients tested with Crohn's Disease (the incidence varies from study to study). MAP is occasionally found in milk - even in milk that has been pasteurized. However, UHT milk (sealed, boxed milk that can sit on the shelf till opened) is subjected to much higher temperatures than pasteurized milk and may be less likely to contain MAP (they're not sure at this point). John Herman-Taylor, a researcher at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London, thinks there is also evidence that MAP is at the root of irritable bowel syndrome, \"In animals, MAP in/f_lames the nerves of the gut. Recent work from Sweden /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT shows that people with (IBS) also have in/f_lamed gut nerves.\" Kelly Karper, PhD, RPh, recently published a paper in a journal for pharmacists titled, Crohn's: An Infectious Disease? : \"Like other mycobacterial strains, MAP reproduces very slowly. For antibiotics to eectively eliminate MAP, a cocktail of antimycobacterial drugs must be used for extended periods of time. And that is just what the doctor orders for patients with Crohn's disease in Sydney, Australia. /T_homas Borody, M.D., director of the Centre for Digestive Diseases, Notes: utilizes triple antimycobacterial therapy for his Crohn's patients...for at least three years...In his experience, 'cures are achieved in /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle - /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle/percentoldstyle of his patients and the rest go into total remission.' By cure, he means that when his patients are o all medications, they not only have no symptoms, but, endoscopically, they have no in/f_lammation, no histologic evidence of Crohn's disease, and their blood work is negative for markers of in/f_lammation. In contrast, those patients that 'go into total remission' experience only minor symptoms, and there is still slight evidence of the disease in endoscopic examination.\" /onesuperior I can't help wondering what Dr. Borody's cure and remission rates would be like if he also followed his antimycobacterial protocol with one to two years of high quality probiotic supplementation. As Kelly Karpa goes on to say in her article: \"Some other gastroenterologists who believe an infectious agent may underlie Crohn's disease have taken a dierent approach to treating the illness. Instead of using antibiotics to wipe out infectious microorganisms, they have instead opted to treat patients with therapeutic doses of 'healthy bacteria', or probiotics. Rather than using antibiotics to kill bacteria, this novel approach lets bacteria kill bacteria.\" /onesuperior Probiotic Species & Strains Regardless of whether IBD and IBS are initially caused by pathogenic microorganisms (like MAP), or not, the fact remains that probiotic /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 supplementation results in many bene/f_its to the gut and overall health of people with IBD and IBS. Adequate probiotic supplementation is an integral part of healing the root causes of your digestive disorder. And when I say 'adequate probiotic supplementation', I mean high-dose supplementation with eective, potent strains. /T_here have been many human studies done with probiotics to monitor the eect of supplementation on things such as candidiasis, diarrhea, cystitis, etc. and the same probiotics taken at lower levels had very little or no eect. However, the same probiotics taken at high doses (typically /sevenoldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle billion cfu per day in adults) showed impressive To see results from probiotic results. So, you can be taking the right probiotics, but if you're not taking supplementation, you have to them in high enough doses, you won't see the desired results. ingest the right strain of each It's also important to ingest the right strain of each species.

If you have IBS or IBD, you need to ingest potent strains that are capable of wiping out the bad bacteria in your gut, strong enough to protect against re-infection, and capable of restoring your mucosal lining and help balance your immune system. /T_here have been human trials performed where (for example) probiotic supplementation consisting of strain 'A' of L. acidophilus and strain 'B' of Bi/f_idobacterium was ingested by subjects with diarrhea, and supplementation signi/f_icantly reduced the incidence of diarrhea. However, the other half of the /oneoldstyle/threeoldstyle/twooldstyle member study who consumed strain 'X' of L. acidophilus and strain 'Y' of Bi/f_idobacterium showed no results of any statistical signi/f_icance./onesuperior Just ingesting high doses of L acidophilus or B. bi/f_idus is not enough. You need to ingest high doses of the correct strains of acidophilus and bi/f_idus . Many probiotic manufacturers have tried to tell me that the strain doesn't matter, or isn't important. All this shows is that they are either lying or ignorant, as there are dozens of human trials that illustrate quite clearly that the strain is extremely important to the potency and ecacy of the probiotic - i.e. can it adhere to walls of the intestine and colonize eectively? Can it produce bene/f_icial enzymes, vitamins, healing agents and /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT anti-cancer agents? Can it inhibit or exclude pathogenic microorganisms like bad bacteria, yeast, fungi and parasites? Etc. etc. /T_he species and strain of bacteria (along with manufacturing process and environment) are also very important when considering safety issues. Here's an example to help you distinguish between the name of the species and the name of the strain: Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-/oneoldstyle (o/f_ten written L. acidophilus DDS-/oneoldstyle) Lactobacillus Notes: Species - acidophilus Strain - DDS-/oneoldstyle Some species that are routinely included in commercial probiotic blends simply do not have a long-term record of human safety and not enough is known about their actions/rami/f_ication in the gut under varying conditions. For example, a study on immunode/f_icient mice found that supplementing with a certain strain of L. reuteri (used in many probiotic blends) caused some of the mice to die, leading the researchers to recommend \"the need to proceed cautiously when using high doses of this strain in neonatal, immunocompromised hosts.\" /onesuperior /T_herefore, you only want to purchase a probiotic supplement that contains species and strains with a proven, long- term record of human safety. /T_he manufacturing of probiotics is another area that can result in a dangerous product if incredibly strict, sterile-environment procedures are not followed. An Australian manufacturer was completely shut down a/f_ter their product was found to be contaminated with lead and other toxic materials. Again, there is no independent, third-party regulating probiotic manufacture, advertising or distribution, so you're completely at the mercy of the manufacturer to ensure you're consuming a safe, potent, eective probiotic. I have heard from so many people who developed further complications a/f_ter ingesting unsafe probiotics, or, who had been taking probiotics (usually recommended by a health professional) for one or two years and yet seen no change in symptoms. Once these clients switch to Natren probiotics and scale up to the appropriate dosage, they can't /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 believe the dierence. One of my consultation clients even saw a dramatic reduction in mucus and bloating a/f_ter only four days - but she is an exception, not the norm. I have communicated directly with several popular, well-known probiotic manufacturers (other than Natren) and they were all very helpful with my initial inquiries. However, once I started asking speci/f_ic questions about strains used and/or asking to see independent lab assays of the product, most simply stopped responding to my questions and refused to talk to Swallowing live me anymore and one even started yelling at me, accusing me of being microorganisms, which are highly ridiculous and unreasonable - I kid you not! adaptive, intelligent beings, should Choosing The Right Probiotics be undertaken with great caution So, you need to be very careful when choosing a probiotic brand to and safety should always be supplement with as the /f_ield of misinformation in this arena is vast. In my paramount. opinion, probiotics are so powerful, they should be even more stringently regulated than prescription drugs. Swallowing live microorganisms, which are highly adaptive, intelligent beings, should be undertaken with great caution and safety should always be paramount. Unfortunately, currently probiotics are not regulated at all, and many probiotic manufacturers do not even comply with labeling guidelines. In addition, when I refer to 'probiotics' I'm referring to food-cultured bene/f_icial bacteria only. Bacterial soil organisms, (bacteria that exist in the soil) are a completely dierent proposition and something I strongly recommend you do not ingest - although many manufacturers are now referring to this kind of bacterial organism as a 'probiotic' as well. For more information and my opinion on bacterial soil organisms (also referred to as SO's, SBO's, or HSO's), please see Chapter Eight. Saccharomyces boulardii is also referred to a probiotic, but it is not a bacteria, it is a yeast. It has been shown to be bene/f_icial in clinical trials with both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. I tried it myself many years ago and before I discovered Natren probiotics, but it exacerbated my symptoms. If you feel led to try Saccharomyces boulardii , it is probably safe, however, I don't recommend long-term or ongoing supplementation with /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT it. Simply because it doesn't have the track record of human safety that the other probiotics (recommended here) do. /T_herefore, to ensure both safety and potency, when choosing a brand of probiotics, you need to make sure the product ful/f_ills all of the following criteria: /one.oldstyle. cGMP Facility and stored in dark, glass bottles only Make sure the probiotic is manufactured in a facility that carries the Notes: cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) certification, otherwise you risk consuming a contaminated product. Contaminants could consist of lead, mercury (and other poisonous heavy metals), and undesirable bacteria. A /oneoldstyle/nineoldstyle/nineoldstyle/zerooldstyle independent laboratory study found that nine out of ten brands of popular Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotics actually contained no acidophilus at all. All nine contained contaminants and other species of lactobacilli instead./twosuperior Probiotics are also sensitive to (and damaged by) light and moisture. Only a glass bottle will keep out all moisture - all plastic is permeable to varying degrees of moisture. In addition, the glass must be dark (or amber colored) to keep out light, which also damages bacteria. /two.oldstyle. Different species must not be touching each other Different species of bacteria placed together will compete for space and try to dominate each other, resulting in competitive exclusion by the dominant species. In vitro studies have shown that when you place different species together, the dominant (strongest) species will usually produce bacteriocins that kill closely related species. For example, one study in a prestigious microbiology journal showed that a certain strain of L. acidophilus produced bacteriocins (antibiotics that work against same, or closely related species by adsorption to receptors on the target cells) that inhibited L. delbrueckii, L. ./twosuperior/onesuperior Look at the list of ingredients, and you'll see that many probiotic companies package these same species together all in one bottle or capsule. If L.acidophilus can /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 inhibit or competitively exclude all these other species, how much of each species is going to be left by the time you ingest it? Therefore, each species (eg. acidophilus, bifidum, bulgaricus ) must be kept in its own bottle or in separate capsules to prevent the dominant species from inhibiting or killing off the other species. Refrigeration does not prevent this from happening either, since certain bacteriocins have proved stable at temperatures as low as -/twooldstyle/zerooldstyle degrees Celcius. Currently, Natren Inc. is the only company I know of that has worked out a patented Different species of bacteria system for keeping the species of bacteria separate, yet within the same placed together will compete for capsule. The bacteria are added one species at a time to the capsule, space and try to dominate each over the course of a week, and each species is encapsulated within its own oil bubble, so although you just swallow one capsule, within that other, resulting in competitive capsule, the different bacteria are completely isolated and not touching exclusion by the dominant species. each other (hence the high price of the product). I know most probiotic manufacturers sell regular capsules or powders with anywhere from /threeoldstyle to /oneoldstyle/fouroldstyle different species packaged together in one jar, or one capsule. Again, I'm absolutely mystified as to why they do this. However, check the bottle and you'll see that none of these manufacturers guarantees the number of live, viable bacteria in their product at the time of opening, or consumption. Nor do they guarantee how many of each species and strain remains alive and viable for effective colonization in the gut at time of consumption . One can only conclude that they know that different species inhibit and compete with each other, but yet they continue to package them this way. Perhaps they're relying on the ignorance of the consumer, supported by poorly researched magazine articles that tell people to consume a full spectrum of probiotics, but don't give enough guidelines to ensure safety and potency of the probiotic products. Or, amazing at it may seem, the more probiotic manufacturers I talk to, the more it becomes clear that they themselves are actually ignorant of the problems of packaging different species together!

Heat quickly kills bacteria and even at room temperature they will become active and soon live out their life cycle - think of what happens if you leave yoghurt on the counter. The best way to preserve bacterial potency is by keeping it cold at all times, until you're ready to ingest it. Freeze drying is the best method of preserving the bacteria and for this to be maintained, they must be kept Notes: very cold at all times until you're ready to ingest them. Of course, keep your probiotics refrigerated at home too. When I travel to third world countries, I pack my probiotics in a cooler, on ice, and make sure the hotel where I'm staying has a bar fridge. Alternatively, you can just keep them in a filled ice bucket in your room, but that's a bit more hassle as you have to keep filling the bucket with fresh ice. /four.oldstyle. Strain and number of bacteria per serving must be listed on the bottle Only certain strains of bacteria are potent and eective (eg. L. bulgaricus DDS-/oneoldstyle/fouroldstyle is excellent, L. bulgaricus DDS-/oneoldstyle/threeoldstyle is useless - remember, 'bulgaricus ' is the species, 'DDS-/oneoldstyle/fouroldstyle' is the strain). If the manufacturer just lists 'acidophilus' for example, chances are they've used a cheap and ineective strain of L. acidophilus . /T_here are approximately /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle identi/f_ied strains of L. acidophilus, of these, only /oneoldstyle/threeoldstyle have good antibiotic (against bad bacteria) qualities, thus, the strain is indeed very important. /T_hey must also list the number of bacteria guaranteed per serving (and this should be between /twooldstyle - /fiveoldstyle billion colony forming units per serving) at the time of opening . /T_his guarantee is key: If a manufacturer only guarantees the number of bacteria at the time of manufacture , this is meaningless. At manufacture, a bottle may contain /twooldstyle billion cfu (colony forming units) per serving - however, by the time that bottle gets to you, the bacteria may be mostly dead. Another trick to watch out for is that manufacturers will list (for example) two dierent strains of L. acidophilus , one of which is a good strain and the other a cheap useless one. /T_hen they will list the total guaranteed bacteria per serving at /twooldstyle billion cfu. However, they haven't told you how much of that total count is the eective strain and how much /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 is the ineective one. To increase pro/f_itability, the product probably \u0003 consists mostly of the cheap, ineective strain, with a tiny amount of \u0003 the potent strain sprinkled in. It's also a good idea to use human strains \u0003 (vs. bovine or porcine strains) for safety's sake.

In ultra/f_iltration \u0003 extraction methods, the bacteria are pressed through a /f_ilter that removes \u0003 the larger molecules of their growth medium. However, when bacteria \u0003 are growing in their culture, they form into chains as they multiply. \u0003 Ultra/f_iltration results in the breakup of these chains, separates the \u0003 bacteria from their bene/f_icial growth medium (supernatant) and can also \u0003 damage the bacteria themselves. /T_he best method of preserving bacteria \u0003 (and the most expensive) is to freeze dry it along with its growth medium. \u0003 Many scientists maintain it's best to consume bacteria along with it's \u0003 growth medium (also known as the substrate or supernatant) since \u0003 this protects the bacteria from stomach acid and provides a ready food \u0003 source for the bacteria to consume as they establish themselves in your \u0003 gastrointestinal tract.

Make sure your brand of bacteria states on the \u0003 /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: bottle that it doesn't use ultra/f_iltration or centrifugal extraction methods (if it doesn't say so, chances are it does use these methods) and ideally, purchase bacteria that's freeze dried along with its growth medium. /six.oldstyle. Avoid prebiotics Some companies package their probiotics with fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and/or inulin - indigestible substances referred to as prebiotics, which they claim feed the bacteria, thereby improving performance. Keep in mind though, that many bacteria (both good and bad) can feed on these substances. So if you have a predominantly bad bacterial /f_lora (as most, if not all people with IBD do) consuming prebiotics is probably going to exacerbate your symptoms. Also, most FOS is manufactured via chemical synthesis and in many instances has been shown to cause abdominal pain, bloating and gas. I especially don't recommend it for people with IBS or IBD. Also avoid FOS and inulin in vitamin/mineral supplements, whey protein powders, etc. Be sure to read labels as it's become popular to add it to all kinds of products. For perfectly healthy people with an established good bacterial /f_lora, prebiotics are probably okay, especially if they are not able to obtain these substances naturally through a good diet. Unfortunately, to date, the only brand of probiotics I've found that meets all the requisite criteria (as listed above) is Natren Inc. And let me state here that I receive /nsc/osc commissions, royalties or other compensation from Natren for recommending their products. Like George's Aloe Vera Juice and Udo's Choice Oil Blend, I'm simply recommending the best product that I've found, in order to save my readers time, hassle and the pain (symptom exacerbation) of unsuccessful experimentation. Natasha Trenev is the passionate founder and owner of Natren Inc. and as long as she owns the company, you can be assured the same level of quality and safety will continue. If the company is ever sold, then check to make sure the products still meet all the above criteria. Now, if any of you manage to /f_ind another brand of probiotics that meets all the criteria listed above - please let me know! I would love to have another brand to recommend to people, it's always nice to have choices. /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 With probiotics being such an expanding /f_ield and numerous dierent companies producing them, I'm really mysti/f_ied as to why everyone else is producing such inferior products. I can only surmise that it's due to pro/f_its and ignorance. It's very expensive to produce and ship bacteria according to the standards required for full potency, safety, and bioavailability (as outlined above). Perhaps these other companies just aren't aware of all the factors involved in successful culturing, extraction and storage of bacteria, or, perhaps they're counting on the fact that the consumer is not aware and therefore will buy their products anyway. Don't be surprised when even When purchasing probiotics, your naturopathic physician or gastroenterologist doesn't know the above make sure the manufacturer criteria for ensuring potent, viable bacteria. As I said, there's a lot of money guarantees the number of live being invested in probiotics by people/manufacturers who know very little bacteria, of each strain (not just about these highly sensitive microorganisms. Unfortunately, they care more of each species), at the time of about their pro/f_its than your health. consumption - not at the time of When I /f_irst began recommending Natren probiotics to my readers, I did packaging. so for one reason only; they worked. At that time, I knew a fraction of what I know now about probiotic strain selection, manufacturing, storage, and other factors eecting potency and ecacy. I had experimented with dierent brands of probiotics o and on for seven years and each time I tried supplementing, my symptoms (gas, bloating, bleeding) worsened. Although the science behind probiotics and why they should bene/f_it me seemed sound, my experience proved contrary. When I was nearly ready to give up on the whole subject, my naturopathic physician Dr. David Wang, convinced me to try Natren brand probiotics. He insisted they were the best brand he knew of and that I would see good results from them. I started with Natren's Bi/f_ido Factor powder ( Bi/f_idobacterium bi/f_idum Malyoth strain) and for the /f_irst time, experienced an improvement as a result. Prior to taking Natren's B. bi/f_idum , the only thing that had worked to stem my chronic diarrhea was L-Glutamine (on an empty stomach only). However, within three doses of Natren's bi/f_idobacteria, my stools began to /f_irm up and excess water was reabsorbed. I tried Natren's Megadophilus (Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-/oneoldstyle) next but did not tolerate that as well as the bi/f_idum . In searching for reasons why, I came across this bit of research /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: that showed that in states of in/f_lammation the overall tolerance to bacterial /f_lora is greatly reduced: \"It is possible that the products of the commensal /f_lora promote in/f_lammation in the presence of an impaired mucosal barrier or injury to the mucosa... /T_hese results indicate that, in health, there is tolerance to autologous [your own] but not allogeneic [foreign source] intestinal /f_lora, and tolerance is lost during in/f_lammation. Evidence also exists that animals are tolerant to their own /f_lora in health but not a/f_ter colitis develops.\" /twosuperior/twosuperior Unfortunately, this bit of research doesn't specify which species of bacteria the body loses tolerance for, and which strains of which species - perhaps all of them? Nevertheless, it provided me with a clue by which to proceed, and I stayed on just the B. bi/f_idum bacteria for another three months before trying the L. acidophilus again and I then tolerated it well. By that time (I surmise) the B. bi/f_idum and other supplements I was taking had healed my intestine to the point where it was able to tolerate - and bene/f_it from - additional probiotic supplementation. About a month a/f_ter that, I added Natren's L. bulgaricus and tolerated that successfully as well. I have since continued to recommend the same conservative course of action to my readers. However, in March /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/fiveoldstyle, gastroenterology journal published results of a human trial on /sevenoldstyle/fiveoldstyle people with IBS, supplementing with /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle billion cfu of B. infantis , once per day in a malted milk drink. Now, Bi/f_idobacterium infantis is, as the title suggests, a strain typically used for infants. But as Dr. Quigley and his colleagues note in their paper, the symptom relief achieved with B. infantis in the trial was comparable to that seen with Zelnorm (tegaserod) and Lotronex (alosetron) - two drugs used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome./twosuperior/threesuperior B. Infantis is the predominant bacteria found in the bowel of healthy breastfed infants. As the infant begins to eat solid foods, the more 'adult' strains like B. bi/f_idum come to dominate. However, what if you never had a healthy bacterial /f_lora as an infant? /T_hen maybe it would be best for you /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 to start with what was missing from the very beginning and work up from there? /T_his approach makes sense to me both logically and intuitively. Interestingly, I had a bottle of Natren's Life Start (B. infantis) in my fridge (that I had given to my daughter) and about six months before this research came out I had begun taking it myself (along with the three adult species/ strains) just because I intuitively felt like trying it. In light of this research, you may want to consider beginning probiotic supplementation with B. infantis , especially if you try B. bi/f_idum and can't tolerate it. And just to confuse you even more, I have talked with readers who couldn't tolerate If you try all the adult strains B. bi/f_idum at /f_irst, but could tolerate L. acidophilus . So, essentially, I've and can't tolerate them, then try provided you with a guideline, but within that you may need to experiment the infant strain: B. infantis (Life and /f_ind what works best for your particular body and gut environment.

You do need to to start with what you never had establish a healthy bacterial /f_lora (consisting of all three species) to enjoy as a baby, and gradually move on long-term, lasting health. from there. I know many people have experienced good results from more aggressive supplementation and also from beginning supplementation immediately (with ulceration and bleeding still present). Feedback from hundreds of readers has con/f_irmed the eectiveness of the slower approach (as outlined above), but it certainly does take more time to see results since you're proceeding so slowly. However, if your gut is really toxic, proceeding slowly helps minimize the die-o eect (Herxheimer Reaction), so while it takes longer to see any results, at least you don't have the nausea, bloating, headaches, etc. that can result from a rapid die-o of pathogens in the gut. As in all things, please follow your own gut instinct /f_irst. If you feel you should pursue aggressive supplementation, then please do so. I know of a colon clinic in Sydney, Australia that treats people with active, bleeding Crohn's with high doses of Natren brand probiotics orally and also via retention enemas and they have had good success with this approach. I will give you instructions below for doing Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema and I certainly recommend this as one of the fastest, most eective ways of changing your gut ecology and seeing quick, positive results (not including the die-o eect!). /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT How Much Should I Take And When? If you're a highly reactive, sensitive person, you may want to get your ulceration and bleeding healed (using the therapies recommended in this program) before beginning probiotic supplementation. However, I do recommend you try supplementing with Natren's Bi/f_ido Factor ( B. bi/f_idum Malyoth) right away because if you can tolerate it, it will help speed your healing. If you can't tolerate the B. bi/f_idum , then try Natren's Life Start (B. infantis) . Life Start is available in stores only in a dairy-based formula at this time. If you want the goat milk-based formula, you'll need to order it online, direct from Natren. By the way, when ordering Natren probiotics online, I recommend you /osc/nsc/lsc/ysc order from www.natren.com or from my store, www.LTYGshoppe.com , as there are a lot of counterfeit operations that have imitated Natren's label, claiming to sell Natren's probiotics, but while the label looks the same, inside the bottle is a completely dierent product! Once you've successfully used Natren's bi/f_idum bacteria for next try adding Natren's Megadophilus ( L. acidophilus DDS-/oneoldstyle). If you tolerate that /f_inally add their Digesta-Lac product ( L. bulgaricus LB-/fiveoldstyle/oneoldstyle) to your regimen. If you don't tolerate a new species of bacteria well, then stay on just what's working for you for another few weeks or a month before trying again. You ultimately need to ingest the complete spectrum of probiotics as each is particularly active and healing for dierent parts of your intestine: Acidophilus for the esophageal tube, stomach and small intestine, bi/f_idum for the large intestine, and bulgaricus is a transient species that travels throughout the intestinal tract and also assists the action of acidophilus and bi/f_idum . If you suer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) you can start immediately with all three (Megadophilus, Bi/f_ido Factor, Digesta-Lac) and/or, with Life Start (B. infantis) as discussed above. Whether you tend toward diarrhea or constipation or some mixture of both, probiotics will normalize your bowel function and you should start to see positive results within a month or so. Natren probiotics are available in both dairy-based, and non-dairy preparations. If you have a dairy intolerance, then use the non-dairy /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/two.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 versions. Again, if you're having trouble getting exactly what you want from your health store (most don't carry the full line), then order it direct from Natren (www.natren.com) or the LTYG Holistic Health Shoppe (www.LTYGshoppe.com) . However, a/f_ter you've been taking probiotics for a year or so, you may be able to tolerate dairy again - especially since they produce the enzyme lactase, which helps your body digest the lactose in milk products, and L. bulgaricus also helps you digest milk proteins. If you don't have a problem with dairy, then test each of them and see which one you get better results from. My body seems to prefer the dairy-based For young children who probiotics now, although initially I consumed the non-dairy line. Also, for won't drink the probiotics mixed young children who won't drink the probiotics mixed in water, it's also in water, it's also eective to mix eective to mix the Natren dairy-based line in with yoghurt (/f_lavored or the Natren dairy-based line in plain are both ok).

I recommend people with IBD take their probiotics in powder form so that \u0003 (a) you can reap the bene/f_its in your mouth (mouth ulcers), esophagus and stomach ( L. acidophilus reduces or eliminates heartburn - even while pregnant) and (b) to ensure eective utilisation as people with IBD o/f_ten have very fast transit times through their gastrointestinal tract, so capsules are not always broken down/absorbed properly. Also, when you take the powder form, you're also ingesting the valuable supernatant (growth medium) along with the bene/f_icial bacteria. If your system tends to be constipated, then you'll probably be /f_ine with taking the capsules (if you prefer). When you /f_irst begin probiotic supplementation, I recommend proceeding slowly. /T_his is due to a phenomena called /T_he Herxheimer Reaction (/f_irst documented by Dr. Karl Herxheimer) where the die-o of pathogens in the gut (caused by the good bacteria) causes various unpleasant symptoms. Bloating, gas, headaches, colds, /f_lu, diarrhea, etc., can result as these toxins die o and your body tries to expel them as quickly as possible. To /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: avoid or minimize this temporary reaction, start with only \u00bc tsp. of each (Bi/f_ido Factor, Megadophilus, Digesta-Lac) /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day, or, /oneoldstyle capsule (Healthy Trinity) every second day, on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food). Some people's guts are so toxic, they are only able to tolerate /oneoldstyle capsule every four days. So listen to your gut and proceed at the pace that's right for your body. Eventually work your way up to /oneoldstyle tsp of each powder (Bi/f_ido Factor, Megadophilus, Digesta-Lac), /threeoldstyle times per day, or, /oneoldstyle capsule (Healthy Trinity) /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food). You can follow dosage instructions on the bottle (but try to work up to /oneoldstyle tsp. /threeoldstyle times per day) and you can mix all three powders together in one glass of room temperature, /f_iltered or spring water (no tap water as the chlorine in tap water kills bacteria). If you want to be careful about not contaminating each bottle, you can wipe the spoon o with a piece of tissue in between scooping from each bottle (so you don't transfer acidophilus to your bulgaricus bottle, for example). Or, even better, you can hold the spoon below the mouth of the bottle and shake the powder into the spoon, so it doesn't even touch the remaining contents of the bottle. Make sure you always take probiotics on an empty stomach (/oneoldstyle/fiveoldstyle - /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes before food, or /twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food) as digestive juices destroy the bacteria. I also like to take /oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder (mixed together in a glass of room temperature /f_iltered or spring water) before bed (on an empty stomach) so the bacteria have all night to colonize undisturbed. You need to work up to a full teaspoon of each powder (Bi/f_ido Factor, Megadophilus, Digesta-Lac), three times a day, or, /oneoldstyle capsule (Healthy Trinity), /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle times per day, for at least three months to see really good, lasting results. If you have IBD, your gut /f_lora is so compromised that you need consistent, high doses of the full spectrum of probiotics to eect any kind of lasting change. For ongoing maintenance, once you're completely healed and symptom- free, I recommend taking one dose (/oneoldstyle tsp. of each powder) before bed, on an empty stomach (/twooldstyle hours a/f_ter food). Or, if you prefer, you can just take /oneoldstyle Healthy Trinity capsule before bed, on an empty stomach, for ongoing maintenance. /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/four.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Things That Kill Good Bacteria Keep in mind that numerous drugs used in IBS/IBD therapy also kill o the good bacteria in your gut, so if you're on medication, you should also simultaneously be using probiotics (at least /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle times per day). Prednisone is one of the worst drugs for disrupting bacterial /f_lora in the gut since it produces an alkaline pH, which promotes the growth of yeast (Candida albicans) , fungi and bad bacteria. Birth control pills have the same eect. Other substances that also disrupt the growth and balance of bene/f_icial bacteria in your gut include antibiotics, some antidepressants, Whether you tend toward laxatives, antacids, chlorinated water, anal intercourse, nonsteroidal anti- diarrhea or some in/f_lammatory agents (NSAIDS) and steroids (including corticosteroids like mixture of both, probiotics will Prednisone and Hydrocortisone). See Chapter Nine for alternative methods normalize your bowel function of birth control to the oral contraceptive pill. If you are using any of these and you should see some positive substances, you will have to continue probiotic supplementation inde/f_initely results within a month or so. For to counter the eects of these agents. Once you stop using these substances, \u0003 you will then need to do at least three month's of high dose probiotic faster results, do Jini's Probiotic \u0003 supplementation and then continue as needed.

Dosage Instructions Following Antibiotics Or Exploratory Tests If you're taking an antibiotic, you can either wait until the course of treatment is over before beginning probiotic supplementation, or, you can take probiotics during the course of antibiotic treatment.

Dosage Instructions For Babies For an infant with bowel problems (or skin problems), supplement with Natren's Life Start ( Bi/f_idobacteria infantis bacteria) only - do not give the other probiotic species directly to an infant (although a nursing mother can and should ingest other species including B. infantis ). - \u00bc tsp. /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle times a day should produce fairly swi/f_t results.

Remember that skin conditions are always a sign of gut problems, so although the Wild Oregano Oil would have eliminated the visible symptoms, the underlying problem still needed to be addressed. Her body has also shown me (via the yeast/fungal skin infections and tendency towards constipation) where her genetic weakness lies (or where she carries stress in her body), so I continue to give her probiotics regularly.

Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema /T_his retention enema, which delivers very high dose probiotics directly to your colon (and lower part of your ileum) can provide dramatic healing results. As the name suggests, this is not a cleansing or /f_lushing enema, but rather it is an implant or retention enema - where the goal is to hold the mixture in your colon until the liquid is completely absorbed (about /twooldstyle hours). If you can't retain it until the liquid is absorbed, don't worry, continue with oral probiotic supplementation and try again in a few weeks. You will still retain some bene/f_its though, no matter how short the retention time, so don't worry, the eort is not wasted. Many people use Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema during severe in/f_lammation and bleeding for quick healing , whilst others prefer to wait until things have calmed down a bit and they're tolerating the probiotics well orally /f_irst.

Ideally, for best results, first clear the colon of fecal matter, until an enema bag of warm water runs clear when expelled from your colon/ rectum. You can clear the colon by giving repeated enemas of warm, filtered water. Use an enema bag to put /eightoldstyle - /oneoldstyle/sixoldstyle ounces (/oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle cups) of warm, filtered water into your colon, massage around for as long as you can (or up to /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle minutes) and then expel liquid and feces into the toilet. Notes: Then, give yourself another enema of /eightoldstyle - /oneoldstyle/sixoldstyle ounces (/oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle cups) of warm, filtered water, massage water around the colon, and expel. Continue until the water expelled is clear of fecal matter. If you think that repeated enemas will only aggravate your colon, then just do one. If your rectum is sore or sensitive, first coat the tip of the enema tube and your anus/rectum with a clear lubricant (such as KY Jelly). Do not use Vaseline. If you're currently on an elemental (liquid) diet, or suffer from constant diarrhea, you may not need to do this step if you'd really prefer not to. If having enemas doesn't bother you though, it would still be best if you could administer at least one warm water enema to flush the colon before proceeding. /twooldstyle. Once your colon is clear of fecal matter, you can give yourself Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema . Unlike the previous enemas, the goal of this one is to /nsc/osc/tsc expel the contents into the toilet, but rather to retain (hold) it in your colon until all the water has been absorbed and thus the bacteria has a chance to colonize at full capacity.

Elevate your hips using rolled towels or a pillow, lie on your right side and insert the enema tube /oneoldstyle - /twooldstyle inches up your rectum (lubricate tube and anus with your saliva, or saline lubricant if necessary).

However, if lying on your le/f_t side makes you feel you need to expel the mixture, then just lie on your right side and your back. If you can, massage your colon gently in each position to really work the probiotics into all the folds and crevices of your colon. However, take care to massage away from the rectum to help prevent expulsion: Massage from your le/f_t side towards the right side of the colon.

How Long Should I Take Probiotics? Again, this is an area where there are vastly diering opinions: Opinion /one.oldstyle: You should take probiotics every day for the rest of your life. /T_hirty years ago, it took about /twooldstyle/fiveoldstyle,/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle colony forming units to cause food Notes: poisoning, today it can take only /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle colony forming units. /T_herefore, you need to daily make sure you have a protective population of bene/f_icial bacteria in your gut to prevent and /f_ight o invading pathogens. As the probiotics discussed also have anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial (against 'bad' bacteria) capabilities, taking them daily supports your ongoing health. /T_he other argument for this position is that people who've demonstrated a gut weakness, or, susceptibility (as in the case of someone with IBD) need extra support and protection against pathogenic microorganisms and thus should take the bene/f_icial bacteria daily. If you ever eat at fast food restaurants, or buy non-organic ground meat, you also need to know that: \"Every day in the United States, roughly /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle,/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle people are sickened by a foodborne disease, /nineoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle are hospitalized, and fourteen die. ...

For myself, I use a mix of Opinion /numbersignoldstyle/twooldstyle and /numbersignoldstyle/threeoldstyle and if I ever travel to less developed countries, or travel anywhere for longer than two weeks, I carry probiotics with me and take them prophylactically (daily). /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION Notes: If you've had IBD or IBS for any length of time, you probably have a medium to severe de/f_iciency of the following vitamins and minerals due to decreased nutritional absorption and excess fecal losses (Source: Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine , by Michael Murray N.D., and Joseph Pizzorno, N.D.): Zinc - Zinc picolinate or zinc citrate are much better absorbed than other forms (e.g., zinc sulphate). Also, if you're on the birth control pill then you're going to be extra-low in zinc. Magnesium - Magnesium chelates (citrate, aspartate, much than magnesium salts (e.g., magnesium carbonate). However, magnesium can have a laxative eect, so give your body time to adjust by starting with a lower dose and working up. Recent studies have shown an average of /fouroldstyle/zerooldstyle/percentoldstyle of Americans are de/f_icient in magnesium. Calcium - A vitamin D de/f_iciency (among other things) can result in a calcium de/f_iciency even though you're ingesting sucient calcium. Potassium - Another reason to eat bananas and papayas. If you tend to get leg and foot cramps, then you're probably low in calcium and potassium. Vitamin A* - /T_his vitamin directly aects the intestinal mucosal lining; it increases the production of mucins, increases the secretion of mucus and restores normal barrier function. Vitamin D - sunshine! Do not always cover up your skin or use sunscreen as you do need to be able to absorb the sun's rays to get enough vitamin D for your body. Vitamin E* - Inhibits in/f_lammation and reduces free radical damage. Selenium * - Another excellent antioxidant, best taken with vitamin E (they increase each other's absorption), but take your vitamin C at another time as it interferes with the absorption of some forms of selenium. Liquid selenium is virtually tasteless and odorless. /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 Vitamin K - Also present in parsley. Folic Acid - Intestinal mucosal cells need a constant supply of folic acid (or folate), also necessary for iron absorption.

Look up the drugs in your pharmacist's CPS (drug handbook) or ask your doctor for the pharmaceutical printout on each drug he prescribes you (don't trust your doctor to know about this, he may have little to no idea of the extended rami/f_ications of the drugs he's prescribing). Here's an example of two common drugs used in the treatment of IBD and their eects (Source: Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine , Michael Murray N.D., and Joseph Pizzorno, N.D.): /oneoldstyle. Corticosteroids decrease the absorption of calcium and phosphorous depress protein synthesis decrease bone formation and impair wound healing /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT increase urinary excretion of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, and zinc increase blood glucose, serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol and blood pressure increase requirements for vitamin B/sixoldstyle, ascorbic acid, folate \u0003 and vitamin D increase risk of cataracts /twooldstyle. Sulphasalazine inhibits transport and absorption of folate decreases iron and serum folate increases urinary excretion of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) You're also going to need information on which glands, organs, etc. are also aected by your drug intake (your naturopathic doctor should be able to /f_igure this out by looking at the pharmaceutical printout on the drug) and then take the necessary herbal therapy or treatment to remedy the eects. For example, steroids suppress adrenal gland functioning and are taxing on the liver. So part of your treatment to heal the eects of this drug may include a herb to stimulate the adrenals, a herb to cleanse the liver and another one to strengthen it, and acupressure or acupuncture to further stimulate and strengthen the adrenals and liver. Make an appointment with a good naturopathic doctor (N.D.) and take in the list of drugs you're on or have been on in the last two years, and he/she will be able to advise you on which herbs to take. But remember, always trial-test new substances one at a time and follow your own intuition above all else. Also, you may want to wait until your digestive tract is reasonably healed - no intestinal bleeding and no more than /f_ive bowel movements per day - before starting any additional herbal therapy (i.e. other than those recommended in this chapter). Acupressure or acupuncture can be done at any time. We've had a lot of media hype and information about the importance of vitamins, but less attention has been given to minerals. However, due to de/f_icient and declining soil and water quality, it's actually harder now /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 to get a sucient amount of minerals from our diet. Also, many people with IBD tend towards a hyper-acidic bodily state and certain minerals act as alkalizing agents to bring your overall body's pH back into balance. Depending on how overly acidic your body is (i.e. low pH), you may need mega-doses of certain minerals to bring it back into balance. A good naturopathic physician will be able to test you for this using BTA (Biological Terrain Analysis), where the biochemistry of your blood, urine and saliva are all tested and compared. You get a much better picture of what's going on holistically with your body than you do from just regular blood tests. If Due to de/f_icient and you have diculty swallowing pills, you can take your minerals by crushing declining soil and water quality, them up /f_inely (use a pill-crusher, or mortar and pestle) and mixing them it's actually harder now to get with either oatmeal, yogurt, fruit juice or half a mashed banana.

Simply open the capsule and empty the contents into the blender with the supplement powder. Even if you don't need to gain weight, you may want to replace breakfast with a delicious liquid shake simply because it's such an eective way to absorb and digest your daily nutrients. You can also add other supplements at this time, like extra iron capsules, coenzyme Q/oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle, a tablespoon of Udo's Choice EFA oil, etc. See the section above on Malnutrition , and the Bowel Rest Elemental Diet section in Chapter /T_hree for more information on Absorb Plus and protein shakes. /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT In some regions you can get vitamins and minerals in a spray form and this also increases absorption - just watch out for any possible irritation to the tissue you're spraying, but unless you're super sensitive it should be /f_ine. Vitamins associated with lower Colon-Cancer risk A recent study has shown that supplements of multivitamins and vitamin E are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. American researchers assessed the frequency, duration, and daily dose of individual vitamin supple - ments and multivitamins, for a ten year interval ending two years before diagnosis of cancer. After controlling for other predictors of colon-cancer risk such as intake of dietary vitamins, alcohol, and /f_ibre, the risk of colon cancer was lower in men and women who took supplements of vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, calcium, and multivita - mins. But the association was strongest for vitamin E and multivitamins: people who used multivitamins daily for the entire /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-year interval had half the risk of those who had not taken multivi - tamins. Those who averaged /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle IU or more of vitamin E per day for the /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle years had a /five.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle risk reduction compared to non-users.

Or, you can buy online from www.LTYGshoppe.com . Again, try to get preparations from a certi/f_ied organic or wild source, plant derivatives are better than animal sources, and make sure the product has no added /f_illers (starch, sugar, yeast, etc.). A/f_ter literally years of searching, I have /f_inally found an adult chewable multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that's free of arti/f_icial sweeteners or /f_illers and actually tastes good: Nature's Plus Natural Pineapple Flavor Adult's Chewable Multi-Vitamin & Mineral (ingest /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle times per day). See Appendix C for supplier details. Again, take it at mealtimes to ensure absorption. I've found my body initially tolerates, on average, half the recommended dose for each of the vitamins and minerals that can cause diarrhea (see the list above). If you think this might be a problem then it's best to start slowly and gradually work your way up to the recommended dose or beyond it, if needed. However, if you simultaneously supplement with L-Glutamine, Psyllium Seed, or Bentonite Clay (see outlines above) these will greatly lessen your diarrhea and you may be able to ingest the normal dose right away. Vitamin and mineral supplementation is a vital part of giving your body the tools and energy it needs to heal itself. To make sure you're getting ideal amounts of all the vitamins and minerals necessary, I recommend the following easy daily supplementation plan: /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle SUPPLEMENTS & TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CHAPTER 2 High quality multi-vitamin/mineral supplement in capsule form, with extra vitamin A and B spectrum. /twooldstyle capsules of a fairly dissolvable mineral blend for extra mineral supplementation needed for vital bodily functions and to regulate acidity. /sixoldstyle/zerooldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle/zerooldstyle mg.

Many of the 'do's' and 'don'ts' are likely to be things you've already noticed aect your body positively or negatively. Like most people with an illness, you're going to have to resign yourself to giving up the junk food, chemical-laden, processed food, fast food diet you may be on. A \"normal\" western diet places tremendous stress on the digestive system and pollutes your body with all kinds of substances that irritate your gastrointestinal tract. ORGANIC FOOD AND BEVERAGES It is very important that you consider switching to certi/f_ied organic food and beverages as much as possible. /T_his includes meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruit, juices, bread, rice and all other grains - basically, anything you put in your mouth. Yes, this is a lot more expensive and will probably involve more hassle as you'll have to go to a special grocer. But again, is your health and wellbeing your number one priority, or not? Keep in mind that you don't have to put yourself in a prison about this. If you go out to eat with family or friends, just enjoy the food available and relax. Having a good time and relaxing is just as integral to wellness as the physical food you ingest. Meat & Dairy Products Non-organic meat is a major source of pollutants for your body because the animals are fed chemically grown and treated feed, they're given a steady diet of antibiotics to combat the unhealthy environment they're raised in and they're also given hormones to make them grow and mature faster for slaughter. All of these toxins are then ingested by you when you eat the meat. Certi/f_ied organic meat, on the other hand, is fed natural, organic feed, and not injected with antibiotics or hormones. Needless to say, this also means the animals have a better life prior to slaughter and are allowed to mature normally in a natural, free-range environment. You can see why /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 organic farmers need to charge more for their meat, but also why it is well worth it. Certi/f_ied organic milk, cheese and other dairy products are also far superior to non-organic because the non-organic cows are continually given hormones to unnaturally increase and prolong their milk production (in addition to pesticide and antibiotic consumption). /T_his means that non-organic (i.e. regular) milk and dairy products have very high levels of hormones in them. /T_he harmful eects of secondary hormone consumption A \"normal\" western diet places (via animal products) are not currently understood properly. However, there tremendous stress on the digestive is increasing research available showing the negative eects of estrogen- system and pollutes your body mimicking compounds (xenoestrogens) in plastics, and increased breast cancer rates have been shown, among other harmful eects. with all kinds of substances that irritate your gastrointestinal tract. Fruits & Vegetables As for certi/f_ied organic fruit and vegetables, let me give you a little example to show you the dierence. Let's take a look at the typical growing and storage cycle of a non-organic potato. First the soil is mixed with a chemical fertilizer so that the seed potatoes from the beginning of their growth cycle are absorbing toxic chemicals. During the above-ground growth cycle of the potato plants, they will probably be sprayed with chemical pesticides at least twice. /T_hese pesticides are directly absorbed by the plant and also leach into the soil in which it's growing. A/f_ter harvest, some of the potatoes are shipped directly to grocery stores, the rest of them are sealed in an airtight storage container. /T_hese stored potatoes are then blasted with a toxic gas designed to kill anything it comes into contact with (to prevent decay). /T_he potatoes sit, surrounded by and absorbing this poisonous gas in the sealed, airtight container, until they're shipped to the stores and sold for your consumption. Certi/f_ied organic potatoes, by comparison, are grown in naturally fertilized soil, no pesticides or chemicals of any sort are used during the growing cycle of the plant and a/f_ter harvest they remain untreated and natural. When you buy a certi/f_ied organic potato at the grocery store you get a /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT plain, natural potato with no added chemicals, toxins or poisons. I think you may be beginning to comprehend why it makes sense to pay extra for certi/f_ied organic food. Remember, you need to create a healthy, supportive environment that helps your body to heal itself - not one that makes it harder and poisons your body with even more toxins to process. Make Sure It's Certi/f_ied You may notice that several times I've used the term 'certi/f_ied organic' Notes: instead of just 'organic'. /T_his is because, unfortunately, some states and provinces have no regulations governing organic food and there's nothing to prevent an unscrupulous grocer or supplier from just slapping the label \"organic\" on a product that's actually full of chemicals. However, if you buy food and produce that's labeled \"certi/f_ied organic\" (and the regulatory board will also probably be listed) you can be pretty certain you're getting what you're paying for. Typically, \"certi/f_ied organic\" produce means that the soil has been free of prohibited pesticides and chemical fertilizers for at least three years; with regard to meat it means the animals have been fed certi/f_ied organic feed and not given hormones or antibiotics. Organic Food = Healthier Rats A /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle study done by the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences and the School of Agriculture at the University of Newcastle, compared the results between rats fed a diet of organic food since weaning and rats fed conventional food. Scientists found that, compared to rats that ate conventional diets, organically fed rats experienced various health bene/f_its: Improved immune system status Better sleeping habits Less adipose tissue (fat) Higher vitamin E content in their blood Of course, rats are not human, but the results are certainly meaningful. /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 I hope I've impressed upon you the importance of eating organic food and beverages. However, as with anything we \"should\" do, when it comes time to actually implement it in our lives, several other factors can come into play. If you have a choice between eating lunch at work or taking an organic packed lunch from home, then pack your own lunch - as long as it doesn't stress you out. It's better to eat one organic meal a day in a happy and relaxed state, than to eat three organic meals a day simultaneously feeling stressed out and unhappy over the amount of time you've spent preparing food. Our goal is to reduce toxins ingested, so whatever amount of organic Remember, you need to create food you can consume is better than none. a healthy, supportive environment that helps your body to heal itself Shopping For Organic Food - not one that makes it harder and As consumer awareness increases, we are seeing more foods in regular poisons your body with even more grocery stores with labels like, \"No arti/f_icial preservatives or additives\", or toxins to process. \"No sugar added\". /T_his is a good trend as it's also bringing down the price of pure foods. Remember that every little bit helps, so if you absolutely cannot aord organic food or you can't get it where you live, then start at your local supermarket and buy the purest of what they're stocking. Here are some guidelines: Hothouse tomatoes and other vegetables tend to be grown with less chemicals than outdoor varieties. You can get a natural vegetable/fruit wash product that will remove some of the pesticide residues from the skin of fruits and vegetables. Whenever possible, peel your non-organic produce before cooking or eating. In my opinion, it's more important to eat organic meat, eggs, and dairy, than organic vegetables and fruit. Also, you may want to look at scaling back your meat consumption and eating less meat and more vegetables - not only is this good for your health, but it will considerably bring down your food bills. For years when I would eat at my parents' house I couldn't believe the portions of meat they ate at /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Pesticides are directly absorbed by plants and also leach into the soil in which they're growing. Water run-o from the soil then carries these pesticides into our rivers, lake and oceans, where they further damage our wildlife and environment. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT one sitting - I used to say to my mum, \"you know, the amount of chicken on your plate alone would feed three of us at my house.\" Unsurprisingly, my mum and dad both developed very high blood pressure. In the last year, my mum has cut way back on their meat consumption and sometimes serves entirely vegetarian meals and now her blood pressure is normal. My dad still smokes and drinks quite a bit however, so his blood pressure hasn't seen such marked results! However, if reducing your meat intake is going to cause you to increase your bread, pasta, potatoes, and other starchy carbohydrates intake - then don't do it. Of the two scenarios, for someone with IBS or IBD, it's better to eat more meat and less starchy carbohydrates. If you can reduce your meat consumption and increase your non-starchy vegetable consumption, then that's ideal. RESTRICTIONS & GUIDELINES Here are some issues that may or may not be applicable to your situation. Keep in mind that all of /T_he Healing Diets following assume you have read and incorporated these suggestions into your dietary practice. Preserving The Nutritive Value Of Food In order to get the highest level of nutrition from your food, in the most easily digestible form, it's best to eat fresh meats and vegetables and cook them in a conventional oven or stovetop. Eating raw foods is de/f_initely bene/f_icial and usually contains the highest amount of live enzymes. However, until your system is quite healed you may /f_ind it dicult, if not impossible, to tolerate raw foods. /T_he best way to cook vegetables for maximum nutrient retention is to steam them. You can do this using a steaming basket suspended in a pot with water on the stove, or you can buy a steamer that you just /f_ill with water and plug it in - both ways are equally easy. Otherwise, if you boil vegetables in water, make sure you use the least amount of water (/f_iltered, not tap) possible as this will help reduce nutrient loss. Most of us put far too much water in the pot - usually you only need the water to come about half way up the vegetables and then cover the pot with a lid to produce a 'steaming' eect (turn the heat down low). If you can /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 either drink this cooking water, or use it in a soup, sauce or stew, that's ideal. See Chapter Four for detailed instructions on what kind of pots and pans to use, and why you should never use a microwave. Eliminating Sugar White sugar (and brown sugar) also interfere with your healing process. Numerous clinical studies have shown that the immune system stays markedly depressed for /four.oldstyle - /eight.oldstyle hours following the consumption of even a small amount of sugar. /T_herefore, it's best to reduce or eliminate as much re/f_ined, unnecessary sugar from your diet as possible. /T_his means: Drink only fresh, natural juices with no added sugar and even then, dilute with \u00bd water to reduce sugar intake. Switch to all-fruit sugarless jams and jellies (sweetened with grape juice or fructose - the naturally occurring sugar in fruit). Reduce or stop putting sugar in your tea. Use honey, stevia or pure maple syrup instead of sugar wherever possible, especially in baking. Where you must have sugar, use brown Rapadura sugar. Rapadura (sometimes called turbinado sugar) is the most natural-state form of sugar available. Most other brown sugars are first bleached and then dyed brown again - using molasses or an artificial coloring agent. Always check labels (especially on canned foods) to ensure there's no added sugar, or artifical sweeteners. Switch to natural cereals flavored with honey, rice syrup, molasses, fruit juice, or fructose (the naturally occurring sugar in fruits). When you're cooking oatmeal or any other hot cereal, add raisins and/or chopped apples towards the end of cooking, and they'll automatically sweeten it for you so you won't have to add much (if any) additional sweetener. Notes: Fructose (a natural fruit sugar) has been getting some negative media coverage lately. However, the media reports do not distinguish between /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson High fructose corn syrup causes great spikes in blood sugar and disrupts normal insulin production and response. Regular fructose does not impair insulin function and in fact, actually improves insulin response. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT regular fructose and high fructose corn syrup. Regular fructose is o/f_ten extracted from corn (since it's a sweet vegetable), but, high fructose corn syrup is fructose that's been extracted from corn, and then combined with glucose to produce a completely dierent substance. Research shows that consuming high fructose corn syrup causes great spikes in blood sugar and disrupts normal insulin production and response. /T_herefore, I don't recommend you consume it. Be sure and check labels as it's o/f_ten added to drinks, cereals and other packaged foods. However, regular fructose does not impair insulin function and in fact, actually improves insulin response. Fructose is not transported directly into the bloodstream a/f_ter digestion and absorption, but is converted into glycogen in the liver, where it is stored and used for energy at a later time. A recent trial demonstrated that no increase is seen in blood glucose a/f_ter ingestion of fructose at /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle grams or less. /T_his lowered glycemic response with fructose ingestion appeared to be most eective in those individuals who had the poorest glucose tolerance pro/f_iles. In non-diabetic individuals, fructose consumption results in little to no discernable rise in blood insulin levels./one.superior Because fructose must be changed to glucose in the liver in order to be utilized by the body, blood glucose levels do not rise as rapidly a/f_ter fructose consumption compared to other simple sugars or even complex carbohydrates. For example, the glycemic load calculation for /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle grams of fructose is only /two.oldstyle. In comparison, the glycemic load for a slice of bread is /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle, an apple is /seven.oldstyle, and a cup of white rice is /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle. My philosophy is to save your sugar for when it really counts. If you eliminate most of the unnecessary sugars from your diet, then you can enjoy that occasional chocolate bar or sugar-packed piece of cake without feeling guilty. /T_he good news about all of these restrictions is that when you switch to doing your grocery shopping at a natural/ whole foods/ organic grocery store, most of the products they carry will already conform to these guidelines; no added sugar, no preservatives, chemicals, MSG, nitrates, nitrites, etc. Still, you should check the labels just to make sure. /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/two.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Reduce Grains/Carbohydrates If you have IBS or IBD, there's a good chance you also have an overgrowth of yeast ( Candida albicans ) in your body. Yeast loves to feed on sugars, and all carbohydrates - when broken down via digestion - are sugars. /T_herefore, it's almost always a good idea for people with IBS or IBD to reduce their grain and starchy carbohydrate intake and increase their intake of protein, non-starchy vegetables, and good fats. Grains include wheat, rice, corn, amaranth, quinoa, cous-cous, millet, oats, rye, barley, kamut, spelt, etc. Other carbohydrates to reduce or avoid include potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, beans, legumes, and fruit. If you suspect a Candida overgrowth, you also need to avoid fermented foods such as soy sauce, tempeh, natto, miso, cheese, alcohol, vinegar, sauerkraut, pickles etc. as well as mushrooms and sugar alcohols (sweeteners like xylitol, sorbitol, etc.). Once you have no more symptoms of bowel dysfunction and you have restored a healthy bacterial /f_lora to your gut, you can begin to eat these foods again. When you do eat grains, try to eat other varieties like millet, spelt, rye, amaranth, quinoa, and kamut, instead of just eating wheat all the time. Health stores now carry many dierent varieties of bread and pasta made from spelt, kamut and rye. For myself, I still continue to minimize grains and starchy vegetables like potatoes, just because my gut tells me to. Sometimes I won't eat bread at all - other times I'll minimize intake by having an open-face sandwich (for example), thereby consuming one slice of bread, rather than two. Likewise, I continue to minimize sugar consumption and use Stevia (a natural herb that is /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle times sweeter than sugar) as much as possible. Sucient Water Intake People with IBD and IBS tend to need more water due to increased bowel movements and/or the need to /f_lush toxins and drug residues. Make sure you're getting at least /eight.oldstyle - /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle glasses of water per day. Spring water is ideal Re/f_ined Carbs Increase Colon Cancer Researchers in Italy conducted a multi-centre case-control study including /one.oldstyle,/nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/three.oldstyle cases and /four.oldstyle,/one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/four.oldstyle hospitalised controls. Subjects from /six.oldstyle Italian regions were interviewed, using a food frequency question - naire, over a period of /four.oldstyle years. Results showed that individuals with the highest consumption of re/f_ined bread had a /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle higher risk of colorectal cancer than those with the lowest. For re/f_ined sugar, an increase of one serving (/four.oldstyle teaspoons) per day showed an /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle increase in colorectal cancer risk. Both results remained statistically signi/f_icant after adjust - ment for confounders. Eating either raw or cooked vegetables showed a protective eect. An increase of one serving of vegetables per day resulted in a /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle reduction in risk. Franceschi, S .et al, Eur. J. of Cancer Prevention /seven.oldstyle (Suppl /two.oldstyle) S/one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle-S/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle. since it contains natural minerals that help alkalize your body, but /f_iltered is okay. Do not drink tap water as it is o/f_ten contaminated with pathogenic /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson People in disease states need a lot of extra protein and without it, your body can't heal properly. Therefore, if you're vegetarian, you'll also need to supplement daily with whey protein or hemp protein shakes. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT microorganisms and/or chlorine, which will kill o the good bacteria in your gut. Also do not drink carbonated, or '/f_izzy' water as it will likely bloat your gut and the carbonation leaches minerals from your bones. A great book on the importance of drinking water is Dr. F Batmanghelidj's book, Your Body's Many Cries for Water . Mealtimes Remember that the way and manner in which you consume your food can be almost as important as what you're eating. Always take the time and peace necessary to sit down and relax while you're enjoying your food. Don't discuss sensitive or emotional issues right before, during, or right a/f_ter a meal. Ask your friend, family, or spouse to please wait until later, when you'll be more than happy to discuss the issue. Remember that digestion begins with the enzymes in your saliva, so take the time to eat slowly and thoroughly chew each mouthful before swallowing. If these guidelines seem tedious to you, just give it a chance and you'll soon be enjoying your food and mealtimes as a wonderful time to relax and savor. Vegetarianism If you're a vegetarian, you're going to have to make sure you're getting an adequate intake of nutrients, particularly since beans, lentils and the entire cabbage family (onions, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauli/f_lower, etc.) are not allowed on most of /T_he Healing Diets . To make up for the prohibited beans, vegetables and cheese, you'll need to make sure you're eating plenty of cous - cous, brown rice and more nutritious grains and pastas like kamut (has /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle more protein than wheat), amaranth and quinoa. Vegetarians also need an alternative source of protein since dairy products (except certain types of whey protein) are not allowed, or restricted on most of the Diets. /T_herefore, if you're vegetarian, you'll also need to supplement daily with whey protein or hemp protein shakes. People in disease states need a lot of extra protein and without it, your body can't heal properly. I even recommend that meat eaters ingest one whey protein isolate shake per day since the protein is alkaline and highly absorbable. If you don't want to eat these other sources of protein and iron, then you may want to consider eating meat until /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/four.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 your body is healed to the point where you're completely o drugs, have acceptable hemoglobin levels, no more than three formed bowel movements per day, and no cramping or bleeding. At that point, you'll be able to eat beans, lentils and whatever other vegetables you want and so can probably become a vegetarian again, if you wish. High Fibre & Raw Foods I know there are many dieticians and naturopaths who recommend a high /f_ibre diet as the best therapy for people with IBS and IBD. I'm sorry, Your intestines need to be but I must disagree with them. When your intestines are in an in/f_lamed, fairly healthy before you'll be able aggravated state, they simply cannot digest and absorb the nutrients to digest high /f_ibre or raw foods from high /f_ibre foods (whole grains, legumes, dark green leafy vegetables, properly. Even raw vegetable juices celery, etc.). In fact, if you eat these foods you'll probably /f_ind the result is can trigger diarrhea. /f_latulence (gas), bloating, diarrhea and sometimes a trigger or increase in intestinal bleeding. However, a/f_ter you've used /T_he Healing Diets to heal yourself, you can most certainly start consuming high /f_ibre and cabbage family (cruciferous) foods again. In terms of preserving and maintaining intestinal health I highly recommend these whole, unre/f_ined foods. But, your intestines need to be fairly healthy before you'll be able to digest these foods properly. For myself, a/f_ter following /T_he Healing Diets for two years (keep in mind I was testing and developing them simultaneously) I was able to start eating onions, broccoli, beans, wild rice and all kinds of high /f_ibre and raw foods again with absolutely no bloating or gas as a result. Yes, dietary freedom is possible! But /f_irst you need to heal your system and bring your digestive and absorptive abilities up to normal - or at least close to it. Likewise, once you're healed, you want to eat as many raw foods as you can. When you consume raw vegetables and fruits (preferably naturally ripened before picking) you will receive the maximum amount of live enzymes, phytonutrients, vitamins and minerals possible. However, until your digestive system is fairly healed (especially if your stomach and small intestine are compromised) it is dicult to digest raw foods; they can be irritating and cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. /T_herefore, until you reach /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: the Maintenance Diet , I recommend you cook all vegetables, and on some of the diets you'll need to cook fruit as well. If you want to try juicing raw vegetables, then start with really small amounts, otherwise you may /f_ind they trigger diarrhea. Soy Products I recommend that all people (from infants to adults) avoid or greatly minimize unfermented soy product consumption - this includes tofu, soybeans, soybean oil, soy milk, soy protein, etc. You especially need to read the labels on vegetarian processed foods as many are composed predominantly of some form of soy or soy protein. Here's why I recommend you avoid consuming unfermented soy products: Soy contains very high amounts of phyto-estrogens (plant based chemicals that mimic estrogen). The daily exposure of infants who consume soy formulas is /six.oldstyle - /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle times higher than adults consuming soy foods, and the concentration of these phyto-estrogen hormones in the blood is /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle to /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle times higher than normal estrogen./two.superior This is detrimental both from a hormonal/glandular balance point of view and also from an 'increased propensity to breast, uterine and cervical cancer' point of view. The phytic acid naturally contained in soy inhibits mineral absorption and depresses thyroid function. These are both very harmful factors for normal people, but especially so for people with IBS and IBD. Soybeans contain enzyme inhibitors that block the action of trypsin and other enzymes needed for protein digestion. These enzyme inhibitors can produce gastric distress, reduce protein digestion and result in chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake. In test animals, diets high in trypsin inhibitors caused enlargement and pathological conditions of the pancreas, including cancer./three.superior Fermented soy products, like natto, miso, tempeh and soy sauce, are /f_ine to consume and actually bene/f_icial, since the fermentation process greatly reduces the phytic acid, and deactivates the enzyme inhibitors. As well, your /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/six.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 phyto-estrogen intake, in the amounts you'd normally eat of these foods, would be fairly low. For many more excellent articles on why you should not consume unfermented soy (or only a minimal amount) see www.mercola. com - in particular, read the article by Sally Fallon and Mary G. Enig , PhD. If you've been using soy as a dairy substitute, try switching to rice milk or goat's milk instead. Almond milk is also good but you may have to make your own as I've been thus far unable to /f_ind a commercial product that doesn't have added carrageenan. If you've been using soy as a protein source, The farmed salmon are fed then good alternatives include cold-extracted, whey protein isolate, cheddar food pellets that have been cheese made from raw milk, and hemp protein. chemically dyed orange, otherwise Wild vs. Farmed Salmon the farmed salmon would be grey Before you buy salmon or order it in a restaurant, con/f_irm that the salmon in color - what does that tell you is wild, not farmed. Farmed salmon is an unhealthy food choice and the about the health and abnormal salmon farms are causing serious damage to the ocean environment and conditions of these /f_ish? wild salmon populations.

Farmed salmon, like many commercially farmed animals, are unhealthy (due to con/f_inement and overcrowding) and o/f_ten covered in sea lice. To get rid of the lice, veterinary substances designed to be used on land animals are released into the pens and then /f_low out into the ocean - with unknown consequences. Every so o/f_ten, these lice-infested /f_ish break out of their pens and infect wild salmon (particularly the young /f_ish), who then die. Farmed salmon also have much lower levels of bene/f_icial Omega-/three.oldstyle fatty acids - one of the principle reasons why eating salmon is so good for people. Obviously, an unhealthy /f_ish is not going to deliver the same health bene/f_its to the person who eats it, as a healthy /f_ish will. Farmed salmon also have higher levels of contaminants (like PCB's, mercury, etc.) than wild salmon, probably because they're /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT penned close to shore where toxin levels are higher. So, at all times, check that the salmon is wild (not farmed) before consuming. If you're going to eat salmon sashimi or other raw /f_ish, make sure the /f_ish has been frozen for /three.oldstyle - /seven.oldstyle days prior to consumption. Freezing the /f_ish for that length of time causes the worms (anisakiasis, diphyllobothrium) that may be in the /f_ish to die. /T_here is also a simple 'candle test' you can do to check for worms in the sashimi. Simply hold the /f_ish up to a candle and any worms will appear as round, coiled occlusions in the /f_lesh. Also check to Notes: make sure the restaurant uses wild salmon, not farmed. Mercury In Fish Some /f_ish are now also contaminated with unacceptably high levels of mercury. Mercury is an extremely damaging substance, especially since it is able to cross the blood/brain barrier. /T_he Environmental Protection Agency has released these guidelines to minimize human mercury contamination through seafood: /one.oldstyle. Do not eat Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury. /two.oldstyle. Only eat up to /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle ounces (/two.oldstyle average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury, i.e. don't eat seafood more than twice a week. /three.oldstyle. Five of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are shrimp, canned light tuna, wild salmon, pollock, and catfish. /four.oldstyle. Another commonly eaten fish, albacore (\"white\") tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna. So, when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to /six.oldstyle ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week.* /five.oldstyle. Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas.

Follow these same recommendations when feeding fish and shellfish to your young child, but serve smaller portions. *Many other environmental groups now feel that albacore tuna has moved into the \u0003 'high mercury' category as well.

It could also be called 'The Common Sense Diet' and this should be your ongoing, normal diet for the rest of your life. Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet - if you have no diarrhea, but experience bloating, gas, flatulence, constipation, indigestion and/or belching, then follow this diet till your symptoms resolve. Reduce Diarrhea Diet - use this diet if you're having gas and bloating symptoms along with five or more bowel movements per day. Or, if you're just experiencing diarrhea. You can also follow this diet if you're bleeding from your rectum only. Stop Intestinal Bleeding Diet - this is a very strict, bland diet to be used in conjunction with the appropriate supplements (outlined in Chapter Two) to stop bleeding from your stomach, small intestine or large /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT If you switch diets and experience a recurrence of symptoms, it means that you've switched too soon. intestine. It is not necessary to follow this diet if your bleeding is from your rectum only (in that case just follow the Reduce Diarrhea Diet ). Bowel Rest Elemental Diet - this is a completely liquid, pre-digested diet and usually used when you're so ill that you're facing surgery, or you're facing, or already on TPN (total parenteral nutrition), or you're currently receiving elemental food through a shunt (tube that goes directly into your stomach). Alternatively, it can be used as a fast way to clear symptoms, gain weight, induce disease remission and test for food sensitivities/allergies. Use whichever diet corresponds to where you're at in your healing process. You may need to switch back and forth between diets depending on how you're doing each month and the stress levels in your life. Let your symptoms be your guide and choose the diet according to your most severe symptom. For example, if you're experiencing excessive gas, bloating and diarrhea, then follow the Reduce Diarrhea Diet . Once you have the diarrhea under control, switch to the more lenient Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet . When you're no longer experiencing any /f_latulence or bloating, switch to the Maintenance Diet . If you switch diets and experience a recurrence of symptoms, it means that you've switched too soon. Go back to the stricter diet for another few months and then try the more lenient diet again. As well, as you become more in tune with your body, you'll be able to sense if your system's getting run down or aggravated due to stress and then you can switch right away to one of the stricter diets. /T_his will help you to prevent /f_lare-ups before they manifest full-blown in your body. /T_here are Quick Reference Guides for each Diet listed at the end of this chapter. /T_hese Quick Reference Guides summarize each of the diet guidelines on one page, making them easy to refer to at a glance. I've also made these one-page Quick Reference Guides available to you on the Listen To Your Gut CD , so you can print them out and tack them up on your fridge. You can also take a copy with you when you go grocery shopping, or out to restaurants to aid you in your food selection. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 All of /T_he Healing Diets have the following guidelines or principles in common: No processed foods containing nitrates/nitrites, preservatives, MSG, carrageenan, artificial flavors or colors. There is a new class of chemicals that have just been released which are 'flavor blockers or enhancers' and these work by blocking or stimulating receptors on your brain associated with certain tastes and flavors. This means that a food company could release 'reduced salt' potato chips (for example) Processed Food and IBD that taste just as salty as regular potato chips - because they're Sulphate-reducing bacteria can using a 'salt enhancer' chemical that tells your brain there's proliferate in the colon as a result \u0003 more salt in the chips then there actually is.

In fact, homogenized milk has been shown to destroy plasmalogen \u0003 (which makes up /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the membrane system in human heart cells) \u0003 resulting in atherosclerosis. Raw milk (milk that has not been heated or \u0003 homogenized) however, has not been denatured and still contains the \u0003 beneficial enzymes and bacteria that help your body to digest and absorb \u0003 it properly. Cheddar made from raw milk (available in many natural \u0003 food stores) is a good place to start testing, as it is tolerated by many \u0003 /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT people who cannot tolerate pasteurized milk products. To find a raw milk supplier in your area, go to www.realmilk.com . You can also read more about this issue on the website and the site will point you to other relevant resources. I eat raw milk cheddar all the time with no problems and it is an excellent source of calcium and protein. I can't get raw milk where I live, so haven't been able to test that, but I suspect I would be fine with it. Pasteurized milk, however, will often cause me to have a bowel movement within an hour of consumption. The odd time my kids insist Notes: on drinking cow's milk (because they've had it at friends' houses and realize it tastes pretty darn good!), I mix in a \u00bc tsp. of Megadophilus or Bifido They can't taste any difference (because it's dairy-based) and the probiotics help them digest the milk better and avoid bloating. Reducing or eliminating acidic foods; tomatoes, citrus fruits and juices, tomato-based sauces and condiments, vinegar-based sauces and condiments, etc. (dependant upon your sensitivity and until your system can handle them). People whose mucosal lining is inflamed or ulcerated are very sensitive to anything acidic, so best to avoid acidic foods and beverages until inflammation and ulceration is healed. No caffeine. Caffeine inhibits the absorption of vitamin C and leaches calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and trace minerals from the body, and it stimulates bowel movements. Coffee is the worst thing you could drink; it really aggravates the colon in particular. A fantastic herbal coffee substitute is Bambu by Bioforce Inc. (available in many health stores, or online), but you'll still need to test it to make sure it doesn't aggravate your colon or cause heartburn. Even de-caffeinated coffee is not tolerated well and can result in cramping or increased bowel movements. Pure hot chocolate may be okay (test it and see), but make it with \u00be water and only \u00bc milk. No alcohol. Alcohol is also extremely acidic and therefore very irritating to the mucosal lining of the stomach and intestines. Once you're healed and on the Maintenance Diet you may want to test small amounts - but /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 try to stick to wine or beer and avoid all hard liquor. If you've adjusted fine to getting along without alcohol, then why drink at all? There are no health benefits to consuming alcohol, only negatives. If you need the 'drug' aspect of it, then personally, I feel marijuana (in small and infrequent amounts) does less damage to your health than alcohol. Personally, I consume neither. No carbonated drinks (e.g., soda pop). Carbonated drinks are packed with sugar, artificial flavors and colors. Even if you buy natural carbonated beverages, or plain soda water, the carbonation still leaches minerals from your bones (especially calcium) and produces gas and bloating in your abdomen. Emergen-C vitamin C drink packets are an excellent alternative to carbonated drinks since the mineral ascorbates go a bit fizzy when you add water and they taste as good, if not better, than a soda. No hydrogenated oils/fats. During the processing of commercial vege- table oils, they are heated to the point where their molecular structure is altered (similar to margarine) resulting in trans-fatty acids that damage cell walls and DNA. Margarine (and some other butter substitutes) is treated with chemical solvents and bleaches resulting in deformed, highly toxic, trans-fatty acids. These trans-fatty acids are also suspected carcinogens. No artificial sweeteners. Aspartame has the largest list of complaints and adverse reactions of any substance listed with the FDA. Aspartame has been proven to cause memory loss, can also be highly addictive and cause seizures and hyperactivity in some people. There is also a large body of mounting evidence against sucralose (Splenda), saccharine and acesulfame-K. An Internet search using the keywords \"dangers of [name of sweetener]\" can bring up lots of research on any one of them, pointing out the dangers and adverse reactions reported to date. /T_he best sugar alternative that has virtually no calories and is actually bene/f_icial to your body is a plant extract called Stevia. Stevia is /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle natural and is /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-/three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle times sweeter than sugar. Xylitol is also another People whose mucosal lining is inflamed or ulcerated are very sensitive to anything acidic, so best to avoid acidic foods and beverages until inflammation and ulceration is healed. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT natural sweetener that works well, however Xylitol also /f_lushes bacteria and prevents them from adhering to mucous membranes. /T_his is a bene/f_it if you're using Xylitol as a nasal spray (for example) during a cold, however, for ongoing use it's not a good idea as it will interfere with the necessary good bacteria colonizing your body. In small amounts, occasionally, Xylitol is okay. Stevia can be used any time and in any amounts you wish and it is now available in many forms in health stores and grocery stores. Notes: Reducing roughage and cabbage family vegetables, until your system can handle them. Roughage includes any type of bran, husk, or insoluble fibre (raw fruit, raw vegetables, sprouts, seeds, celery, green leafy vegetables). Certain other vegetables and fruit like grapes, blueberries, cherries, celery, corn, bell peppers also have a tough 'skin' that is very hard to digest and should be avoided, or removed before cooking and eating. Cabbage (or cruciferous) family vegetables should also be avoided and these include garlic, onions, leeks, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cabbage. These foods will cause lots of gas and bloating until your mucosal lining is healed and your bacterial flora normalized. You also won't be able to digest them properly or absorb the nutrients from them until your digestive system is fairly healed, and will see lots of undigested particles floating in your stools, so there's no point in consuming them until you're healed enough to switch to the Maintenance Diet . /T_herefore, you'll notice that each of the diets has numerous 'Do's' and 'Don'ts' in common. /T_he Stop Intestinal Bleeding Diet has the greatest number of 'Don'ts' and the list gets progressively shorter (or less strict) as you move to the Reduce Diarrhea Diet , then the Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet. Finally, the Maintenance Diet has the smallest number of 'Don'ts' and is the most lenient of all /T_he Healing Diets . /T_he Bowel Rest Elemental Diet is in a class by itself as it doesn't involve ingesting normal food at all. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE Food Combining If you have severe or widespread Crohn's (particularly if in/f_lammation is present in your stomach and/or small intestine), you may have a higher degree of success with these diets if you also practice proper food combining at the same time (fully outlined in the book, Fit For Life, by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond). /T_he basic tenet that should be followed is simply to not mix your proteins with your starch, or, complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides). /T_he premise for this practice is that the digestive process for protein is very dierent, requiring dierent enzymes and fermentation times, from that of starch. /T_herefore, eating the two together at the same time results in neither being digested or absorbed with maximum eciency. It's okay to eat protein with simple carbohydrates as the sugars in their mono and disaccharide molecular chains are easily broken down and absorbed directly into the bloodstream. To practice proper food combining, you're going to need some knowledge of which foods classify as complex carbohydrates and which are simple carbohydrates. Following are a few examples to get you started. For a complete list and recipe/meal ideas, pick up the Fit For Life book: Complex Carbohydrates Bread, cereals, pasta, cakes, cookies, biscuits, crackers, etc. Any grains; wheat, rye, corn, bran, oats, barley, rice, cous-cous, amaranth, millet, quinoa, etc. Potatoes, yams, parsnips Peas, beans, chick peas, sprouted beans, lentils * All of the above should not be eaten with proteins/meats. Simple Carbohydrates Carrots, zucchini, asparagus Acorn, butternut or spaghetti squash Lettuce, leafy green vegetables (spinach, bok choy, etc.) CHAPTER 3 If you have severe or widespread Crohn's (particularly if in/f_lammation is present in your stomach and/or small intestine), you may have a higher degree of success with these diets if you also practice proper food combining at the same time. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Your child needs to feel positive and has to want to follow these diets, or there's no point in pursuing them. If someone feels they're being forced to eat a certain way and feels anger and resentment at mealtimes, then the food is not going to bene/f_it their body very much. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Tomatoes, cucumber, mushrooms Red, green, yellow, orange peppers * All of the above may be eaten with proteins/meats. Elaine Gottschall's book, initially called Food And /T_he Gut Reaction and later renamed Breaking the Vicious Cycle , also follows proper food combin - ing principles. So if you have her book you can use it as a food category guide and for recipe ideas as well. All the allowable carbohydrates in her book are simple carbohydrates. Not mixing your proteins and starches (complex carbohydrates) will probably feel really weird at /f_irst since we come from such a \"meat and potatoes\" culture. Eventually, I found myself enjoying just a piece of steak or chicken with gravy (the gravy - just water added to drippings in the pan - is also classi/f_ied as a protein) for one meal and at the next meal having some vegetables on their own with a bit of butter and salt. I also started learning to cook squash and to think of squash (mashed, cubed, fried, etc.) instead of potatoes. It's a hassle when you eat out, but like anything, you'll adjust to the point where your food choices are automatic. Some people have found that it's okay to eat rice with protein, so a/f_ter you've been food combining for a month or two, you may want to give it a try and see if it's okay for you. You may want to follow just /T_he Healing Diet guidelines to begin with, and once you're comfortable and have adjusted to that change, then implement the food combining rules, if you still need to. As I've said, if you have Crohn's in the stomach and/or small intestine, you may bene/f_it from practicing proper food combining whilst on /T_he Healing Diets . However, if that's too much hassle for you, rest assured that you will still experience substantial relief just from following /T_he Healing Diets alone (in conjunction with the therapies in Chapter Two). Implementation If you're the parent of a child with IBD, please take the time necessary to explain to your child why you're changing his/her diet and why that's a good idea. Again, your child needs to feel positive and has to want to /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 follow these diets, or there's no point in pursuing them. If someone feels they're being forced to eat a certain way and feels anger and resentment at mealtimes, then the food is not going to bene/f_it their body very much. Remember that the emotions can aect intestinal health just as much as anything we eat or drink. Also, due to the strong evidence for genetic predisposition to IBD, other family members (particularly children) should follow the Maintenance Diet as a preventive measure. Please keep in mind that everyone's body is dierent and there may be things that I advise you not to eat that you can actually tolerate quite well. Likewise, there may be foods that I say are okay that don't feel good to you at all. For example, I allow potatoes and bread in /T_he Healing Diets because I don't /f_ind them harmful. However, my personal intuitive sense is to keep these foods to a minimum and o/f_ten I'll take a break and not eat them for a few weeks or months at a time. Our bodies are unique, /f_inely tuned composites embodying all the complexity and variety of who we are. No one else's body is going to be or function exactly like yours. So, at all times, keep your own body as your /f_inal authority or decision maker in what's right, or not right for you. /T_he Healing Diets are also for you to use while you're simultaneously weaning yourself o prescription drugs. See Chapter Five for more information about the weaning process. For this reason, you'll probably need to switch back and forth between the diets because as you wean yourself o drugs, your symptoms will temporarily worsen as your body adjusts to the change. Here's what the cycle looks like: You reduce your drug intake and your symptoms worsen, so you switch to a stricter diet to get those symptoms in hand. /T_hen you level out for a while, so you switch back to the more lenient diet, then you reduce your drug intake again and your symptoms temporarily worsen again, so you switch back to the stricter diet. And this cycle continues until you're completely drug-free and then the natural, deep healing of your body can begin. Dependent upon a myriad of factors (length of time you've had IBD, length and intensity of drug use, amount of toxins in your environment and Notes: /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Since we are all dierent beings, have dierent rates of change, and respond dierently to the same stimulus, there is no cut and dried timetable for the healing of your IBD or IBS. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT diet, exercise or lack thereof, use of companion healing therapies, mental/ emotional state, etc.) you may only need to use these diets for six months or less and be healed enough to switch to the Maintenance Diet , or you may need to stay with them for two years or more. Everything in our body/ mind/spirit is interconnected. All of the parts aect the whole. If you follow these diets, but implement none of the other changes recommended in this book, you may need to follow these diets for the next /f_ive years. /T_he point I'm trying to make is that since we are all dierent beings, have dierent rates of change, and respond dierently to the same stimulus, there is no cut and dried timetable for the healing of your IBD or IBS. /T_his is your unique process, your healing journey, and it's going to be speci/f_ic to you and be a little or a lot dierent from anyone else's. /T_his is why I keep encouraging you to listen to your body, let your own body be your guide and follow your own intuition above anything else. Maintenance Diet When you're healed to the point where you're feeling quite good, are not taking any drugs and having fairly normal bowel movements (formed stool that stays in the bottom of the toilet, not more than /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle bowel movements per day, minimal or no cramping and certainly no intestinal bleeding), this does not mean you should go back to eating and living however you want. Your body has demonstrated to you that your digestive system is your genetic weak link, or stress outlet. You will probably always need to take special care of your digestive system. If you have fairly mild IBS, this diet alone may be sucient to keep your symptoms in check. I also recommend that children of people with IBD/IBS follow this diet as a preventive measure due to the strong evidence of a genetic (hereditary) component with these diseases. /T_herefore, make it part of your lifestyle, or second-nature, to avoid the following as much as possible: Alcohol - very acidic. If you must have alcohol, then have non- pasteurized beer (available from many micro-breweries). /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE Caffeine - blocks absorption of vitamin C, leaches minerals and stimulates bowel movements. Even de-caeinated coee is not tolerated well. Pure hot chocolate may be okay, but make it with \u00be water and only \u00bc milk. Carbonated drinks - you certainly don't need more gas, sugar or caffeine in your system. Anything containing MSG (interferes with neural functioning) or carrageenan (used in large quantities to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates in clinical trials). Margarine or butter substitutes - these are treated with chemical sol - vents and bleaches resulting in deformed, highly toxic, trans-fatty acids. Hot, spicy foods. Artificial colors or flavors - especially since the introduction of neural flavor blockers and enhancers. Cigarette/cigar/pipe smoke (first or secondhand). Artificial sweeteners of any kind - toxic and proven to cause memory loss, can also be highly addictive and cause seizures and hyperactivity in some people. Don't consume hydrogenated oils in cooking or in packaged foods. Use a cold-pressed light, extra-virgin, or virgin olive oil wherever oil is called for in cooking, salads, etc. Cold-pressed oils are superior in retaining nutritional value and don't result in toxic trans-fatty acids. Sesame, almond, sunflower, hemp seed and flax seed oil are also okay - basically anything other than mass-market (hydrogenated) vegetable oils. Don't eat fruit with other foods, or after a meal. Try to eat fruit in isolation (/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle minutes before other food, or /two.oldstyle hours after) until you've been healed for a year or so and then experiment with mixing it with other foods. CHAPTER 3 The standard North American diet is absolutely appalling - it is /f_illed with toxins and damaging substances, and the quality of nutrients is dismal. No wonder cancer rates are one in three. This Maintenance Diet should be the standard diet for all westerners. /two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: Reduce milk/milk products. If possible, consume raw rather than pasteurized dairy products. Try to use low-fat Lactaid, rice or goat milk, and skim-milk yogurt. Again, after you've been healed for about a year or so, you'll probably be able to drink regular, pasteurized milk in small quantities or from time to time, if you wish. Raw cheddar cheese and raw milk may be tolerated well, test it and see. Reduce sugar intake - avoid as much as possible. Don't drink milk or juice with meals. If you must have something to drink with your meal, limit yourself to a packet of Emergen-C vitamin C dissolved in four ounces of water, or, \u00bd glass of warm or room tem - perature water, sipped slowly and then no liquids for an hour after you've eaten. Liquids will interfere with your digestive juices and cause bloating. Keep processed foods, or foods containing preservatives, nitrates, etc. to an absolute minimum, ideally, avoid them completely. Eat organic food and beverages as much as possible. Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet If your bowel movements are not too frequent (no more than four bowel movements per day) but you're getting a lot of discomfort and cramping from gas, bloating, indigestion or belching, follow the guidelines listed below. A/f_ter your bowel movements have lessened to no more than three per day, continue on this diet for an additional /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle months, then switch to the Maintenance Diet - but only if you're also drug-free, and have no bloating, cramping or bleeding. However, if you're currently on Imodium (or a similar anti-diarrhea drug), while it stops/reduces diarrhea it can also cause tremendous, embarrassing amounts of /f_latulence and bloating. My recommendation would be to go o the Imodium (as with all drugs, never quit \"cold turkey\" but slowly reduce the dosage one pill at a time every /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle days, and then half a pill for /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle days and then quit) and combine the diet listed below with the Reduce Diarrhea Diet , depending on the severity of your diarrhea. If you're /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 having over /f_ive bowel movements a day, follow just the Reduce Diarrhea Diet (it's stricter). /T_his is the only one of the diets in which yeast and sugar are completely restricted, because excessive bloating is o/f_ten due to an overabundance of Candida albicans (yeast infection) in the colon. If you have a moderate to severe yeast infection, you will also need to eliminate other foods that feed Candida like all grains, starchy or complex carbohydrates, mushrooms, all milk products, and fermented foods. Use your own discretion or consult with your naturopathic doctor as to whether you actually need to follow these restrictions. Eliminate: Alcohol - too acidic Caffeine - Inhibits absorption of vitamin C, leaches calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and trace minerals from the body. Coffee is the worst thing you could drink, really aggravates the colon in particular. Pure hot chocolate may be ok, but make it with \u00be water and only \u00bc milk. Even de-caffeinated coffee is not tolerated well. Carbonated drinks - you certainly don't need more gas, sugar or \u0003 caffeine in your system. The cabbage family (especially onions, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage and brussel sprouts). Beans and lentils. Raw vegetables, eat well-cooked vegetables only. Roughage (e.g., bran, cracked wheat, corn) or anything else that's \u0003 'scratchy' or has a tough fibre matrix (too hard to digest). Hot, spicy foods or condiments. Yeast or sugar. Be sure and read the ingredient label as many foods contain added yeast. Notes: /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Processed foods, or foods containing preservatives, nitrates, MSG (interferes with neural functioning), carrageenan (used to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates), or anything else that sounds like a manufactured chemical compound.

Artificial sweeteners of any kind - toxic and proven to cause memory Notes: loss, can also be highly addictive and contribute to hyperactivity and seizures in some people. Artificial colors or flavors - especially since the introduction of neural flavor blockers and enhancers. Deep-fried foods. Remove the skin before eating fruits or vegetables. Reduce: Minimize cheese consumption. Use as a garnish rather than a main part of the meal. Hard cheeses made from raw milk, or goat cheeses are preferable. Stay away from cream sauces and soft cheeses, minimize milk/milk product consumption and use Lactaid milk when you do drink/eat it. Or, experiment with raw milk, rice or goat's milk. Minimize garlic, ginger and cumin consumption. When you have a salad, use butter lettuce instead of romaine or iceberg. North Americans, on the whole, consume far too many sour, acidic, vinegary foods/condiments (pickles, ketchup, mustard, salad dressings with vinegar, etc.) try to reduce these as much as possible. Eat as few tomatoes or tomato-based products as possible. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 When eating fruit or drinking juice, consume in isolation (i.e. \u0003 minimum of \u00bd hour before or /one.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle hours after any other food or \u0003 meal). Do not eat/drink citrus fruits in the morning. Don't drink anything with your meals. If you must have something \u0003 to drink with your meal, limit yourself to \u00bd glass of warm or room \u0003 temperature water, sipped slowly and then no liquids for an hour after \u0003 you've eaten. Liquids will interfere with your digestive juices and \u0003 cause bloating. Notes: Do Eat: Six to eight glasses of room temperature or warm mountain spring \u0003 water per day. Japanese green tea, very weak Chinese tea, decaffeinated English tea \u0003 (never squeeze or re-use the bag as both will release tannins which \u0003 inhibit iron absorption and irritate the gut.) \u0003 When drinking juice, dilute it with \u00bc juice and \u00be water. Juices must \u0003 be fresh, not from concentrate, with no artificial flavor/color, or added \u0003 sugar. Avoid citrus juices - apple, pear, mango, papaya and litchi are \u0003 the best. Remember to always consume in isolation: A minimum of \u0003 \u00bd hour before or /one.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle hours after any other food or meal. Well-ripened bananas, watermelon, apples, pears, mango, \u0003 papaya, cantaloupe. Carrots (peeled and well cooked), zucchini, mushrooms, peas are \u0003 sometimes okay if well cooked, asparagus, artichokes (natural, not \u0003 pickled or marinated), pumpkin, plantain, potatoes (no skin), yams. \u0003 Cook all vegetables well - makes them easier to digest. Acorn, butternut or spaghetti squash. Avocados, cucumber, regular and shiitake mushrooms. Cooked seaweed. Eggs, maximum two per day (hard-boiled eggs help stop diarrhea). /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Medium to non-oily fish; sole, cod, wild sea bass, monkfish, wild salmon, tuna. Shrimp, scallops, chicken, extra-lean beef, lamb and pork. Sushi, Japanese grilled fish. However, make sure the restaurant is Japanese owned and run (not Chinese, Korean, Caucasian, etc. unless the chef has trained in Japan). A Japanese sushi chef trains meticulously in the healthy cleaning, storing and serving of raw fish. Also check that they don't use MSG in the cooked dishes, as the MSG Notes: is likely to make you ill. Pasta (spinach or vegetable pastas are good). Make a sauce from pureeing baked squash and water, adding basil and salt for seasoning. Brown rice, cous-cous, millet, spelt, amaranth, quinoa, kamut. Dry curd cheese (this is cottage cheese without the surrounding milk, it's lactose-free and good for stopping diarrhea). /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle whole wheat bread - yeast-free (containing no more than /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle whole wheat flour). Use cold-pressed light, extra-virgin, or virgin olive oil wherever oil is called for in cooking, salads, etc. Cold-pressed oils are superior in retaining nutritional value. Sesame, almond, sunflower, hempseed and flax oil are also good - basically anything other than 'normal' hydrogenated vegetable oils (regular sunflower, safflower, canola, etc.). During the processing of commercial vegetable oils, they are heated to the point where the molecular structure is altered resulting in trans-fatty acids that damage cell walls and DNA, and are suspected carcinogens. Basil, oregano, cilantro or coriander, thyme, mary, Hungarian paprika (non-spicy) and turmeric are good spices to use. Salt is ok unless you have mouth ulcers, then go easy on it. Soy Sauce, but make sure there's no added preservatives, alcohol, wheat or sugar. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Eat only organic foods; meat, vegetables, fruit, grains , milk, \u0003 cheese, etc. \u0003 Reduce Diarrhea Diet If you're having more than /f_ive bowel movements per day, use this diet until you've got it down to three or less bowel movements per day. /T_hen switch to the Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet for as long as necessary. If your bowel movements increase a/f_ter switching to the Minimize Gas & Bloating Diet , Notes: then switch back to this diet for another three months. Also, check out the information on L-Glutamine in Chapter Two - it's excellent for healing diarrhea and will allow you to move onto the more lenient diet much faster. /T_he Colonic Massage technique for Cramping/Diarrhea in Chapter Six will also help you spend less time on the toilet. Sore Bum Remedy If your anus is sore from having so many bowel movements per day, here's a quick remedy that's very eective. A/f_ter you /f_inish your bowel movement, wipe your bum as usual with so/f_t, dry toilet paper. /T_hen wipe yourself one extra time, but instead of using dry toilet paper, use two, /two.oldstyle-ply tissues (e.g., Kleenex) and quickly /f_lash the tissues under warm tap water to moisten them /f_irst. Wipe yourself very gently with the wetted tissues and if you have hemorrhoids or skin tags be sure to clean gently in between and around them. Use a second wad of moistened tissues if necessary. You'll probably be surprised by how much stool shows up on the damp tissues - when you thought your bum was actually clean. Make sure you wipe or dab gently though, otherwise you'll just wind up with little rolls of soggy tissue caught in the surrounding hair (the British actually have a name for these soggy bits: Winnets!) and this will irritate your bum almost as much as le/f_tover stool. If you do this a/f_ter every bowel movement, your soreness will probably disappear in a few days. Tissues (or Kleenex) work much better than toilet paper since they don't shred so easily and they are so/f_ter. Make sure all toilet paper and tissues are not dyed - just plain white - and unscented. Also, make sure you wear /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle cotton underwear during the day and then sleep bare-bum at night on /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle cotton sheets. If the soreness persists, then try Wild Oregano Oil applied topically and just inside your /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT anus - see Chapter Two for detailed dilution and application instructions (you must not use full-strength Wild Oregano Oil on your anus or genitals). Do not use commercial pre-moistened wipes (e.g., Wet Ones) as these will tend to irritate your bum rather than soothe it. Eliminate: Alcohol (alcohol is /v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/y.sc acidic; drinking it is akin to pouring acid on an open wound). Notes: Caffeine - Inhibits absorption of vitamin C, leaches calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron and trace minerals from the body. Coffee is the worst thing you could drink, really aggravates the colon in particular. Even de-caffeinated coffee is not tolerated well. Carbonated drinks - you certainly don't need more gas, sugar or caffeine in your system. English or Chinese black teas ( e.g., Earl Grey, orange pekoe, or any other tea that contains caffeine) or Tangy/citrusy herb teas (e.g., Orange Zinger, tart raspberry, etc). Citrus fruits or juices (e.g., oranges, lemons, grapefruit). Pineapple, cherries, grapes, raspberries. Don't drink anything with your meals. If you must have something to drink with your meal, limit yourself to \u00bd glass of warm water, sipped slowly and then no liquids for an hour after you've eaten. Liquids will interfere with your digestive juices and cause bloating. Milk products; milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, etc. Anything sour, fermented, acidic, or containing vinegar (e.g., all condiments - mustard, ketchup, pickles, Worcestershire sauce, chutneys, etc.). Tomatoes. Leafy green vegetables (e.g., spinach, lettuce). Raw vegetables. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Beans, lentils. Cabbage family vegetables (e.g., onions, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, etc.). Garlic, ginger, mustard seed, cumin. Spicy or black peppers, chilies, etc. Any processed, pre-packaged foods. Notes: No foods preservatives, nitrates, MSG (it interferes with neural functioning), carrageenan (large quantities have been used to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates), or anything else that sounds like a manufactured chemical compound. Margarine or butter substitutes - treated with chemical solvents and bleaches, resulting in deformed, highly toxic, trans-fatty acids. Artificial sweeteners of any kind - toxic and proven to cause memory loss, can also be highly addictive and contribute to hyperactivity and seizures in some people. Artificial colors or flavors - especially since the introduction of neural flavor blockers and enhancers. No nuts, seeds, roughage (e.g., bran, cracked wheat, corn,) or anything else that's 'scratchy' or has a tough fibre matrix (difficult to digest). Nothing fried or deep-fried, keep butter and oil to a minimum. When you do use oil, make sure it's a light olive oil. Cold-pressed oils are superior in retaining nutritional value. Cold-pressed sesame, almond, hempseed, sunflower and flax oil are also ok - basically anything other than commercial, hydrogenated vegetable oils (regular sunflower, safflower, canola, etc.). During the processing of commercial vegetable oils, they are heated to the point where the molecular structure is altered so that they can no longer be properly digested or eliminated. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Do Eat: At least eight to ten glasses of room-temperature or warm spring water per day. You lose a lot of fluids with diarrhea, so it's important to stay hydrated. Very weak Japanese green tea, weak rooibos or honeybush tea, decaffeinated English tea (never squeeze or re-use the bag as both will release tannins which inhibit iron absorption and irritate the gut.) Notes: If you really want to drink juice then dilute it with \u00bc juice and \u00be water. Juices must be fresh, not from concentrate, with no artificial flavor/ color, or added sugar. No citrus juices; apple, mango, pear, papaya and bananas, watermelon, mango, papaya, cantaloupe, pears. Remember to consume fruit in isolation, either \u00bd hour before or /one.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle hours after any other food. Carrots (peeled and well cooked), zucchini, mushrooms, asparagus, artichokes (natural, not pickled or marinated), pumpkin, potatoes (no skin), yams. Cook all vegetables well - makes them easier to digest. Acorn, butternut or spaghetti squash. Avocados, cucumber, shiitake, portobello, oyster mushrooms. Cooked seaweed. Eggs, maximum two per day (a hard-boiled egg helps stop diarrhea). Medium to non-oily fish; sole, cod, wild sea bass, monkfish, wild salmon, tuna. Shrimp, scallops, chicken, extra-lean beef, lamb and pork. Sushi, Japanese grilled fish. However, make sure the restaurant is Japanese owned and run (not Chinese, Korean, Caucasian, etc. unless the chef has trained in Japan). A Japanese sushi chef trains meticulously in the healthy cleaning, storing and serving of raw fish. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Also check that they don't use MSG in the cooked dishes, as the MSG \u0003 is likely to make you ill. Pasta (spinach or vegetable pastas are good). Try it with a sauce made from pureeing baked squash and a little water or broth, and adding basil and salt for seasoning. Otherwise, just toss with a bit of olive oil and allowable spices and vegetables. Brown rice, cous-cous, millet, amaranth, quinoa, kamut. Notes: Dry curd (this is cottage cheese without the surrounding milk, lactose- free and especially excellent for stopping diarrhea). /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle whole wheat bread. Eat only organic foods; meat, vegetables, fruit, grains (wheat, rice, etc.). Basil, oregano, thyme, fennel, tarragon, rosemary and cilantro or coriander are good spices to use. A little Hungarian paprika (non- spicy) and turmeric should also be fine. Salt is good (helps you retain fluid and electrolytes) unless you have mouth ulcers, then just eat as much as you can tolerate. Soy sauce, but make sure there's no added preservatives or alcohol. Keep butter and oil to a minimum, use as little as possible. When you do use oil, make sure it's a cold-pressed, light, extra-virgin or virgin olive oil. Cold-pressed oils are superior in retaining nutritional value. Cold-pressed sesame, almond, hempseed, sunflower and flax oil are also okay - basically anything other than hydrogenated vegetable oils (regular sunflower, safflower, canola, etc.). During the processing of commercial vegetable oils, they are heated to the point where the molecular structure is altered resulting in trans-fatty acids that damage cell walls and DNA, and are suspected carcinogens. /two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Stop Intestinal Bleeding Diet /T_his diet is for you to use if you're experiencing intermittent intestinal bleeding, or a type and volume of bleeding that you've had before several times and that you know is no cause for immediate or undue alarm. If, however, you're experiencing bleeding that would classify as hemorrhaging or your weight and hemoglobin are dropping rapidly, then you need to follow the steps outlined in the Bowel Rest Elemental Diet , listed immediately a/f_ter this one. Strictly following this Stop Intestinal Bleeding Diet usually stopped my intestinal bleeding within /one.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle days. I found if you chill right out, don't go to work or school but just get lots of rest and sleep and strictly follow this diet, within /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle days you should have the bleeding stopped. However, continue to follow this diet for two more weeks to give yourself time to heal properly, gradually combining it with the guidelines listed under the Reduce Diarrhea Diet. See also the herbal therapies in Chapter Two, to help speed healing and stop the bleeding even faster, o/f_ten within a day or two. /T_he main diculty people experience with following this diet is that the food is quite bland, since you're only allowed tiny amounts of butter or oil, and you're not allowed any sauces, condiments, etc. /T_he easiest way around this is to cook with water rather than oil - I know this sounds and will feel really odd, but it actually works very well. Just substitute the water for oil and cook as normal. /T_he other quick way to add a /f_lavor boost to the food is to give it an oriental /f_lavor by adding /one.oldstyle tsp. of soy sauce and \u00bd of cold-pressed sesame oil to /one.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle tbsp. of water and then using that, a/f_ter cooking, to /f_lavor your noodles, rice, vegetables, /f_ish, meat, etc. You will also, by the end of the /f_irst week, be able to taste and really appreciate all the natural /f_lavors present in organic meat and vegetables. If you're having only small amounts of blood in your stool and/or on the toilet paper when you wipe your bum, it's probably just due to an anal or rectal /f_issure, or internal hemorrhoids and you don't need to follow this diet. See Rectal Fissures and Hemorrhoids in Chapter Two for a full outline of applicable healing treatments. /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Eliminate: Cow's milk products; milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, etc. (the only exceptions are dry curd and whey protein isolate) Rice milk, goat's milk, almond milk, etc. Alcohol (alcohol is /v.sc/e.sc/r.sc/y.sc acidic, drinking it is akin to pouring acid on an open wound).

Again, do whatever feels right to you. Listen to your body and give it what it's asking for. Bowel Rest Elemental Diet An elemental diet is one in which all the nutrients (protein, carbohydrates) have been pre-digested. /T_he oils (fat) in an elemental diet are all non- hydrogenated, cold-pressed oils, which are essential to your body's functioning and easily absorbed. Elemental diets were originally developed by NASA for astronauts to consume in space so they would only produce a minimal amount of fecal matter. /T_hey were later appropriated for use by the medical community. Because they're completely liquid with all the nutrients pre-digested, they also give your digestive system a rest. Colonic wounds are given a chance to heal, as there is a much smaller amount of only liquid or mushy stool being passed. An elemental diet is bene/f_icial when you're recovering from surgery, having severe intestinal bleeding, or when you're malnourished and need to consume as many nutritious calories per day as possible. It is also very eective as a screening tool to determine your particular food allergies or intolerances, and in longer periods to induce disease remission. Notes: /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Many gastroenterologists prefer using an elemental diet because it doesn't result in the \"side eects\" of steroids or immunosuppressants. However, other gastroenterologists say they don't even bother recommending an elemental diet to their patients because the adherence rate is so low. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Using /T_he Diet To Induce Remission My gastroenterologist (who has around /seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle patients) tells me that in his experience an elemental diet alone (for a duration of about six weeks) produces remission as o/f_ten as steroids. Recent clinical trials involving children with active Crohn's disease in England and Italy have demonstrated that \"elemental diet therapy is as eective as steroids in inducing remission, whilst avoiding steroid side eects\" . In the English study, /four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle children with Crohn's were put on an elemental diet and /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle of them (/nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle) achieved clinical remission in an average of six weeks (individual times on the elemental diet ranged from /two.oldstyle - /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle weeks). In the Italian study, /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle children were assigned to an elemental diet and /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle children were assigned methylprednisone (steroids). /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle (/eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle) of the children on the elemental diet achieved clinical remission in an average of /two.oldstyle./five.oldstyle weeks and /nine.oldstyle of the children on steroids achieved clinical remission in an average of /three.oldstyle./seven.oldstyle weeks. However, /seven.oldstyle of the children on the elemental diet showed complete healing of the mucosal lining of the intestine, while none of the children on steroids showed healing of the mucosal lining. As Dr. Robert Canani summarized: \"In children with active Crohn's disease, exclusive nutritional therapy shows a more rapid eect than steroids in inducing clinical remission and is markedly more eective than steroids in producing healing of mucosal in/f_lammation.\" Many gastroenterologists prefer using an elemental diet because it doesn't result in the \"side eects\" of steroids or immunosuppressants. However, other gastroenterologists say they don't even bother recommending an elemental diet to their patients because the adherence rate is so low. And they do have a point; an elemental, completely liquid, pre-digested diet is very dicult to stick to for any length of time and requires a lot of discipline. Personally, the /f_irst time I went on an elemental diet, I found it extremely dicult. However, I have since heard from numerous readers who actually say they preferred it to eating real food - because they felt so good on it and didn't have to worry about meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning up the kitchen! /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 /T_he /f_irst time I went on an elemental diet was due to intestinal hemorrhaging that le/f_t me at /nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle lbs (I'm /five.oldstyle'/seven.oldstyle\") and required a transfusion of /six.oldstyle pints of blood. I had two objectives; to stop the bleeding and to gain weight. Continuing to eat regular food simply re-opened the wounds and started the bleeding again. /T_herefore, my nutrition needed to come from a completely pre-digested (elemental) liquid source, which my gastroenterologist told me resulted in disease remission as o/f_ten as Prednisone (steroids). I sampled each of the elemental (pre-digested) products provided by the hospital, but found the taste and ingredient list Notes: unacceptable. All of the products contained arti/f_icial /f_lavors and sweeteners, large amounts of sugar (in relation to maltodextrin - which results in a 'sugar high', or spike in blood sugar levels) and high levels of low quality oils - which resulted in painful intestinal spasming. Rather than drinking these, or, undergoing a surgical procedure to have a tube inserted in my stomach and the commercial elemental products pumped in, I set out to /f_ind a natural, healthy alternative. A/f_ter an extensive search of health stores and the Internet, I devised my own elemental formula by mixing together six dierent products. I did this /eight.oldstyle - /nine.oldstyle times a day to give my body the nutrients it needed in elemental (pre-digested for maximum absorption) form. Because all the food I ate (or more accurately, drank) was pre-digested, the elemental diet also gave my bowel a complete rest, which allowed my wounds time and space to heal. In addition, I added numerous supplements to each shake to further facilitate my healing and recovery. Using this formula, I gained /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle pounds of solid weight (not fat) in six weeks and my albumin (blood protein) levels were restored to normal. I went from being so weak I could barely move around my apartment, to cycling and li/f_ting weights at the gym at a solid weight of /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle lbs. One month later I got pregnant, had an excellent pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Oscar. I had written about this process in the /f_irst edition of Listen To Your Gut and had given my readers detailed instructions on how to source the same list of products and mix them together to make a good quality, non-toxic elemental shake. A/f_ter a while, I was approached by one of the directors /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson A key bene/f_it of following the IBD Remission Diet is that it provides an ideal vehicle with which to consume large amounts of healing supplements in easily absorbable, liquid form. If you stay on the Diet for longer than two weeks, you'll also experience a gentle detox eect. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT of a health company called Imix Naturals Inc. and he asked me if I would be interested in formulating my ideal elemental shake product for their company to manufacture. Of course, I was thrilled to do so and the result is called Absorb Plus. All you have to add to it is cold-pressed /f_lax oil (or Udo's oil), and water. Because Imix gave me the freedom to create my ideal product, Absorb Plus also contains a targeted free-form amino acid blend (that speci/f_ically assists the healing of various IBD related conditions) and a carefully selected range of vitamins and minerals (including trace minerals). So you get a lot of bene/f_its automatically, without having to pay for additional supplements. I also spent six months getting the /f_lavoring (all natural of course) as good as it can possibly be with an elemental product - I don't think the lab guys had ever experienced someone as picky as me! However, when you're formulating a product that you know you're going to be using yourself, you have a whole dierent set of standards than someone who's formulating from a bottom line/pro/f_it margin perspective! I could go on and on about exactly why I chose each speci/f_ic ingredient and the bene/f_its conferred, but it would be better if you just go to their website (www.absorbplus.com ) as they have extensive information about each of the ingredients in Absorb Plus listed there. /T_he other thing that happened, following the /f_irst outline of an elemental diet in the /f_irst edition of Listen To Your Gut , is that readers kept contacting me asking for more detailed, speci/f_ic information on exactly how to implement the diet, for how long, for what conditions, etc. So, in response to that, I wrote a second book called /T_he IBD Remission Diet that provides all the information one could possibly need to implement an elemental diet with the highest possibility of success. /T_he IBD Remission Diet is not the same as a doctor-prescribed elemental diet, because it also contains a detailed and targeted supplementation plan speci/f_ically chosen to heal the mucosal lining of the intestine, reduce in/f_lammation, repair tissue damage, support enzyme production and hormonal pathways, facilitate optimal cellular function, balance the immune system, and restore a bene/f_icial bacterial /f_lora throughout your gastrointestinal tract. /T_his provides your body with an extended healing regimen where all aspects of digestive /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 healing are supported simultaneously; and as the whole body is inter-linked, you may /f_ind that other health issues are also resolved during this time. Another key bene/f_it of following the IBD Remission Diet is that it provides an ideal vehicle with which to consume large amounts of healing supplements in easily absorbable, liquid form. Swallowing /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle gelcaps, tablets, and capsules (for example) throughout the day for an extended period can be quite dicult and the absorption of these shellacked and capsulated products is not ideal. Emptying all those supplements into several good-The IBD Remission Diet tasting shakes and drinking them down is much easier, absorption is is a fantastic way to resolve improved, and you're more likely to stick with it for the duration.

Using /T_he Diet To Gain Healthy Weight Many people with IBD (in/f_lammatory bowel disease) and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) also suer from malnutrition due to inadequate digestion, low absorption of nutrients, and lack of appetite - when everything you eat makes you feel sick or results in pain you quickly lose your appetite! /T_he IBD Remission Diet is a fantastic way to resolve malnutrition and gain some solid weight (muscle, not fat) quickly. Because everything you con - sume is pre-digested, there is very little digestion required and the nutrients are absorbed rapidly. And because everything is in liquid form, it's easy to consume a large number of calories per day, so you can gain weight more quickly than if you were eating normal food. To eat /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle - /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle calories per day of regular food can be quite dicult, but drinking the same number of calories - and being able to actually absorb and utilise all of them - is considerably easier. Also, even though your food is all in liquid form, you will not feel hungry on the elemental diet (as long as you're consuming an /two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: adequate number of calories for your body). In fact, some people who've followed the IBD Remission Diet have even been reluctant to go back to eating regular food - they loved the taste of the shakes, felt really energetic, not hungry at all, and very much enjoyed the break from shopping, meal planning, cooking and cleaning the kitchen! If you use the Diet for weight gain or to address malnutrition, I also strongly advise that you start an exercise program - ideally weight-training/body building - at the appropri - ate time to further encourage muscle growth and development. Later, you can continue to use the shakes in conjunction with your regular diet, for as long as you wish, to further increase your calorie intake (and maintain good quality nutrition) and continue to gain weight. See the section on Malnutrition/Weight Gain in Chapter Two for more information on using Absorb Plus along with your regular diet, and for details of a weight- training/bodybuilding program. For myself, I have a demanding schedule with two young children, so it's hard to get the chance for peaceful, unhurried meals every day. I'm a slow eater and I'm rarely able to eat until I'm full at mealtimes. /T_herefore, I o/f_ten drink an Absorb Plus shake for breakfast to make up any calorie/nutrient de/f_icit and simply to maintain my existing weight. Using /T_he Diet To Lose Weight Some people have gained excessive weight due to steroid use, lack of physical exercise, unbalanced hormonal system/thyroid function, etc. /T_he IBD Remission Diet is also a good vehicle to lose that extra fat. Many readers have found this an easy way to lose weight because: a. It's very easy to monitor and control calorie intake when you're on a completely liquid diet. It's actually easier not to eat at all, than to have a wide variety of choices and constantly have to monitor yourself. b. All the food you consume is of very high quality, with quickly absorbed nutrients, so your body maintains a high level of health and nutrition throughout your weight loss. Another point people are often not aware of is that obese people are often suffering from malnutrition. Fat does not equal nutrition. Indeed the reason some obese people feel so hungry /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 all the time is because their bodies are actually starving! Your body \u0003 cannot use junk food, hydrogenated fats, and other unhealthy foods to \u0003 nourish itself or maintain health. So if you're simultaneously obese and \u0003 malnourished, the IBD Remission Diet is an ideal way to shed some of \u0003 your fat, whilst addressing your malnutrition. c. There's absolutely no possibility of eating junk food or typical 'diet - breaker' binge foods on an elemental diet, so that whole avenue of \u0003 failure/sabotage is closed.

However, you can continue to \u0003 use the shakes in conjunction with your regular diet, for as long as you wish, \u0003 to further control your calorie intake (whilst maintaining good quality \u0003 nutrition) and encourage ongoing weight loss. Using /T_he Diet To Test For Food Allergies /T_he most thorough and reliable method of testing for food allergies or intolerances is to use an elemental diet for /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle - /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle days to completely clear the body of any food allergens. Following the clearance period, you then reintroduce foods, one by one, and test to see if the new food results in any undesirable reaction. Reacting in these ways to consuming a food shows that your body has either an allergy or intolerance to that food. /T_hese reactions can lessen or even disappear as your health improves over time, but it's good to keep them in mind, as during times of stress they'll likely resurface and you'll want to avoid or restrict consumption of these foods again. Undesirable reactions to watch out for include: increased mucus production /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT nausea, itchy tongue or skin, swelling, redness, bumps, rash bloating/gas, cramps heartburn, indigestion shortness of breath, fuzzy head or a drugged feeling, sleepiness, etc. headache, joint/muscle pain any blood mixed in with or accompanying stool. Blood from the colon Notes: or rectum will be red. Blood from the small intestine will turn the stool dark green or black (as can iron therapy/supplements, so don't confuse the two). If you only have a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe your bum, it's probably from a minor anal or rectal fissure/wound so don't worry about it. Once you've been eating completely solid food for a minimum of two weeks, you can also check for these undesirable reactions: undigested particles of the test food in the stool or toilet bowl watery, slimy, or acidic stool increased diarrhea When you're testing for your own personal food intolerances or allergies, you may want to keep in mind the results of the following study. /T_hirty-three Crohn's patients were /f_irst put on TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition - liquid nutrients given intravenously) to clear their symptoms. /T_he researchers then gradually reintroduced one food per day to determine which foods were tolerated and which triggered a return of symptoms. Wheat was the highest oender (/six.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle), then dairy products (/four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle), followed by yeast (/three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle), corn (/two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle) and potato (/one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle)./seven.numerator At the end of this chapter is a Food Reintroduction Chart that you can use to screen for allergies or intolerances. When reintroducing foods a/f_ter the clearance period, test foods from Phase One, column A /f_irst. /T_hen gradually move through columns B, C, D and E. Next you would test foods from /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 Phase Two, column A, and so on throughout the chart. If you know you're allergic or intolerant to a certain food, then wait until you've completed all the foods on the chart (or all the ones you wish to test for), and then test the problem food. If you have a severe allergy, you may want to just leave it alone altogether. Again, use this chart as a guide, but follow your own gut/intuition at all times. You can use the IBD Remission Diet speci/f_ically to test for food allergies, or, you can use it for any of the other purposes listed here and then If your life is very demanding, automatically test for food allergies when you begin introducing solid foods or you experience a sudden again. Detailed instructions on how to do this are in /T_he IBD Remission onslaught of stress or exhaustion, Diet book (available at: www.IBDremissiondiet.com ). the IBD Remission Diet is a Using /T_he Diet To Prevent Flares relatively quick (usually two Once you've been on the IBD Remission Diet for an extended period, weeks is sucient) and eective weaned o all your drugs, and used it as a tool for building solid, \u0003 foundational health, you may still /f_ind you need to use it occasionally, for recuperation tool. short periods. If your life is very demanding, or circumstances change \u0003 resulting in a sudden onslaught of stress or exhaustion, you may /f_ind it \u0003 useful to use the IBD Remission Diet as a relatively quick (usually two \u0003 weeks is sucient) recuperation tool. As with most illness, it was a con/f_luence of events and stressors that led \u0003 to my second time on an elemental diet. Until I weaned him from night \u0003 nursing at /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle months, my /f_irst baby, Oscar, did not sleep more than three \u0003 hours in a row, so neither did I. We also went to Singapore when Oscar was \u0003 eight weeks old, for six months. However, when we came back to Vancouver, \u0003 the new condo we had bought was far behind its construction schedule. \u0003 So we then spent the next /f_ive and a half months travelling around England, \u0003 Hawaii and Arizona, living out of suitcases. In addition, Oscar has a \u0003 voracious appetite (and high metabolism) so he breastfed full feeds about \u0003 ten times a day. Combined together, the stress of transatlantic /f_lights, no \u0003 home, no routines for the baby, all the varied adjustments involved for new \u0003 parents, and the severe extended sleep deprivation eventually became too \u0003 much for me. \u0003 /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT I gradually lost weight until I was only /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle lbs and then I took a new calcium/magnesium supplement I'd bought that also contained something called Betaine HCL (Hydrochloride). About eight hours later, my colon started bleeding. A/f_ter wracking my brain to try and /f_igure out what could have triggered the bleeding, I /f_inally remembered the mystery ingredient and looked it up in one of my encyclopaedias. /T_here I discovered that Betaine HCL is something that stimulates the production of stomach acid. It should never be used by someone with ulcers, and even people with normal digestive systems should start at a very low dose and stop if they experience any discomfort. Obviously, in a digestive system as sensitive as mine, that's all it took to trigger the bleeding and as I was so run down I knew the situation could deteriorate quite quickly. I've found that you can use all kinds of herbal supplements to prop yourself up and keep going, but when your body becomes too run down and malnourished it loses the ability to heal itself. So even though you give it the tools, your body has no energy or resources le/f_t to utilize those tools. Although the bleeding wasn't anywhere near the hemorrhaging I experienced prior to the /f_irst time I went on an elemental diet, I didn't want to risk it escalating to that point, so I immediately went on an elemental diet a/f_ter three days of passing blood, ranging from about /three.oldstyle tbsp. - \u00bc cup per bowel movement, with small blood clots the second and third day. /T_he good news is that I was also nowhere near as ill and run down as I was the /f_irst time round, so although my bleeding had completely stopped by day four, I remained on the diet exclusively for two weeks. I then continued drinking a few shakes a day for an additional ten days as I gradually re - introduced normal food. I also didn't feel the need to gain weight as quickly as I did the /f_irst time, so I only consumed six shakes per day. At the end of two weeks I'd gained seven pounds and by the time I was fully back on regular food, I'd gained a total of /one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle pounds. During my pregnancy with Oscar, I'd had a shake every morning with all the supplements and /f_lax oil added as it's a wonderful way to ensure excellent health for both myself and the baby. /two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle FOOD AS MEDICINE CHAPTER 3 /T_he third (and hopefully last!) time I had to go on the IBD Remission Diet was following the birth of my second child. Unfortunately, the IBD Remission Diet is such a great rejuvenator of health, that I got pregnant only a few months a/f_ter my second time on it (described above). Well, my daughter Zara also breastfed all night long, but I now had an energetic toddler (Oscar) to look a/f_ter during the days as well. /T_he same spiral downward of extended sleep deprivation, inability to eat properly, exhaustion, etc. occurred again and by the time Zara was six months old, I was down to /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle pounds, and chose to go on the IBD Remission Diet again The IBD Remission Diet is such for two weeks. Both kids then slept with Daddy in a separate room and I a great rejuvenator of health, that got uninterrupted sleep for the /f_irst time in over three years! You see, even I got pregnant only a few months though I'm pretty much healed, with no serious symptoms, and I've been after my second time on it. drug and surgery-free for over /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle years, my digestive system is my sensitive area. Load enough stress, exhaustion, lack of nutrients, etc. on me, and my distress will be evidenced in my gut.

One reader I heard from is a /f_ilm producer, who always takes Absorb Plus along on location to ensure he doesn't get sick due to the added stress of travel, long shoot days, and the usually unhealthy food on oer.

It's also helpful to keep a Food Diary . Write down exactly what you eat and drink, when, how much, and how you felt at the time. At the end of the day, critique what you ate and how you feel. Describe the type, consistency, and number of bowel movements. Write down any other observations regarding Notes: gas, pain, bloating, bleeding, cramping, etc. Also, very important is to note your emotional state and any unpleasant or stressful situations, thoughts, or feelings that occurred. Remember that mind/body/spirit is one, and food is not the only factor that in/f_luences your digestive system. /T_he Healing Diets give you a pretty good guideline, but keeping a Food Diary will help you to really pinpoint what foods are good, or not so good, for your unique body. It will also help you identify, for example, whether it's okay to eat a food once per week, but not three times per week. Our bodies have tolerance thresholds for certain foods or substances and a Food Diary can help you map yours out.

A/f_ter you've dried yourself o, you apply moisturizer to your skin, makeup to your face and perhaps some hair gel, mousse or hairspray. A /f_inal spritz of perfume or cologne, an application of deodorant, and you're ready for breakfast. You have your usual breakfast of cereal with milk and grab an apple for the road. You're feeling pretty good and refreshed, you're clean, you smell nice and you've just kicked o your metabolism for the day with a nutritious and healthy breakfast. Well, that's one way of looking at it. What you're probably not aware of is the phenomenal amount of toxins you've just absorbed or ingested in your body within your /f_irst hour of waking. /T_he skin is the body's largest organ and it is very ecient at absorbing and transporting to the blood and cells whatever it comes into contact with. Barbara Griggs, the author of Green Pharmacy: /T_he History and Evolution of Western Herbal Medicine tells this story of healing via poultices applied to the skin: \"/T_his hot aromatic poultice of stimulating and antiseptic herbs very probably did the trick - and reminds us that until only very recently, poultices and foot-baths were very common ways of applying medicine, not just because of their local heating or counter - irritant value, but because their virtues are absorbed through the skin. Mustard foot-baths - piping hot - have always been a popular remedy for coughs, colds and chestiness in my family - a folk-remedy of hundreds of years' standing which we have always found highly eective. Research by the German /f_irm Madaus has recently revealed a rationale for this treatment: mustard seeds contain a powerful antibiotic, which is absorbed directly through the particularly sensitive skin of the feet.\" /one.superior When you realize how very ecient the skin is at absorbing and integrating into the body anything it comes into contact with, you might also want /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/four.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 to take a second look at exactly what elements you're introducing to your body via your skin. Every single product that you've used during your typical morning outlined above probably contains toxic and carcinogenic elements - from your toothpaste to your deodorant. In addition, many of the products available in North America contain chemicals that have been completely banned in numerous other countries. It's beyond the scope of this book to go into exactly what each of these chemicals are and which products they're found in, but rest assured if you didn't buy all your toiletry products from a reputable health pharmacy, you're likely to be absorbing What you're probably not toxic and carcinogenic elements from every single product you use. aware of is the phenomenal amount of toxins you've just /T_hen there's the supposedly healthy breakfast you ate.

We have to wonder why childhood cancer rates are up several hundred percent from the /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle's. What exactly is causing all these auto-immune diseases like lupus, /f_ibromyalgia, Crohn's, multiple sclerosis, etc? And why is it that the incidence rate of cancer in America is now /one.oldstyle in /three.oldstyle?

LISTEN TO YOUR GUT \"/T_he EPA does not have a scienti/f_ically acceptable method for determining the risk for multiple chemical exposure. Yet when scientists have done studies on multiple chemical exposure, it seems quite clear that the chemicals act synergistically. In one /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/six.oldstyle study, a scienti/f_ic team used three chemicals on a group of rats. /T_he chemicals were tested one at a time on the rats without ill-eect.

Over /six.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle million Americans live in regions that exceed smog standards and most drinking water contains over seven hundred chemicals. As many as ten thousand chemicals enter our bodies in the form of solvents, emulsi/f_iers and preservatives used in food processing and storage. What on earth makes us think our bodies can withstand such a chemically saturated environment without breaking down? And where do we go from here, how do we progress from feeling depressed and overwhelmed by our current toxin load to a healthier, less toxic state of being? You can start by becoming aware, and simply take notice of the number of chemicals you're ingesting, absorbing or otherwise exposing your body to. Start reading the labels on products you buy, the food you eat, and toiletries you use. Fortunately, there are non-toxic, environmentally-friendly versions available of nearly every product or food you currently use. Start shopping at organic food stores and health stores. You can eliminate a tremendous amount of daily toxins simply by changing your personal hygiene, household cleaning and dietary habits. Yes, it's more expensive, but would you rather pay the price with your health or your pocketbook? Eliminating the avoidable toxins from your lifestyle and diet will relieve a great deal of stress from your body - leaving it free to use its energy to process the unavoidable toxins and pollutants in our environment. /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/six.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 According to Dr. Claudio Fiocchi at the Division of Gastroenterology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio: \"Environmental factors are probably as important as the patient's genetic makeup for the risk of IBD. Potentially relevant environmental factors include prenatal events, breastfeeding, childhood infections, microbial agents, smoking, oral contraceptives, diet, hygiene, occupation, education, climate, pollution, stress and miscellaneous components such as toothpaste, appendectomy, tonsillectomy, blood transfusions, contact with animals, and physical activity.\" /four.numerator You may /f_ind this chapter quite overwhelming, and I certainly don't want it to cause you to throw up your hands in despair and give up. /T_his is a dicult chapter and it will cause you to examine ways of living and being that are habitual; things you've done for so long you probably don't even think about them. For this reason, I encourage you to only attempt the changes suggested in this chapter if and when you feel completely ready to. Some of the recommendations in this chapter (for example, having mercury amalgam /f_illings replaced) have taken me years to get round to implementing, so don't worry if it takes you a long time to work through everything. Just take it nice and slow and don't pressure yourself or stress- out over these recommendations. Assessing /T_he Toxins In Your Life Take a look at all the physical factors in your life right now and ask yourself two questions: /one.oldstyle) Am I happy with this? /two.oldstyle) Is this good for my health? Start by taking a look at your living environment: Examine the food you eat and the beverages you drink. What's the air quality like where you live? Are you in a bustling city but would rather be in the peaceful countryside, or vice-versa? Notes: /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson There's no such thing as \"can't\". Start taking responsibility for the choices you're making in your life and next time you /f_ind yourself saying \"can't\" , change it to \"won't\". This will actually be a very freeing move, accepting your power and shifting out of victim-mode into driver's seat-mode. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT What's your job like? Does your job build you up or tear you down? Do you look forward to getting up in the morning? Is your level of job- related stress healthy for you, or unhealthy? What's your current exercise regimen? Take the time to go through all of these in/f_luencing physical factors in your life and make a list of what should change and a list of what must change (you may want to read this whole chapter /f_irst, and then make your list). /T_his will help you to prioritize which changes need to be implemented /f_irst. If you want to heal yourself, you must put your body and your needs /f_irst. Dierent people will respond dierently to the same stimulus. I'm very aected by air pollution and as a result, I will probably never live in a really polluted city like London or Tokyo again, but you may be only slightly aected by air pollution. Every person is dierent, with dierent needs and sensitivities. Listen to your body and to your intuition and you'll know what needs to change for you in your life. Yes, this is going to be dicult! You may decide you need to change jobs, or take a sabbatical. You may need to change your whole way of eating. You may want to move to a new city, or a new country. You may need to restructure your home life so that you do less of the chores and have more time for relaxation. /T_hese are not small changes. But again, just ask yourself the question: Do I want to heal myself? If the answer's \"Yes\" then you need to make yourself your number one priority and do whatever it takes to put yourself /f_irst and get your needs met as much and as o/f_ten as you can. You may feel that you can't make the necessary changes or put your needs /f_irst because you have a demanding job, or demanding dependents, or not enough money, not enough time, etc. Remember that life is all about choices. You can do anything you choose or decide to do. /T_here's no such thing as \"can't\". Start taking responsibility for the choices you're making in your life and next time you /f_ind yourself saying \"can't\", change it to \"won't\". /T_his will actually be a very freeing move, accepting your power and shi/f_ting out of victim-mode into driver's seat-mode. Take all the energy that you would normally spend in coming up with reasons why you \"can't\" do /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 something and put it into /f_iguring out how you can do that thing. You'll either realize that (a) you actually don't really want to do that thing, or, (b) you'll /f_ind a way to do it. Either way, you'll step into your power to make an honest decision about what you want and what's right for you at this time. It will probably take you a while to implement all of the physical changes that you need to make. No problem! Just take it one step at a time and proceed at the pace of change that's right for you. Don't get discouraged People who are strong and if you feel it's taking you a long time to change your lifestyle, or if some healthy can accept and process days you feel the task is insurmountable.

Do not live near power lines, power plants/stations or cell phone towers. Try not to use cell phones. If you must use one, keep it away from your body and use an ear-pierce with a ferrite bead attached to the cord, rather than holding it up to your head to talk. Do not carry a cell phone on your body if it's turned on. See the section below on Cell Phones for more details. /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Inhaling any type of air-borne chemical like pesticides from farming or from bug-control in tropical climates, fumes from dry cleaners, auto body repair shops, household cleaning products, perfumes, colognes, or bug sprays, room/car deodorizers, perfumed toilet paper or tissues, formaldehyde in carpets and particle-board furniture, etc. If you currently have allergies to dust, mold, pollen, animals, etc., chances are you're very sensitive to environmental pollutants and your immune system function is quite imbalanced. If you have medium to severe allergies Notes: and you live in a large, polluted city, you may want to give serious thought to relocating somewhere less polluted. People who are strong and healthy can accept and process a lot of toxins every day without being adversely aected. However, if your body has developed IBD, it is in a hyper - sensitive state and it's up to you to protect it and provide yourself with an environment that supports your healing eorts, not undermines them. Smoking If you or someone else in your household is a smoker, you may want to consider banning any smoking in the house. Smoking only in a particular room doesn't cut it, because smoke permeates and saturates everything. A/f_ter your house/apartment has been smoke-free for a week, get all the rugs shampooed, the furniture steam cleaned and all of the drapes and window hangings cleaned. If possible, avoid getting anything dry-cleaned as the chemicals used are very toxic and will then pollute your living environment. If you absolutely cannot avoid dry-cleaning, then hang the fabric or clothing in your garage or outside for a few days to a week to allow the chemicals to disperse as much as possible. Also, wash all of your walls, duvets, pillows and bedding. If you or your partner regularly smoked in the bedroom, you may want to get a new mattress as well. No, I am not going overboard here. A/f_ter you've been smoke-free for a month or two and you walk into a smoker's house you'll immediately notice a tremendous dierence and will probably feel ill from the fumes and smell. Obviously, if you're a smoker, the best gi/f_t you could give yourself would be to quit smoking. But again, in your own time and only when/if you feel it's right for you. Although some /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 studies have shown that nicotine can actually have a calming eect on ulcerative colitis (possibly due to increased mucus production in the colon), the negative eects on the body as a whole still far outweigh any short-term bene/f_it that might be derived.

Following are the top your living environment. polluters of your nutritional environment: Processed or packaged foods and beverages. Foods/beverages containing preservatives, nitrates/nitrites, MSG (interferes with neural functioning), carrageenan (used in large quantities to induce ulcerative colitis in guinea pigs and primates), chemical dyes, or anything else that sounds like a manufactured chemical compound. Non-organic beverages and food; fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and meat (i.e. The \"regular\" kind you buy at your local grocer). Refined sugar Microwaved foods or drinks (alters the molecular composition of food, rendering it toxic) Teflon coated (non-stick) cookware. Plastic dishes or containers (chemicals will migrate into the food, even if the food is cold) If you want to heal your digestive tract, you're probably going to have to eliminate as much of the above from your diet as you can. Go through your diet and your fridge and cupboards. You'll probably be astounded at the amount of food and drinks you normally consume that are packed with /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT unnatural additives and chemicals. You're going to have to go back to the beginning and start reading every label on every item you buy. Some foods you're just going to have to give up because they're actually not natural foods and don't exist in a non-toxic form. See Chapter /T_hree and the sections below for detailed information on exactly why all of the above are harmful to your health. Cell Phones Notes: Cell phone (mobile phone) manufacturers have worked tirelessly to minimize the reporting of adverse eects from cell phone use. However, in November /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle, the prestigious UK medical journal /T_he Lancet published two reports on cell phone usage damage, with the author of one report, Dr. Gerald Hyland (a British physicist) stating, \"If mobile phones were a type of food, they simply would not be licensed.\" /T_he two reports point out that cell phone radiation aects a variety of brain functions and this can result in tumors, headaches and disrupted sleep. Cell phone radiation also degrades the immune system. Due to various factors - like head size, a thinner skull, a brain that is still developing and an immune system that is less robust - infants and preadolescents are the most susceptible to the damaging eects of cell phone radiation. A cell phone emits radiation even if it's just turned on (but you're not talking to someone), so make sure you (and your children) don't carry a cell phone anywhere on your body. If you're at all prone to epilepsy, then the radiation from cell phones can trigger seizures. Here is the actual data from the two reports that explains in technical detail the points I have just communicated: \"... GSM radiation does seem to aect non-thermally a variety of brain functions (including the neuroendocrine system), and health problems reported anecdotally do tend to be neurological... For example: Reports of headache are consistent with the effect of the radiation on the dopamine-opiate system of the brain and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, both of which have been connected to headache. /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 Reports of sleep disruption are consistent with effects of the radiation on melatonin levels and on rapid-eye-movement sleep. Furthermore, since there is no reason to suppose that the seizure-inducing ability of a /f_lashing visible light does not extend to microwave radiation (which can access the brain through the skull) /f_lashing at a similarly low frequency, together with the fact that exposure to pulsed MWR can induce epileptic activity in rats, reports of epileptic activity in some children exposed to base-station radiation are perhaps not surprising. Cell phone radiation aects a Finally, the signi/f_icant increase (by a factor of between /two.oldstyle and variety of brain functions and this /three.oldstyle) in the incidence of neuroepithelial tumours (the laterality of can result in tumors, headaches which correlates with cell-phone use) found in a nationwide US and disrupted sleep, it also study is consistent not only with the genotoxicity of GSM radiation, degrades the immune system. as indicated by increased DNA strand breaks and formation If you're at all prone to epilepsy, of chromosome aberrations and micronuclei but also with its promotional eect on tumour development. then the radiation from cell It is o/f_ten argued that anecdotal reports of health problems phones can trigger seizures. should be dismissed. However, given the paucity of systematic epidemiological studies of this new technology, such reports are an indispensable source of information, a point acknowledged in the /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle report of the UK parliamentary committee. Preadolescent children can be expected to be more vulnerable to any adverse health eects than adults because absorption of GSM microwaves is greatest in an object about the size of a child's head, because of the \"head resonance\" eect and the greater ease with which the radiation can penetrate the thinner skull of an infant. Also the multiframe repetition frequency of /eight.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle Hz and the /two.oldstyle Hz pulsing in the DTX mode of cellphones lie in the range of the alpha and delta brain-waves, respectively. In a child, alpha waves do not replace delta waves as a stable activity until the age of about /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle years. Furthermore, the immune system, whose ecacy is degraded by this kind of radiation, is less robust in children. /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /T_his makes them less able to cope with any adverse health eect that might be provoked by chronic exposure, not only to the pulsed microwave radiation but also to the more penetrating low-frequency magnetic /f_ields associated with the current surges from the handset battery which can reach /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle \u00b5T (peak) near the back of the case.\" It was originally thought, that since radiation decreases exponentially over the distance between you and your phone, that by using a headset, the phone would be away from your body and thus reduce the radiation Notes: intensity. However, a report in the British consumer research magazine Which? (www.which.c uTFE\u000f However, the good news is that you can pretty much neutralize all of the radiation transmitted via the headset by clipping on a ferrite bead device. Professor Lawrie Challis says that clipping a ferrite bead on headsets stops the radio waves from traveling up the wire and into the head, \"Using a ferrite bead eectively reduces emissions to the head to zero but as yet manufacturers do not put them on hands-free kits.\" Dr. Stuart Porter, agrees with Professor Challis' comments: \"Hands-free kits eectively have two currents, an intentional one that stays within the wires and an unintentional one on the outside. It is the unintentional one the beads stop. /T_hey work by blocking the current, a bit like a block in a water pipe.\" A ferrite bead is simply a hollow bead or cylinder made of ferrite - a semi- magnetic substance made from iron oxide alloyed with other metals. /T_hey work by reducing EMI (electromagnetic interference) and RFI (radio - frequency interference). Jim May, an engineer whose company produces ferrite beads for a variety of industry uses says: \"Ferrites have a concentrated, homogeneous magnetic structure with high permeability. /T_hey are consistently stable over time and over a /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 wide temperature range, and provide RF suppression without high eddy-current losses.\" /one.superior /T_his may all have been a bit more technical than you'd prefer, but I wanted to present you with the original research, so you can see for yourself that my recommendations are based on hard science. Obviously, it's best if you can avoid using cell phones altogether. But, as that is not always possible, know that you can greatly reduce their harmful radiation by not carrying the cell phone on your body (when it's turned on) and by using a headset (hands - free device) with a ferrite bead clipped to it when speaking on your cell phone. /T_his advice is particularly pertinent for children. When we lived in Singapore, there was a big media splash about increasing numbers of twenty year olds who were having heart attacks and no one could /f_igure out why. /T_hen, they realized that it was the fashion for these young people to carry their cell phones attached to designer cords worn round their necks. /T_herefore, their phones hung against their chest - right near their hearts, causing the heart attacks! Knowing this, I cringe when I see mothers tucking their cell phones into baby carriers (right next to the baby's torso) and people putting their cell phones into their pockets. A good place to get a reasonably priced ferrite bead that is easily attached to your cell phone headset is from www.mercola.com - just type in \"Ferrite Beads\" in mercola.com's search engine. Otherwise, do an Internet search to look for suppliers in your area. Your Sleeping Environment Since the normal person spends an average of one third of their life in bed, your bed and sleeping environment can have a signi/f_icant impact on your health. If your bed, pillow, duvet, etc. are composed of synthetic elements, then they are o-gassing toxins while you sleep, or, you are absorbing toxins through your skin (see the section below on Absorption /T_hrough the Skin for more details). /T_here are many mattresses now available made from various combinations of the following natural (non-toxic) materials: Natural latex, cotton, coir (coconut /f_ibre), wool, de-magnetized coils, etc. Do an Internet Notes: /two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Since the normal person spends an average of one third of their life in bed, your bed and sleeping environment can have a signi/f_icant impact on your health. search using the keywords 'natural mattress' to view a selection of what's available. If you're buying a natural latex mattress, ensure that the mattress is indeed composed of at least /nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle pure natural latex. Many manufacturers will mix natural and synthetic latex together and then call it \"natural latex\". For your bedding, use only natural materials like wool, down, cotton, etc. I prefer to use wool duvets and pillows as I /f_ind they're more comfortable than goose or duck down, and wool doesn't shi/f_t around or bunch up in places, as down does. If you can't aord to replace your bed, then at least: Get a /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle cotton mattress cover (the padding inside the mattress pad must be cotton as well), or a wool/cotton mattress pad.

When you need or want to replace the /f_looring in your bedroom, choose natural materials like hardwood or cork (durable, warm, and much cheaper than hardwood). Even /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle wool carpeting is not ideal since the glue and underlay are toxic materials. Much better is to get a cork or hardwood /f_loor and then put a cotton or wool rug overtop.

DuPont (the manufacturer of Te/f_lon) previously asserted that toxins would only be emitted at extremely high temperatures that would not likely be reached in normal cooking. However, in May /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/three.oldstyle, a consumer activist organization, the Environmental Working Group ( www.ewg. \u0013\u0017\u0016org) conduc te d their own tests and found that in two to /f_ive minutes on a conventional stovetop, cookware coated with Te/f_lon and other non-stick surfaces can exceed temperatures at which the coating breaks apart and emits toxic particles and gases linked to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pet bird deaths and an unknown number of human illnesses each year.

You can see why it's really necessary to use stainless steel, cast iron, glass, or ceramic cookware - yes, I know it's more work to clean them, but it's very much worth it for your health. Some health advocates believe the best cookware is ceramic-coated (enameled) metal, as the ceramic is virtually inert and will not transfer any metal ions to the food you cook. When purchasing stainless steel cookware, make sure the steel content is high enough by seeing if a magnet sticks to it - if the magnet doesn't stick, don't buy it, as it may contain a high nickel content. Nickel is as toxic as mercury to your body and nickel ions will be released into your food during cooking. Also completely avoid aluminum cookware as the aluminum migrates into your food and researchers suspect this is a signi/f_icant contributor to diseases like Alzheimer's - they found signi/f_icantly higher levels of aluminum in the brains of people who died with Alzheimer's disease.

It may take a while to clear out all your plastic containers as they are everywhere, but again, it's worth it. Also, be sure and check your kettle as most electric kettles are made of plastic, and switch to stainless steel, if necessary. Check other kitchen items like blenders, mixing bowls, spatulas, kid's dishes, etc. and replace them with acceptable versions. If you have a baby, keep it from sucking or chewing on plastic toys, as much as possible. A lot of research has been done on certain estrogen-mimicking chemicals (xenoestrogens) that migrate into food from plastic containers and these are thought to be a chief contributor to problems with menopause and breast cancer. A great book on this is What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause by John R. Lee, MD, Jesse Hanley, MD and Virginia Hopkins. You may also want to avoid wearing plastic clothes (these include polyester, spandex, nylon, lycra, elastane and other synthetics) as the estrogen-like chemicals are absorbed through the skin from these fabrics. I wear only natural fabrics next to my skin and though I occasionally wear spandex mixed with cotton, I limit it to a maximum of /five.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the fabric blend. Wearing natural fabrics only will also help you avoid dry-cleaning - which really should be called chemical-cleaning - another source of toxic chemicals absorbed both through the skin and inhaled. If you want more information on which harmful chemicals are involved in dry-cleaning and how they harm the body, do an Internet search using the keywords 'dangers of drycleaning'. Of course, I also apply all these rules to my family's clothing and environment. /T_he best way to safeguard your health is to use only natural products. If a company oers you an \"improved\" product, food, clothing, etc. just ask yourself one question: \"Is it /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle natural?\" If it's not, then don't touch it.

If you're interested in this topic, you may want to do an Internet search to pull up some of the original Russian research - it's quite eye-opening. More recently, a Swiss biologist by the name of Hans U.

THE DANGERS OF VACCINATION Most of you reading this book will likely be vaccinated already. However, knowledge is power and you may still be considering vaccinations for travel, the /f_lu, or your children, so the following information will still /two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/six.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 be useful. I myself was vaccinated three times as a child - in Kenya, the U.S. and Canada - and I consider this to be one of the key reasons why I developed Crohn's at age /one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle. I also received a tuberculosis vaccination during my registration for university and three months later developed the /f_irst symptoms of Crohn's Disease. A/f_ter you /f_inish reading this section, you may agree with me that this was not just a coincidence. An unpublished study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on a \"measles susceptible\" (malnourished) group of children showed that In Canada, the vaccination the group who hadn't been vaccinated contracted measles at the normal schedule for babies begins at two contract rate of /two.oldstyle./four.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle.

This figure is even more alarming when it is revealed that only one in four claimants were awarded compensation./one.superior Some researchers postulate that the use of live viral vaccines introduce foreign genetic material into the human system, which has contributed to the unprecedented escalation of auto-immune disorders (like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, cancer, Crohn's disease, asthma, etc.) in recent decades./two.superior /two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: /T_he above facts each highlight a dierent facet of the vaccination question: Eectiveness, adverse eects, and long-term consequences. /T_he unspoken thread running through each of these is a pressing question: Why haven't more people been informed of this evidence, and indeed, why is vaccination presented carte blanche as a positive, imperative requisite for our children's health? When my son Oscar was born, it became important to /f_ind out what is really going on with infant and childhood vaccination and whether it is conclusively a bene/f_icial or necessary procedure. Prior to that, I assumed what most of us assume; that vaccination is something that prevents us from getting certain diseases. In short, I had assimilated the carefully disseminated propaganda of the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Do Vaccines Actually Work? As I researched the issue, I was amazed to discover that there is a large and growing body of clinical studies, /f_ieldwork (in developing nations) and historical data refuting the safety and ecacy of vaccination. Unfortunately, the propaganda campaign for vaccination has been so successful that most of us automatically believe that vaccines are so eective they are responsible for the virtual eradication of serious childhood illnesses. In reality, this is not so, and if you examine the actual rates of incidence for each disease (from mainstream sources such as /T_he Lancet , WHO and UNICEF), the graphs show a clearly dierent picture. From the /one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle's to the present, in every case , each disease had drastically declined decades before the introduction of the relevant vaccine; through improved hygiene, better nutrition, clean drinking water and improved sanitation. Basically, as people's overall health and immune systems improved, they didn't get sick. As the physician W.J. McCormick summarized in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle (before vaccines for measles, mumps, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever were introduced): \"...the decline in diptheria, whooping cough and typhoid fever began fully /f_i/f_ty years prior to the inception of arti/f_icial immunization and followed an almost even grade before and a/f_ter the adoption of these control measures. In the case of scarlet fever, mumps, measles /two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 and rheumatic fever there has been no speci/f_ic innovation in control \u0003 measures, yet these also have followed the same general pattern in \u0003 incidence decline.\" /two.superior/one.superior Furthermore, research reveals dozens of cases around the world where there was an outbreak of infectious disease (e.g., measles, polio, tetanus, smallpox, etc.) and contract rates were either similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, or higher and more severe among the vaccinated. From the 1800's to the For example: Massachusetts in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/one.oldstyle experienced a 'type II' polio outbreak and present, in every case , each \"there were more paralytic cases in the triple vaccinates than in the disease had been virtually unvaccinated.\" /two.superior/two.superior eliminated decades before the In /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/six.oldstyle, Dr. G.T.

This, combined with the fact that only /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of children (and a maximum of /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of adults) had been vaccinated, clearly shows that vaccinated people have a much higher tendency to contract the disease./two.superior If vaccination is not responsible for the eradication of childhood illnesses, and vaccinated children are actually at a greater risk of contracting a disease than unvaccinated children, why is vaccination routinely presented as an eective safeguard for our children's health? When the historical data is referred to by pro-vaccine parties, it is o/f_ten skewed and presented out of context. For example, in reference to a mass vaccination campaign carried out in /T_hailand: \"...the immunization coverage for measles has increased from /six.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle in \u0003 /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/four.oldstyle to /six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle, leading to reduction measles prevalence Patel Thompson There is no scienti/f_ic evidence as to the actual frequency or incidence of vaccine-induced injury, so in fact we have no idea whether reactions are indeed rare, or, statistically signi/f_icant. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT However, what the report doesn't indicate is that in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle, the infection rate of measles was /eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle./one.oldstyle//one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle. And in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle it was /five.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle./one.oldstyle//one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle which is actually higher than the rate of infection in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/two.oldstyle (/five.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle./one.oldstyle//one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle) when no one had been vaccinated. /T_hese statistics however, are conveniently not included as they don't support the pro-vaccination stance of the report. Aside from establishing that vaccines are not the reason infectious childhood illnesses have virtually disappeared, and that vaccinated children are actually at a greater risk of contracting disease, there are also the adverse eects and long-term consequences of vaccination to be considered. Eects Of Vaccination Immediate Side Eects Immediate or short-term eects of vaccination can include the following: encephalopathy (irreversible brain damage), ataxia (incoordination of voluntary mental retardation, aseptic meningitis (in/f_lammation of the membranes of spinal cord or brain), seizure disorders, hemiparesis (half-body paralysis), retinopathy and blindness, hyperactivity, anaphylaxis, high pitched (encephalitic) screaming/prolonged crying, learning disorders, autism, hay fever, asthma, sudden infant death (SIDS), brachial plexus neuropathy (disease aecting nerves which serve the arm, forearm and hand), and abdominal pain. Secondary complications can include juvenile-onset diabetes, Reye's syndrome and multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, it's virtually impossible to determine the real incidence of damaging adverse reactions. For example, a British government report claims the rate of permanent neurological damage from the DPT vaccine to be /one.oldstyle in /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle./two.superior However, other researchers indicate the permanent damage level to be anywhere from /one.oldstyle in /six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle to /one.oldstyle in /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle. Research by Coulter and Fisher on the /three.oldstyle./three.oldstyle million children vaccinated yearly in the U.S. found there to be a total of /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/six.oldstyle cases of acute neurological reactions (encephalitic screaming, convulsions, collapse) within /four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle hours of receiving the DPT shot. /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 When the problems with vaccination are addressed in a serious manner by the pro-vaccination side, it usually involves a member of the bio-medical /f_ield qualifying that the dangers of vaccination, although real, are very rare, for example: \"Parents must be informed of the rare possibility of serious adverse \u0003 eects, including seizure and allergic reaction. Every physician who \u0003 administers vaccines therefore needs to become familiar with the \u0003 reactions that may occur with each immunologic agent used. /T_he best \u0003Notes: safeguard against litigation, when and if a serious reaction follows \u0003 vaccination, is the indication that these considerations were discussed \u0003 and that an informed choice was made.\" /two.superior However, there is no scienti/f_ic evidence as to the actual frequency or incidence of vaccine-induced injury, so in fact we have no idea whether reactions are indeed rare, or, statistically signi/f_icant. In articles such as the one above, no veri/f_iable statistical evidence, re/f_lecting reliable reporting or monitored studies for this 'rarity' is ever presented. As shown in the ocial minutes of the /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/t.superior/h.superior session of the US Panel of Review of Bacterial Vaccines and Toxoids with Standards and Potency : \"Many physicians are not cognisant of the importance of reporting \u0003 untoward reactions, or may be unaware of their clinical features. \u0003 Further, both physicians and manufacturers have been held liable \u0003 for damage suits by patients who may suer adverse eects from \u0003 established vaccines. All of these factors undoubtedly discourage \u0003 reporting; without some other form of surveillance, de/f_inition of the \u0003 rates and signi/f_icance of untoward reactions to current and future \u0003 vaccines cannot be ascertained.\" /two.superior For this reason, it is suspected that the number of adverse reactions and vaccine-damaged children is actually much, much higher than is currently presented by the medical/pharmaceutical community. Instead, there is a growing number of mothers and lay people, whose children have been irrevocably damaged, forming vaccine risk awareness groups. /T_here continue to be incidents like the one in West Germany in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle, where /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Other researchers argue that these attenuated forms of the viruses remain in the body causing continual antigenic stimulation of the immune system - meaning the immune system is always in 'attack' mode - which also weakens it and leads to auto-immune diseases. This immunosuppressive eect is of particular interest to those of us diagnosed with IBD, especially Crohn's disease. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT smallpox vaccination damaged the hearing of /three.oldstyle,/two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle children, and of these /seven.oldstyle/one.oldstyle were rendered completely deaf./two.superior At the extreme end of the spectrum, we have occurrences like the one in Australia's Northern Territory where malnourished aboriginal children were vaccinated and in some areas /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of them died./three.superior We have to question why autism rates (a common 'side eect' of vaccination) in California have increased /six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle since /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle./three.superior/one.superior Whether these adverse reactions are caused by the vaccines themselves or the number of highly toxic additives contained in vaccines (e.g., formaldehyde, mercury, acetone, etc.), or a combination of the two, remains to be determined. As yet, no research has been carried out to resolve this question. Long-Term Consequences While these short-term consequences are alarming (especially if it happens to your child) the possible long-term consequences of vaccination are, in my opinion, even more of a worry. When you contract a disease naturally, the virus or bacteria normally enters via the body's natural /f_iltration system - by being inhaled or swallowed and passing through the liver. With measles, for example, the airborne virus is carried /f_irst to the tonsils, then the lymph nodes and then into the spleen, blood and other organs. /T_his succession produces a variety of reactions; sneezing, coughing or the secretion of a local antibody within the respiratory tract, all designed to expel or weaken the virus at its port of entry. With vaccines, foreign antigens are usually injected directly into the body's tissues and carried throughout the circulatory system, giving them direct access to all of the body's vital organs and systems. To bypass the body's natural defence system, and at such a young age, is simply asking for trouble. In addition, because the vaccine contains an attenuated (or weakened) form of the virus, the body doesn't activate its major in/f_lammatory response, nor its non-speci/f_ic immune defences. Another long-term complication of vaccination involves the 'one cell-one antibody' rule. /T_his means that once a B cell is committed to an antigen (disease-causing virus or bacteria), it becomes inert and incapable of responding to other antigens or attacks on the immune system. If a child contracts childhood diseases naturally, it is estimated that up to a total of /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/two.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 /seven.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of their immune system is taken up with responding to these diseases. However, a child who undergoes the routine course of vaccinations, risks having up to /seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of his/her immune system committed to these antigens and no longer available for other immune challenges. Current research suggests this reduced immune-response capacity is responsible for increased susceptibility to other infections, allergies, and auto-immune diseases. Other researchers argue that these attenuated forms of the viruses remain in the body causing continual antigenic stimulation of the immune system - meaning the immune system is always in 'attack' mode - which also weakens it and leads to auto-immune diseases. /T_his immunosuppres - sive eect is of particular interest to those of us diagnosed with IBD, espe - cially Crohn's disease. A placebo-controlled trial of acellular pertussis vaccines in Sweden, compared vaccinated children with un-vaccinated children of the same birth grouping. During the trial, an invasive bacterial infection occurred among the vaccinated group resulting in numerous deaths. A review of the trial data led researchers to conclude that \"/T_he hypothesis of an immuno - suppressive eect of the vaccines, which would explain the deaths...could not be refuted by the data.\" /three.superior/two.superior As further evidence, one of the few double- blind trials that have ever been conducted on a vaccine shows the same immunosuppressive eect. In the trial, of the group who were vaccinated with the Salk polio vaccine, over /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle people went on to contract polio. Among the control group (unvaccinated), not one of them developed polio./three.superior/three.superior Citing references from numerous valid sources, including four recognized textbooks on paediatrics and immunology, Harold Buttram, MD and John Homan, PhD, conclude that childhood vaccination \"cannot help but have adverse eects on the immunologic system of the child, possibly leaving this system crippled in its ability to protect the child throughout life...opening the way for other diseases as a result of immunologic dysfunction.\" /three.superior /T_he other worrying aspect of live viral vaccines is that they introduce foreign genetic material into the human body. Dr. R. Moskowitz, MD and Notes: /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson If a child contracts childhood diseases naturally, it is estimated that up to a total of 7% of their immune system is taken up with responding to these diseases. However, a child who undergoes the routine course of vaccinations, risks having up to 70% of his/her immune system committed to these antigens and no longer available for other immune challenges. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Harvard graduate, explains how this can lead to auto-immune disease susceptibility: \"Vaccinal attenuated viruses attach their own genetic 'episome' to the genome (half set of chromosomes and their genes) of the host cell, and are thus capable of surviving or remaining latent within the host cells for years. /T_he presence of foreign antigenic material within the host cell sets the stage for their unpredictable provocation of various auto - immune phenomena such as herpes, shingles, warts, tumors - both benign and malignant - and diseases of the central nervous system, such as varied forms of paralysis and in/f_lammation of the brain.\" /three.superior Dr. Markowitz states that in addition, vaccines do not just produce mild versions of the original disease, but all of them commonly produce a variety of their own symptoms. In some cases, \"these illnesses may be considerably more serious than the original disease, involving deeper structures, more vital organs, and less of a tendency to resolve spontaneously. Even more worrisome is the fact that they are almost always more dicult to recognize.\" /three.superior In addressing scientists at a conference sponsored by the American Cancer Society, Rutgers University professor R. Simpson warned: \"Immunization Programs against /f_lu, measles, mumps, polio and so forth may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form latent proviruses in cells throughout the body. /T_hese latent proviruses could be molecules in search of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease and perhaps cancer.\" /three.superior /T_he bulk of the evidence gathered from numerous countries points out that not only is vaccination ineective at preventing the spread of infectious disease, but vaccinated children are actually at a higher risk of contracting these illnesses. In addition, the adverse reactions to vaccination are much higher than presently documented in the medico-pharmaceutical literature /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/four.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 and the long-term damaging eect of suppressing the immune system is \u0003 rarely addressed. \u0003 In light of all the evidence to the contrary, why have vaccines been pressed \u0003 upon the public as a necessary, bene/f_icial way of preventing our children \u0003 from getting sick? In the words of Dr. Raymond Obomsawin (who's held \u0003 senior positions in UNICEF and CUSO), referring to mass vaccination, \"It \u0003 is reprehensible that such actions continue to be enforced by authorities, \u0003 while parents and local health workers are not accorded any practical \u0003 knowledge of the known dangers involved, and the extent to which there \u0003 prevails a general ignorance of the longer term consequences.\" /three.superior Combine this ignorance with the millions of dollars in pro/f_it generated by \u0003 vaccination that goes straight into the pockets of manufacturing companies, \u0003 governments and medical doctors, and it becomes clear that vaccination is \u0003 more of a political and economic issue, than a health issue. Barbara Fisher, \u0003 who served for ten years on the U.S. National Vaccine Advisory \u0003 Committee states: \"We have bad science and bad medicine translated into law to ensure that vaccine manufacturers make big pro/f_its, that career bureaucrats at the Public Health Service meet the mass vaccination goals promised to politicians funding their budgets, and pediatricians have a steady /f_low of patients...As the drug companies have o/f_ten stated in meetings I have attended, if a vaccine they produce is not mandated to be used on a mass basis, they do not recoup their R&D costs and do not make the pro/f_it they want.

What the reader does not know is that o/f_ten the studies have been designed and conducted by physicians who sit on vaccine policy- making committees at the Centers for Disease Control...some of whom receive money from vaccine manufacturers for their universities and for testifying as expert witnesses in vaccine-injury cases.

Needless to say, having completed my research, Oscar and his sister Zara remain completely un-vaccinated. As to whether you should vaccinate your child or not, only you can and should make that decision. It is very dicult to stand strong and resolute against the ubiquitous pressure to vaccinate. It's like having to keep insisting the earth is round when authorities, your community, intellectuals, and the majority of scientists etc. all insist it's /f_lat.

Also, any good naturopathic physician will be able to advise you of the alternatives and prescribe immune support measures for your child. For those of you who are wary of the dangers of vaccination but not quite strong enough - or convinced enough - to decline vaccination, there are a few options you might wish to explore: Only give your child the vaccines you feel are most necessary and omit the most dangerous ones, or the ones that have been banned in other countries. For example, opt for diphtheria and tetanus but omit the pertussis component of the DPT shot, skip the hepatitis B vaccine - especially in infants (/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle doctors in France have banded together to try to get their government to ban it). The MMR (measles, mumps, /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 rubella) shot has also been banned in several countries. Make sure your doctor uses only single-dose vaccines and shows you the package insert confirming there is no thimerosol (mercury) in it. If you do vaccinate, assist your child/baby's immune system before, during and after vaccination to reduce the risk of adverse effects. Dr. Lendon Smith (an Oregon pediatrician) administers the following to his patients: /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg. vitamin C, /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg. calcium, /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg. vitamin B/six.oldstyle the day before, the day of vaccination, and the day after.

Consider delaying vaccination until your child is at least two years old to minimize the risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).

In Canada, the vaccination schedule for babies begins at two months of age. If the whole basis for conferring immunity is the development of antibodies, then this point alone reveals that vaccination is primarily driven by pro/f_it, not health concerns: A baby's body is not even capable of producing antibodies until it is /three.oldstyle - /four.oldstyle months old - so why on earth would you vaccinate a two month old baby? Obviously, as the mother of two children, this whole issue of vaccination and what's being done to our children's health is very distressing for me. Vaccination (among other factors) has so degraded our children's health in /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: the western world that people now think it's 'normal' for kids to be sick all the time. My /f_ive year old son Oscar (who has not been vaccinated, takes regular vitamin C and sporadic probiotics with a healthy organic diet) usually goes /six.oldstyle - /nine.oldstyle months between colds. He's travelled to Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Barbados, Antigua, Mexico, Florida, Arizona, Michigan, California and Washington and the most serious illness he's had was croup. His cousin caught croup at the same time and endured two nights in the hospital, adrenalin drugs, and took /f_ive weeks to completely recover. Oscar recovered completely in six days - using only Eucalyptus steams, and receiving vitamin C and Astragalus through my breastmilk. My point in relating this is simply to illustrate that we have lost perspective on what a 'normal' healthy child looks like. Vaccination begins at such a young age now that our children don't stand a chance, and their immune systems are being damaged in a particularly insidious manner. Until we have a majority of people refusing vaccination, and pursuing natural, healthy lifestyles, there won't be a visible control group of what normal, healthy children can look and be like. I really encourage you to take a discriminating look at this issue, there is much more information available and I've been able to present only a very small selection of it here. Please educate yourself further until you feel you can make an informed decision. /T_here are many more books, articles, and research papers available where scientists are beginning to speak out against vaccination - an Internet search using the keywords: 'dangers of vaccination' will pull these up for you. IMPLEMENTING CHANGE You may be feeling rather overwhelmed at this point by the number of changes you need to make in your diet and lifestyle - that's normal. It's very dicult to change lifelong tastes and habits overnight, so be patient with yourself. Proceed at your own pace of change. Some of you may be able to implement these changes in two weeks and stick to them. Others may require a slow evolution over the course of a year, gradually changing and adjusting to one thing at a time. Some people may take /f_ive or six years to /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle LIFESTYLE & ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CHAPTER 4 complete all the changes they require. We're all dierent and have dierent ways of doing things, so do whatever works best for you, keeps you feeling positive and doesn't overwhelm and discourage you. Your emotions aect your intestinal health just as much as the food you eat and the environment you live in. So if you're a slow-change kind of person and you implement all these changes right away, you're going to be stressed out and miserable, nothing will taste right or good to you and you'll begin to dread food shopping and preparation. /T_hese distressing Your emotions aect your emotions will then very nearly negate all the lifestyle and dietary bene/f_its intestinal health just as much you're reaping, so what's the point? Slow down and do things at the pace of as the food you eat and the change that feels comfortable and positive for you. Any changes to promote and encourage your health, no matter how slowly implemented, are better environment you live in. So slow than none. A great website for ongoing information about health, food, down and do things at a pace of environment, etc. is www.mercola.com , be sure and sign up for change that feels comfortable and Dr. Mercola's free newsletter as it's an excellent source of well-researched positive for you. health information. I've been receiving his newsletter for a few years and the only issue to date that I've disagreed with him on is probiotics - he has promoted the use of bacterial soil organisms, which I am strongly opposed to (see Chapter Eight for more on this issue). Also, be sure to always check in with yourself prior to making any of these changes and only do what feels necessary and right for you. Maybe your body is only nominally aected by toxins and so you only need to change a couple of things. Or maybe your system is very sensitive and you need to eliminate all the toxins listed and a few more besides. Again, only you know what's best for your body, so only change what you feel you need to. Here in order of importance, are the top ten dietary and lifestyle changes you may want to make, at a pace that suits you: /one.oldstyle. Do not eat/drink foods or any other man-made chemical compound. \u0003 No processed foods. For specific dietary guidelines, see the \u0003 Maintenance Diet in Chapter Three. /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /two.oldstyle.

Create a non-toxic sleeping environment in your bedroom. Gradually expand these guidelines to the rest of your house. /one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle. Research vaccination issues and refuse all vaccines for childhood, travel, flu, etc. Now turn to the Healing Journey Workbook on the Listen To Your Gut CD and go through the Workbook questions and exercises for this chapter (Chapter Four). /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle Allopathic Medicine \"/H.swashealing in the deepe sense is a myery. /E.swashven modern medicine with its pretext of being scientific res upon observations that, at their heart, are unexplained. /O.swashne of the definitive texts of pharmacology begins by reminding the reader that ultimately no one knows how any drug works. /O.swashf course, the average physician conveniently /c_hooses to forget this and a/c_tually comes to believe that he knows what he's doing. /T.swashhere is no queion that many of these formulations 'work' predi/c_tably. /Y.swashet when we expe/c_t a certain re/s_ponse from a particular treatment, we are more in the business of shuffling symptoms than in the business of healing.\" Dr. Richard Moss, MD 5 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT In our society, we have grown up surrounded by an incredibly strong belief in allopathic (Western/modern) medicine and an equally strong belief in the power and authority of medical doctors. /T_his can actually be a positive thing from a 'faith healing' perspective - in that whatever you believe will heal you, is most likely to. However, it can also produce negative results as the treatment protocols in allopathic medicine are o/f_ten quite invasive and traumatic for the body. /T_he other glaring shortcoming of Notes: allopathic (modern) medicine is that it views and treats the body primarily as a rational, logical machine. Drugs and treatments are o/f_ten prescribed that are designed to aect one part of the body whilst disregarding their eects on other parts of the body. /T_he short-term alleviation of symptoms is usually placed before consequent long-term damage and degeneration. Fortunately, with the growing awareness of alternative treatment methods, people are also realizing that there are much kinder, gentler ways to eect healing in a manner that supports the whole body. /T_hese treatment protocols may take longer and require a bit more eort to implement, but they are worthwhile in that the healing eected is holistic and long-term. We must take responsibility for the health and treatment of our bodies and determine what is acceptable and what is not. Allopathic (Western/modern) medicine and its beliefs and attitudes did not just spring forth from a void. /T_hey came from our culture and our society and were formed by our beliefs and desires. Julie Motz is an energy healer with a master's degree in public health from Colombia University, who has some interesting thoughts on this topic. She accompanies various surgeons in the operating room and administers energy healing whilst the surgery (open heart, neurosurgery, breast cancer, etc.) is in progress. In her book Hands of Life she writes: \"It became more and more apparent to me that we have violent medicine because we have a violent society, and that the root of this violence is the cruelty and humiliation in/f_licted upon children by their parents. Disease is facilitated by the violence of childhood, and we can think of healing only in terms of matching this violence. /T_hat is why /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/two.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 we have a 'war' on cancer, and why surgeons see themselves as heroes on a bloody battle/f_ield, dashing in to save lives.

Take a look at the type of healthcare and therapies you've chosen and ask yourself why you made those choices. Examine the ecacy of those choices; how and why did they help you or not help you, what are the long-term consequences, what have you learned from your experiences so far? Answering these questions will help you to determine why and how you've chosen your past and current methods of treatment and where you want to go from here. I'm not suggesting that you abandon all forms of allopathic treatment, I'm simply encouraging you to become fully aware of your treatment options and to pursue the methods that work best for you. My personal belief is that allopathic medicine is very eective and valuable in high trauma, emergency situations - any type of violent accident /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT situation, extremely premature births, hemorrhaging, intestinal rupture, etc. But for on-going, systemic health, we have other kinds of medicine and treatment protocols that are far more eective in the long-term. It is your responsibility to search out and educate yourself regarding these options and to make the eort required to secure the best treatment for your body. Obviously you're already on this path, or you wouldn't be reading this book. I encourage you to keep going, keep on exploring and experimenting. Hopefully, with all our eorts combined we can leave a much more eective, Notes: positive legacy of healthcare knowledge and practice to our children. DRUGS When people ingest a drug, the symptom disappears and they assume they're cured. If you want to have any success with natural, holistic healing, you must break out of this paradigm of 'healthcare'. Because, /f_irst of all, it's false. Drugs do not heal, they merely suppress symptoms. But, no matter how many times people have it demonstrated to them that drugs do not really heal, they automatically tend to think this way. We live in a short- term, fast food, instant reward society and drugs /f_it in seamlessly with this mindset. Someone takes a drug for depression and it makes them feel better, but then they become overweight because the drug has damaged their thyroid gland, and they rarely connect the two events. /T_hen they take a drug for their thyroid gland, which then causes problem C, and so on and so on. Drugs do not heal. /T_hey merely suppress symptoms for a period of time. Now people with IBD are taking Remicade intravenously to suppress bleeding and ulceration in their intestines and winding up with Hepatitis, or Tuberculosis, or even dead, in exchange. I'm well aware of the reasons why people take drugs. I grew up not even questioning the allopathic paradigm of healthcare (or, more accurately, disease management). I've been on Prednisone myself because I was ignorant, and I believed what my doctor told me. Don't waste time beating yourself up or lamenting the past. Learn and move forward. If you become aware of your past fears and motivations supporting your drug use, you'll /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/four.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 be able to recognize them when they come around again. Knowledge is power. /T_he more you become aware of what motivates you, the better you'll be able to address your shortcomings and change your course of action. Suppression vs. Healing It was my opinion that I could not be or feel completely healthy until I got myself o all long-term prescription drugs. As long as I was regularly ingesting such strong substances into my body, how could I expect my body to /f_ind its own state of balance and heal itself? Asking my body to heal Drugs do not heal. \u0003 itself whilst simultaneously overwhelming it with toxic substances (drugs) They merely suppress symptoms. seemed to be a form of sabotage. /T_he body works and heals holistically, \u0003 everything works together as a whole. \u0003 Unfortunately, when a pharmaceutical company develops a drug, their primary mandate is to develop a product that reliably produces a speci/f_ic result. All the other results are labeled \"side eects\" as if they're somehow less important and impact less on the body - which of course they don't. Let's look at steroids as an example: You may take them to suppress in/f_lammation, but at the same time you're sacri/f_icing adrenal gland functioning, inhibiting the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals, stressing the liver and decreasing bone formation. Each of these problems (side eects!) then leads to consequent further (and o/f_ten synergistic) damage to the body. For example, the adrenal gland produces certain key hormones which then interact with other glands and also play key roles in other hormone production pathways - which in turn interact, balance, and serve your body in hundreds of dierent ways. I could actually write a small book outlining and tracing the domino-eect damage that steroid medication causes in the body. And if you're a developing child, you're doing even more systemic damage to your body, aecting developing organs and systems: \"Steroid treatment of asthmatic children has been demonstrated to \u0003 retard lung maturation and physical growth and to cause a higher inci - dence of cataracts in children receiving long-term steroid therapy.\" /three.superior /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson When Prednisone was /f_irst released, it was strictly mandated - by the manufacturer - to be used only in \"life threatening conditions\". LISTEN TO YOUR GUT When Prednisone was /f_irst released, Dr. Mendelsohn relates how it was strictly mandated to be used only in \"life threatening conditions\". /T_he composition of Prednisone and its eects on the body have not changed. However, it is now used for suppressing a range of symptoms, none of which are classi/f_ied as 'life threatening'. Why? Is it because doctors have grown familiar and comfortable with prescribing Prednisone? Or is it because they now have drugs that are so much more damaging than Prednisone (like Remicade or Imuran) that they make Prednisone look mild in comparison? Because of the way they're developed and the mindset of the pharmaceutical companies, drugs end up causing a short-term suppression of symptoms, whilst impairing and interfering with long-term healing. Consequently, their use results in damage and malfunction that o/f_ten takes longer to heal than the original symptom. It's very dicult to get yourself out of the allopathic paradigm where drugs = cure. In my opinion, drugs do not eect healing. Drugs merely suppress symptoms, for a short period of time. /T_hen your symptoms will recur, or escalate, and become more systemic or more severe. Since pharmaceutical drugs consist of molecularly altered compounds that do not exist in nature, they will also function as poisons, or toxins in your body. So, in addition to the damage they cause your organs, tissues, bones, hormonal and immune system, etc., the drugs you ingest will then also need to be cleansed from your body before true, root-level healing can take place. In his book, Tales From the Medicine Trail , Chris Kilham writes: \"I am committed to the development and promotion of plant-based medicines, because they are far and away safer, gentler, and better for human health than synthetic drugs. /T_his is so because human beings have co-evolved with plants over the past few million years. We eat plants, drink their juices, ferment and distill libations from them, and consume them in a thousand forms. Ingredients in plants, from carbohydrates, fats and protein to vitamins and minerals, are part of our body composition and chemistry. Some compounds perform the same functions in plants that they do in the body. Natural antioxidant phenols in plants, for example, protect plant cells from oxidation, and /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 they o/f_ten perform the same function in the human body. Our \u0003 bodies know the substances that occur in plants, and they possess \u0003 sophisticated mechanisms for metabolizing plant materials. /T_he same \u0003 cannot be said about synthetic drugs. /T_hese agents are most o/f_ten alien \u0003 to the chemistry of the human body, and they're separate and apart \u0003 from the careful cra/f_ting of evolution. Synthetic drugs o/f_ten act in the \u0003 body as irritants and toxins, upsetting the balance of whole systems \u0003 and producing side eects that can be lethal.\" Drugs merely suppress You may have initially taken a drug to suppress a distressing symptom - symptoms, for a short period of thereby giving yourself temporary relief from pain, worry, fear, diculty, time. Then your symptoms will depression, etc. However, you will then have an even bigger problem on your hands as you are now le/f_t with not only the symptom (which will recur, or escalate, and become eventually return as you have not addressed or healed the root cause), but more systemic, or more severe. also the damage caused by the drug to numerous other parts and systems of your body, plus the burden of detoxifying your body from the poisonous drug. You have sacri/f_iced the long-term health and functioning of your body. Your fear and pain (and o/f_ten ignorance) has caused you to ingest a damaging substance that provides only short-term relief. Symptoms Or Messages? I once heard from a young woman who was following the exclusively elemental diet and supplementation plan from my book, /T_he IBD Remission Diet, and she had completely weaned o all prescription drugs and seen real improvement in her health. However, in her /f_i/f_th week of the diet she developed joint pain and erythema nodosum (swollen, painful nodules on the skin). So she immediately went back on Prednisone! Do joint pain and swollen, painful nodules constitute a life threatening condition? She didn't give her body any time to work through these symptoms, or question what was the root cause of them. Maybe these symptoms were byproducts of the detoxi/f_ication process - two of the drugs she'd been on for a long time cause joint pain and erythema nodosum as 'side eects'. Maybe they were symptoms of a severely unbalanced hormonal system that required natural hormone supplementation to be brought back into balance. /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: Maybe these two symptoms would have automatically resolved when she began probiotic supplementation at the end of the diet. She didn't take the time to /f_ind out, or support her body in its healing path. Instead, she quickly ingested a very damaging drug to suppress the symptoms. Whether she did so out of fear or ignorance, I was still saddened that she would sabotage her health and eorts thus far in this manner. Well, who can speak for another person? And she probably had numerous reasons for her actions. But the end result was two steps forward, one step back (or maybe two steps back). Unfortunately, she concluded from this that the elemental diet didn't work very well for her. But natural healing doesn't work that way. We've been trained by the medical system to expect instant relief (suppression of symptoms) and when we don't get it, we think the natural treatment method isn't working. A pathway of natural healing involves many twists and turns, especially since true healing involves healing the mind, body and spirit. When a symptom comes up (or reappears), instead of just /f_inding out how to get rid of it, you need to /f_irst ask yourself, \"Why is this symptom here? What's my body trying to tell me? What is the message here for me?\" /T_he answer will form part of the treatment to heal that symptom. As your body sends you messages (symptoms) for what needs healing next, try to stick with your body and continue to support it and heal it, rather than just using a drug to suppress the symptom. Replace words like '/f_lare' and 'symptom' with the word 'message' and see how that alters your feelings and attitude towards your body. Instead of saying, \"/T_he erythema nodosum have reappeared again, how do I get rid of them?\" Try saying, \"My body's developed swollen, painful, nodules...what does that mean...what's my body trying to tell me?\" /T_he answer will probably be a mixture of physical and emotional reasons, and only you will be able to decipher the message from your body telling you what it needs you to do next. Let me give you an example from my own life of how this whole process of 'symptoms as messages' can work: I started bleeding from my colon seven months a/f_ter the birth of my second child. I passed out from dehydration, so went to the hospital and received four bags of saline. I refused a blood /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 transfusion as my hemoglobin was only /seven.oldstyle/three.oldstyle and that's not low enough to warrant the risk of a transfusion, in my opinion. I immediately used Jini's Healing Implant Enema to stop the bleeding (it took only two applications) and then went on the IBD Remission Diet for two weeks to facilitate thorough healing. When I connected with my body/spirit to /f_ind out why this had occurred and what my body was trying to tell me, I realized several things. First of all, my body had been trying for months to get the message to me using lesser signs; mouth ulcers, gas, fatigue, sugar cravings, mild pain a/f_ter or during eating, etc. Only when I failed to heed any of these We've been trained by the messages did it clunk me over the head with the one sign/message I couldn't medical/drug system to expect ignore - intestinal bleeding gets my attention like nothing else! instant relief (suppression of /T_he message or teaching my body/higher self was trying to give me symptoms) and when we don't get encompassed several issues in my life - some physical and some emotional. it, we think the natural treatment Firstly, I wasn't getting nearly enough sleep at night as my daughter was method isn't working. teething, and waking up to ten times a night in discomfort, wanting to be breastfed back to sleep. I was then getting up a/f_ter only a few hours sleep and doing a full day's work looking a/f_ter both children, cooking, housekeeping, and working in my oce when I could. My husband and I share parenting and housekeeping duties equally. But to give you an idea of the workload, he's a very healthy, /f_it/muscular man, getting a full night's sleep and he was still exhausted. Secondly, due to the demands of the kids and my escalating stress levels, I wasn't eating enough at mealtimes, and due to my fatigue I was then using sugary foods to give me the energy to keep going. Next, when I looked at why I was doing these physical things to my body, the emotional reasons became clear. I found it very dicult to say, 'no' - to my children, my husband, business associates, etc. Out of guilt and some kind of 'strongman' complex, I was trying to do it all. Also, I must point out that extended sleep deprivation interferes with your ability to think and make decisions. It's very easy to get into an inecient or damaging feedback loop and be too exhausted to see it, or /f_igure out how to break it. /two.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT A/f_ter addressing the physical component of my healing path, I also had to address the emotional component, otherwise I wouldn't fully heal, or, I would be sick again fairly quickly. I had asked my mum to come out and help during my convalescence and I stayed in bed for two weeks, sleeping and allowing my body to heal. My mum also took my daughter at night and gradually (with no trauma, crying, etc.) taught her how to sleep through the night without breastfeeding, so as to provide a long-term solution to my sleep deprivation problem. Notes: As I was lying there in bed recovering, having ample time to read, take a bath whenever I wanted to, having all my meals (shakes, broths & jello!) brought to me, I realized: I have a better life now! What motivation do I have to get well? So that I can return to the life of drudgery and exhaustion I've been living? How had my life become so pathetic? So my next line of thinking was, \"Okay, what do I need to change in my life to make me want to get well, to make me look forward to getting out of bed in the morning?\" As a result of that exploration, I hired one of my son's sports camp teachers to babysit two nights a week from /four.oldstyle - /eight.oldstyle pm. Tuesdays became my night to myself or to go out with a girlfriend, and my husband went out to play soccer with his friends. /T_hursdays were designated date night with my hubby - we would usually catch a matinee movie and then dinner. I also hired a cook/housekeeper to come in from /four.oldstyle - /eight.oldstyle pm three nights a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and what a dierence she made! She did all the laundry, tidied up the house, made supper and a dessert (enough for two meals), then cleaned up a/f_ter and le/f_t a sparkling kitchen. If one of the kids was grumpy during dinner, she played with them so that I could actually eat a full meal, undisturbed! I then also hired a cleaner to come in every Saturday morning to thoroughly clean the whole house, change beds, do laundry, etc. Could we /f_inancially aord all this help? Yes and no. But as my husband and I agreed, our children are our /f_irst priority. In order to take care of our kids properly, we both have to be healthy and happy. We decided that even if we have to go into debt for the next few years, it's worth it. Once the kids are in school, we'll have more time to work the hours necessary to pay o any debts. /T_hen, to fully round out my healing, /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 I released the pain and trauma of the past few months and the bleeding episode from my colon with my bodywork therapist, whilst embracing and arming the new knowledge and balance that had come into my life. I also had several sessions with a hypnotherapist to address the root issues involved. Now, if I had taken my colonic bleeding as a sign that natural healing methods didn't work, and just gone on Prednisone or Remicade to suppress the symptoms, what a tremendous opportunity for learning and growth I Your body is always advocating would have missed - for myself and my family. And think of the extensive, on your behalf, it's up to you systemic damage the drugs would have done and how long it would have to decide what to do with the taken me to heal from that.

Your body is always advocating messages and opportunities (i.e. \u0003 on your behalf, it's up to you to decide what to do with the messages and symptoms) it gives you. opportunities it gives you. Symptoms Or Side Eects? I've o/f_ten received emails from people who are following the recommended treatments in this book, but still experiencing a particular symptom. One of the /f_irst things I've learned to ask is, \"Which medications or other supple - ments are you also taking?\" Usually, the person is also taking a drug (or in some cases a natural supplement) that causes the exact same symptom they can't seem to heal. As you read through the list of possible drug side eects listed below, you may also want to ask yourself, \"What kind of damage is this drug doing to my body that it could produce these kinds of symp - toms?\" And is the suppression of symptom 'A' worth incurring additional symptoms 'B, C, D and E'? If I recommended an herb in this book that would stop diarrhea, but also cause nausea, gas, headaches and fever, would anyone want to take it? And wouldn't you think I was ridiculous for even suggesting you take it? In fact, wouldn't you think that a method of 'healing' that causes extensive, additional damage is a tad insane? I was contacted by a medical doctor who was thinking about putting his daughter on /six.oldstyle-MP, but he was worried whether that would interfere with her hormonal system. However, his daughter had already been on /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Prednisone and Remicade - both of which completely impair adrenal gland function. /T_he adrenal gland produces hormones that are inextricably intertwined with hormonal pathways and production throughout the body - and other glands require hormones from the adrenal gland as 'building blocks' for the hormones they produce. Her hormonal system had already been extensively damaged and 'interfered with'. /T_his man is a medical doctor, he knows all this (and in much greater detail than me). But he too is blind to the reality of prescription drug use: Suppression of a particular Notes: symptom(s) simultaneously damages the body, with the subsequent damage o/f_ten being worse than the original symptom you are seeking to suppress. Nothing in the body functions independently, everything is interlinked with far-reaching, or, domino-like consequences. Nothing in your body functions in isolation. When you look at the list of side eects for a drug, think about what system, glands, organs, etc. must be being damaged by that drug to produce such a symptom and think about the rami/f_ications of that on your health and body. O/f_ten when you present your doctor with your concerns about side eects, she'll pull up the pharmaceutical data on placebo-controlled trials and show you that the incidence of these side eects is quite low, so you don't need to worry. Firstly, you may be one of the minority that experiences those side eects, so it is a concern. Secondly, I have heard from too many people who are experiencing supposedly 'rare' side eects from particular drugs to conclude that the rates of incidence indicated in pharmaceutical trials play out the same way in reality. /T_he reason for this disparity, I cannot say - although recent reports seem to indicate that pharmaceutical companies have not been totally honest in their drug reporting, and in some cases have deliberately misrepresented or suppressed studies/results that don't support their drug. Keep this in mind when considering a drug or when trying to sort out your own symptom pro/f_ile - don't just look at the 'common' side eects, look at the ones designated as 'rare' too. For example, I have heard from dozens of readers so far who were following all the appropriate natural healing methods and still experiencing bloody diarrhea. However, once they discontinued taking Asacol, their bloody diarrhea soon disappeared. /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/two.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 You also need to read the complete 'side eects' list for drugs you may be taking for other conditions. One of my phone consultation clients was convinced her colitis started a/f_ter she took Zolo/f_t (an antidepressant) but all the doctors she'd told her theory to quickly dismissed her concerns. So I looked up the pharmaceutical information for Zolo/f_t and sure enough - one of the \"common\" side eects listed was Gastroenteritis, and one of the \"rare\" side eects listed was colitis! I can understand using drugs as a short-term, emergency therapy; when Often, people are you're really scared and haven't yet discovered an alternative therapy that simultaneously taking a drug (or in works. Sometimes we take drugs because we're simply not aware that there some cases a natural supplement) are eective natural alternatives. Other times we may take drugs because we are afraid, because someone else (a doctor, a family member) tells us that is causing the exact same we must, otherwise this or that terrible thing will happen. What they don't symptom they can't seem to heal. usually tell you, or even know, is all the terrible things that may happen to you because you're taking the drugs. Or perhaps we take the pills because deep down we're lazy, because we don't really want to expend the time and energy necessary to investigate why and how our bodies have become so pain-full, so full of dis-ease and it's so much easier to pop a few pills and hope that looks a/f_ter it. As long as we're following an authority /f_igure's direction for our health, we just need to do as we're told, right? Wrong. No one inherently possesses any authority except that which you give to them. You are still responsible for your own health, whether you appoint someone else as your authority, or whether you appoint yourself. It's really important for you to take a balanced, discriminating look at yourself and your motives. Ask yourself, \"Why am I taking each of these drugs?\" If you discover you're taking drugs mainly out of fear, then your next step is to determine whether the time is right to face your fear, or whether it's best for you to keep using the drugs until you're in a stronger place. I'm certainly not advising anyone to discontinue their prescription drugs prematurely. You have to be ready, with an alternative plan in place, and the timing has to be right for you. I encourage you to look at the alternatives and then follow a course of treatment that feels right for you. Some of you may not feel safe tapering o your drugs until you've used the /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT diets, supplements and therapies in this book o/f_ten enough to feel really comfortable and /f_luent with them.

Some people are also able to use drug therapy very sparingly and /f_ind it eective as a short-term or stop-gap measure. If you're one of these people and it's working for you then great, by all means continue with what feels right for your body.

Weaning O Prescription Medication If you decide to wean yourself o your drugs and your doctor will cooperate with you, excellent. But you may /f_ind that easier said than done. I was reading an Internet posting once from an American fellow and he mentioned that if you tried to diverge from your doctor's advice at all, he/ she would notify your insurance company that you were behaving \"AMA\" (Against Medical Advice), and it would be very dicult for you to get insurance or a renewal. So if you feel that you should be o drugs, and your doctor disagrees with you, then /f_ind a new doctor who's more open-minded and willing to work with you, not against you. /T_he following tapering o procedure is probably similar to what your doctor will recommend. /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/six.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 *Please remember that all the information in this book is simply my own opinion. I am not a medical professional, and you undertake all therapies and procedures at your own risk and liability. Never just stop taking a drug. An abrupt change would be very stressful and probably trigger a /f_lare in symptoms. Always gradually bring your body o the drug, giving yourself time to adjust, whilst simultaneously following the appropriate Healing Diet , exercising, taking care of yourself emotionally, using the appropriate herbal supplements, and getting plenty of sleep and Never just stop taking a drug. relaxation time. If you've been on a mild drug, or haven't been on the drug An abrupt change would be very for very long, e.g., two months, you can do a 'fast taper' in which you just stressful and probably trigger a halve the dosage every week until you're down to half a pill (which you take for a week), and then you stop. However, if you're on a stronger drug (like /f_lare in symptoms. Prednisone) which you've been on for six months or more, you'll have to do a 'slow taper' similar to what's outlined below. You need to slowly taper o the drug in order to give your body time to kick in and re-start the functioning that was suppressed by taking the drug. Slow Taper Procedure e.g., Prednisone - Current dosage: /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle Week Eleven: Nothing. Keep in mind that the tapering schedules outlined here are simply \u0003 guidelines for you to use and you should feel free to adjust them in \u0003 whichever way you feel is best for your body. For example, using the \u0003 Prednisone slow taper outlined above, you may want to reduce to the \u0003 dosage listed in Week /f_ive and six and then stay at that for the next month \u0003 before reducing your dosage again. Use your intuition (see Dialoguing With \u0003 /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Your Body in Chapter Six if you're not sure about how to listen to your body) and wean yourself o your drugs at the pace that's right for you. If you go too fast and don't allow your body enough time to activate and implement its own healing mechanisms, you'll only set your healing back. Also, you need to make sure you're simultaneously following the appropriate Healing Diet and taking whichever herbal supplements will help you at that time. Adding a bodywork therapy and emotional healing tool to your support structure (see Chapter Six) will also greatly aid you in your healing process. Notes: If your medical doctor won't work with you on this issue, then please /f_ind a naturopathic physician who will, as this will help you feel a lot more con/f_ident and secure through the ups and downs that will undoubtedly ensue. Remember that most of the drugs used in treatment of IBD (and some for IBS) are very strong, systemic drugs. /T_herefore, they cause a great deal of damage and will also likely make you feel ill when your body starts to detoxify and /f_lush out these drugs. Do not expect to stop your drugs, implement natural healing methods and just feel better with every day that passes. When you're weaning yourself o drugs - and during the root-level healing process that will follow - go back and read Chapter One again, so you have a better idea of what to expect on your healing pathway. Expect ups and downs, expect short-term recurrences or periodic worsening of symptoms (healing crises). But know that if you stay with your body during these times and allow it to detoxify itself, or give you additional messages about what needs healing, then you will reap the rewards in abundance. If you stay tuned and connect with your body during these healing crises, you'll know what you need to do next. Don't give your authority away to me, or your doctor, or anyone else during these times. You are the only one who knows what's best for your body and you may feel led to do something that I disagree with, or your doctor, or family disagrees with, stay with your own body and follow its guidance above all else. Follow your own path and only do what you feel is right and safe for you. You may choose to combine elements of what's listed in this book with drug /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 therapy, if it works for you, great! You may also want to take a long time and wean yourself o each of your drugs very, very slowly. You know what's best for you, so check in with yourself and your body regularly and follow your own intuition. If you've been on drugs for longer than six months in a row, please make an appointment to see a naturopath to /f_ind out which organ and gland functioning is being interfered with as a result of the drugs you're ingesting. Your naturopathic doctor can then prescribe you the appropriate herbs and Expect ups and downs, expect vitamins necessary to reduce toxicity and stimulate normal functioning in short-term recurrences or periodic the aected glands and organs. But remember to follow the guidelines in worsening of symptoms (healing Chapter Two when introducing new supplements. Acupuncture is also very eective for stimulating organ and glandular functions. crises). But know that if you stay with your body during these times Immunosuppressive Drugs & Hormonal Health and allow it to detoxify itself, or If you've been taking any of the immunosuppressive drugs (like Prednisone, give you additional messages Remicade, Imuran, etc.) for three months or longer, your hormonal (symptoms) about what needs (endocrine) system will most likely be out of balance and this can cause healing, then you will reap the far-reaching consequences in the body. Immunosuppressive drugs can suppress the function of the adrenal, thyroid and pituitary glands, thus rewards in abundance. interfering with normal hormone production. However, as hormonal health is still a relatively new /f_ield, you need to /f_ind a physician (MD or ND) who specializes in hormones and has lots of experience reading and interpreting hormone tests combined with symptom pro/f_iles. I had two doctors (an MD and an ND) tell me my hormone levels were normal, when I knew intuitively there was something wrong with them. I was eating three meals plus two protein shakes per day and I was still losing weight. I was freezing cold all the time and even when I used a hot water bottle or bath to warm up, I wouldn't stay warm a/f_terwards. I was very irritable and felt depressed many days, and I was usually very tired. I /f_inally found a doctor who specialized in hormone health and she ascertained that indeed, my thyroid was low, my cortisol levels very high, and my estrogen, progesterone and testosterone were all very low /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Notes: LISTEN TO YOUR GUT as well. I began supplementing with raw adrenal gland extract, thyroid extract, DHEA, and natural progesterone cream. From my second day of supplementation, I was no longer cold and I began gaining about three pounds per week. My mental/emotional symptoms also subsided very quickly and my energy increased proportionately. If you're a woman over the age of twenty, I highly recommend you purchase a book called, What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause by John R. Lee, MD and Jesse Hanley, MD. Don't let the title mislead you, this is the best book on hormonal imbalances I have read, and all the factors - from birth control pills to synthetic clothing to emotional/lifestyle factors - that contribute to hormonal imbalance are covered. /T_he book also goes into hormone testing and therapy in detail so it's an invaluable resource guide if you suspect your hormone levels are o, or that your adrenal or thyroid are not functioning properly. Men who've been on immunosuppressants will also /f_ind this book helpful. As well, there's a booklet (geared more speci/f_ically to men) available in most health stores called Natural Progesterone Cream: Safe and Natural Hormone Replacement (A Keats Good Health Guide) by C. Norman Shealy, MD, PhD, that is helpful - particularly if you have, or your family has, a history of prostate gland problems. Most hormonal supplements your naturopath prescribes can just be added to a daily protein shake along with the rest of your supplements, if you prefer. DHEA is tasteless, raw adrenal extract is pretty bland as long as it doesn't have other substances added, raw thyroid extract (like Armour /T_hyroid) is a very small pill that can be swallowed or chewed easily. Do not take synthetic hormones as they do not have the same holistic, supportive eect on the body - make sure all hormones and thyroid or adrenal supplements are /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle natural. You may also want to try homeopathic thyroid and adrenal support medicines. During my second pregnancy, I used a homeopathic formula that provided support for my liver, spleen, thyroid, pituitary, pancreas and adrenal glands and found it eective. We monitored my thyroid levels (TSH) throughout my pregnancy with blood tests, and the homeopathic remedy alone (along with good diet, nutritional /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 supplements and exercise) resulted in consistent, marked improvement throughout the pregnancy. A hypothyroid condition can cause mental retardation in the fetus so it's not something you want to take chances with! Above all, if you suspect you have a hormonal imbalance the important thing is to /f_ind a doctor who specializes in hormones - an ordinary medical doctor (MD) or naturopathic doctor (ND), or gastroenterologist, will not be skilled enough to interpret your test results and symptoms accurately. You need to /f_ind a medical doctor or naturopathic doctor where the majority of their practice consists of people with hormonal (endocrine) problems. Immunosuppresive drugs can suppress the function of the SURGERY Regarding surgery, I maintain a similar stance to drug use - not for me, thanks! Prior to my departure from the medical system, my doctor was insisting that I must have gastrointestinal surgery. Sure I've gone through some pretty rough periods since, but I'm still here and doing quite nicely, in fact, much better than the people I know who've had the recommended surgery (or /f_ive). My resolve did falter at one point and I gave in to having surgery to remove some external perianal skin tags back in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle. /T_hey weren't bothering me at all, but the doctor was worried they might be malignant. Not surprisingly, they were benign and promptly grew back in six months. What a waste of time, trauma, pain, and damage that was! Like drugs, surgery for in/f_lammatory bowel disease does not address the root cause, it merely cuts out the section of the body that is displaying the symptom. Surgery does not heal, it just temporarily removes the symptom. Like drugs, it is a short-term solution that o/f_ten escalates over time as the body is increasingly damaged. Obviously, like drugs, this is also an area where you'll have to make your own decisions based on what you feel is best for your body. I have managed to stay so strong in my resolve to avoid internal surgery at all costs, because of the research I did prior to making my departure from the medical establishment. At that time (/one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle), every textbook I read on Crohn's stated that when surgery was performed, the disease, for some adrenal, thyroid and pituitary glands, thus interfering with normal hormone production - causing far-reaching consequences. /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT unknown reason, jumped to a minimum of three new sites. Again, this struck me as the same /f_lawed reasoning that was behind drug therapy; short-term relief at a tremendous cost and worsening of the condition long- term. More recent reports indicate there is a /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-/eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle chance of the disease recurring close to the resection (the statistics vary depending on which study you read), with the number of years between surgery and recurrence being roughly proportionate to the severity of the initial condition. I once read a report of a woman with Crohn's who was so ill she was close Notes: to death, so her doctors felt she might as well try a risky, untested surgical procedure in the hope it might prolong her life. /T_hus, she received a complete intestinal (small and large intestine) transplant. Even on massive doses of immunosuppressive drugs, her new healthy intestine had Crohn's throughout within seven months. /T_his is further evidence that IBD is a whole-body phenomenon, as the author of the report concludes: \"/T_he /f_indings in this case suggest that factors other than immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease and support the theory that Crohn's disease may be an exaggerated response to environmental triggers such as infection, enteric micro/f_lora, nicotine, or drugs in genetically susceptible individuals.\" I o/f_ten consult with readers whose colitis has progressed to the point where they are seriously considering a colostomy (complete removal of the colon). /T_heir doctors o/f_ten tell them that their problems will be over and they'll be pretty much disease-free a/f_ter a colostomy. However, if you go to the support-group websites for people who've had a colostomy or J-pouch surgery, you get a completely dierent story. /T_here, you will discover that /four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the people who've had a colostomy suer recurrent, ongoing infections of their J-pouch. And many of them report that this causes symptoms similar to, and in some cases worse than, their original colitis! So if you are considering a surgical procedure, make sure you visit a few support-group or message board type websites for people who've already been through the procedure. And don't focus on the ones who've /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 recently had surgery, but listen to what the people are saying /six.oldstyle months or one year following the surgery. Personally, I believe we will have much better results if we treat and heal the whole mind/body rather than just try to medicate or cut out the currently aected part. No matter how bad my condition has become, I have always been able to heal it naturally using the Healing Diets , herbal supplements, bodywork therapies and visualization techniques listed in this book. Yes it can be scary at times and it can also take a lot of work and self-discipline, Like drugs, surgery for but it is so very much worth it. I also make extensive use of spiritual and in/f_lammatory bowel disease energy healing therapies, because contrary to popular belief, 'miracles' are does not address the root cause, not so few and far between. If you feel you're inevitably headed for surgery, why not see an energy or spiritual healer and ask for a miracle. What have it merely cuts out the section of you got to lose? the body that is displaying the symptom. Surgery does not heal, When Is Surgery Really Necessary? - Holistic vs. Medical Parameters it just temporarily alleviates the Another factor that's helped me to avoid surgery is the fact that I don't symptom .have colonoscopies or sigmoidoscopies, barium enemas, upper GI tract x-rays, or any other exploratory procedure done. Aside from the initial set of exploratory procedures done for my diagnosis nearly /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle years ago, I've had no further testing or exploratory procedure of any kind. /T_herefore, I have no idea how 'bad' my condition has been at times and I believe this has helped me to not be frightened into having surgery, but rather to stay focused on healing myself. When I was /f_irst diagnosed, the doctor couldn't even do a complete colonoscopy since she couldn't get the tube through a part of my intestine that was narrowed - even though she tried to ram it through six times (oh yes, I was counting!). I continued to have terrible abdominal pain periodically for a few years following, along with bleeding, diarrhea and severe anemia. But I never had surgery and I never went back for another colonoscopy. I know the symptoms to watch for that would indicate intestinal perforation or rupture (very rigid abdominal wall, no bowel movements, intense pain and fever or chills) - which are critically life-threatening events and require hospital treatment. But I do know how to stop colonic hemmorhaging and small intestine bleeding using /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT natural methods (see Chapter Two). /T_herefore, in the absence of a truly 'life-threatening' condition, I prefer to use natural methods to heal my body rather than surgery. Keep in mind that a medical doctor's assessment of an exploratory test result is based on his experience and what he believes is possible within the parameters of his profession. Unfortunately, since most medical doctors are not educated about alternative healing therapies or procedures they will honestly tell you that there's nothing else you can do and you must have surgery. In their experience, they're speaking the truth. Notes: I received an email from a woman who resisted surgery for a long time until her husband convinced her she was endangering her life. A/f_ter the surgery, her doctor told her that the section of the intestine they removed was so narrowed there was no way it would have ever returned to normal. In the doctor's experience, there was nothing he could do to restore her intestine. However, our bodies are capable of 'miraculous' regeneration, change and healing once we give them the right tools and conditions. Until you utilize the bodywork therapies (including EFT, hypnotherapy, and energy/spiritual healing), herbal treatments, Healing Diets , and lifestyle guidelines listed in this book, you really have no idea of what your body is capable of. I currently have either a narrowing or a stricture in my throat and my rectum. For years I've been purposely keeping my stool loose so as not to tear the stricture upon defecation - which then causes it to bleed. I eat slowly, taking small mouthfuls and chewing well to avoid choking. A fellow I know has the same problem with his throat and he's had it ballooned open twice so far (which is very painful and traumatic). Each procedure lasts about six months and then he's back to square one. Or is he? We don't know the deeper damage this violent, abrupt procedure could be doing to his throat tissue, visceral membrane and musculature in the area. I've chosen to address my condition holistically. I've discovered that the amount of narrowing in my throat is directly related to my stress level, whether I'm upset, and whether there's something I need to be saying that I haven't said. Addressing the applicable factor causes my throat to relax and open up so at times I don't even notice anything wrong with my throat. I've /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 recently felt ready to address the stricture or narrowing in my rectum in sessions with my craniosacral therapist, Lori Main. When we /f_irst began working with the area, I could barely insert my pinkie /f_inger through the stricture and then it would bleed a/f_terwards. By the second session, Lori could insert her index /f_inger (past the second knuckle) with no bleeding following. She's also not sure that the narrowing is even a stricture and we're now thinking that it may just be a traumatized internal sphincter muscle. I'm also noticing changes in my hips, knees, back and throat as she frees up the restrictions in my rectum and releases the emotional trauma We will have much better stored in the tissue. I've also started working on the emotional factors results if we treat and heal the underlying my choking problems with a wonderful EFT therapist named whole mind/body, rather than Aileen Nobles. See Chapter Six for more detailed descriptions of these types just try to medicate or cut out the of therapy and what they can do for your body. currently aected part. So you see, when a medical doctor says this or that is or isn't possible, he is only speaking from his narrow band of experience. Most medical doctors do not receive any training in the dozens of very eective alternative therapies available for healing and releasing the body. I encourage you to educate yourself on what options are available to you and try the gentler, root-level, long-term forms of healing /f_irst. /T_he emergency surgical procedures will always be available to you. And in truly life-threatening conditions they do have their place. It's up to you to connect with your body and discern, truly, how serious the problem is and what will bene/f_it you most at this time. You cannot rely on anyone else to do this for you with the same degree of truth or accuracy, for no one (no matter what their professional quali/f_ication is) knows your body better than you do. You may have already had a few surgeries by the time you read this book; that's /f_ine. Find out exactly which sections of your intestine were removed (get a copy of the report from your /f_ile, if possible) and make an appointment to see a naturopathic doctor. Your naturopath will be able to work out which, if any, nutrients you're unable to absorb properly, and then you can take the vitamin or mineral in sublingual, transdermal, or lozenge form. Following is an illustration that shows you some of the nutrients absorbed at dierent places in the gastrointestinal tract.

Take some time to be healing and releasing the body. still and go into your body, open up a discussion with your intestines and see how your body feels about having the surgery and whether you feel it's necessary (See Dialoguing With Your Body in Chapter Six). It can also be very eective to ask your subconscious to give you a dream to help you decide what would be best for your body. Ask for a dream for guidance when you go to bed at night and keep a pen and pad of paper beside the bed to record anything you can remember upon waking, whether in the morning or in the middle of the night. You may receive guidance or feel strongly that surgery is the best course for you - in that case, by all means proceed with it. Ultimately, only you can and should decide whether having surgery is right for you. You are the one who knows the best treatment for your body. GASTROINTESTINAL EXPLORATORY PROCEDURES Some gastroenterologists feel it's necessary to have regular internal scopes to monitor your disease. Personally, I think colonoscopies, sigmoidoscopies, /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT gastroscopies, barium enemas, etc. are overrated as a disease-management tool. /T_hey are unnecessary in many cases, and also very damaging to the mucosal lining and bacterial /f_lora. Please go back and re-read the section on probiotics in Chapter Two to /f_ind out how integral a healthy gut /f_lora is to your health. When you have a colonoscopy or barium enema, it completely disrupts (and sometimes wipes out) the bacterial /f_lora in your bowel. Any kind of upper-GI exploratory procedure is going to have a negative eect on the bacterial /f_lora in your stomach and small intestine. If Notes: these procedures are not followed with a long-term, high dose course of probiotics, then your gut is le/f_t wide open to damage and infection from bad bacteria, yeast, parasites, viruses, etc. However, although gastroenterologists know that these procedures seriously disrupt the bacterial /f_lora of the gastrointestinal tract, most do not follow exploratory or diagnostic procedures with probiotic (good bacteria) supplementation. /T_his is ludicrous! Some of the top research presenters at probiotic conferences are gastroenterologists. Are members of the profession not in communication with each other, or is there another element or motivation at work? I don't know. What I do know is that any exploratory gastrointestinal procedure (particularly colonoscopies and barium enemas) should be followed with Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema and at least three months of full-spectrum, high dose, oral probiotic supplementation. Again, see Chapter Two for full instructions on taking probiotics. Colonoscopy Screening For Colon Cancer For the past few years in America, there's been a massive advertising push urging people over age /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle to have yearly colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer. Not surprisingly, I've begun to have an increasing number of people over the age of /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle contacting me for advice. /T_he last woman I talked to was /seven.oldstyle/four.oldstyle years old and until that year, had never had a gastrointestinal problem in her life. She was dealing with a widespread and debilitating case of ulcerative colitis when a mutual friend passed on my phone number to her. One of the /f_irst questions I asked her was whether she had a colonoscopy /three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 prior to her colitis problems? \"Why yes,\" she said, \"my doctor suggested I have one to scan for colon cancer and then a short while later I began having problems....\" Well, that was worthwhile! Now you know that you don't have colon cancer, but we'll set you up for ulcerative colitis instead! If you look at cancer in holistic terms, it is not something that suddenly occurs, it's usually at least a /f_ive or ten year accumulation of unhealthy practices. You'll hear people say so many times, \"He was perfectly healthy, nothing wrong with him, and then the next day he had cancer!\" Any exploratory gastroin-/T_hese are people looking at the body through an allopathic (western testinal procedure (particularly medicine) view/f_inder. If you were to look at that person from a natural, colonoscopies and barium enemas) holistic perspective, you would /f_ind many factors that have contributed over the years to the gradual degradation of health that results in cancer. should be followed with And although there will be clear physical factors that have contributed to Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema such an illness, there will also be emotional factors. and at least three months of Dr. Gabor Mate (MD) has written a fantastic book that I strongly urge full-spectrum, high dose, oral everyone reading this to get, called, When /T_he Body Says No - /T_he Hidden probiotic supplementation.

Isolation and stress aect many who may believe their lives are quite satisfactory.\" So you see, if you're concerned about the possibility of colon cancer, then begin preventive measures. Implement the guidelines in Chapter Four and eliminate all the carcinogens from your food supply and environment. Use Chapter Two to heal your colon and stop the physical damage that predisposes people to colon cancer. Use the emotional healing techniques in Chapter Six to fully heal your mind/body, and recognize that emotional health is just as crucial as physical health - and indeed, the two cannot be separated. However, if you have a strong intuition that you should have a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer (or for any other reason), then by all means do so! You know your body the best and you should de/f_initely listen to what it tells you. /T_he Wales Day Centre (a colo rectal and proctology clinic in Sydney, Australia) has an excellent website giving good descriptions and full color pictures of many exploratory/diagnostic procedures, so it's a good place to go for general information if you're considering any of these procedures. Click on both their patient and practitioner information sections: http://www.wales.com.au . /T_he pictures may also be useful for you to use during healing visualizations (see Chapter Seven). Colonoscopy As A Tracking Or Con/f_irmation Tool Please realize the seriousness of these procedures and don't undertake them lightly, or because your doctor is pressuring you to. Another reader who had achieved full remission underwent a colonoscopy to con/f_irm that she was indeed completely healed. However, shortly therea/f_ter, she experienced a /f_lare and asked me whether I thought the two (colonoscopy and subsequent /f_lare) were related? Of course they were! Please don't do this to yourself. If, for some reason, you feel you must have an invasive, damaging procedure done to con/f_irm your healing, then please follow it immediately with Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema and three to six months of high dose, oral probiotic supplementation. /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CCHHAAPPTTEER 5 R 5 We can get into a fascination or 'information addiction' with our bodies. So much of our life seems unstable and frightening, full of shi/f_ting sands and precarious perches. We can feel like we're always on the edge of a precipice, in constant fear of the element that's going to bump us o the edge and send us hurtling downwards. And anyone who's gone through a '/f_lare', where one day you're feeling /f_ine and the next day you're two feet from the grave, knows exactly what I'm talking about! So we seek to gather as many hard facts as we can, hoping to allay our fears and be able to say 'this is what's wrong with me'. So many people with non-speci/f_ic symptoms talk of the relief they feel when they're /f_inally diagnosed. /T_his is due to the paradigm of medical/pharmaceutical healthcare that we've been brought up with. We think that if we can only pinpoint, speci/f_ically, what's wrong, then we can take that speci/f_ic drug or surgery to cure it. But as we've already discussed, each step along this thought sequence is erroneous. Drugs and surgery don't cure. And having a label to assign to your set of symptoms does nothing to heal you. Natural, root-level healing involves breaking out of this mindset and simply connecting with your own body. Your body can tell you everything that's wrong with it and everything you need to do to heal it. You just have to listen. Of course, connecting with and listening to your own body is harder initially than taking drugs, having exploratory procedures, or even surgery. Drugs, surgery and exploratory/diagnostic procedures put the responsibility for /f_inding out what's wrong with your body and helping it, onto someone else. It's much more dicult to take this responsibility ourselves. It's easier to look to someone else to help you, rather than look to yourself. Here's another way of looking at the whole exploratory procedure issue. /T_he average length of life for an intestinal cell is three days. Technically, this means that the gastrointestinal tract is capable of complete regeneration, or degeneration, in three days time. So, let's say you had a colonoscopy that revealed you had extensive ulceration along your descending colon. If you did everything required for complete healing (emotional, physical, spiritual), you could potentially turn that around and have a completely healed intestinal surface three days later. Likewise, if your colonoscopy Notes: /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT showed that everything was /f_ine, in only three days time, you could have ulceration or in/f_lammation present throughout. If the test results can be so transient, how meaningful are they? Some of you may have heard of a newer technology for scoping the upper gastrointestinal tract called Capsule Endoscopy. /T_his involves a test preparation procedure to clear the tract and then swallowing an encapsulated camera that takes photos as it travels along the small intestine. In a drug trial that utilized this procedure, researchers were Fecal Occult Blood Test Since it screens for blood in the surprised to discover that /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle./eight.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the pre-screening group stool, don't take the test during (healthy people with no history of IBD, IBS, etc.) had ulceration your period and avoid red meat for present in their small bowel!

We really don't know enough to draw a supplements can also skew the conclusion. I'm providing these examples merely to make you results. So can drugs: In the question the inherent value of exploratory procedures, and week leading up to the test, you shouldn't take anti-in/f_lammatories whether they're worth the damage they do to your intestinal like Advil or more than one daily lining, mucosa, and bacterial /f_lora. dose of aspirin. Sari Globerman, Oprah Magazine , I rather like the approach of a gastroenterologist I know in March /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle. Vancouver, Canada. He asks the question, \"Will performing a scope at this time change the existing course of treatment?\" If the answer is \"No\", then he doesn't suggest doing one. Many doctors use scopes out of fear, worried that something bad might be going on. Others like to do them as a form of research or on-going data collection. Many do them as a preventive measure against potential malpractice suits - if you do develop cancer in your colon and your doctor has not suggested yearly scopes, then he's in big trouble. So when a doctor is pressuring you to have a colonoscopy, you need to take his position and fears into account. /T_hink back over all the scopes you've had. Did you learn anything new about your condition? Did the information result in a better, more eective /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 course of treatment? Did you /f_ind that a/f_ter each stint of testing you were weaker and sicker, and it set your healing back signi/f_icantly? Did you suer psychological and emotional trauma as a result of the scope(s)? In my view, these procedures are simply too invasive and damaging to the body and can result in long-term damage and imbalance to the intestinal lining and bacterial /f_lora. In addition, my mother's doctor once told her about some of the \"complications\" a colonoscopy can result in, like perforation through the intestinal wall and even a ruptured spleen in one case. At present, there isn't even an eective method for completely sterilizing colonoscopy Notes: equipment (please see references in Appendix D for substantiating data) - so think about the implications of that for disease transmission (IBD, cancer, AIDS, hepatitis, etc.). /T_here are disposable sigmoidoscopes available now, so if you're going to have a sigmoidoscopy, insist on a disposable one to avoid risk of contamination. I haven't had a colonoscopy since my very /f_irst one used to determine the medical diagnosis of my condition. Why do I need another one? I know when my intestines are bleeding, I know when they're spasming, I can feel if a portion is thicker than elsewhere. I live with my intestines every day, I do not need a gastroenterologist to do a scope to tell me that there's \"a signi/f_icant increase in ulceration of the bowel wall, a /f_issure in your rectal canal and increased production of mucus\". I can tell all that from my bowel movements: How I feel when I'm having them, and what shows up in my stool and the surrounding liquid. Also, if you're going to use the techniques and diets in this book, and follow a pathway of natural healing, your gastroenterologist's assessment of your current condition is not going to make much dierence to your treatment. If you're experiencing blood with your bowel movements or mixed in with your stool, the Healing Diet to follow and herbal supplements recommended are similar regardless of whether the bleeding is from ulceration of the bowel wall or your rectal canal. Try to trust your body and learn to read the signs it gives you, rather than resorting to a damaging procedure to give you that same information. I'm not saying that colonoscopies and other exploratory procedures are never appropriate or helpful. I'm just suggesting /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson We can get into a fascination or 'information addiction' with our bodies. We seek to gather as many hard facts as we can, hoping to allay our fears, and to be able to say, 'This is what's wrong with me.' LISTEN TO YOUR GUT you think very carefully before submitting to one and ask your doctor the key question, \"Will the results of this procedure change the course of treatment?\" Again, we get to the same point as when considering surgery: Take your doctor's opinion as simply that, his opinion. Compare it with your own opinion and gut feelings and decide whether or not you really need yet another scope or scan and whether that will actually bene/f_it you in any signi/f_icant way. Weigh up the possible risks and subsequent damage the procedure will cause and ask yourself whether it's worth it. Don't be surprised if you /f_ind the answer is no. A large part of the reason we submit to unnecessary scopes and surgeries is because of fear. Be aware of, and make sure you're not taking on the fear of your doctor or family members. Fear-based decisions are never optimal, so if you /f_ind yourself making a decision largely due to fear, take some time out. Slow it down (your doctor and family may try to make you feel like everything is extremely urgent! Just ignore them) and take some time by yourself to relax, meditate and get in touch with yourself. Take a walk out in nature and read some upli/f_ting, expanding books - anything by Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Caroline Myss or Bernie Siegel will help you get back your power and strength and separate yourself from your fear. /T_hen, when you're in a more balanced, centered frame of mind you can make your deci - sion as to whether you want to have that surgery or exploratory test done. YOUR DOCTOR AND YOU I spent eight years without a gastroenterologist or even a regular GP (general practitioner) because I couldn't /f_ind a doctor who was willing to work with me and support me in the way that I wanted to treat and heal my body. Instead I encountered scorn, hostility, doctors who were intimidated by me, and doctors who thought I was naive and stupid. It was simply more trouble than it was worth. As a result, I frequented the walk-in medical clinics where I was able to just show up from time to time, request a prescription for folic acid, or get some blood work done, or testing for hormone levels, etc. /T_his worked well, for a while. /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 However, as time wore on I felt an increasing need to balance out my relationship with modern medicine and perhaps seek a more integrative approach to my health care. Fortunately, there has been such a growing awareness of alternative health and healing in the last few years, that it has aected and in/f_luenced even the medical profession. Indeed, some of its loudest proponents are medical doctors themselves (Christiane Northrup, Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Bernie Siegel, etc.). More and more medical doctors are also training as naturopaths, acupuncturists, homeopaths, etc. I was able to /f_ind a medical doctor whose approach to health is fairly The last thing you need is a open-minded and inclusive. She is also fairly comfortable with me not doctor who gives you negativity, following her advice and is simply there to provide medical information undermines your eorts, and uses and treatment protocols. In her words, \"Try to think of me as just another scare tactics to get you to do what resource. I'll give you my opinion on what I think is best and why, and she/he believes is best. None of then you put it together with your other knowledge and resources and this will support you in your eorts make a decision as to what you feel is best for you\". It makes a tremendous dierence to have a doctor who supports and is willing to work with you to heal yourself. and with what you feel is best for you. If you're looking for a medical or naturopathic doctor, or a gastroenterologist in your area, go to my website: www.JiniPatel/T_hompson.com , and check out the Healthcare Professionals section. Here you'll /f_ind other readers' recommendations for doctors they have found to be good and/or open to natural healthcare methods. Also, if you have a doctor you think is doing a good job, please post their name and contact information on the site, so others can bene/f_it too. If you do not have an arming, supportive doctor, please start looking for one. /T_he last thing you need is a doctor who disagrees with the way you wish to manage your health. She/he will only give you negativity, under - mine your eorts and use scare tactics to get you to do what she/he believes is best. None of this will support you in your eorts to heal yourself. Try to /f_ind a doctor with additional holistic healing quali/f_ications, or one who has a reputation for being a non-traditionalist. /T_hey are out there and it is so important to have a doctor who supports you and is willing to work with you in the way that you want, or one who is simply happy to let you do your own thing. Still, remember to not give your power away no matter how /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: safe or knowledgeable you think your doctor is. Always maintain yourself and your own gut intuition as your /f_inal authority and decision-maker. If you absolutely cannot /f_ind a supportive doctor in your area, then /f_ind a supportive natural physician - naturopath or homeopath. Follow your appointments with your medical doctor with an appointment with your naturopath. Your naturopathic physician will help balance out the negativ - ity you receive from your medical doctor and will help you combat any fear or scare tactics that may have thrown you into despair. Your naturopathic physician can also help you with natural methods for addressing health concerns that may have shown up in your medical tests. My main point regarding the medical profession and the tools it has to oer (drugs and surgery) is simply this: Treat it as an option. It is one path out of many and not necessarily the best one. Use the procedures and tools that are useful to you, when they're useful, and don't worry about the rest. Drugs and surgery are usually invasive, traumatic ways of treating the body and they don't tend to support holistic, long-term healing. If there's a kinder, gentler way to accomplish the same end, then even if it takes longer and is more work, take the gentle, healing path. It's time to start working with your body; loving, supporting and nurturing it on a gentle, deep-level, long- lasting healing path. NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE In my opinion, having a good naturopathic doctor that you see regularly is just as important as regular visits to your allopathic doctor (GP). /T_heir training consists of four years of specialized, intensive training in natural medicine at a college or university that's accredited by the CNME (Council on Naturopathic Medical Education). /T_he CNME in turn is regulated by the U.S. government. Be sure and ask your naturopath which college he/she went to and how long the course was, as there are numerous non-accredited colleges selling mail-order degrees. See Appendix B for referral information to an accredited naturopath. A registered naturopathic physician is able to work with you in all facets of treating and maintaining /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle ALLOPATHIC MEDICINE CHAPTER 5 health using a range of natural, herbal and homeopathic methods. And I'm not just referring to the treatment and management of your IBD or IBS. Use your naturopath for all aspects of your health - if you get a cold or the /f_lu, arthritis, or an irregular period, for example. /T_here are also an increasing number of medical doctors who also have a naturopathic degree or integrative medicine quali/f_ication, and they can be very helpful since their knowledge covers the whole spectrum of treatments and testing procedures available in both modalities. But again, you have to Make sure your doctor is make sure the doctor is skilled, respectful and that you 'click' with him/her. skilled, respectful, and that you 'click' with him/her. Natural Diagnostics I once went to my naturopath simply because my intuitive feeling was that I was de/f_icient in some mineral. A/f_ter asking me a series of questions, he determined that I was de/f_icient in magnesium. One of the main clues was that my throat was spasming occasionally and making it dicult for me to swallow sometimes. A few days a/f_ter starting the magnesium supplementation, my throat was /f_ine - because magnesium relaxes smooth muscle tissue (which is why it can also cause diarrhea in high doses). Now, can you imagine if I'd gone to my allopathic doctor complaining of a spasming throat and trouble swallowing? I don't even want to think of the barrage of tests that would have been ordered, probably including a gastroscopy! How long do you think it would take an allopathic doctor to discover the problem was due to magnesium de/f_iciency? Most likely, it would not be discovered. Experience has taught me to always take the gentler, less invasive path /f_irst. If you're having a health problem, seek out the natural forms of healing /f_irst. A naturopathic doctor is not only well trained in a wide variety of natural treatments, but is also excellent as a resource and reference guide to other forms of non-invasive testing or therapy that may bene/f_it you. Again, use the same discretion you would when choosing any doctor or practitioner. Ask around for someone with a good reputation, phone your local association of naturopathic physicians for a referral of doctors in your area /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT (see Appendix B) and don't be afraid to keep looking until you /f_ind the right doctor for you. Finally, use your naturopathic doctor the same way you use all your doctors, healers and practitioners - as a resource. Don't give your power away and always follow your own intuition above anyone else's advice or opinion. Turn now to the Healing Journey Workbook and complete the section for Chapter Five. /three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle 6 Mind/Body Therapies \"/W.swashhen someone comes to me for healing or help, the fir thing /I.swash do is to examine the overall pattern of the person's life. /T.swashhis usually reveals certain blo/c_ks that are holding him or her ba/c_k from being healed. /T.swashhese blo/c_ks may be present on both a physical and a /s_piritual level. /F.swashrom the /s_piritual andpoint, the mo common blo/c_ks are the negative attitudes and emotions that a lot of people carry around all the time. /T.swashhese blo/c_ks mu be overcome for healing to occur. /I.swashn working with people who have cancer or other serious illnesses, /I.swash find that unless they can learn to let go of negativity, their si/c_kness comes ba/c_k.\" Sun Bear, Medicine Chief of the Bear Tribe Medicine Society Jini Patel Thompson In my experience, there is always an emotional component to any physical problem. Many times the physical problem/symptom will just disappear once you address the underlying emotional component, but at other times you need to address both \u0003the emotional and physical bodies. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT There are many wonderful, healing bodywork and treatment therapies available and each one has its own particular bene/f_its to oer. I have tried enough dierent types of therapies over the last twenty years to /f_ill a small encyclopedia (and spent tens of thousands of dollars doing so!), so rather than go into everything I've tried, I'm just going to present you with those therapies I've found to be the most helpful and healing. Three Types Of Useful Bodywork Therapies /T_here are three types of bodywork for people with IBS or IBD that are particularly useful. /T_hese are loosely de/f_ined categories, and as you go through this chapter, you'll notice there is a de/f_inite overlap between the three categories. Or, the therapy can /f_it into dierent categories depending on the skill and/or intent of the practitioner. /T_he /f_irst category of bodywork therapies focuses primarily on the physical tissues, bones, organs, etc. where the problems are occurring and the therapies are designed speci/f_ically to release and heal the problems in the physical body. /T_his category includes acupuncture, acupressure, massage therapy, visceral and myofascial release, rol/f_ing, craniosacral therapy, etc. /T_he second category of bodywork therapies oers an integrated mind/ body approach, where you address the physical restrictions, trauma and malfunctioning, and at the same time access the emotional and spiritual bodies to release the emotional pain, trauma and anger that is stored in those tissues, organs, bones, etc. /T_his is called a somato-emotional approach ('soma' means 'body') to healing. /T_hese therapies include many of the therapies mentioned above, but the practitioner has gone to the advanced levels of the modality, or received additional training in somato-emotional release. So again, this category of therapies includes advanced craniosacral therapy, advanced rol/f_ing (practitioners at this level in rol/f_ing are rare), acupuncture and acupressure. /T_he third category of therapies involves interpreting, or getting to the underlying emotional root of the physical problem by addressing the /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 emotional component /f_irst. By releasing and healing the emotional trauma, the corresponding trauma in the physical body can be automatically and simultaneously released. Keep in mind that psychotherapy and other forms of 'talk' therapy are not sucient to eect root-level, long-term healing in the physical body. You need a form of emotional therapy that also integrates with the physical body in some way (like EFT or hypnotherapy). In my experience, there is always an emotional component to any physical problem. Many times the physical problem/symptom will just disappear once you address the underlying emotional component, but at other times you need to address both the emotional and physical bodies. Practitioner Skill Is Paramount However, you do need to keep in mind that each of these therapies is only as good as the individual practitioner. For example, I once went to two massage practitioners with identical training and background, and one was fabulous and the other fair to middling. So, unfortunately, /f_inding a good practitioner can sometimes be a dicult, costly, and time-consuming task - but de/f_initely well worth it. When locating a practitioner, ask around all your friends and family and see if anyone knows of someone with a good reputation. Pick up the local, free metaphysical/new age publications in your city and see who's advertising. Above all, go with your gut and let your intuition guide you as to which type of therapy you'd like to try, and which practitioner(s) to make an appointment with. It's also useful to call a number of therapists /f_irst and just have a quick chat with each of them. You'll get a sense of who you like or 'click' with just from the phone conversation and then you can try those /f_irst. Notes: \u0003 ACUPUNCTURE Acupuncture (and at a gentler, slower rate, acupressure) is excellent for balancing the energy /f_lows in your body and stimulating the healthy functioning of all your glands and organs. I found the main bene/f_it derived from this type of treatment was stress control and pain reduction. It is also excellent for maintaining and promoting overall, holistic health and /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Acupuncture is excellent for balancing the energy /f_lows in your body, stimulating the healthy functioning of all your glands and organs, and reducing stress and pain. supporting proper organ and gland functioning. However, in my opinion, there is a big dierence between Chinese and Japanese acupuncture. With Japanese acupuncture, I have never even felt the needles going in, much less felt any pain or twinges as a result. I have only ever felt relaxed and nurtured during and a/f_ter a session. With Chinese acupuncture, the needles used are much larger. I could feel every one going in and some of the insertions were even painful. A/f_ter the needles were in I felt hot rushes up my legs, parts of my body went numb, other parts felt ice cold and in one session it felt like my arms had separated from my body. So, unless you prefer more aggressive, dramatic treatments, I de/f_initely recommend seeing a Japanese acupuncturist rather than a Chinese acupuncturist. Try to /f_ind a practitioner who is actually Japanese and has undergone their training and certi/f_ication in Japan. If the practitioner is non-Japanese, be sure and /f_ind out the length of their course and how long it took them to receive their certi/f_ication. /T_he acupuncture I received in Tokyo was at a Zen monastery and each practitioner was deeply immersed in training for about four years. Unfortunately, I've seen numerous Western practitioners advertising who've just done a two to four week course in acupuncture in China or Japan and come back to practice as a certi/f_ied acupuncturist (question MDs in particular). Likewise, if you do decide to go for Chinese acupuncture, try to make sure the practitioner is Chinese and/or has received their training and practiced in China /f_irst. /T_here are certain acupuncturists who have also trained in somato - emotional release, so if your practitioner has this training, then acupuncture or acupressure can be a gateway to accessing the emotional body as well. BIO/hyphen.capKINESIOLOGY Bio-kinesiology, or applied kinesiology (sometimes called Touch For Health), is basically a system of testing and asking your body directly what's wrong with it and what it needs. /T_he practitioner /f_irst sets up a /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 control, say an amount of pressure on your raised arm that you can easily resist. /T_hen, she will proceed to ask your body a series of questions whilst applying pressure to your arm. When she asks something to which the answer is \"yes\", your arm will collapse, unable to resist the pressure. Some practitioners will also combine this with stimulating acupressure points to test the functioning of glands, organs and various bodily systems. A/f_ter your body has outlined where it's malfunctioning, or in need of support, the practitioner will select some possible herbal or homeopathic remedies and then proceed to ask your body which of them it wants and My position regarding bio - in what dosage. /T_his is done by laying the remedies on your stomach and kinesiology is that it can be very asking via the muscle-testing procedure (pressure on the arm) whether this helpful and useful, but do not give particular remedy will help and in what dosage. your power away to it. Practitioner Energy Interference I know several people personally who've had excellent results using this method of diagnosis and treatment, both for one-time illnesses and also as a system of ongoing healthcare. I myself was introduced to both liquid chlorophyll and homeopathic iron as a result of a session. My only reservation about this method of treatment is that I wonder how much of the practitioner's energy and intent is involved in the testing process. For example, let's say I have a practitioner who feels that yeast is a really bad thing and that most people have an overabundance of yeast in their system. When she is asking me the question about yeast, she will simultaneously be projecting a very strong energetic thought or intent about yeast into the feedback loop - and she is part of the loop because she is touching my body and also asking the question. So when my arm collapses, signifying that I have a yeast problem, how much of that response is mine and how much is hers? So, again, my position regarding this type of therapy is that it can be very helpful and useful, but do not give your power away to it. Your body may test positive for something during the session, but a/f_terwards when you're back at home you may get a strong intuitive feeling that you don't actually have that problem or need to avoid that food. In that case, de/f_initely go /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT with own body and intuition. You being directly in tune with your body is the clearest channel of information and communication there is. Use your applied kinesiology practitioner and the testing process as a resource, as an opinion, as a source of information, but not the only one and not necessarily the best one. MASSAGE THERAPY Keep trying until you /f_ind a practitioner who's so good that they make a signi/f_icant dierence to your body and wellbeing - your body should feel unblocked, /f_luid and expansive. I saw a therapeutic massage therapist regularly for about ten years (sometimes once a week, sometimes once every ten days) due to the scoliosis in my spine and multiple injuries from car accidents and martial arts. Now, I have a fantastic yoga instructor (Sandra Sammartino - she's /six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle years old and has been teaching for over thirty years), and as a result my neck and spine are gradually straightening and I'm learning how to unlock and release tissues, bones, etc. myself. As a result of her training and classes, I no longer need to have massage therapy, although I'll occasionally go for a treat or stress relief. During the decade I did need regular massage, every time I moved to a new city it was a real hassle /f_inding a good practitioner. When I moved to Vancouver I tried six dierent therapists before /f_inding someone I was happy with. My advice to you is: Don't give up. Keep trying until you /f_ind a practitioner who's so good that they make a signi/f_icant dierence to your body and wellbeing. I walk out of one hour sessions with my massage therapist feeling like I've got a new lease on life and my body feels completely unblocked, /f_luid and expansive. In short, I feel wonderful and any pain or tightness in my body is relieved. Bene/f_its Of Massage Therapy Researchers at Miami's Touch Research Institute (TRI) found that premature infants who received three massages a day over /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle days gained /four.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle more weight than preemies who weren't massaged. According to Family /T_herapy Networker, TRI has also documented the bene/f_its of massage in treating everything from colic and bulimia to chronic fatigue syndrome /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 and back pain./one.superior Massage also raises immune-system cell levels in people who are HIV-positive./two.superior Look for a certi/f_ied or registered practitioner who specializes in therapeutic as opposed to relaxing massage. Practitioners who also have additional quali/f_ications like craniosacral, visceral manipulation, myofascial release, or applied kinesiology will be able to give you a better treatment; the more training the better.

CRANIOSACRAL THERAPY Craniosacral therapy is a bodywork therapy that can be just a straightforward physical therapy whereby the practitioner facilitates deep- level release of muscle tissue, connective tissue, and various internal valves, tissues and organs. Or it can be a therapy that goes that next step further into the release of traumatic memories and emotions that are being stored in the physical body. It's really up to you which level you wish to go to and how you would like your practitioner to treat you. You're usually fully clothed throughout the session. Practitioners who are only trained in the /f_irst or second levels of the therapy will only use it as a physical therapy tool. /T_he ones who've pursued the higher levels of training will utilize it as a somato-emotional release tool as well. It's up to you to discuss with the practitioner your needs and wishes and specify what you feel comfortable with prior to the session beginning. /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: \u0003Craniosacral therapy was originally developed by an osteopath (akin to a MD and chiropractor rolled into one) named Dr. John Upledger. It focuses on the energy, vibrational and /f_luid /f_lows and rhythms around the brain and spinal cord. In this way it is a physical therapy. However, depending upon the intent and skill of the therapist, craniosacral therapy can also facilitate what is called somato-emotional release. /T_his technique is based on the premise that emotional/spiritual trauma is also stored in the physical tissues of our body. /T_hus, healing one's emotional issues/traumas through counseling or mental self-realization is not enough. One must also go into the body itself and release the pain and trauma that is stored there (hence somato(body)-emotional release). Somato-emotional release can also be facilitated by other types of therapy such as Reiki, Pranic or energy healing, Qigong and /T_herapeutic Touch - all of which I would also recommend. Traumatic Memories Stored In The Body Every craniosacral session I've had has been dierent. In the /f_irst one, Brian Finnie (the therapist) was massaging and moving my neck around and as he moved my neck a particular way I would have certain memories spring large-as-life to my mind. If the memory got to be too overwhelming (because I was actually re-living these memories) he would move my neck slightly out of the position and the memory would fade away and I'd be instantaneously normal and happy again. /T_hen, a/f_ter giving me a few moments to rest, he'd move my neck back into that position and whoosh, I'd be right back in the technicolor memory and emotion immediately, sobbing my eyes out, or incredibly angry, or whatever. As I re-lived these memories from my current position of increased strength and maturity (that is, stronger and more mature than when the incidents actually occurred), I was able to see them in a new light and with new understanding. I was able to place the events within a context and somehow, in the accessing of these memories within my body, I was able to release them and their accompanying emotional state. Needless to say, being able to release these experiences and emotions at such a deep level feels absolutely wonderful. I could literally feel the tightness and heaviness being released from my body. /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 Finding My True Voice I had a most remarkable experience with another practitioner, Ruth Redekop, who is trained in both craniosacral and energy healing. I went to see her because a month previously I'd had an eruption of mouth ulcers all over my tongue, lining of my mouth, gums and the lining of my throat. I'd spent the month using all my physical-level cures for mouth ulcers (non - acid diet, DGL licorice extract tablets, aloe vera juice) that usually worked, but they just kept getting worse. Notes: \u0003I explained all this to Ruth and said, \"I know it's something else, but I've \u0003 just been unable to get to it, I've tried going into the problem when I'm \u0003 meditating, but haven't been able to turn up anything.\" So, she started the \u0003 session with some craniosacral therapy on my bowel and then moved up to \u0003 my jaw and mouth. A/f_ter about /five.oldstyle minutes (with her hands on my jaw) she \u0003 said, \"Ok, can you tell me what's going on in here\". I started to talk and as I \u0003 talked I realized that for the past year or so, I had given up my \"Voice\". \u0003 About a year previously, my husband and a close friend had said that they \u0003 were really hurt by my usual direct manner of communicating and they \u0003 had asked me to change the way I speak, to make it a kinder, gentler way of \u0003 communicating. Appalled at the thought of hurting anyone, I complied. \u0003 Well, they were happy and I became someone who didn't sound at all like \u0003 me. Interestingly, over the year both my friend and husband became more \u0003 and more blunt and direct in their manner of communicating, while I \u0003 sounded more and more like a counselor, couching and talking round \u0003 everything. In fact, as I talked to Ruth, I realized that I had become one \u0003 of those namby-pamby, mince-words, talk-round-the-issue type of people \u0003 that I can't stand! I also realized that I was not responsible for other people's \u0003 feelings or reactions to who I am. If people can't handle my truth, then don't \u0003 ask me for it! It took me about ten minutes to realize and verbalize all this to Ruth. \u0003 She then asked me how my mouth ulcers were. I kid you not, they were /nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle \u0003 gone, as in disappeared . /T_hat evening I went home and told my husband \u0003 and friend about the session and about how I was going be from now on: \u0003 Me. /T_he next morning I woke up and the ulcers were /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle gone. So, there \u0003 /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Being able to release these experiences and emotions at such a deep level feels absolutely wonderful. I could literally feel the tightness and heaviness being released from my body . LISTEN TO YOUR GUT you have it. Take it or leave it. I will also say that this healing is the most dramatic that I've ever experienced. Usually, I /f_ind healing occurs in layers or stages and takes place over several sessions. Your Body's In Charge A woman I know in Israel goes to a spiritual/energy healer there and she says she doesn't even know what it is that he does, but she feels her colon is linked to her inner child. She says she cries through every session and for an hour or two a/f_terwards, and then for the next few days her colon is perfectly /f_ine, as if her ulcerative colitis didn't even exist. Yes, our emotional body is inextricably linked and intertwined with our physical body and when you start to explore this link and heal the emotional body, some of the physical results are truly amazing. /T_he really important thing to keep in mind about this kind of therapy is that your body is in charge of what emerges in the session, and yes, it may be emotionally dicult, but your body knows your limits and will not take you where you cannot handle it. It will not take you beyond your limits, so you don't have to fear having something occur that is unmanageable. If you feel unsure about going to the somato-emotional level, you can start with a craniosacral practitioner who uses the therapy at a purely physical level (without the somato-emotional release), which is also very valuable and healing for the body. /T_hen a/f_ter you're comfortable with the therapy modality, if you wish, you can seek out another therapist who can take you a little deeper. For those of you that tend to suer from heartburn, even though you don't eat a lot of acidic foods and you don't lie down right a/f_ter eating, you'll probably /f_ind tremendous relief from seeing a craniosacral therapist. When you go to the therapist, tell him/her that you've been having a lot of heartburn and your solar plexus and diaphragm need releasing. Of course, make sure that you're not taking a drug that's known to cause heartburn as a side-eect. For myself, whenever I've had heartburn, one /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-minute session of craniosacral therapy has usually eliminated it. /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 Internal Craniosacral Therapy Having physical-level craniosacral therapy to release your tailbone (coccyx) and rectal canal can also make a tremendous dierence to people with irritable or in/f_lamed bowels. I know of one woman who was cured of thirty years of diarrhea using this therapy. /T_he practitioner accesses these areas internally, either through your vagina or your rectal canal, so it has to be someone you trust and feel comfortable with. Most osteopaths are also trained in un-jamming or releasing the tailbone, so if you're already seeing an osteopath you may want to discuss this with them. If the practitioner Yes, our emotional body is is skilled and sensitive, you should feel minimal to no real discomfort inextricably linked and intertwined throughout the procedure. You can also bring a family member or spouse with our physical body. When you with you to remain in the room while the treatment is being carried out if start to explore this link and heal you feel vulnerable. the emotional body, some of the physical results are truly amazing .Craniosacral Therapy For Babies / Children /T_here are certain hospitals in the UK (England, Scotland, etc.) where every single newborn receives an osteopathic treatment that includes craniosacral therapy. /T_here is inevitably trauma to the cranium (head), body and emotional body of a baby born via vaginal or caesarean birth. If this trauma or damage is unresolved, it can lead to a host of problems for the person, both in infancy and as it grows to a child. /T_hese problems can include headaches, vision problems, chewing and swallowing problems, sitting, crawling and walking problems, projectile vomiting, colic, lack of balance/coordination, etc. /T_here are so many problems treated with invasive medical procedures - like surgery for blocked tear ducts, orthotics or braces for feet and walking problems - that are simply unnecessary if the baby/child is taken for craniosacral therapy. If your child is accident-prone it may be because their balance and coordination are being hindered - craniosacral treatment can re-balance accident-prone babies/children and help them avoid so much damage and trauma. I have lots of stories of 'miraculous' occurrences following craniosacral for babies or children and if you're interested in hearing them, or if you have a baby/child, then pick up my video called BABY FART AEROBICS: And /three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Craniosacral is such a wonderful, completely nurturing healing therapy, that every child and baby should have at least a couple of sessions to set them up for unrestricted growth and development. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Other Natural Treatments for Colicky Babies (available at www.ColicInfant . com). /T_here is a large section in the video where I show a live craniosacral treatment on my daughter Zara (then eight weeks old) accompanied by a fascinating, in-depth interview with craniosacral therapist Lori Main. Craniosacral is such a wonderful, completely nurturing healing therapy, that I believe every child and/or baby should have at least a couple of sessions to set them up for unrestricted growth and development. Babies and children should also be treated with craniosacral a/f_ter any violent fall or accident that causes jarring to the body, especially if their head was knocked or injured at all. I /f_irmly believe that if I had received craniosacral therapy as a baby and child, then I would not have developed scoliosis by the age of twelve. Craniosacral Therapy Or Surgery? I once had a phone consultation with a woman who had given birth four months previously, and ever since had heartburn so severe that even the prescription medications weren't working. /T_hen an ultrasound showed an unidenti/f_ied mass the size of a baseball in her abdomen, so the doctors were now wanting to do a full panel of gastrointestinal exploratory tests and possibly surgery. Understandably, she was very worried and coupled with the stress and sleep-deprivation of a newborn, you can just imagine this poor woman's state. A/f_ter a thorough discussion with her, I presented her with my opinion in which I summarized, \"You're understandably very scared right now and receiving a lot of pressure from doctors to proceed with the exploratory tests/surgery as soon as possible. However, you are faced with a choice. You can pursue the non-invasive healing methods /f_irst and see if that works. If it doesn't, the exploratory tests and surgery are always going to be there for you. If you take two weeks to explore kinder, gentler methods of healing, is that going to make so much dierence to your prognosis?\" I told her about the kind of things that craniosacral therapy can help with and especially since she'd just been through pregnancy and childbirth (which can really move around the internal organs and intestines), I suggested she start with that /f_irst. Luckily, she was /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 in a city close to mine so I was able to refer her to a top-notch craniosacral therapist named Henry Epp (in Vancouver, Canada). I also suggested she simultaneously see a naturopath, just to cover all possibilities. A/f_ter only two sessions with Henry, she discontinued her heartburn medication and had no remaining heartburn whatsoever. In fact, she felt such a change in her body that she had her doctor re-do the ultrasound. /T_he baseball-sized mass had completely disappeared and no further testing or surgery was required. Needless to say, she was overjoyed. Now just imagine the incredible amount of illness and trauma she saved herself by pursuing a natural path of healing /f_irst. /T_he possibilities for healing of IBS and IBD-related conditions through craniosacral therapy are so immense, that I recommend everyone reading this manual to /f_ind a good practitioner and have at least one or two sessions to see for yourself the relief possible through craniosacral therapy. To /f_ind a practitioner in your area, use the search tool at www.upledger.com and specify a practitioner at Level II or higher. Notes: \u0003 EMOTIONAL FREEDOM TECHNIQUE /parenleft.capEFT/parenright.cap I've spent the last few years learning about and experimenting with a body/mind healing tool called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). EFT is derived from a centuries-old Chinese acupuncture meridian tapping practice called Neigong. /T_he founder of EFT, an engineer called Gary Craig, used the principles of Neigong, but adapted it for the western mind. EFT works by tapping on a series of acupuncture (meridian) points whilst a) talking out loud about the problem, b) re-framing the problem in a way that sets you up for a positive or alternate experience concerning the problem and c) choosing or arming that you're willing to move into a new reality with this issue. Tapping on the acupuncture points whilst talking frees or releases the problem/negativity/trauma etc. from your energy body and your physical body. In this way it is a healing therapy that eectively integrates and eects change in the mind, body and spirit. /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson EFT works extremely well when applied correctly. The key is being able to /f_igure out what is at the root of your problem/ issue/symptom and then tapping eectively on that. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT EFT works extremely well when applied correctly. /T_he key is being able to /f_igure out what is at the root of your problem/issue/symptom and then tapping eectively on that. In certain circumstances, there can be a number of roots, or layers to the problem, which all have to be addressed to see resolution in your physical body. EFT is my favorite body/mind healing tool for the simple reason that once you learn how to do it eectively, you can do it yourself and take it with you anywhere. You may need a therapist initially, to guide you through your complicated, many-layered issues, but therea/f_ter you'll probably be able to address most problems on your own. Some people are able to reach this level of pro/f_iciency on their own, without any outside help, but others need several sessions with a skilled therapist to become /f_luent in the technique. Alternatively, you can purchase instructional videos from Gary Craig's website to help you (they're very reasonably priced). You can /f_ind out all about EFT, sign up for his free newsletter (which is excellent) and download a Basic Training Manual for free by going to www. Meridian/T_herapyTechniques.com . Gary Craig makes all this information available without charge because his ultimate vision is to have one person in every family trained in EFT and thus able to alleviate so much avoidable suering. For myself, I downloaded the basic, free training manual, read the newsletter regularly and had a mild degree of success using EFT on my own, but nothing noteworthy. However, I kept at it since it really 'clicked' in my gut that this should work really well, and I just hadn't /f_igured it out yet. /T_hen I tried a very expensive PhD psychotherapist who was EFT certi/f_ied, but again, /dollar.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle later I can't say a whole lot had changed. I must point out though, that I didn't really 'click' with this therapist. Although he was a nice enough fellow, I found him to be quite egotistical and at one point he even said, \"You're going to think that I'm God.\" Uhh...I don't think so, buddy! Yes, I know, I should have listened to my gut and walked out right then. Despite my disappointing experience with this high-pro/f_ile therapist, my gut kept urging me not to give up and a year later I found a really good EFT therapist named Andy Bryce. I have had excellent results from my sessions with Andy - with clear, measurable results. And not just for me, but there's /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 been a domino-eect for my husband and kids too - as we heal ourselves, the people connected with us shi/f_t and are healed too, if they're open to it. I had many sessions with Andy and worked mostly on money, career, issues with my mother, and my own parenting. Andy started o as a massage therapist, then moved into energy (pranic) healing and became a Reiki Master, hence his intuitive abilities are quite high and this really helps in being able to get to the root of an issue. When I began my sessions with Andy I was at a very low point, feeling Notes: \u0003absolutely swamped and in serious /f_inancial debt. In fact, a/f_ter the /f_irst two sessions I didn't re-book, because I couldn't aord it. But Andy, bless him, said to me, \"No, Jini, I see who you are and you are so close. Just pay me whatever you can aord, and if you can't pay me anything, then no problem, we're going to keep going. Because once we get you free of this stu, money is not going to be an issue for you.\" So I worked out what I could aord, and we kept going. /T_hings kept improving with each session, and I actually kept a written record of the all the positive /f_inancial events and shi/f_ts that occurred (and continue to occur!) By the /f_i/f_th session, I sent Andy a cheque for the balance owing on all my discounted sessions. EFT is such a wonderful therapy because it illustrates so perfectly (and quickly) that when you change energy/thought/feeling, you change reality. I'll just give you one example of how this works. Andy and I worked directly with my money issues for three sessions. When I /f_irst went to see him, we were absolutely bottomed out /f_inancially from raising our children ourselves (no daycare), and funding the growth of a new business. We had no assets le/f_t, were deeply in debt and it looked like we would have to sell our house in the next two months. During the sessions, I discovered that my money issues were also linked into parenting issues - prior to having children I'd had no trouble making money and could make things happen very quickly. A/f_ter our kids were born, both my husband, Ian, and I felt like we were moving through mud, trying to make things happen. Every day, every project, was such a struggle - with none of the ease and /f_low we'd both experienced before having children. During my sessions with Andy, I discovered clear psychological/emotional blocks I had to /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT EFT is such a wonderful therapy because it illustrates so perfectly (and quickly) that when you change energy/thought/ feeling, you change reality. becoming wealthy, and I also realized that my extreme love for my children combined with my fear that I \"must not screw them up\" caused my energy to seize up (as fear usually does). Energetically, I was contracting and stagnating, rather than expanding, /f_lowing, and opening. As I cleared these blocks using EFT, everything started to shi/f_t /f_inancially, for both myself and Ian. Previously, we had applied to every bank we could think of for some sort of /f_inancing, re-mortgage, second mortgage, line of credit, etc. - anything that we could use to fund us until our new business was generating sucient revenue. Every /f_inancial institution, including aggressive banks like ING Direct, turned us down. Your debt ratio is too high, they all said. Well, a/f_ter my third session with Andy, tapping away on money issues, Ian phoned up our bank manager again - and the bank agreed to re-mortgage our house for another /dollar.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle! Now, you see, this is the beauty of EFT - absolutely nothing had changed with our physical situation. We still had the exact same debt ratio. Our bank manager had refused to loan, re-/f_inance, or re-mortgage our house only six weeks prior. /T_he only thing that had changed was the energy. Our physical reality was the same, but our energy reality had changed completely. So we got the money we needed to fund the next stage of the business, and we didn't have to sell our house! As I continued to work with Andy on my /f_inancial issues, things like this happened one a/f_ter the other. I've included this /f_inancial example of EFT's eectiveness because sometimes with 'miraculous' physical healings, people will come up with all kinds of reasons to explain it away, or they'll attribute the healing to some other factor. However, with a hard topic like money, where all the factors have stayed the same, it's pretty hard to dismiss the evidence. It may take some time to work through all the layers of an issue (or illness), and it may take some experimenting to /f_ind the right practitioner, but EFT de/f_initely works very well - and it works long-term. I then felt my gut urging me to contact another EFT therapist named Aileen Nobles (I had read an article she'd written for the EFT newsletter). Aileen has been a psychic hypnotherapist for the past /two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle years and her clientele is /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 extensive, including celebrities and political /f_igures. She has her own cable television show called Light Transformation , where she will o/f_ten do EFT sessions on air. She was also Psychic to the Stars on Leeza Gibbon's Top /two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Countdown Show - a syndicated weekly music radio show. She was /f_ilmed having a session with a client for /T_he Learning Channel's All About Angels , and she gave predictions on NBC's /T_he Other Side . Aileen also talked about her experience working with angels on the Susan Powter Show , and consulted for CBS' Angels Among Us . In spite of being a well-known psychic in the U.S., Aileen is so gentle, friendly and caring, I felt immediately safe It may take some time to work and relaxed with her. through all the layers of an issue (or illness), and it may take some My gut was telling me that Aileen was the person to work with on long- standing physical problems I'd had with choking and an extremely tight experimenting to /f_ind the right internal anal sphincter muscle. I'd had choking problems since birth, and practitioner, but EFT de/f_initely my internal anal sphincter had been malfunctioning ever since I had works very well - and the results rectal surgery to remove some perianal skin tags in /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle. As I've written are long-term. throughout this book, physical problems are rarely (if ever) just physical problems. And with chronic issues/symptoms you can be sure there are multiple layers and many causative events involved. /T_his is why it is so helpful to /f_ind a therapist who is also highly spiritually intuitive, psychic, etc. Not only will they come up with things that instantly 'hit home' with you, but they will ask you the right questions to stimulate buried memories, forgotten hurts or vows, and make connections between separate events that you may have missed. Needless to say, my sessions with Aileen were profound, healing, and transformative. I highly recommend both Aileen and Andy to anyone doing this program. You can /f_ind a complete listing of EFT therapists in your area by going to: www.Meridian/T_herapyTechniques.com . You can also have EFT sessions by phone and this is equally eective (all my sessions with Aileen were by phone and some of my sessions with Andy). To /f_ind out more about Andy Bryce and/or book a session with him, go to: www.spiritcoach.ca . To /f_ind out more about Aileen Nobles and/or book a session with her, visit: www. aileennobles.com . /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Hypnotherapy is useful for addressing not only current issues and symptoms, but also if you want to explore your infancy, early childhood, or even past life events that you think may be negatively in/f_luencing your health. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Before you book an EFT session, I recommend you go to this website www. Meridian/T_herapyTechniques.com to download the free Basic Training Manual and learn the EFT tapping points /f_irst. /T_his will save you some money, as you won't have to spend your session time learning which points to tap on. For your /f_irst few sessions, it's also handy to keep the diagram of meridian tapping points in front of you, in case you can't remember exactly where they are. It's also useful (but not necessary) to have a speaker-phone for phone sessions, so you can have your hands free and really relax. HYPNOTHERAPY I've had many sessions of hypnotherapy throughout the years and they have de/f_initely contributed to my healing. Hypnotherapy is useful for addressing not only current issues and symptoms, but also if you want to explore your infancy, early childhood, or even past life events that you think may be negatively in/f_luencing your health. Again, the skill of the practitioner is of paramount importance here. Make sure the person possesses legitimate accreditation and that you also 'click' well with them on a personality level. You need to /f_ind a practitioner that you feel very comfortable and safe with, otherwise you won't be able to relax fully. Hypnosis is simply being in a state of deep relaxation - similar to meditation, or that zone where you've just woken up in the morning and are still kind of '/f_loaty' and relaxed. /T_here's nothing scary or voodoo about it at all. You remain in complete control at all times and can talk or end the session if you wish. Some people who are able to relax completely, very quickly, enter a state of supreme relaxation referred to as 'deep trance'. In a deep trance state it's like you're asleep, and upon 'awakening' you may or may not have any conscious memory of what's happened. However, even for people who don't remember anything, once someone starts talking about the session and what happened, the person will usually start to remember. However, whether you're in a light trance or deep trance, there certainly is a measure of 'giving up control' that takes place. /T_his has to happen in order for true relaxation to take place and for the session to be successful. /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/six.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 Choosing a practitioner who gives you a good gut feeling is your /f_irst step towards ensuring you're with someone who is safe. Other things you can do to ensure your safety (and thus enable yourself to fully relax) is to make sure the session is tape recorded from beginning to end. Or, you can set up your own video camera at the start of the session and then stop it at the end. Another alternative is to have a close friend or family member come in to the session with you the /f_irst few times, until you feel comfortable. /T_his can be dicult though, as you'll need to have someone who is truly supportive, non-judgmental, and able to accept whatever might come up during a session. Also, you may /f_ind yourself editing what you say because of your friend/family member in the room, and that won't be very helpful. For these reasons it's best to go with a tape or video recording if you can. Hypnotherapy (like EFT and Craniosacral therapy) is very helpful for people with IBD and IBS because it taps into the realm of healing possible within the brain-gut axis (see Chapter One). By addressing mental/ emotional issues that are adversely triggering the autonomic nervous system, hypnotherapy can resolve or at least help conditions like diarrhea, constipation, cramping/spasming, pain, heartburn, and faulty digestion and absorption. Remember, that these are all functions that are directly in/f_luenced by the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter One). So if you resolve the malfunctioning of your nervous system, you will automatically resolve (or at least improve) the functioning of your digestive system. Hypnotherapy has been extensively studied for its positive eects on people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the studies have been published in prestigious medical journals like Gastroenterology, Gut and /T_he Lancet . I have excerpted some of these studies in Appendix D for those of you who are interested, or want to do further research. /T_he research to date shows that hypnotherapy is extremely successful in reducing or eliminating all symptoms of IBS, and that the results held during follow-up periods of /three.oldstyle - /six.oldstyle months. However the following parameters must be met for optimal results: You need to have at least seven sessions in a row to see a measurable effect that lasts. Notes: \u0003 /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Anything that puts you in \u0003 touch with your intuitive self, and \u0003 plugs you into whatever it is you \u0003 call \"God\" , is a form of meditation. People with severe psychological problems or atypical symptom profiles showed lower rates of success. People over the age of /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle showed lower rates of success (perhaps because of mental barriers and an inability or unwillingness to fully relax?). Personally, I believe hypnotherapy is so eective for people with IBS \u0003 because their dis-ease has not become as systemic or entrenched as it is in \u0003 people with IBD. Also, almost all people with Crohn's, colitis, etc., will have \u0003 an infectious component to their illness. Altering/improving hormonal \u0003 secretions and digestive function is not going to resolve an infection of \u0003 pathogenic microorganisms (like yeast, fungus, mycoplasma, mycobacteria, \u0003 parasites, bad bacteria, etc.). /T_herefore, for people with IBD, hypnotherapy \u0003 is de/f_initely eective and can provide substantial relief and healing, but it \u0003 is not likely to eliminate your diarrhea (for example) or completely resolve \u0003 all symptoms, as it can for someone with IBS. Obviously, people with IBS \u0003 can also have an infectious component to their illness and perhaps these \u0003 people comprise the 'atypical symptom patterns' referenced in the studies \u0003 in Appendix D - for whom hypnotherapy helped, but was not nearly as \u0003 successful as for those with classical symptom patterns. If you have IBS, I strongly recommend you try EFT or hypnotherapy \u0003 to address the emotional component of your illness. If you have IBD, \u0003 I think you'll see better results from EFT or craniosacral therapy, \u0003 or, /f_ind a hypnotherapist who's also certi/f_ied in EFT (see www. Meridian/T_herapyTechniques.com for a list of practitioners) - this would be \u0003 wonderful for people with IBD or IBS. MEDITATION Essentially, anything that puts you in touch with your intuitive self and plugs you into whatever it is you call \"God\", can be labeled a form of meditating. /T_here are numerous bene/f_icial techniques and it's simply a matter of /f_inding what type of meditation suits you the best. A walk in the woods breathing in the wonderful fresh smells and feeling a part of the /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 mental chatter and activity o/f_ten /f_ind it helpful to use a mantra when meditating. Repeating a phrase (mantra) over and over again gives their mind something to do so they can focus on their breathing and allow themselves to become calm and still. Transcendental Meditation and Primordial Sound Meditation are both forms of mantra meditation. Simply sitting in a pool of sunlight, breathing deeply and opening yourself to receive the healing rays of the sun is a form of meditation. If you're a Christian who likes to pray, then just sit or lie down somewhere and instead of you talking to God or Jesus, let them talk to you - stay quiet and peaceful and simply listen, open yourself to receive. If you practice some of the healing visualizations listed in this book, as you become more and more /f_luent with them you will /f_ind yourself in a deeply relaxed, meditative state. If you /f_ind it dicult to relax and meditate on your own, your local metaphysi - cal bookstore should sell a selection of guided meditation cassette tapes - just pop one in your tape deck and follow the directions. Meditation helps you to develop your intuition and your ability to listen to and understand your body. /T_here are also direct health bene/f_its derived from regular meditation including stress reduc - tion, lowered blood pressure, improved mental functioning and an improved immune system. Following is a simple meditative technique I enjoy. Cultivating Stillness Sit down on the /f_loor (if possible; or in a chair) with your back straight, and shoulders relaxed. Keep your eyes open and focus your attention on your ajna chakra (also known as \"the third Level of Chronc Stress predicts Clinical Outcome in irritable bowel syndrome In the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), life stress contributes to symptom onset and exacerbation. One hundred and seventeen outpa - tients who satis/f_ied the modi/f_ied Rome criteria for IBS (/six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle with one or more concurrent FD symptoms) participated in a trial to test the relation of chronic life stress threat to subsequent symptom intensity over time. It was found that chronic life stress threat was a powerful predictor of subsequent symptom intensity, explaining /nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the variance on this measure over /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle months. No patient exposed to even one chronic highly threatening stressor improved clinically (by /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle) over the /one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle months; all patients who improved did so in the absence of such a stressor.

If you lick your /f_inger and dab some saliva on your ajna chakra it will help you to know and focus on where it is. Focusing your attention on your ajna chakra will cause your vision and attention to shi/f_t into so/f_t-focus, like when you're staring absentmindedly at something. Sit there for as long as you can and just do /three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT nothing. Be with the stillness. If you have thoughts, just let them come and then let them go. You can have thoughts constantly coming into your mind, but you don't have to pay them any attention. Don't /f_ight your thoughts, don't try to stop thinking, simply allow them to come and allow them to go. Try to be with your stillness every day. Meditation helps you to develop your intuition, and your ability to listen to and understand your body . DIALOGUING WITH YOUR BODY I advise numerous times throughout this book to \"follow your intuition\" or \"listen to your body\". For those of you who want a little more guidance in exactly how to go about this, you can develop your awareness and intuition by using the following simple technique: /one.oldstyle. Use whatever method you currently use to get still and peaceful. This could be praying, walking through the woods, soaking in a bubble bath, lying down and breathing deeply, or various forms of meditation. Use your method to become relaxed and still. /two.oldstyle. When you're fully relaxed and peaceful (or as near as you can get), and your breathing is deep, place your hand on your abdomen and simply allow the feelings and thoughts from your tummy/bowels/gut to flow into you. Allow yourself to feel whatever comes up, no matter how trivial or stupid or painful it may be. You will not be hurt by allowing yourself to feel. You will be healed. Just stay here for a while, allowing yourself to feel and acknowledge whatever comes up for you. The first few times you do this, you may want to stop after this point, or you may want to continue on to the next step. Do whatever feels comfortable for you. /three.oldstyle. After you've allowed some of your feelings and thoughts to arise, begin a dialogue out loud with your tummy/bowels (wherever you sense the feelings and thoughts are coming from). This could involve simply repeating out loud whatever feelings you're having: \"Yes, I'm feeling angry that my girlfriend went away for the weekend...Yes, I'm very worried about my deadline for this work project\". Or, you may find /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 yourself perceiving your guts as a helpless baby, or your own inner child, \u0003 and your dialogue may involve things like: \"Oh my poor sweetie, it's \u0003 okay, you're safe, mummy/daddy is going to look after you now...Yes, \u0003 I know, you've been so hurt.\" The important point is simply to allow \u0003 whatever you feel like saying, don't judge it, don't think about what it \u0003 might mean, don't worry that you're sounding ridiculous, simply allow. \u0003 /four.oldstyle. Continue breathing deeply. If you have any questions for your bowels \u0003 or stomach, ask them now, and trust whatever you feel is the answer. \u0003You will not be hurt by The feeling may be quite faint in the beginning, but you need to trust it allowing yourself to feel. You will and act upon it in order for your feeling (or intuition) to grow stronger. be healed. The more you trust those vague feelings or sense that you should or \u0003 shouldn't do something, the stronger the feelings and sense will become. \u0003 Intuition is like a muscle, the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets. \u0003 When you have nothing more to say, continue to lie or sit quietly for a \u0003 while, breathing deeply. \u0003 A/f_ter you've done this technique numerous times, you'll get to the point where you can pretty much instantly access whatever's going on in your gut at any given time. You'll be able to still yourself and connect with your digestive system in a matter of moments anywhere you might be. If you want to connect with another part of your body that's in pain or distress, simply follow the same procedure but place your hand on whichever part of your body you wish to access. A little tip here: When you're asking your digestive system what kind of food it wants, or whether a particular food is safe to eat, make sure you're asking and receiving an answer from your stomach/intestines, rather than your taste buds. Your taste buds may want beer and pizza - but your stomach/gut wants grilled /f_ish and butternut squash. O/f_ten I feel like eating something and when I check in with my body I realize it's my taste buds that want that food, but my stomach actually doesn't. /T_here was one time I craved sugar a couple of times a day for two weeks, but every time I checked in with my stomach, it didn't want sugar, it wanted water. So I would drink a glass of water and presto, no more craving for sugar! I tell you, the body is a strange and wonderful thing. /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT COLONIC MASSAGE Colonic massage is extremely helpful whether you're experiencing gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation or blockages. As the parent of a child with IBD or IBS, this can be a very meaningful way to connect in a soothing, loving way with your child. Most, if not all, of the medical treatments your child has been subjected to are invasive and traumatic. Alternatively, colonic massage is a very helpful treatment that you can administer gently Notes: and lovingly. A couple of years a/f_ter I had taught this massage technique to my brother (who is a medical doctor), he taught it to the mother of one of his patients in hospital with ulcerative colitis. /T_he next day while he was doing rounds with a couple of other doctors, the woman came rushing up to him and thanked him profusely for teaching her the technique. She said her child had slept through the night for the /f_irst time and that it had helped him more than anything else they had done. A tip: Make sure you're in a loving, calm state of being before massaging your child, and keep your movements gentle and sensitive throughout. When doing the colonic massage technique on the toilet, experiment with dierent sitting positions; lean forward or lean back. Breathe deeply into your diaphragm (you'll see it expand just under your ribcage), and the pressure from the air you've inhaled will o/f_ten be enough to move some stool along. Another technique is to sit back against the wall or back of the toilet, keep your abdomen completely relaxed and grab the tops of your knees with your /f_ingertips. Use your arms to rock your torso gently back and forth - don't use your abdominal muscles! Breathe deeply and relax. Alternate these techniques with colonic massage and you'll soon /f_ind the combination/ sequence that works best for you. You can also get a child's stepping stool (available very cheaply at Ikea), or use a couple of phonebooks and place them under your feet whilst sitting on the toilet. Raising your knees up higher than your hips more closely approximates a squatting position - which is the best way to facilitate the /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/two.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 passage of stool since it aligns and opens your rectal canal. However, if you have internal hemorrhoids, or a rectal /f_issure, you may not want to use the stepping stool under your feet. Properly aligning and opening your rectal canal can cause the stool to come out too quickly for those with hemorrhoids or /f_issures, or it may be okay/bene/f_icial. Test it and see if it works for you. If you use these techniques combined with colonic massage, rather than pushing and straining, you'll greatly reduce your chances of developing hemorrhoids and if you have some already, you'll be giving them the best chance to heal. Blockages & Constipation A self-administered colonic massage can really help if you're experiencing constipation, blockages in thickened areas of your colon, or blockages in diverticulae (hollow pouches that occur when the inner intestinal lining has pushed through weakened areas of the colon wall), where food is getting stuck and causing a lot of pain. -JWFS\u0001 4UPNBDI\u0001 /one.oldstyle. Lie down on your bed or the couch with your knees bent and the soles of your feet on the bed/couch. Take several slow, deep breaths to relax and calm yourself. Lift your shirt up, undo your pants and start at the lower right quadrant of your abdomen. Stroke your fingertips upwards until you reach the bottom of your ribcage. Now stroke your hand left across the underside of your ribcage and then down again to the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. You've just roughly traced the path of your colon, starting at the end of the small intestine in a horseshoe shape until it joins the rectal canal. $PMPO\u0001 3FDUBM\u0001 $BOBM\u00014NBMM\u0001 *OUFTUJOF\u0001 /two.oldstyle. Follow the path of your colon in a soothing, stroking motion (always in the same direction as described) and notice as you become more sensitive to where it is and how it feels. /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /three.oldstyle. The next step is to apply a bit of pressure with your fingertips and move them in a circular, probing motion as you follow the colon around. Experiment with both the probing motion and the amount of pressure you use. /four.oldstyle. As you get to know your colon better, you'll be able to notice any areas that feel harder and/or thicker than the rest. If you've got stool stuck in a diverticula (intestinal pouch), the pain and irritation should tell you where it is. Focus on this area now and gently massage in and around Notes: \u0003it with your fingertips. Imagine yourself gently breaking up the stool clogged there and helping it move through the thickened section, or out of the pouch, and stroking/massaging it along the path towards the rectal canal. /five.oldstyle. When you think you've cleared most of the blockage from the problem area, go back to the lower right quadrant and begin massaging the colon, moving upwards toward the ribcage, across, and then down to the lower left quadrant. When you get to the blockage again, spend a little more time, massaging the food through there and then continuing on the path to the rectal canal. /six.oldstyle. At any point in this process, you may feel the need for a bowel movement. If so, go sit on the toilet and continue with the massage. Remember to take deep breaths and stay relaxed. Keep your abdomen and anal sphincter muscle loose, open and relaxed. For a diverticulitis blockage, perform the massage on an empty stomach and experiment with drinking two glasses of warm spring water /f_i/f_teen minutes before your massage, and then two more glasses immediately following, to try and further help /f_lush out the stool particles. Gas & Bloating A similar colonic massage technique can also be used when you're feeling bloated and experiencing cramping from gas. /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/four.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 /one.oldstyle. Begin the massage sitting on the toilet. Take deep breaths and relax the \u0003 abdomen and anal sphincter muscle, allow yourself to make as \u0003 much noise farting and crapping as you want. Don't tense or hold \u0003 anything back. \u0003 /two.oldstyle. Use the same technique as described above - following around the path \u0003 of your colon from lower right, up, across to the left and then down the \u0003 left side - but instead of using your fingertips, use the heel of your right \u0003 hand in a kind of digging, circular motion and follow the colon around \u0003Most of the medical treatments to the rectal canal. your child has been subjected to /three.oldstyle.

Again, experiment with the massage motion and the amount of assisting their physical body. pressure you use. Be patient as it will take you a while to develop your \u0003 technique to maximum effectiveness. \u0003 /five.oldstyle. Keep massaging along the colon until you feel the pressure is relieved \u0003 and there's nothing more in there that wants to come out. /T_his technique is especially eective a/f_ter surgery (or a colonoscopy) as your colon will be full of air and causing you a great deal of pain. Get up and start walking around as soon a/f_ter you come out of the anesthetic as possible. If you need two nurses to support you in case you faint - get them. Walk around until you feel the pressure building, then go sit on the toilet (again, a nurse may need to come in with you in case you faint - don't worry, they've seen/heard everything and this is no time for modesty) relax your abdomen and anal sphincter muscle and begin the colonic massage. It will probably hurt like crazy but try to continue (of course, if you've had surgery on your colon, go very gently and carefully). When you've farted out as much as you can, go back to bed. Rest for about /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle minutes (more or less, whatever feels right), then call the nurse and go for another walk and massage session. Keep repeating this procedure until you have no more /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT air to get rid of. /T_his will speed your recovery considerably because not only will it ease the pain, but you will also resume normal urination more quickly, feel stronger, and be in better spirits overall. Cramping & Diarrhea If you tend to get attacks of cramping where you have to run for the toilet and then sit there for the next hour or two, because every time you try to get up, you have another bowel movement, then this technique will also be Notes: a big help to you. /one.oldstyle. Begin your massage sitting on the toilet. Remember to breathe deeply and relax. As you perform the massage, you'll basically be helping to move the separate little stool deposits that are dotted throughout your colon around and out of your rectum in a much shorter period of time than if you relied on your own peristalsis (rhythmic contractions of the intestinal wall), which is obviously not getting the job done. /two.oldstyle. Start at the lower right quadrant of your abdomen. Stroke your fingertips upwards until you reach the bottom of your ribcage. Now stroke your hand left across the underside of your ribcage and then down again to the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. You've just roughly traced the path of your colon, starting at the end of the small intestine in a horseshoe shape until it joins the rectal canal. /three.oldstyle. Follow the path of your colon in a soothing, stroking motion (always in the same direction as described) and notice as you become more sensitive to where it is and how it feels. /four.oldstyle. The next step is to use the heel of your right hand, or your knuckles, in a kind of digging, circular motion and follow the colon around to the rectal canal. Experiment with both the motion and the amount of pressure you use. /five.oldstyle. When you get to the bottom of the lower left quadrant, dig/press a little deeper and massage towards the center of your groin and down as far as you can go (this allows you to massage your rectal canal). Sometimes /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/six.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 you may want to hold the pressure there for a few moments and rock \u0003 gently back and forth. \u0003 /six.oldstyle. Again, experiment with the massage motion and the amount of pressure you use. Be patient as it will take you a while to develop your technique to maximum effectiveness. /seven.oldstyle. Keep massaging along the colon until you feel the pressure is relieved and there's nothing more in there that wants to come out. EXERCISE Yoga and Tai Chi are doubly bene/f_icial because they also liberate and activate the chakras It's imperative that you exercise at least three times a week. I cannot stress (energy centers) and the overall the importance of regular exercise enough. If all you can manage is to go energy /f_low within the body .outside, walk down the block and back - great! Do it. And if you can do it every day, even better. Any amount or level of exercise will help your circulatory system get rid of toxins and will put your mind and emotions in a healthier state, so they can then help your body. Mobilizing Your Lifeforce Energy If you can manage more, exercise to whatever level is comfortable for you, but not beyond it. /T_he goal of your exercising is to nurture and strengthen your body, not test it and challenge it. Hard, challenging workouts lead to immune system suppression - not a good thing for people who are already ill! Excellent workouts that are strengthening, but not too hard on the cardiovascular system, include weight training, walking, yoga and tai chi. /T_he extra bene/f_it of yoga, tai chi, chi kung and other 'so/f_t' meditative martial arts is that these forms of exercise don't just aect and improve the physical body. /T_hey are doubly bene/f_icial because they also liberate and activate the chakras (energy centers) and the overall energy /f_low (chi or ki) within the body. By doing them you are activating and stimulating your body's chi (lifeforce energy), which your body uses to heal itself. You don't have to join a class or turn this into an expensive endeavor, as there are many videotapes available for all levels of yoga and tai chi. Stay away from power yoga, Bikram's yoga or other strenuous styles. Choose yoga that is /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson The great thing about a yoga video is you can do it in the privacy of your own home - very useful if you're having frequent bowel movements, or if you wish to do it right before bed, to help you have a deep, healing sleep. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT described with words like 'gentle, relaxing, restorative', etc. I especially like using videos because then I can work totally at my own pace, in the comfort of my home. If it's not automatically included in your exercise regimen, you should also do some sort of stretching routine every day (or as o/f_ten as you can). If our musco-skeletal frame is cramped and tight, how can we expect our insides to be relaxed and easy? You don't even need to start a formalized program of calisthenics or a particular stretching routine. Just clear yourself some space on the /f_loor and simply let your body move, twist, bend and reach in whatever ways and whatever direction feels good to you. As I've said before, your body knows exactly what it needs at all times, so just trust it and allow yourself to go with it. Remember to take deep breaths throughout and relax. Yoga Videos I'm hoping to do some yoga videos with my yoga instructor, Sandra Sammartino, in the near future, speci/f_ically for people with Crohn's, colitis, diverticulitis and irritable bowel syndrome. And who knows, by the time you're reading this program, maybe they'll already be available! Relaxing the abdomen, spine (and related areas) via yoga, massage, or craniosacral therapy can completely change your digestion, bowel movements, and quality of sleep. /T_he night of my yoga class, I sleep /seven.oldstyle - /eight.oldstyle hours in a row completely uninterrupted - I don't get up to pee or poo for the whole night (usually I wake once). For those of you having /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle bowel movements a day, imagine how that would feel and how healing and restorative for your body it would be! At the time of writing, my yoga instructor Sandra Sammartino is /six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle years old and she's been teaching for over /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle years. Her yoga is so wonderful because she has an immense knowledge of the interrelatedness and intricacies of the human body and in each session we work with the energy body (prana, lifeforce energy) as much as the physical body. /T_his really mobilizes your body's self-healing ability and produces profound nurturing and relaxation. In the videos with Sandra, we're going to focus speci/f_ically on freeing-up and relaxing both the small and large intestine and also /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle MIND/BODY THERAPIES CHAPTER 6 addressing all the varied parts of the body that refer or tie in to the gut. /T_he great thing about having it on video is you'll be able to do it in the privacy of your own home - very useful if you're having frequent bowel movements, or if you wish to do it right before bed to help you have a deep, healing sleep. To see if the yoga videos are available, go to my website: www.ListenToYourGut.com Exercising With Anemia If all you can manage is to go or for those of you with Osteoporosis who need to strengthen your bones, outside, walk down the block and see the section on Malnutrition in Chapter Two. Remember, just because For an outline of an exercise regimen to help you either gain or lose weight, back - great! Do it. your hemoglobin levels are low, it doesn't mean you have to give up exercise. Doctors may try to panic you with tales of an impending heart attack if you exert yourself with a hemoglobin level of /seven.oldstyle (or /seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle depending which measurement they're using) or lower. Now if you're a /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle year old couch potato, /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle lbs. overweight, who's never done a day of exercise in your life - the doctor is probably right (but there's still no excuse for you not to get out for a walk every day). However, as with all things to do with the mind/ body, everything is relative. I've enjoyed good cardiovascular and muscular /f_itness my whole life, so I was able to do /three.oldstyle-hour kickboxing classes with a hemoglobin level of /seven.oldstyle./two.oldstyle (or /seven.oldstyle/two.oldstyle). At a hemoglobin level of /six.oldstyle./two.oldstyle I could no longer do the high-energy cardio workouts but I could go for /two.oldstyle hour walks or do an hour of yoga. Again, listen to your body, it will tell you what it can and can't do. Check your pulse frequently or place your hand over your heart to feel how hard it's working. If your pulse is too high or your heart feels like it's pounding like a jackhammer, then you're doing too much, too fast. It's better to go slowly and gently than to trigger a backlash reaction in your body because you've pushed it too far. Remember that nurturing and relaxation are the primary goals of exercise whilst your IBS or IBD is active. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to heal, so use exercise to nurture and support your healing process, not exhaust it. /three.oldstyle/five.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson I have had clients who were absolutely stuck in a symptom pattern, or escalating condition, and they refused to address their emotional issues. In these cases, they are either eventually forced by their declining health to /f_inally seek emotional healing, or they abandon holistic healing altogether. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Overcoming Reluctance We've covered a lot of important mind/body healing tools in this chapter, and in the very next chapter I'll get into speci/f_ic mental exercises or techniques that you can use to mobilize your lifeforce healing energy as well. Remember that to achieve healing in your physical body, you must also heal/resolve your emotional issues and stressors. /T_his may be a hard road for many of you to take, and some people have a lot of resistance to seeking outside help for their emotional problems - or even admitting they have any emotional problems! I understand your reluctance, mistrust, stubbornness, etc. But you must believe me: No one achieves deep-level, long-lasting healing without healing their emotional body. Even the medical profession has come to realize this and has established two /f_ields of specialty to deal with this: Psychoneuroimmunology and Neurogastroenterology. So no matter how dicult it is for you, and how alien it feels to you, just push yourself through it and book yourself a session with whichever therapy you feel drawn towards. My consultation clients who see the best results are the ones who are simultaneously having EFT or craniosacral sessions. I have also had clients who were absolutely stuck in a symptom pattern, or escalating condition and refused to address their emotional issues. In these cases, they are either eventually forced by their declining health to /f_inally seek emotional healing, or they abandon holistic healing altogether.

Turn to the Healing Journey Workbook now, and complete the section for this chapter - Chapter Six. /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle 7 Use Your Mind To Help Your Body \"/M.swashy colleague, /D.swashr. /R.swasha/c_hel /N.swashaomi /R.swashemen, has said that illness could be considered a /W.swasheern form of meditation. /I.swashn the /W.swashe, where the meditative tradition is not rong and people are not in the habit of opping periodically to become quiet and reevaluate their lives, an illness - and sometimes only a serious illness su/c_h as a heart atta/c_k or cancer - ops a person so he can ep ba/c_k and have an opportunity to take o/c_k of what is important to him.\" Dr. Martin Rossman, MD Jini Patel Thompson Scientists have now discovered that thoughts and emotions produce actual chemical reactions or changes in the physical body: You can use your thoughts to create your physical reality. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Much has been written about the interplay of the mind and body. Modern science has now discovered that thoughts and emotions produce actual chemical reactions or changes in the physical body (thoughts and feelings create physical states). Dr. Candace Pert has proven that neuropeptides are the result of thoughts and emotions being translated into physical matter./one.superior If you'd like more information about this, Bill Moyers' book, Healing and the Mind , has a whole section of him interviewing medical and scienti/f_ic professionals at the forefront of this new /f_ield of knowledge called psychoneuroimmunology./two.superior If you want a simpler term, you can just call it mind/body medicine. /T_he fact is that you can use your thoughts to create or determine your reality. AFFIRMATIONS Positive armations are a powerful tool you can use to help yourself achieve everything from athletic excellence, to /f_inancial success, to excellent health. I suspect they're underrated because people feel stupid doing them initially. An armation is basically a positive statement that you repeat aloud in the present tense whilst looking at yourself in the mirror. You can make up your own armation, or any book by Louise L. Hay contains many good ones./three.superior Combining armations with EFT increases their eectiveness exponentially and will greatly reduce the time necessary to achieve the desired result. /T_he key to using armations is to keep them positive and in the present tense as though the situation/state already exists, \"I am strong, I am healthy and I love my body\", or, \"My colon is healthy and absorbs all the nutrition I give it\". Arming is a way of programming your subconscious to do your bidding, or look a/f_ter something for you. /T_he message is delivered in three ways; you say the words, you hear the words, and you see yourself speaking. Simultaneously using EFT to integrate the armation with your physical and energy body is even more powerful. Saying something in the future tense, for example \"I will be healthy\", is not very eective. Your mind won't /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 do anything now, in the present, as it will be locked into waiting for the future as you directed it. Also, an armation needs to be a positive, pro - active statement to work best. Negative statements, e.g., \"I do not snore\" can work, but not nearly as well as the positive statement, \"I sleep on my side. I sleep peacefully and quietly\". My husband used that statement every night before going to sleep to ensure he didn't wake me up with his snoring! /T_he armation worked about /nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the time and a/f_ter a few months he didn't even need to say it anymore. Combining armations with /T_hink about some mental roots, beliefs, or thought patterns that you EFT increases their eectiveness currently have that do not serve you. For example, you may have a root-level exponentially and will greatly belief (absorbed from a parent or your culture) that says something like, \"Life is a series of sorrows interrupted by /f_leeting joy\". Spend some time reduce the time necessary to thinking about this thought pattern; how does this thought serve you, is it achieve the desired result. life-arming, does believing this lead you to a fuller and richer experience of life? If you realize that a thought pattern is life-minimizing, or life- destroying, then you may want to change that thought pattern. In order to start re-programming this mental pattern, you have to get to the root of what's underneath this thought. I /f_ind that the common element under any thought or pattern that's negative, or defeatist, or less-than, is simply a form of fear. So, addressing the fear that's at the root of the above thought pattern could involve some of the following armations: \"It is safe for me to live.\" \"Life is wonderful. I love life.\" \"Today is an expression of joy.\" \"Life is so good to me. I'm glad to be alive.\" \"I experience joy in all areas of my life.\" Developing armations for yourself is going to involve a fair amount of time spent looking at your current thoughts, patterns and beliefs. Try to think of maxims you always heard your parents repeating, you'll likely discover these have in/f_iltrated your mind-set in a most insidious way In order to heal yourself physically, you must also address your mental state. You need to let go of thought patterns that do not serve or help you and replace them with ones that do. You need to shi/f_t your mental state from one that is not arming and serving you, to one that does. Yes, this /f_irst requires awareness, and then it requires discipline. Try to say your armations at least twice a day in front of the mirror, whilst tapping on the /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: \u0003series of EFT acupuncture points and then say them out loud to yourself throughout the day whenever you remember and just tap on the 'karate chop' point.

It's the same thing you used to do so o/f_ten as a child, except now you concentrate on imagining a speci/f_ied thing, sequence, or result. You don't let your mind wander in and out of the scene, but hold it there as you \"see\" or imagine your chosen image or sequence occurring. If you /f_ind it dicult to concentrate and your attention wanders at /f_irst, don't worry about it. /T_he more you practice visualizing, the better you'll become at it. Visualizing also works on the premise that thought determines reality. Ask any top athlete, or member of the Chicago Bulls basketball team and they'll tell you how eective visualizing is. Any physicist will tell you that anything and everything in our universe is composed of energy. If you break anything down to its smallest unit, you'll have pure energy. Likewise, thought is also energy and therefore dynamic and capable of aecting change and altering physical reality. Your thoughts determine your beliefs, your beliefs determine your actions, and your actions determine and create your physical reality. Regular, concentrated visualization of a desired occurrence or process can produce very real, physical results. /T_here are many dierent ways to visualize healing. Some people like to visualize soothing colors (e.g., blue to calm in/f_lammation), others visualize inanimate things such as a web of rubber bands stretching with each breath in and then sagging, losing their tightness as the breath goes out. /T_here are many, many books available on visualization techniques for both direct healing and also relaxation, strengthening and energizing. I'm just going to describe three of my favorite techniques with you here, one for direct healing, one for overall healing, and the other for balancing and calming. I /f_ind it's best to visualize at night in bed, so you can dri/f_t o to sleep with /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 the images and feelings still /f_loating around you. Of course, you can do these visualizations ten times a day if you like, or do a main one at night or in the morning and return to it brie/f_ly to arm your image(s) throughout the day. You may want to take some of these visualizations and record them, so that you can play them in your personal listenng device as you dri/f_t o to sleep at night. Direct Healing Any physicist will tell you that everything from healing bleeding intestinal wounds and ulcers to curing an anything and everything in our ear infection overnight. Visualize the site you want to heal (your intestinal /T_his technique has been extremely eective for me and I have used it on universe is composed of energy. tract, ear canal, etc.) imagine how it looks in there and what needs to be If you break anything down to its done to clean it up and soothe the site and heal it. /T_hen imagine a team of smallest unit or particle, you'll have tiny little workers coming in and doing whatever needs to be done to treat, pure energy. Likewise, thought is soothe and heal the area. also energy and therefore dynamic Here's an example of what I visualize to heal an ulcerated area of my and capable of aecting change intestine: First I look at the intestinal wall where it's ulcerated and I notice and altering physical reality. that it's swollen, puy, and there's blood and pus oozing out. My little workers in their bright, clean overalls arrive and immediately go to work. /T_hey have little wings on their backs so they can /f_ly up the sides of the wall and treat wounded areas without having to rest their body weight on the painful surface. First they cleanse the area with so/f_t pressure hoses containing warm water which washes away a lot of the blood and pus. Next, they have super so/f_t gloves which they rub in a circular motion to slough o all the dead, pus-/f_illed tissue. /T_hey rinse again with the warm water. Now they have pots of herbal salve in their hands and they gently massage this in over the wounded area. I can see/feel how much better my intestine feels already. I stop visualizing at this point and leave the area alone for a day or so as I know the salve takes a while to sink in and go to work. /T_he next day/night I visualize the workers going back in and dousing again with warm water and gently cleaning with a so/f_t, moisturizing soap. /T_he wall looks much better. It has stopped bleeding and the wounds are in /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Your thoughts determine your beliefs, your beliefs determine your actions, and your actions determine and create your physical reality. the /f_irst stages of healing. I decide it's time to bring down the in/f_lammation. My workers spread on a cooling, soothing herbal cream and set up a temporary wall at either end of the wounded area to seal it o from the rest of the intestine. /T_hen they set up a cooling unit which acts like a fridge to bring down the temperature of the area until the wound is nice and chilled with no more redness. /T_he workers then dismantle the walls and take them and the cooling unit away. I dri/f_t o into sleep knowing the coolness and soothing herbal cream are helping my intestine tremendously. I keep going with the visualization, imagining whatever it is my intestine needs next until it is quite healed. /T_hen I usually do a /f_inal cleansing followed by a coat of herbal salve for moisture and suppleness. Take some time and don't be afraid to experiment to /f_ind out what kind of visualization works best for you. Listen to your body and adjust the length and frequency of your visualization accordingly. For example, in the visualization outlined above, I may want to visualize the /f_irst part (with the herbal salve) for four or /f_ive days consecutively until I feel the area is healed enough to move onto to the next stages of treatment. As with anything, you'll become more /f_luent and /f_ind it easier to concentrate the more you apply yourself to visualizing. Also, dierent images work for dierent people. Go with whatever pops into your head. A six-year-old boy I know used to visualize dragons and a battle scene where whatever he felt was making him ill was killed o. A visualization like that would not work for me, but for him it was quite eective. Again, use whatever works best for you. Overall Healing You can do this visualization either lying down, or sitting up cross-legged, or propped against some pillows. Close your eyes and just breathe deeply for a few minutes. Concentrate on nothing other than your breath. Inhale and bring the breath deep down into your diaphragm, watch/feel your abdomen protrude as it /f_ills with breath. /T_hen slowly, evenly exhale all of the breath, push out even the last wisps of breath, then slowly, deeply, inhale again. /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/six.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 Stay like this for a few minutes, just inhaling and exhaling as deeply as you can. Feel your body sink and settle a little deeper with each breath in and out. A/f_ter a few minutes of breathing deeply and evenly, imagine the top of your head opening up like a /f_lower whose petals bloom and unfurl in the sunlight. Above you is a great ocean of brilliant white light. /T_his beautiful white light is God, or the Universal Energy, or the Divine Healing Light, or whatever name you feel comfortable with.

Stay here awhile and breathe, feel the so/f_t white \u0003 light cushioning and soothing every part of your precious tummy. Now see the beautiful white light washing down all around you, \u0003 surrounding you with a sea of shimmering whiteness. Feel yourself melting \u0003 into that pool of white light.

Close your eyes and imagine a big, round, pure golden ball of light in your abdomen (this is your Chi, your seat of energy and power located about two /f_inger-widths below your belly button). Take deep breaths in and out of your diaphragm. With each breath in, see your golden ball expand and glow brighter, with each breath out it reduces a bit but the light is more intense and shimmering. Relax here and breathe for a while, holding the visualization with each breath. Now imagine a huge brilliant cloud of this beautiful golden light above your head. /T_his is your universal energy and it is always available to feed, nourish and connect with you. /T_here is a stream /f_lowing from this huge /f_ield of golden light and it /f_lows in through the top of your head, imagine the top of your head opening to receive this beautiful light. /T_he light /f_lows down and pools pulsating in your throat, from there it /f_lows to your heart and envelops it with so/f_t, warm, soothing light.

You are part of the heavens and part of the nourishing, so/f_t earth. See the beautiful, warm golden light pulsating and radiating healing and peace as it streams from the universe around you, through your body and into the good, so/f_t earth. Accept this light and healing as a gi/f_t from God or the universe. Rest here and breathe peacefully. CONTROLLING YOUR BOWELS Many people with IBD have, at one time or another, dropped their stool in their pants rather than in the toilet. I've heard numerous stories of unfortunate accidents from people stuck in trac, or a long waiting line /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 at a public bathroom, or some who have simply been unable to /f_ind a toilet in time. Yes, it's tremendously embarrassing and yes, you do eventually get over it. But the really good news is that you can train your bowels so that it never happens again! /T_hink of your bowels as a small puppy that you need to teach what is allowed and what isn't. Start the training at home where you have the time and privacy necessary to start pushing your boundaries and if you have an accident, it's not such a big deal. I have received many emails Begin by learning how to close your anal opening. Closing your anus from readers thanking me requires the same muscles and motion used to do Kegel exercises. If you're profusely for this technique, saying unfamiliar with Kegel exercises, then simply practice closing your anus this technique alone has changed periodically the next time you have a bowel movement. While the stool is their life. So congratulations to passing through your anus, clench it shut by pulling up the lower pelvic all of you, for being innovative, wall and rectum. If you can't conceive of how to do this, then simply squeeze your bum muscles together, this should immediately stop the /f_low adventurous people who are of your stool. /T_hen relax and let the stool pass through again. As you do this willing to think outside the box! several times, you'll begin to feel the actual muscles responsible for closing your anal opening and you won't have to clench your bum muscles together in order to close it. Practice this exercise not only during a bowel movement, but also throughout the day. Try to work up to being able to do /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle closings (and releases) in a row. Also, start trying to hold your anus shut for up to /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle seconds non-stop. Like any muscle, you need to strengthen, condition and develop your control over its movements. Once you've developed your anal sphincter and the other muscles required to close your anal opening and hold it shut, you can begin the next phase of training. Do the following procedure at home initially. /one.oldstyle. Wait until you need to have a bowel movement quite urgently. \u0003 Then stand very still, place your hand on your colon and clench your \u0003 anus closed. Now here's where training the puppy comes in: You now \u0003 need to talk to your bowel very sternly (but lovingly) and tell it out loud \u0003 that, \"I'm sorry, but we (meaning you and your colon) cannot have a \u0003 bowel movement at this time.\" Then you need to tell your bowel when \u0003 /three.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT it will be able to pass stool. Since you'll start by doing this training at home, begin with requiring your bowel to wait two minutes. Say to your colon, \"In two minutes, and not a second sooner, we may have a bowel movement.\" Now try to stand quietly and breathe evenly whilst timing yourself. Sitting or jiggling around is not usually a good idea. When the two minutes is up, walk quietly to the bathroom and say to your colon, \"Ok, now we can have our bowel movement.\" If you can't make it and you have an accident, don't worry about it, just think how Notes: long it takes to toilet train children. Keep practicing this procedure, gradually expanding the waiting time until you've got it up to five minutes. /two.oldstyle. When you can hold your stool in for up to five minutes, you're ready to begin training your bowel to suck the stool back up the rectal canal. As many of you probably already know, merely keeping your anus closed will only hold back a bowel movement for a fairly minimal amount of time. However, by getting your bowel to move the stool back up the rectal canal, thereby completely relieving the pressure and urgency to void, you can go from thirty minutes to two hours without passing stool. Again, go through this procedure at home a few times first. /three.oldstyle. Wait until you need to have a bowel movement urgently, then go through the steps in point /one.oldstyle, above. But, do not tell your colon that you can have a bowel movement in a few minutes. After you've held your anus shut for a few minutes, begin talking to your colon. Again, you address your body as \"we\" because you're acknowledging that your mind/body/spirit is one entity and you're honoring the unity of yourself as whole; complete and working together. You are also recognizing that there is intelligence and awareness in every cell in your body, it is not just the brain controlling the body. It's using the awareness and intelligence of every part of the body to work together as a whole to accomplish what's best for the whole body. /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 /four.oldstyle. Here's an example of what I say, \"Ok darling, now we need to suck this \u0003 stool back up, because we're in the middle of dinner and we are /n.sc/o.sc/t.sc going to have a bowel movement until we've finished eating, probably in \u0003 about /four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle minutes.\" \u0003 /five.oldstyle. Then, with your hand still on your colon, begin clenching and releasing \u0003 your anal sphincter whilst simultaneously pulling in with your \u0003 abdominal muscles each time you clench your anus. This results in \u0003 a kind of rolling or wave motion in your abdomen. At the same time, \u0003Think of your bowels as a small visualize, or imagine the motion results in your rectal canal acting like puppy that you need to teach what a pump that moves the stool back up the rectal canal. Also visualize is allowed and what isn't. Start the your descending colon helping out by creating a vacuum effect that further helps to suck the stool up the rectal canal. As you're doing training at home where you have this, you'll begin to notice that your need or urgency to pass stool is the time and privacy necessary lessening. Then rest for a bit, still holding your anus closed. If the to start pushing your boundaries. pressure is not substantially relieved, begin the procedure of clenching and if you have an accident, it's not and releasing your anus whilst contracting your abdominals again. You such a big deal .may want to alternate this procedure with rest periods several times. /six.oldstyle. The complete procedure, along with visualizing (imagining) should \u0003 take about two minutes or less. Take a rest whenever you need it. \u0003 Again, it may take a while for you to be able to perform the muscular \u0003 movements continuously, whilst visualizing, so be patient with \u0003 yourself. When you feel the pressure or urgency to void has decreased \u0003 significantly (i.e. you're no longer in danger of soiling yourself) go back \u0003 to whatever you were doing, or focus your attention on something else. \u0003 Thank your bowels for their good work, and then leave them to look \u0003 after themselves. Shift your attention and continue with what you \u0003 were doing. If you're on an anti-diarrhea drug or some other drug that directly aects the colon and its peristalsis, then I don't know how well this technique will work for you. /T_his degree of cooperation with your bowels involves mind/ body harmony and teaching your body to work with you. If you have a drug /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT The primary factor that makes pain hurt, is fear. interfering with the process, you may or may not be successful with this technique. I de/f_initely encourage you to put in the time necessary to master this technique as the freedom it will give you is glorious. /T_here have been many times where I've been out shopping or involved in some activity and my colon has started spasming and I've felt like I was going to explode. I've then implemented this technique and been able to go two hours or more without having a bowel movement. I also don't like having a bowel movement in public washrooms, so I simply tell my bowel that we have to wait until we get home to our toilet where we can have a much nicer, more relaxing bowel movement. /T_hen I continue with whatever I'm doing - having lunch, running errands, whatever - and I don't need to have a bowel movement again until I get home. At which point I feel like my puppy-colon must be one of Pavlov's dogs, because as soon as I turn the key in my front door I can feel the stool moving rapidly down my rectal canal in anticipation of the promised bowel movement! When I /f_irst published Listen To Your Gut back in /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle, I thought that hardly anyone would try this technique. And indeed, I expected people to think I was quite loopy for even putting it into print. Much to my surprise, I have since received lots of emails from readers thanking me profusely for this technique, saying this technique alone has changed their life. So congratulations to all of you for being innovative, adventurous people who are willing to think outside the box! TRANSFORMING PAIN Most of the painful episodes associated with IBD and IBS are caused by the intestines cramping or spasming severely. Other causes include blockages in the colon (see Colonic Massage section in Chapter Six) or rupturing of the bowel. O/f_ten when your gut is spasming, you get hot, sweaty and shaky and it's so painful that you start to think your bowel or appendix is rupturing, but this is actually quite rare. If you are having a rupture or perforation take place, you will experience the following symptoms: Fever, very rigid /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/two.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 abdomen, severe shaking or shivering, constipation - not passing any gas or stool. Otherwise, you're probably just having a spasm/cramp attack. If you suspect you're having a rupture or perforation take place, then you can still use the techniques listed below, but do them on the way to the hospital. If you tend to experience these cramping/spasming attacks on a regular basis, then you may want to develop some tools to enable you to deal with and eliminate the pain - other than being rushed to the emergency room and pumped full of drugs. I strongly suggest you take up either meditation, Instead of trying not to think yoga, or tai chi as any of them will give you a strong base for breath control. of the pain, or rallying your body Being able to control your breath will help you to control both the feelings and mind to /f_ight against it, you of 'pain' and your oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange, so you don't have to \u0003 worry about passing out. You may also want to try drinking two glasses of have to submit to it. spring or /f_iltered water (fairly quickly, one a/f_ter the other) as soon as you \u0003 feel the pain begin - sometimes this alone can avoid or lessen an attack. /T_he best technique for pain-management does not involve ignoring or \u0003 /f_ighting the pain, but rather, moving into it. Instead of trying not to think \u0003 of the pain, or rallying your body and mind to /f_ight against it, you have to \u0003 submit to it. Water is one of the strongest forces on our planet. Its supreme \u0003 strength resides in the fact that it is completely malleable and therefore \u0003 unstoppable. When you need an image or way to think of yourself during \u0003 these attacks, think of yourself (your whole body) as water, unresisting, \u0003 /f_lowing. If you were to choose a traditional image of strength, like a rock \u0003 for example, this would not be nearly as eective. Anything solid and rigid \u0003 like a rock presents an ideal surface of resistance for other forces to slam \u0003 up against, drill through, chip and crack, or, like water, to patiently and \u0003 enduringly wear a path through. Whenever you resist something, you give \u0003 it something to /f_ight against, you provide it with the motivation to gather its \u0003 strength and intensify against you. /T_he next time you have a spasm/cramp attack, either try to keep the image \u0003 of water in your head, or repeat to yourself, \"I am water.\" /T_hen imagine the \u0003 whole room is /f_illed with pain, your pain, the pain you're experiencing, and \u0003 let the pain completely overwhelm you. Let it take over and surround every \u0003 /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Whenever you resist something, you give it something to /f_ight against, you provide it with the motivation to gather its strength and intensify against you. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT part of you. Say to the pain, \"Here I am. I am water. Come to me. I accept you.\" /T_his is where you need to have some practice and control over your breathing, so that you can imagine such a scenario whilst maintaining deep, even breaths. As you allow the pain to pervade every facet of your senses and as you accept it and welcome it, you will gradually pass through the panic and fear that you're going to die from the pain. It helps to remember that if the pain really does become more than you can bear, you will simply pass out, and then you won't feel any more pain. /T_he body has this fail-safe mechanism in place for pain that truly is unbearable, so you don't need to be afraid you'll die from the pain, or that you'll be driven out of your mind by unbearable pain. As long as you're conscious, you can bear it. /T_his really helped me during /four.oldstyle/four.oldstyle hours of labor giving birth to my /f_irst child. As you allow the pain to /f_lood you, take you over, and pervade every part of your being, you will also gradually begin to observe it, you will also begin to realize that 'pain' doesn't have to hurt. As you let the pain take over and saturate every pore of your body, you will begin to recognize 'pain' as just another sensory input - a signal sent from your body to your brain to convey a message, no more, no less. You will then be able to sit there with the \"pain\" washing over you in waves, but yet it won't hurt. /T_he primary factor that makes pain hurt, is fear. /T_he hurt we feel is not generated from the pain feeling itself, but from the fear that is its conductor. In and of itself, the nerve impulse that we have labeled 'pain' doesn't have to hurt. However, when it's delivered via a conductor such as fear, it feels very shocking and hurtful. Autopsies have shown that when people commit suicide by jumping o a high-rise building, or when they die in a plane crash, many of them are not killed by the impact of their body hitting the ground - they are already dead at that point. /T_heir intense fear and horror of the coming pain or impact has already killed them by causing them to have a heart attack. If during your next cramping episode, you walk into the center of your pain, and you face your fear of the pain and you say, \"Here I am. I am water. I /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/four.oldstyle USE YOUR MIND TO HELP YOUR BODY CHAPTER 7 accept you. Come to me, here I am,\" you will discover, gradually, that your pain doesn't hurt anymore. You will master your fear of experiencing pain and you'll realize that being free from fear is the most liberating, healing state to be in. If you have a spouse, partner, friend or child around while you're having the cramping, they can also assist you in the healing process. While you're going through the process outlined above, your helper can be giving you some direct healing. Have your helper place his/her hand about an inch or If you take the time and two above your bare abdomen (wherever you're experiencing the cramping) eort to learn this technique, it is and have them visualize white and ice blue light /f_lowing from the center of something you'll be able to use in their palm into your gut.

But remember, instruct your helper on what to do, or give them a copy of this section ahead of time, so that during the cramping episode your mind is able to focus completely on facing and accepting your pain. You don't even need to be aware of what your helper is doing for the healing to take eect, you merely have to accept it. You can use this technique on your own for transforming all kinds of pain. I used it frequently during my martial arts career as I tore the cartilage in both my knees, had my le/f_t shoulder dislocated twice, severely damaged my neck, and suered numerous sprains, wounds and hematomas. In spite of these injuries, by transforming the pain I was able to keep going and /f_inish the /f_ight or training regimen - don't ask me now why I wanted to!

She said, \"Of course I remember you, you're the one whose labor went on and on forever and you refused any painkillers. None of us could believe it!\" So you see, if you take the time and eort to learn this technique, it is something you'll be able to use in various situations throughout your life. It is very liberating to know that no matter what happens, you have the strength and freedom in your own body to cope with it, and usually transcend it. /T_his knowledge and ability is very healing and the strength you manifest from this technique will pervade all areas of your life - both physical and emotional.

LISTEN TO YOUR GUT I'm fortunate in that I have received (and continue to receive) a lot of feedback over the years from my readers. A/f_ter a while, I noticed that people kept asking me for my opinion on the same products, diets and treatments - over and over again. /T_herefore, this chapter answers those very same questions and gives you my personal opinion on certain speci/f_ic products, diets, etc. Please keep in mind that all the information following is my own, personal opinion only. I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything, and I'm not passing ocial judgment on anything. I'm simply giving my personal opinion because so many readers have asked me to.

Ayurvedic medicine has some very interesting, valid theories on the dierent types of bodies/personalities (doshas), how the seasonal changes aect the body, and how to live in balance and harmony. My only caution would be regarding taking the remedies themselves, particularly if you have a squeamish or sensitive palate. Be sure to follow the guidelines in Chapter Two for introducing new supplements. /three.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE I really like the theoretical paradigm underlying Chinese medicine; the balance of yin and yang, the relating of the body to the essential elements, the concept of having too much or too little heat, cold, water, etc. Like Ayurvedic medicine, there is a tremendous body of knowledge here, both interesting and applicable, that will only contribute to your understanding of your body. Regarding the actual treatment and application of remedies, personally, I found it much too aggressive for my body. Chinese herbal medicine is based upon a process of cleansing, toning and strengthening. I could handle the toning and strengthening part of the therapy, but the cleansing part really knocked my system out of whack. I lost seven pounds, my digestive system was aggravated and it took me a good six months to regain my balance and strength. Unless your body responds well to aggressive treatment, it may not be such a good idea to see a TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) doctor. Also, some of the herbal mixtures are absolutely foul, and the smell alone can be enough to trigger your gag re/f_lex. I don't know how I managed to consume mine for a whole month. /T_he /f_irst two weeks I drank the teas, I had to go outside to drink them so the wind could blow away the smell and I could gulp in fresh air between sips. Chinese medicine is also not usually a good idea for people with IBD or IBS because it tends to use multiple-herb remedies. /T_herefore, your chances of having an adverse reaction are much higher. And like Ayurvedic medicine, some of the remedies can irritate the gut and exacerbate symptoms. If you want to pursue Chinese medicine, then use single herbs only and introduce them one at a time, leaving /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle weeks in between each one to check for adverse reactions. I like to experiment with individual Chinese herbs (like the Astragalus listed earlier in this chapter) that I can safely trial-test and monitor individually.

So, as per usual, if you feel this is an avenue you should explore, by all means go ahead. But stay really tuned to your body and don't be afraid to stop treatment if you don't feel it's helping you. Remember to follow the guidelines in Chapter Two for introducing new supplements. THE BLOOD TYPE DIET Notes: /T_his is the diet presented in Dr. Peter J. D'Adamo's book, Eat Right For Your Type . /T_he basic premise of the diet is that your blood type indicates your ancestry in terms of where your originating group of humans lived and what they ate. /T_herefore, your blood type will indicate which type of diet is most compatible with your body and digestive system. An interesting feature of the Blood Type Diet is that nearly everyone is advised to eliminate wheat, dairy and tomatoes. Since wheat and dairy products are the primary culprits in most people's food allergies and intolerances, it's not surprising that people who follow the diet experience substantial relief. Also, as I've said previously, North Americans in general consume far too many tomato-based, acidic foods - one of the main causes of heartburn and aggravation of the intestinal lining. If most people were to cut down or stop eating tomatoes, they would experience signi/f_icant relief. Whether and how much all the additional guidelines in the diet contribute to digestive health, I can't say. /T_hey may contribute substantially, or their eects may be minimal, especially compared to the bene/f_its reaped by eliminating wheat, dairy and tomatoes. I personally know three people with IBS and one with Crohn's who have tried this diet plan and experienced a lessening of symptoms as a result. I've gone through the recommendations for my blood type (AB) and for the most part found them consistent with what I've discovered already. However, during a /f_lare-up or acute phase of IBD or IBS, I don't think the Blood Type Diet guidelines are strict enough to address or alleviate the symptoms particular to IBD/IBS; diarrhea, bleeding, malabsorption, /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 bloating, etc. I also have questions as to the scienti/f_ic validity of the premise upon which the diet plans are based. My personal opinion on this diet is that if you feel drawn to implement it, then please do so, but implement it in conjunction with the appropriate Healing Diet (see Chapter /T_hree). For example, if the Blood Type Diet says you can eat lemons, but the Healing Diet says 'no lemons', then don't eat lemons. If the Healing Diet says you can eat avocados, but the Blood Type Diet says 'avoid avocados', then don't eat avocados. An interesting feature of the Keep in mind that whatever diet you choose to implement, the most Blood Type Diet is that nearly eective way to eat right for your body is still determined by individual trial-everyone is advised to eliminate testing of foods (see Chapter /T_hree). When all is said and done, your own wheat, dairy and tomatoes. Since body knows exactly what it wants and needs for optimal functioning and wheat and dairy products are the healing. Always listen to your body above and beyond any diet guidelines primary culprits in most people's (see Dialoguing With Your Body , Chapter Six) and your body will always give you the best diet to follow. food allergies and intolerances, it's not surprising that people I've found for myself that my body wants and tolerates dierent foods at who follow the diet experience dierent times. For example, occasionally, my body wants milk and I will drink up to four glasses of milk per day and feel great. At other times, my substantial relief. body will go through periods where it doesn't want any dairy products for a month or two at a time. If I drink milk during one of these periods, I will instantly experience bloating and sometimes diarrhea along with excessive mucus production. Your body is not a machine, there isn't some pre-set formula that will ensure optimum performance for the rest of your existence. Your body is a /f_luid, dynamic, responsive, variable wonder and the best way to feed yourself is simply to stay open and tuned to what your body wants and needs each day. SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE DIET /T_his is the diet outlined and advocated in Elaine Gottschall's book, Breaking the Vicious Cycle (originally titled, Food And the Gut Reaction ). It took me seven years a/f_ter /f_irst reading this book to gather up the self-discipline /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson I would love to see Elaine Gottschall add probiotic supplementation to her diet program as I think it would raise the success rates even higher. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT necessary to give the diet a try. When I /f_inally did embark on it, I adhered to each and every guideline meticulously for one year. I saw real improvement in the /f_irst /threeoldstyle months, but it was downhill from there, and when I assessed myself at the end of the year, my symptoms were actually much worse than when I had started. /T_he reason I stuck with the diet for so long was because I wanted to give it a good, fair trial. Now, I know there have been many people helped and even completely healed from using this diet. Although I think most of those people have to stay on the diet inde/f_initely and cannot eat normally, or else they will experience a resurgence of symptoms. To be honest, I think the reason it didn't work for me was largely a matter of personality. /T_he diet has tremendously rigid guidelines and you have to prepare all of your food from scratch. You have to bake all your own bread out of special nut /f_lours and bake all your snacks or desserts yourself. Eating out becomes an ordeal in itself and almost not worth enduring. Now here's the kind of person I am: I don't like being forced to cook, I love eating out, I hate being controlled and regimented in anything in my life, I typically derive extreme enjoyment from my food and am considered something of a gourmet. Can you see where the clash between this diet and my personality would come into play? I went on the Speci/f_ic Carbohydrate Diet and I was in the kitchen cooking for eight to nine hours every single weekend, preparing my food for the week and baking my bread and snacks. I hated it! As a result I became an irritated, angry person and I felt unbearably controlled and non- spontaneous from the time I got up till the time I went to bed. /T_his is where the interplay of the body/mind schemata kicks in. I think that whatever good the diet did my physical body was counteracted by my emotional/mental state. Our mind and emotions can aect and produce results or consequences in our body just as much as what we do physically to our body. /T_his is why I say numerous times throughout this book to always follow your intuition and do what you feel is right for you, make only the changes you feel you need to make, and proceed at whatever pace of change is comfortable and positive for you. /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/two.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 /T_he body/mind interplay was really evidenced for me when I had a blood test to measure antibody response to certain foods (as a method of determining food allergies) over ten years a/f_ter being on the Speci/f_ic Carbohydrate Diet. When the test results came back, I saw that I had tested positive (antibody response) for many of the staple foods I had consumed whilst on the Speci/f_ic Carbohydrate Diet! Now, I'm not actually allergic or intolerant to any of these foods - I know because I've tested all of them using the far more reliable method of food clearance and reintroduction (see Chapter /T_hree). But, I think the antibody response was a sign that my Our mind and emotions can body was still registering the stress and negativity associated with eating aect and produce results or those foods over and over again for a full year and hating every minute consequences in our body, just as of it! So then I had to do some EFT tapping (see Chapter Six) to clear the much as what we do physically to emotion/trauma still retained in my body from following this (for me) very our body. stressful diet. If you feel your gut leading you to follow /T_he Speci/f_ic Carbohydrate Diet, and if you're a structured, love-to-cook kind of person (or you have someone else to do all your meal preparation for you) then I think you'll probably see some good results from it. Personally, I would love to see Elaine Gottschall add probiotic supplementation to her diet program, as I think it would raise the success rates even higher, and a/f_ter a year or so of supplementation, people could probably start introducing 'forbidden' (but otherwise healthy) foods again. DETOXIFICATION PROTOCOLS Most herbal detoxi/f_ication (detox) programs are simply too harsh and damaging for people with Crohn's and colitis. If your diverticulitis is in an acute phase, then likewise abstain from any detox or cleanse protocols. For people with mild to moderate IBS, you may be able to follow a detoxi/f_ication program and bene/f_it from it, but remember to follow it immediately with probiotic supplementation. For people with severe IBS, again, I feel herbal detoxi/f_ication programs are too intense and may damage an already in/f_lamed mucosal lining. /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson It's best to wait until you're fairly healed and at a normal weight before beginning a detoxi/f_ication program, and choose treatments that are gentler and perhaps take longer, to avoid triggering an adverse reaction. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT If you have Crohn's or colitis and you are underweight and/or suering from diarrhea, then you will probably experience negative results (a /f_lare, severe weight loss, bleeding, etc.) from a detoxi/f_ication protocol. Keep in mind that the very nature of detoxi/f_ication involves cleansing, or expelling various substances from your body. And your body has prescribed ways of expelling or detoxifying: Diarrhea or increased bowel movements, vomiting, pushing things out the skin, increased mucus production and expulsion, and urination. So, as you can see, if you're already in a weakened, ill state, then experiencing these things suddenly and abundantly is going to be very stressful. In my opinion, it's best to wait until you're fairly healed and at a normal weight (or overweight) before beginning a detoxi/f_ication program and to choose treatments that are gentler and perhaps take longer to avoid triggering an adverse reaction. I don't even like the idea of juice fasts for people with IBD and IBS, unless you consume primarily non-sweet vegetable juices and no fruit juices. Otherwise, the natural sugar in the juices can cause Candida (yeast) to /f_lourish and may trigger a /f_lare-up of symptoms. I had a phone consultation with a client once whose colitis was triggered by a water and juice fast. On the /f_irst day of the fast he was out driving around on errands and forgot to drink enough water and by day three he experienced a surge of abdominal pain and bleeding. Remember that IBD and IBS are triggered by stress. So if a detoxi/f_ication protocol is going to stress your body, then either make sure you just stay home resting in bed or on the couch the whole time, or don't do it. /T_here are also many protocols outlined in this book that are automatically detoxifying and they include: Drinking /eightoldstyle - /oneoldstyle/zerooldstyle glasses of water per day Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol Bentonite Clay The IBD Remission Diet /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/four.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 High dose probiotic supplementation Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema So, like anything else, follow your gut and if you do go on a detoxi/f_ication program then make sure you're supported during the detox by getting lots of rest, drinking lots of water and taking probiotics. I would also drink \u00bd/spacefrac cup of George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice, three times per day, during the protocol to help prevent damage to the intestine. After you've been through COLON CLEANSING a barium enema followed by a colonoscopy, your colon is about Many sources insist that colon cleansing is integral to bowel health. /T_his as clean as it's going to get! cleansing can take the form of a course of herbs to cleanse and detoxify, a special diet and fasting, or manual /f_lushing of the colon using a saline or herbal solution, or some combination of any of the above. Personally, I don't feel these procedures are necessary for anyone who has already been through the medical exploratory or diagnostic tests. A/f_ter you've been through a barium enema followed by a colonoscopy, your colon is about as clean as it's going to get! Colonoscopies in particular cannot be successfully performed unless the intestinal wall is completely clear of fecal matter, so rest assured that the test preparation for a colonoscopy is an extremely thorough cleanse. I also don't feel it's a good idea to cleanse your colon regularly as it disrupts the bacterial /f_lora in your bowel. A major premise of the healing plan in this book involves allowing the body to heal and balance itself and this includes helping your body to develop a natural, healthy bacterial balance. If you have chronic constipation as a feature of your Irritable Bowel Syndrome, then you may wish to have one or two colonics done initially to clear out any impacted fecal matter that may be compounding your problem. But then you must follow these colonics with Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema to immediately replace the /f_lushed good bacteria and then continue for three months with oral supplementation (see Chapter Two). For most /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Notes: \u0003conditions, I view colon cleansing as a fairly invasive therapy and I don't recommend doing it more than once (and then only if you feel you need to). BACTERIAL SOIL ORGANISMS Bacterial soil organisms (o/f_ten referred to as SO's, HSO's, SBO's, etc.) are currently being marketed as probiotics. However, probiotics have traditionally referred to food-cultured bacteria (e.g. Lactobacillus, Bi/f_idobacterium ), whereas bacterial soil organisms (as the name suggests) are found in the soil. Common species of bacterial soil organisms marketed as probiotics include Bacillus cereus and Bacillus licheniformis . Food- cultured bacteria have a record of safety for human consumption that spans thousands of years (e.g. ke/f_ir, yoghurt, miso, natto, etc.). Bacterial soil organisms have only recently (in the last ten years or so) been consumed directly by humans, and people ingesting them should be made aware that they are participating in an experimental therapy. Popular products currently containing bacterial soil organisms include Royal Flora, Primal Defense, Nature's Biotics, etc. /T_he CEO of one of the main manufacturers of bacterial soil organisms sent me an email, since he'd heard I was advising my readers not to consume bacterial soil organisms. He sent me their company literature supporting the use of soil organisms and suggested I revise my opinion. I then emailed him back and asked him to send me any long-term studies (i.e. /twooldstyle/zerooldstyle years or longer) he had on the safety of human consumption of soil organisms - I never heard back from him (even a/f_ter emailing him again twice). Please remember that it's very easy for supplement companies and pharmaceutical /f_irms to simply pay a doctor to endorse their products, write articles for them, etc. It's a common marketing practice, and unless the 'research' is published in a well-known, long-standing scienti/f_ic publication (one that's been in existence for /f_ive years or more), the information may be little more than propaganda. I've done some fairly thorough research on bacterial soil organisms and I've listed some of the relevant articles in Appendix D for those of you who /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/six.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 want to do your own research. To summarize the available research to date, I don't recommend anyone consume bacterial soil organisms for the following reasons: Soil organisms are spore-formers and they make good competitors for yeast, fungus and other pathogens. This is why many people taking soil organisms may initially experience very favorable results. However, these spores are extremely difficult to kill - surviving commercial sterilants, disinfectants, acceleration forces, heat, pressure, radiation and many Bacterial soil organisms have antibiotics. only recently been consumed Strong antibiotics - like Vancomycin - can suppress certain spores. directly by humans, and people But the spores are so persistent that another round of germination may ingesting them should be aware occur after the drug is stopped. that they are participating in an Soil organisms can also adapt loose genetic material and incorporate experimental therapy. it into their cellular structure - the ramifications of which are as yet unknown. Various soil organisms can produce harmful peptides, affecting hemoglobin in the blood. It's important to keep in mind that virtually all antibiotic drugs were initially developed from soil organisms, and as new antibiotics become more potent, they cause more damage to the host, not just in the immediate gut environment, but systemically as well. In the EU (European Union) the use of soil organisms in animal feed is being stringently controlled and questioned at this time - but there's no monitoring of human use in North America. There are simply too many questions and unknowns to sanction the use of soil organisms for human consumption and one certainly cannot qualify them as \"safe\" at this time. If you've already taken a product containing bacterial soil organisms (and read all supplement labels as they're being added to everything from protein shakes to dog food), you may be worried about consequences. /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson There are simply too many questions and unknowns to sanction the use of soil organisms for human consumption and one certainly cannot qualify them as \"safe\" at this time. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Unfortunately, since this is such an experimental therapy, there's not a lot of research available. I have heard from several readers who developed swelling and tenderness in the lower right quadrant of their abdomen a/f_ter ingesting bacterial soil organisms for two months to a year - whether this is coincidental is very hard to say. I had a phone consultation client who used a popular bacterial soil organism product to completely clear all his symptoms of Crohn's Disease. However, a few months later Oliver developed a rectal infection, abscess and two /f_istulas (he'd never suered from these before) that were so painful he wound up completely bedridden - he couldn't even walk. By the time Oliver contacted me, he'd already had surgery twice for the /f_istulas and been on both Flagyl and Levaquin to try and eliminate the infection. He'd been completely bedridden for two months, on prednisone and massive doses of painkillers when he called me. Following our consultation, he discontinued ingesting the soil organisms, began Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol , went on the IBD Remission Diet for two weeks, and started craniosacral therapy. We had another consultation seven weeks later and Oliver was o prednisone completely (for the /f_irst time in about ten years), had not had a single painkiller in nine days, the abscess and /f_istulas were much improved, and he was going out every day for at least a ten minute walk in the sunshine. Needless to say, Oliver was absolutely thrilled with his progress. I've heard from many readers who had very good results initially (including complete remission) from ingesting bacterial soil organisms. However, up to a year later they experienced /f_lare-ups or new symptoms that were o/f_ten worse than their original condition. I suspect this is because bacterial soil organisms are very aggressive competitors in the gut and as a result they probably wiped out the yeast, fungus, bad bacteria and other pathogens that were causing the initial IBD or IBS. However, they will also wipe out your good bacterial /f_lora, colonize your gut, form spores, and then what? /T_his is the problem: No one knows. I have also heard from readers who've ingested bacterial soil organisms and experienced no unusual eects. Again, because there is no long-term research, it's very dicult to say at this point whether bacterial soil organisms (and which ones) can bene/f_it human beings, or /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 not. Dr. Glenn R. Gibson, a world-renowned researcher of probiotics (PhD Microbiology, University of Reading, UK), emailed me this statement: \"Selection criteria show that best probiotic success arises when the strains are isolated from the same species as their intended use. Hence, I currently do not see the advantages of using soil derived organisms.\" If you've ingested bacterial soil organisms already, you may be concerned about eradicating them and their spores from your gastrointestinal tract. Personally, I think Wild Oregano Oil is your best chance of killing Plant sterols are simply plant these bacterial soil organisms and if you have ingested them, I strongly fats that have been shown in recommend you follow Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol in Chapter Two. repeated, reliable, scienti/f_ic trials Again, there's currently no research or information available on the ecacy of Wild Oregano Oil against bacterial soil organisms in vivo (in to boost immune system function . the body), but since it kills all other known microorganisms, I'd say the odds are pretty good that it would work well. /T_here are studies - like the one referenced in Chapter Two - showing Wild Oregano Oil is very eective at killing certain bacterial soil organisms (like Bacillus cereus ) in vitro (outside the body), so again, I feel the odds are pretty good it will work eectively in the gut as well. Since bacterial soil organisms are spore- formers, you may need to repeat the Protocol in cycles for two or three years to completely rid yourself of the soil organisms - again, at the time of writing, there's no information on this topic available, so follow your gut and take the Wild Oregano Oil as needed. PLANT STEROLS/STEROLINS Plant sterols are simply plant fats that have been shown in repeated, reliable, scienti/f_ic trials to boost immune system function. I have taken plant sterols/ sterolins in the form of a product called Moducare for up to two months at a time, but seen no discernible dierence. An honest health store owner I know swears by Moducare and says feedback from customers has been really good, but you have to take it for at least three months continuously to see good results. A naturopathic physician I know, who has a lot of cancer /three.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT You can order your own kombucha mushroom starter, and then grow it and make the tea yourself. However, you must make sure your growing environment is sterile. patients, says she hasn't seen results that justify the price of the product - i.e. it helps, but it's not that great. My opinion is that this is a natural product that is highly unlikely to aggravate anyone's gut, so if you feel led to take it, then do so. Even though I haven't seen any great results from it, the research is compelling enough that I continue to take it sporadically. If you have a baby who is not being breastfed, then I would de/f_initely put \u00bd capsule into each formula bottle to make up for the lack of immune system factors naturally present in breastmilk (see Chapter Nine). KOMBUCHA TEA /T_his tea has gotten a lot of press as an anti-in/f_lammatory and excellent immune system strengthener. I trial-tested a bottle of it (imported from Germany and bought at a natural pharmacy) and it tasted quite good (kind of like a cross between apple cider and beer). I felt good during the two weeks it took me to /f_inish the bottle, but didn't notice any signi/f_icant change - although at the time I was also not experiencing any symptoms! However, I did see a posting on the Internet once from a woman who said she used it solely to heal her ulcerative colitis and continues to take it for maintenance. She said if she stops taking it, her symptoms return. It can be quite expensive to buy a prepared bottle of it from your health pharmacy, so keep in mind that you can order your own kombucha mushroom starter, and then grow it and make the tea yourself. However, you must make sure your growing environment is as sterile as possible. /T_he amount of tea you should drink will depend on which preparation you get, so just experiment with whatever the recommended guidelines are and use your intuition as your guide. Refrigerate a/f_ter opening. If you have any liver problems or damage, do not consume kombucha as there have been a couple of reports of liver failure due to kombucha.

Although green tea does /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 contain theophylline (a close relative of caeine), it is minimal and the positive eects of the catechins (a group of compounds that lower cholesterol, improve lipid metabolism and have antibacterial properties) outweigh the presence of theophylline - in my opinion. Also, if you just dip the tea bag quickly /twooldstyle - /threeoldstyle times you won't get much theophylline in your tea. /T_he kombucha and Chinese herbs however, will be released immediately upon contact with the hot water as they are sprayed on the tea leaves in a preparation designed to dissolve immediately. /T_he longer you let the tea steep, the higher the caeine content will be. Since MSM is a sulfur-based substance, it usually causes MSM Methyl-sulfonyl-methane (MSM) is a sulfur compound that is touted as being an excellent anti-in/f_lammatory. For this reason, it is commonly used in arthritis treatment and o/f_ten added to intestinal healing formulas. However, since MSM is a sulfur-based substance, it usually causes gas and bloating in people with IBD and IBS. /T_herefore, I do not recommend you consume it. I tried it myself numerous years ago and it did indeed cause bloating and increased my bowel movements. Again, read labels carefully as it's added to all kinds of products. MOLOCURE A.M.P. ALOE VERA Molocure is a very expensive brand of Aloe vera in freeze-dried powder form. I've heard from readers who've had good results from it, readers who've had no results from it, and only one reader who had a bad reaction to it. I haven't tried the product myself, but from the manufacturing process described on their website, it seems to be a good Aloe vera product. As the powder is processed from the inner leaf only, it contains no aggravating ingredients and therefore should be safe for people with IBS and IBD. However, keep in mind that you may see the same results from using George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice, which is a lot cheaper.gas and bloating in people with IBD and IBS. /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT ASHWAGANDA A mild sedative, ashwaganda also reduces mental sleep . Ashwaganda ( Withania somnifera ) is an Indian plant in the same family as the tomato. Some herbalists call ashwaganda 'Indian ginseng' since it is used in Ayurvedic medicine in the same way that ginseng is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Ashwaganda is an adaptogen herb. It is rejuvenating, balancing, strengthening, and calming to the nervous system. It's useful for relieving fatigue, nervous exhaustion, and memory loss. /T_his herb also has a reputation as an aphrodisiac and is believed to help prevent sterility in males and sexual ailments. A mild sedative, ashwaganda also reduces mental chatter and promotes sleep. It also promotes tissue regeneration and slows the aging process. Ashwaganda is available in capsule form, the whole plant is usually used and the product you choose should be standardized for withanolides. Do not use a product called ashwaganda oil internally - this is a combination of ashwaganda, almond oil and rose water that is meant to be used as a facial toner. Do not eat ashwaganda berries, as they can cause severe gastrointestinal pain. You should avoid this herb if you are taking prescription drugs for anxiety, insomnia, or a seizure disorder. If you're sensitive to tomatoes, then test this herb carefully. Otherwise, if you want to try this herb, then try it in isolation (i.e. do not take any other supplements at the same time) and see how you tolerate it before adding any other supplements. I have not tried this herb myself, so I can't oer any comments on it. If you want to use it, then test it and see how it goes. Again, follow the guidelines in Chapter Two for introducing new supplements. SEACURE Seacure comes in capsule form and it is a combination of /f_ish protein and /f_ish oil. I tried the product but as I can't swallow pills, I had to open the capsules. At which point I realized it has a very strong /f_ishy odor! I mixed /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/two.oldstyle TREATMENTS I'M OFTEN ASKED ABOUT CHAPTER 8 the contents of a few capsules in juice and drank it down, but I simply could not face ingesting it again a/f_ter that. My personal opinion is that this is a harmless product, but it may be cheaper to just ingest /f_ish oil (in odorless liquid or capsule form). As for the protein component, you'd have to ingest a lot of capsules to get a signi/f_icant amount of protein and it's probably a lot easier to just eat the /f_ish, or have a whey protein shake. they are completely harmless, and /T_his is a combination homeopathic remedy speci/f_ically formulated for people with Crohn's disease or colitis.

I heard from one reader with colitis who tried it and she said it worked like a charm for about two months, then all her symptoms returned. I tried it and it had no eect on me whatsoever. However, the great thing about homeopathic remedies is that they are completely harmless, and probably the safest supplement to test or experiment with. So, again, if you feel your gut urging you to try this remedy, by all means go ahead, and hopefully you'll get some good results from it. BC/hyphen.cap/nine.fitted HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY The great thing about homeopathic remedies is that TRYING NEW PRODUCTS Remember that before trying any new remedy, you need to test the product in isolation and introduce it according to the supplement guidelines in Chapter Two. Also keep in mind that the remedies recommended in this program have already been trial-tested by thousands of readers and everything you need to heal yourself is here. In almost every phone consultation I do, I /f_ind out the client is taking an herbal supplement(s) that is directly aggravating their condition. Please remember that even health professionals (like medical and naturopathic doctors, herbalists, etc.) are not fully aware of how extremely hypersensitive the gastrointestinal tract becomes in people with IBD and IBS, and their recommendations are not /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT always reliable. I strongly suggest that you at least wait until your condition is fairly stable (no bleeding or diarrhea, normal weight) before testing supplements other than the ones recommended in this program. Now turn to the Healing Journey Workbook and do the section for Chapter Eight. /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/four.oldstyle Pregnancy & Breastfeeding \"/D.swasho you know why my body is /s_pecial? /I.swash think it's a present.\" Oscar Patel /T_hompson, age /four.oldstyle 9 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Be gentle and compassionate with yourself, and just do the best you can at the time. Pregnancy, breastfeeding and the rigorous demands of parenting present a special challenge for people whose bodies are not strong and healthy to start with. In this chapter I'm going to outline all the special physical and emotional challenges in store for people with IBD or severe IBS, who choose to have children. I'm also going to give you some ideas on how to plan to meet these challenges successfully, without risking your health. I have two children (aged two and a half, and /f_ive years, at the time of writing) and have had my health crash several times from the rigorous demands of parenting. My goal in this chapter is to pass on to you the bene/f_it of my experience, so hopefully you will be able to parent more successfully (during the early years) and keep your health intact, as much as possible. Childbearing and parenting are somewhat dicult to write about because you cannot separate goals and beliefs about parenting from implementation. For example, if I believe that my child's health and welfare are number one, then that belief is going to shape and in/f_luence everything I do. If, however, I believe that my needs come /f_irst, and my child's needs are secondary - I will then respond dierently in almost all situations. My goal in this chapter is not to tell you which belief to hold or how best to care for your child. However, you need to know that I'm automatically going to be writing from my belief system - there is no such thing as an unbiased opinion! So, if you /f_ind yourself disagreeing with my position or assumptions, no problem, please just take the information and ideas that are useful to you and /f_it in with your philosophy, and ignore the rest. Balancing Baby's Needs & Your Needs Personally, I believe in an amalgamation of the two parenting positions outlined above. On the one hand, if you are sick or in the hospital, you are not going to be able to take care of your child anyway. So in that respect, you have to take care of yourself /f_irst. On the other hand, there is no way to adequately meet the needs of a newborn and infant without substantial self-sacri/f_ice. /T_he degree of physical energy required to eectively parent /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/six.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 an infant (especially /zero.oldstyle-/five.oldstyle months) will most likely involve a degradation of your health. And this is the juncture where each of us has to make our own decisions about how far we're willing to go to meet our children's needs. One of my goals for my children was to breastfeed them for as long as possible, but at least for one year. Ideally, I wanted to allow each of them to wean themselves, at whatever age they wanted to. I believe very strongly in the importance of breastfeeding, both from a health perspective and a spiritual/emotional perspective, so breastfeeding for a minimum of one Unless you get one of those year was an imperative for me. With my /f_irst child, Oscar, I was able to rare children that automatically breastfeed him for /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle months and then my health became so precarious sleeps through the night, there is that I had to wean him. By that time, I was about /one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle pounds underweight, very hormonally unbalanced, and bleeding from my colon. Some people no way you can meet the needs of may feel I sacri/f_iced far too much and I never should have let my health a newborn baby without sacri/f_icing degrade to such a level just to nurse my son. However, I still stand by my yourself to some degree. decision because I was taking into account who my son is, and his unique needs. He was a child for whom breastfeeding was his lifeline. Every time he latched on to my breast, his eyes would roll up from the pleasure of it, and his whole body would release with a huge sigh. Whenever he was emotionally or physically hurt, nothing could soothe him other than breastfeeding. Breastfeeding was an absolutely crucial need for his psyche and development. For myself, I took it as far as I could go to what I knew were my limits. I already had my treatment plan lined up and knew exactly what I needed to do to heal myself and roughly how long it would take. So I let him breastfeed until I (according to my limits, not someone else's) knew I then had to switch and take care of myself. We went down to my parent's house in Arizona so I could have help and support during my healing and I went on the IBD Remission Diet for two weeks. I did a gradual food reintroduction combined with shakes for the next ten days, and by the end of it I was up in my normal weight range again with no bleeding. It then took a few more months to sort out my hormonal problems. With my second child, Zara, I was not as strong right from the beginning of my pregnancy - because I got pregnant only /f_ive months a/f_ter weaning Oscar! When I weaned Zara, /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle months, I was in /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT I believe very strongly in the importance of breastfeeding, both from a health perspective and a spiritual/emotional perspective . a similar state of health as to when I had weaned Oscar. Again, I went on the IBD Remission Diet for two weeks and immediately began hormone supplementation to balance my endocrine system. I was also okay with my decision to wean Zara sooner because, although she really enjoyed breastfeeding, it wasn't an absolutely crucial thing for her, as it had been for Oscar. And she didn't derive the same sort of 'lifeline' comfort from it that Oscar did. So, with both my children, I didn't manage to meet my goal of letting them wean themselves. And I do feel a bit sad about that because I think it would have been wonderful from an emotional/spiritual point of view. However, taking into account the person I was at that time, the knowledge I had, where I was on my Healing Journey, and my physical constraints at that time, I know I did the best I could. I sacri/f_iced as far as was safe for me and I don't regret one minute of it. Personally, I think our western world places too much importance on the 'take care of yourself /f_irst' concept and not enough importance on self- sacri/f_ice (of sleep/health, money, autonomy, etc.) to meet your child's needs. And I don't care what anyone says, unless you get one of those rare children that automatically sleeps through the night, there is no way you can meet the needs of a newborn baby without sacri/f_icing yourself to some degree. What we can do, however, is to get a generous support network in place so that the parents (and especially the breastfeeding mother) are supported to such an extent that the sacri/f_ice required is minimal. I'll discuss setting up this network later in this chapter and hopefully you can learn and bene/f_it from my mistakes/experience. If I'd had a sucient support network in place with my two children, my health would not have deteriorated to the level it did, I would have been able to breastfeed longer, and I would have been able to enjoy those early years a whole lot more. Who knows, if I ever have a third child, maybe I'll /f_inally be able to get it right! Parenting is a huge learning curve, and I hope each of you can shortcut this process by learning from the mistakes I've already made. If you get your support network in place, then hopefully you'll be able to keep your health intact throughout. Keep in mind that the protocols and concepts presented in this /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 chapter are ideal scenarios. As any parent knows, we can't always ful/f_ill our ideals! So again, be gentle and compassionate with yourself and just do the best you can at the time. BIRTH CONTROL Before you're ready to conceive, a/f_ter you've given birth, and when you don't want to have any more children, you're going to be faced with the question of birth control. I am strongly opposed to any form of hormonal birth control (including birth control pills, transdermal patches and implants). Hormonal birth control methods will unbalance your endocrine (hormonal) system and destroy the good bacteria in your gut (by creating an alkaline pH). /T_hese are very unhealthy conditions - particularly for someone with IBS or IBD. If you're using birth control pills for acne control or period regulation - again, you're just suppressing the symptoms of an imbalance, you're not resolving the actual problem. Acne can be healed using Wild Oregano Oil internally and externally, followed by high dose probiotic supplementation (follow Jini's Wild Oregano Oil Protocol in Chapter Two). Menstrual irregularities signify an underlying endocrine problem - perhaps your thyroid, pituitary or adrenal glands are not functioning properly and/or you're doing other things that are leading to a hormone imbalance. See Immunosuppressive Drugs & Hormonal Health in Chapter Five, and the section on Plastic & Xenoestrogen s in Chapter Four for more information on resolving hormonal imbalance. You also should not use any kind of spermicidal cream, jelly or condom lubricant because this will also disrupt your bacterial /f_lora. So what's le/f_t? You can use condoms lubricated with KY jelly or a natural, herbal lubricant, but as we know, condoms can tear. IUD's (Intrauterine Devices) are not always recommended for people with IBS or IBD as they can trigger cramping, aside from other complications that may result. A diaphragm (but no spermicide) combined with a condom may work well - but make sure you use the regular, thicker condoms and if you're having vigorous or There are two methods of entirely natural birth control that have prevention rates similar to the birth control pill, when used correctly. /three.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT prolonged intercourse, then change the condom periodically for a fresh one to reduce chance of tearing. GI Symptoms vary with Menstruation A review of the literature was carried out regarding the eect of the menstrual cycle on bowel symptoms in women with and without irritable bowel syndrome. The studies surveyed suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms do vary with the menstrual cycle. One-third of otherwise asympto - matic women may experience gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of menstruation, and almost /five.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of women with functional bowel disorder report an increase in symptoms during menstruation. In addition, women who suer from dysmenorrhoea are more likely to have functional bowel disorder. The physiological basis of these phenomena is unknown. It has been suggested that raised serum progesterone levels in the luteal phase may be one of the mechanisms responsible but little is known of the physiological eects of sex hormones on the gut in vitro. It has also been suggested that prostaglandins released by the uterus at the time of menstruation might cause diarrhoea. Further research is needed to explore what common hormonal or neurological path - ways may underlie the covariance in gastrointestinal and menstrual symptoms. Moore, J. et J. Obst.Gyn . /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle, /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle (/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle) /one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle-/five.oldstyle /T_here are two methods of entirely natural birth control that have prevention rates similar to the birth control pill, when used correctly. /T_he /f_irst one uses a daily saliva test to monitor hormone levels - the pattern formed by the saliva indicates your pre-ovulatory phase, ovulation, and then post-ovulatory phase. Scientists found that saliva mimics cervical mucus, so instead of having to swab the cervix and examine the specimen, you can just spit onto a slide and examine that under a microscope. /T_his is the method I use and it's very simple. I just leave the kit on my bedside table and every morning, before I get up (I /f_ind the results most accurate and consistent then) I just dab my tongue onto the slide. I let the sample dry while I'm getting ready, then I take a look under the little microscope and in three seconds I know whether it's okay to have sex that day, or not. Of course, this same handy device can also be used for when you are trying to conceive - since it tells you exactly when you're ovulating. You can buy a saliva method kit or /f_ind out more about it at: www.lunafertility.com . Your kit will come with complete, detailed instructions. Obviously, if you're not in a monogamous relationship, then you still have to use condoms as well, to protect against sexually transmitted diseases. One word of caution: Do not use natural progesterone cream (or other natural hormone supplements) whilst using the saliva method of birth control, as it will obscure the results. /T_he other eective natural planning method also works on mapping your ovulatory cycle, but instead of monitoring your saliva, you monitor your basal body temperature. Or, some methods combine monitoring your basal body temperature and cervical mucus for maximum accuracy. If you're interested in this method of birth control, type in 'basal temperature /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 birth control' to your Internet search engine, as there are many dierent methods and programs available. NATURAL MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS Since we're on the topic, I also want to discuss the importance of using natural, unbleached menstrual products. Like diapers, many commercial menstrual pads and tampons use a very harmful chemical called Dioxin to bleach them white. /T_hey are also composed of synthetic (i.e. plastic) materi - als and these can also leach harmful chemicals into your body - remember that mucous membranes (mouth, intestines, lining of your nose, genitals, anus) have the highest absorption capabilities of any tissue in the body. So you should make absolutely certain you're not using products that contain harmful chemicals in these areas. Which reminds me, for your baby, you should use cloth diapers or natural disposable diapers like Tushies (www.tushies.com ) or Seventh Generation ( www.seventhgeneration.com ). Currently the only disposable natural menstrual products I've seen are Natracare Brand ( www.natracare.com ) and they're available in many health stores. You can also get washable, re-usable, organic cotton menstrual pads from a variety of suppliers online and in health stores, and obviously this is better for our environment than using disposables. But the absolute best natural menstrual product I've come across is a device called the Diva Cup. It's a cone-shaped, silicone cup that you insert mid-way up your vagina and it collects your menstrual blood as it drains from your uterus. You then carefully pull it out, empty the blood into the toilet, rinse it out in the sink (or just wipe it with toilet paper) and then re-insert it. It holds one ounce of blood, so you may only need to empty it twice a day. A/f_ter you buy the Diva Cup, there's no ongoing expense, no laundry to do, no adverse eects on the environment, and it's the easiest thing to use when you're traveling, swimming, etc. I strongly encourage you to give it a try. It's available online at www.divacup.com and they oer a one-year guarantee, so there's no risk. If you don't like it, just send it back. It's also available in health stores. A menstrual cup is inserted mid-way up your vagina and it collects your menstrual blood as it drains from your uterus. You then carefully pull it out, empty the blood into the toilet, and then re-insert it. There's no ongoing expense, no laundry to do, no adverse eects on the environment, and it's the easiest thing to use when you're traveling, swimming, etc. /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT If you don't like silicone, there's another menstrual cup product available called /T_he Keeper that's made out of natural rubber (but some people don't like the rubber smell), it's available at: www.keeper.com . PRIOR TO CONCEPTION Ideally, it's best if you can follow the Listen To Your Gut healing program to get yourself o all drugs for at least three to six months before conceiving a Notes: child. Your husband/partner should also be o all medication and following the Maintenance Diet for three to six months prior to conception, to ensure the health and vitality of his sperm. /T_he health of your baby begins in utero and you want to do everything you can to give it the best conditions to /f_lourish. Prescription Drugs I don't care what your doctor may say about the 'safety' of being on steroids, Asacol or immunosuppressant drugs whilst pregnant. If a pregnant woman is not even supposed to drink alcohol or dye her hair because of possible damage to the fetus, how can these incredibly strong drugs possibly be safe? For example, as I wrote in Chapter Five, when Prednisone was released onto the market it was mandated to be used only in 'life-threatening conditions'. Subsequent research has shown that it causes signi/f_icant damage to the eyes, bones and lungs of developing children./one.superior If it can damage a child's organs outside of the womb, how can it not do any damage to an extremely vulnerable, developing fetus? We already know that numerous pharmaceutical companies have misrepresented drug trial data to the FDA in order to get approval for pending drugs (they leave out data from any trials showing negative results that do not support their FDA application). So how can you trust any data or trial results sponsored, indirectly funded, or otherwise linked to a pharmaceutical company? Instead, use your common sense and your intuition. My personal belief is that it would be far less harmful to use any of the natural supplements listed in this book, rather than a prescription drug. /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/two.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 Even in the case of potent herbs (like Wild Oregano Oil) that have not been tested on pregnant women, they are still plant substances, and therefore will be more compatible with your body, and will likely be metabolized more easily than a synthetic compound. If you have a severe /f_lare-up, or distressing symptoms that you need to address during pregnancy, I believe it's far better for you (and your baby) to address these problems naturally - as long as you don't have other, complicating conditions. A good naturopathic physician can guide you in the use of untested herbs during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Towards the end of this chapter, I'm going to If a pregnant woman is not discuss the use of an elemental diet during pregnancy for people in dire even supposed to drink alcohol or circumstances and give you a few anecdotal examples of using an elemental dye her hair because of possible diet to get through a severe /f_lare-up, rather than resorting to medication. damage to the fetus, how can strong prescription drugs possibly Avoiding Morning Sickness be safe? Depending on your health, you may want to do a gentle detox (or use the therapies in this program that are naturally detoxifying - see Chapter Eight) to reduce the likelihood of /f_irst trimester nausea. My naturopath told me about a patient of his who'd had two children already and suered terrible 'morning sickness' with both. He told her that if she detoxi/f_ied her body /f_irst, then her liver wouldn't have so much to cope with whilst pregnant (the liver automatically carries an extra load during pregnancy). So she underwent a course of herbal and infrared sauna detoxi/f_ication prior to conceiving her third child. She then had absolutely no nausea during that pregnancy. Apparently he had numerous other patients who followed this practice of detoxifying before conceiving and all of them experienced minimal to no nausea during pregnancy. If you've taken prescription medication and been eating a 'normal' diet, then your liver function is likely to be weak. If you've been o drugs for a few months and continue to follow the protocols in this program, you may be okay without additional detoxi/f_ication. But it would be a good idea to supplement with Milk /T_histle (cleanses and strengthens the liver) prior to conceiving. Test it according to the procedure in Chapter Two for introducing new supplements. /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Mothers with IBS or IBD should also give oral B. infantis probiotic directly to their infants from three weeks to one year of age. I had been on the IBD Remission Diet for seven weeks prior to conceiving my /f_irst child, Oscar. So this provided me with an excellent detoxi/f_ication and strengthening program before I got pregnant two months a/f_ter /f_inishing it. I experienced maybe seven incidences of very mild nausea lasting about /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle - /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle minutes each episode, during my entire pregnancy with Oscar. When I got pregnant with Zara, I'd only weaned Oscar /f_ive months prior and had gone on the IBD Remission Diet for two weeks to build myself up because I was so run down. I had wanted a whole year to build up my stores, detox and strengthen myself, but, the romance of Hawaii....! /T_hus, I had mild nausea brie/f_ly periodically at night, during the /f_irst trimester I was pregnant with Zara. Luckily it didn't interfere with my nutrient intake since I'd /f_inished eating for the day by the time it hit. SUPPLEMENTATION It's vital for women to supplement with additional nutrients prior to conception, during pregnancy, during nursing, and then for at least three months following weaning. /T_his holds true for any woman (due to average sub-standard nutrition and toxic environment), but especially so for women who've been diagnosed with IBD or IBS. Your body is already in a weakened, compromised state and most likely coping with additional drug residues (or ongoing drug toxins), so it's imperative that you supplement with additional nutrients and healing substances during this very important time in your and baby's life. Probiotic Supplementation Is Crucial Women with IBD or IBS who are planning to conceive should also be on high dose probiotic supplementation for three months prior to conception, throughout pregnancy, and throughout breastfeeding. It would also be ideal if you could do Jini's Probiotic Retention Enema (see Chapter Two) prior to conception as well. Mothers with IBS or IBD should also give Natren's Life Start ( B. infantis probiotic) directly to their infants from three weeks to one year of age. When giving probiotics directly to an infant, only give Life Start (B. infantis ). Once your baby begins eating regular foods you can start with /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/four.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 the other species of bacteria - but not before. Studies have shown that even healthy mothers in the western world do not have sucient 'good bacterial' populations and therefore cannot pass on a good bacterial /f_lora to their babies./two.superior Many theorize that this is at the root of the explosion of allergies in the Western world. A baby receives its primary implantation of good bacteria as it passes through the vaginal canal - the bacteria enter through ori/f_ices like the ears, nose and mouth. /T_herea/f_ter, it continues to receive good bacteria through its mother's breastmilk. If you don't have a good gut /f_lora to begin with (and people with IBS or IBD do not), or your baby was delivered by cesarean section, then how can you pass on good bacteria to your baby? /T_his is why it is absolutely crucial for every mother reading this book to take high dose oral probiotics prior to conception, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and also to supplement your baby directly. Please see the Probiotic Supplementation section in Chapter Two for detailed probiotic dosage instructions for both you and your baby. Jini's Tried And Tested Supplements Following are the supplements I have used during both my pregnancies (and during breastfeeding) and found to cause no adverse eects (and lots of bene/f_its!) However, this is my experience only (and that of about ten others I've heard from) so use at your own risk/discretion. /T_here's no 'published' information available on the safety of George's Aloe Vera Juice, Astragalus, or L-Glutamine during pregnancy. /T_he other supplements are all published as being safe for pregnant women: George's 'Always Active' Aloe Vera Juice - but only this brand, do not substitute another! I know numerous pregnant women who've used George's successfully Natren brand Probiotics - Healthy Trinity capsules, or Megadophilus powder, Bifido Factor powder, Digesta-Lac powder and Life Start powder. Again, only use this brand, other brands of probiotics may deliver little benefit, and some will aggravate your condition. Continue taking Natren Notes: /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT probiotics throughout breastfeeding as well, so your baby gets beneficial flora in his/her gut. See Chapter Two for detailed probiotic dosage guidelines for both mother and baby. Georges' Aloe Vera and Natren Probiotics both really help if you're experiencing heartburn (among their other benefits - see Chapter Two for more details). L-Glutamine - I've taken up to /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg per day on an empty stomach (stops diarrhea) and up to /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg per day when mixed in a protein shake (doesn't stop diarrhea when mixed with other foods but still highly Notes: beneficial for healing the mucosal lining). Full spectrum of vitamins and minerals, including trace minerals. I took Nature's Way Prenatal (capsules) while pregnant and breastfeeding. Up to /six.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg of vitamin C per day in mineral ascorbate form only (do not use ascorbic acid) eg. calcium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate. A product called Emergen-C is a really tasty naturally flavored drink packet with /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg of Vitamin C per packet (in mineral ascorbate form) that you just mix with water. Up to /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle drops per day (in divided doses) of Herb Pharm's liquid tincture Astragalus when your immune system feels run down, or is battling a cold or illness (do not take if you already have a fever as it induces added sweating) /one.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle Absorb Plus elemental shakes per day (automatically contains /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg L-Glutamine per shake) with /one.oldstyle tbsp. of flax or Udo's oil per shake (great for fetal brain development), /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg CoEnzyme Q/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle, and /three.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle mg Pycnogenol or Grape Seed Extract added. I would also add my /two.oldstyle prenatal multi-vitamin capsules (see above) and whip it all together in the blender, then pour over ice.

Flu/Cold Supplements You can also take all these supplements (above) while breastfeeding and if your baby gets a cold, the Astragalus and vitamin C will get rid of it /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/six.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 very quickly - but again, don't use Astragalus if your baby has a fever. If your baby is vomiting, has diarrhea or a bacterial infection, de/f_initely take the Natren probiotics for the duration of the illness (also give B. infantis - Life Start - directly to your baby) and then for three months following. If there's a stomach /f_lu bug going around your community, or a family member gets sick, then breastfeeding Mum should take all three Natren probiotics (ideally in powder form) /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle times per day to prevent Mum and Baby from contracting the illness. If you do get sick with an infection that causes vomiting or diarrhea, then sip the Natren probiotics (/one.oldstyle tsp. of each Pregnancy and Factor, Digesta-Lac - mixed in room-temperature (breastfeeding) should be the /f_iltered water) in powder form every half hour until the vomiting or most disciplined, healthy diet and diarrhea subsides. Don't worry if you have to sip it very slowly and you still lifestyle time of your life keep vomiting, just keep going with it, and the good bacteria will eventually take hold. /T_hen take them three times per day for the next two weeks. Also always follow antibiotic use with probiotic supplementation, both for your baby and you. See Chapter Two for detailed instructions on probiotic supplementation. Essential Supplements So, here are the supplements I believe every mother should take during pregnancy (and ideally for three months prior to conception), for the duration of breastfeeding, and then for at least three months following weaning (to replenish your stores and health): Nature's Way Prenatal Multivitamin Udo's Oil (or flax oil) - at least /one.oldstyle tbsp. per day Fish Oil - as directed on bottle, or to tolerance Absorb Plus or protein shake - at least once per day, or as needed Natren probiotics in powder form (Megadophilus, Bifido Factor, Life Start, Digesta-Lac) or capsules (if you prefer and have no diarrhea or heartburn). /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Your body is already in a weakened, compromised state and most likely coping with additional drug residues (or ongoing drug toxins), so it's imperative that you supplement with additional nutrients and healing substances during this very important time in your and baby's life. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Follow the Healing Diet that suits your symptoms, or at least follow the Maintenance Diet strictly Other supplements that would also be bene/f_icial: Coenzyme Q/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle Pycnogenol or Grape Seed Extract Vitamin C in mineral ascorbate form Additional Multi-Mineral supplement /T_here have been many long-term studies done showing that the health of your baby in-utero will pre-determine your child's health until the late teenage years./three.superior So please don't make the mistake of assuming that you can eat whatever you want whilst pregnant. Pregnancy and lactation (breastfeeding) should be the most disciplined, healthy diet and lifestyle time of your life. It is absolutely crucial that you strictly follow the guidelines in the Maintenance Diet and take the supplements recommended above to give your baby the best chance at good health, optimal brain functioning, and avoiding allergies and obesity. See Chapter Two for descriptions of why the supplements above are bene/f_icial. If you experience nausea during the /f_irst trimester, you may not be able to take some of the supplements listed above. If this is the case, don't worry about it. Just try to drink the Absorb Plus shakes whenever you can, to keep your nutrient levels up and then begin supplementing whenever you can tolerate it. An added bonus of ingesting the Udo's Oil and/or /f_ish oil, is that you will probably not lose any hair following the birth of your baby. Doctors tell women this is inevitable, and is the result of hormonal changes. But I have had numerous friends take Udo's Oil daily a/f_ter childbirth and none of them (including me) lost any hair. Another mother I know whose hair had already thinned considerably, began taking the Udo's Oil and her hair began thickening within a month. /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 If you experience rectal /f_issures either during or a/f_ter giving birth (a common occurrence for even normal women), then you can use FissureHeal suppositories to heal them quite quickly. See the relevant sections in Chapter Two for healing both rectal /f_issures and/or hemorrhoids. Legally, Imix Naturals (the company that makes FissureHeal) has to warn against their use during pregnancy, because of the Comfrey contained in the product. Personally, I don't believe the Comfrey in FissureHeal will pose a problem during pregnancy, since it's in very small amounts, and as it is not ingested, it does not pass through your digestive system. Natural Progesterone Cream If you /f_ind yourself very sad, depressed, angry, irritable, or perhaps with a signi/f_icant loss of short-term memory or other cognitive abilities (e.g., losing track of what you were saying in mid-sentence, going into a room or shop and being completely unable to remember why you needed to go there, etc.), then you may be suering a hormonal imbalance. Many postpartum mothers /f_ind these problems resolve very quickly a/f_ter supplementing with natural progesterone cream. Progesterone is produced in massive amounts during pregnancy and then drops to virtually nothing following childbirth. Many theorize that this sudden drop is what triggers clinical postpartum depression in some women. /T_hese same symptoms, mentioned above, can also be caused by sleep deprivation. But even if they are, natural progesterone cream may still make a big dierence. I used it a/f_ter the birth of both my children, during the whole time I breastfed, and for several months following - and it changed my life. Without it I was extremely irritable, lost my temper at absurd things (o/f_ten directed at my poor husband!), and couldn't think or remember properly. From day two of supplementing with natural progesterone cream, I was back to my normal self. Needless to say, my husband was amazed at the dierence. I tested going o it a few times to see if it really was solely responsible for the improvements in my mind/ emotions and every time I did, my husband asked me, \"Did you use your progesterone cream today?\" /T_he change was that obvious! Notes: /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson If you /f_ind yourself very sad, depressed, angry, irritable, or perhaps with a signi/f_icant loss of short-term memory or other cognitive abilities, then you may be suering a hormonal imbalance. Many postpartum mothers /f_ind these problems resolve very quickly after supplementing with natural progesterone cream. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Pick up Dr. John Lee and Dr. Jesse Hanley's book What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Premenopause for excellent information on natural progesterone cream and hormonal balancing. If you're having trouble conceiving, then de/f_initely pick up this book - they have helped thousands of women conceive who had tried everything else with no success. /T_he important thing to remember about natural progesterone cream supplementation is that you must use a product that is completely natural. Synthetic progesterone will not have the same eect and is damaging to your body. Natural progesterone has been extensively tested and it is safe to use during pregnancy (for people with de/f_iciencies, or to prevent miscarriage) and/or during breastfeeding. /T_he type and concentration of natural progesterone is important and Dr. Lee has found that some brands work much better than others. He recommends several suitable brands in his book. I used one of the brands he recommended called Pro-Gest by Emerita and it's widely available. Start with \u00bc teaspoon of natural progesterone cream and rub it into your skin on either the soles of your feet, neck and face, inner arms and wrists, or the palms of your hands (where blood vessels are near the surface for quick absorption). Try to rotate application sites for maximum eectiveness, and don't use any other kind of cream or lotion on the areas you're applying it to. You may /f_ind that you don't need \u00bc teaspoon and can get the same results from only of a teaspoon (as I did). I also found that the soles of my feet were the best absorption site, so I alternated applying the cream once per day to either the soles of my feet, or my inner arms, wrists and neck. Keep the cream in the fridge to retain maximum potency. If natural progesterone cream is going to work for you, you'll see a dierence in two to three days. It works very quickly. If you don't see any improvement in postpartum symptoms, within three days, then your progesterone levels are probably /f_ine and that's not the problem. If you have any emotional or cognitive irregularities following childbirth, I certainly recommend you give it a try. /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 BREASTFEEDING Breastfeeding is absolutely crucial to the health of your baby. Even the American Medical Association has revised its recommendations based on scienti/f_ic data, and now advises women to breastfeed for at least one year. Breastmilk contains hundreds of dierent components (from nutrients to immune system factors) and scientists have still not even isolated all the dierent components present. Breastmilk is also a dynamic, responsive feeding system, where your baby's body communicates with your body, and the composition of your breastmilk changes according to baby's needs! For example, if baby's brain is going through a growth or development phase, your breastmilk will automatically contain extra nutrients like essential fatty acids that support brain development. /T_here is really no way formula feeding can even come close to breastfeeding in supporting your infant's growth and development. Breastfeeding also reduces allergies, improves immune system function, and reduces obesity (at all stages of life). /T_he emotional and soul-level bene/f_its of breastfeeding are a whole other issue. I could go on and on about this topic alone, but suce it to say that once you've experienced the level of communion, intimacy and bonding that occurs with breastfeeding, you wouldn't give it up for anything. Here's an excerpt from an article in Mothering magazine that I like for both its realism and beauty: \"I nursed my son from the tender beginnings of skin-on-skin bonding just moments a/f_ter his slippery entrance into this world until a few months a/f_ter his second birthday, when he gracefully weaned himself from my breast.

While I nursed, I'd return calls, look through mail, and try to keep up with all the details of my life. A/f_ter about six months of this, I gave up and gave in. With each day that passed, I saw myself more and more as a mother, as a nursing mother, as a woman devoted to her child and to the importance of breastfeeding. I became an advocate for breastfeeding, trying to Notes: encourage it among all my friends and acquaintances. I awoke to the miracle of my milk and this intimate dance of nursing my child. A calmness began to quiet my restless energy, pulling me into the present moment. As Myla Kabat-Zinn says in her book, Everyday Blessings: /T_he Inner Work of Mindful Parenting , \"As I felt my milk let down, a wonderful haziness descended on me, and everything else became less important. I let go of the things I had planned to do, and instead let myself be pulled into the present moment, into being totally with my baby. It was a deeply meditative time for both of us.\" One sunny a/f_ternoon we were nursing in our \"big blue chair\" (as we like to call our comfortable rocker), and I realized that I'd never before devoted myself to something so entirely. Of course I've devoted myself to my husband, to my family, to friends, to my writing, to mothering, and even to God and other spiritual endeavors at various points in my life. But in that moment, I realized, that as a breastfeeding mother, I'd completely given myself to this act of nursing in a way that I never had before. Nothing was more important than nursing my son. Nothing was put before it. /T_here was no procrastination as with exercise, no excuses as with trying to stop eating sugar, no laziness as with housecleaning and other chores. Nursing had to be done, and I did it, over and over again, multiple times a day, for more than /eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle days in a row. It was the closest thing to a spiritual practice that I'd ever experienced.\" /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 Breastfeeding An Adopted Baby If you're adopting a baby, you may be surprised to hear that you can still breastfeed. You simply put your adopted baby to your breast as many times per day and night as you can and eventually your breasts will produce milk. It is not usually enough milk to exclusively breastfeed your baby, so many adoptive mothers supplement with formula through a tube taped to the breast - so the baby still sucks on the mother's nipple and has the experience and intimacy of breastfeeding. Mothering magazine (www.mothering.com ) has great articles about adoptive mothers Breastmilk is also a dynamic, breastfeeding, exactly how to do it, and further resources available in some responsive feeding system, where of their back issues, so contact them for more information. your baby's body communicates with your body, and the Diculties Breastfeeding composition of your breastmilk I knew a woman who had been sexually abused and so couldn't bear to changes according to baby's needs. breastfeed her baby (at the time I met her, her child was already three years old). But, for the sake of her baby's health, she pumped breastmilk into bottles (which she hated as well) and exclusively fed her baby breastmilk for six months. What a gi/f_t to her child! In spite of her diculties, she managed to do her best and give her baby that vital foundation of health. I admire her tremendously. If you have been abused (physically or mentally) and /f_ind even the thought of breastfeeding repulsive or horrifying, then please see an EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) therapist prior to birth, or conception, to heal yourself (see Chapter Six). You can completely heal this trauma/wounding from your body and psyche, and the healing will pervade and improve all areas of your life. Don't let your abuser continue to rob you of the riches of life. You can be completely healed, and you will then be able to breastfeed your baby with joy and comfort. If you're having diculty breastfeeding for other reasons; insucient milk supply, breast infection, extremely painful/wounded nipples, etc., I encourage you to not give up. La Leche League is an international organization dedicated to the promotion and encouragement of breastfeeding and they have many, many resources available to you. /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT You can go to a local meeting (they have chapters worldwide), and/or you can search their database of useful articles, questions & answers and varied resources available on their website: www.lalecheleague.org . Please do not give up. Breastfeeding is so crucial for your baby's physical and emotional health. Whatever your diculty, there is a solution, you just need to /f_ind it. For example, anemia can cause insucient milk supply, and this can be remedied through iron supplementation. O/f_ten, just supplementing with Mother's Milk tea (from Traditional Medicinals, available in most health Notes: stores) is enough to boost milk production. De/f_initely try EFT therapy as physical problems (in both baby and you) usually have emotional roots. If you've already given up on breastfeeding, it's not too late to start again! Remember that if adoptive mothers - who've never even been pregnant - can produce milk, then so can you. Just start putting your baby to your breast to suck for as long as it wants, as o/f_ten as it wants. Mothering magazine ( www.mothering.com ) is another good resource for breastfeeding. A Colicky Baby /T_he mainstream opinion on colic is that doctors still aren't sure what causes it. However, if you've ever had a serious abdominal pain attack due to trapped gas, stool, or spasming intestines - when you see a colicky baby, you'll know exactly why that baby is screaming! My son Oscar developed colic and I could see from the position and movement of his body, and the rigidity of his abdomen, that he was suering the same kind of pain I had once suered. I thought to myself, \"Well, if the Bowel Queen can't /f_igure out how to heal this, I don't know who can!\" As a result of my experimentation on Oscar, I worked out a very eective technique that combined Colonic Massage (see Chapter Six) with a number of other movements designed to release the abdomen and stimulate the relaxed passage of stool and gas. Within two weeks, Oscar's colic was completely resolved. Whenever I performed the technique on him, he would fart and poop on demand. I found this so funny that I called the routine 'Fart Aerobics'. /T_hen of course I began teaching the technique to other mothers of newborns. Even if their baby didn't have colic, the routine /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/four.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 still helped the baby to get their brand new intestines working properly - leading to less crying and improved sleep (for both mom and baby!). Like everything else in my life, demand led to a new product, and when my daughter Zara was born, we used her to shoot a video that I titled BABY FART AEROBICS: And Other Natural Treatments For Colicky Babies . I had to wait until Zara was born because I needed a newborn to demonstrate the technique on - newborns have to be handled in speci/f_ic ways because they don't have head or limb control. I also included burping and positioning techniques to reduce the amount of upper gastrointestinal gas, and If you've ever had a serious showed mothers a number of other techniques to make their babies more abdominal pain attack due to comfortable and help them sleep better. trapped gas, stool, or spasming Feedback to the DVD has been great from both midwives and mums, and intestines - when you see a colicky I've even had mothers of three or four children, who said they learned baby, you'll know exactly why that something new from it.

You can view a clip of the video and read more about what's in it at: www.ColicInfant.com . Okay, and while I'm on the subject, I have to get in a plug for my Sleeptime Stories series of CDs for children aged /two.oldstyle - /eight.oldstyle years. /T_hese CDs are recordings of stories I've used with my own children at bedtime, or any other time I want to calm them down, or keep them occupied. Each of the CDs features one story followed by half an hour of soothing music. /T_he stories teach children concepts like deep breathing (meditative breathing) when faced with a puzzle or challenge - in order to get in touch with their body or creative self. It's amazing how quickly kids pick up and utilize concepts like this. A few weeks a/f_ter listening to the CDs, the kids and I arrived home a/f_ter a busy day out and we were faced with a dilemma: Zara had fallen asleep in the car and really needed to sleep (if you move her, she wakes up), but Oscar wanted to go inside and do something. I was thinking out loud, trying to come up with a solution when Oscar piped up, \"Mum, we should do some /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT deep breathing and wait for the answer to come.\" Just like he'd heard the characters say in the Murray the Shark CDs !

You can listen to a clip of the stories and the music at: www.Murray/T_heShark.com . If you're formula feeding a newborn, you'll need to add a number of crucial nutrients to facilitate proper brain development and help safeguard his/her gut. FORMULA FEEDING If you absolutely cannot breastfeed your baby, or if you have to supplement with formula feeding then there are things you can add to commercial formulas to increase their low nutrient value. But again, please go to a La Leche League meeting and/or search their website ( www.lalecheleague.org ), as there is so much help available for breastfeeding diculties of all kinds. If you're formula feeding a newborn, you'll need to add a number of crucial nutrients to facilitate proper brain development and help safeguard his/her gut. /T_he best and most comprehensive instructions for infant formula supplementation can be found at www.mercola.com (search under \"Infant Formula Forti/f_ication Protocol\"). /T_here's no point in me giving you additional instructions here, as Dr. Joseph Mercola has really covered it all (and gives a few dierent options) in this article on his website. If you're exclusively formula feeding, contact Natren Inc. ( www.natren.com , /one.oldstyle-/eight.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-/nine.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle/two.oldstyle-/three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle) for guidelines on adding their probiotic (Life Start - B. infantis ) to baby's formula bottles. If you're using formula to supplement your breastfeeding, you should still read the article at mercola.com as the information is vital. Depending on the amount you're still breastfeeding, you'll either need to fortify your formula feedings as per Dr. Mercola's instructions, or you can use Jini's Formula Supplement Protocol below. My protocol assumes that you are taking the supplements recommended above (in Essential Supplements ) - if you are not, then you need to follow Dr. Mercola's protocol instead. My protocol is also not to be used for newborns (/zero.oldstyle-/four.oldstyle months) and is nowhere /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/six.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 near as good as Dr. Mercola's protocol. However, if you simply can't manage to implement Dr. Mercola's protocol, then this protocol is still far better than just plain formula. organic goat's milk (or raw, organic cow's milk if raw, organic goat's milk not available)* /one.oldstyle scoop of formula (or use amount as directed on label) tsp.

Remember never to heat infant milk or formula in the microwave. *If you can't get raw (unpasteurized, non-homogenized) goat's or cow's milk (see www.realmilk.com for suppliers) then just use your regular formula with water or rice milk. Do not ever use pasteurized cow's milk or soy milk. Also give baby /one.oldstyle - /two.oldstyle Cod Liver Oil capsules per day (puncture capsule and squeeze contents into baby's mouth - do not add to bottle.)

Providing yourself and baby with enough nutrients to ensure proper development is vital, therefore I highly recommend you consume Absorb Plus shakes, or blend your own protein shakes (adding the extra supplements necessary), Notes: to provide you with nutrients that you know are actually being absorbed and utilized. Remember that during a /f_lare, your digestive and absorptive capabilities can greatly deteriorate. So even if you're eating enough food, or you're overweight, your baby (and you) may still not be getting adequate nutrients. /T_his is why I recommend the Absorb Plus shakes (www.absorbplus.com ) - since they're completely pre-digested, they are absorbed very quickly into the bloodstream and the quality of nutrients is extremely high. As I mentioned before, I drank Absorb Plus shakes, o and on, throughout both my pregnancies and during breastfeeding both my children. The IBD Remission Diet If you experience a severe /f_lare-up during pregnancy or breastfeeding, then the IBD Remission Diet ( www.caramal.com ), along with probiotics, may be the best solution for you to maintain your weight and nutrition, whilst avoiding drugs. A reader (with colitis that was later diagnosed as Crohn's) once contacted me in her second month of pregnancy. Anna was experiencing a severe /f_lare with copious bleeding and diarrhea, and she was unable to eat much or absorb much nutrition from her food (the gastrointestinal transit time was too fast). Her doctor wanted strongly to put her on Prednisone and was afraid she'd lose the baby if she didn't go on it. Anna had been on the IBD Remission Diet before (and was very happy with the results that time), so she asked me if I thought she should go on the Diet again, rather than take Prednisone. A/f_ter questioning her closely about her condition, symptoms, etc. I recommended that she go on the IBD Remission Diet with two modi/f_ications. First, I wanted her to amend the /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 supplementation recommended in the Diet to comply with the list given above of safe supplements for pregnant women. Secondly, I advised her to try juicing vegetables and drinking them. By juicing and drinking fresh vegetables, the Diet was no longer elemental, but it would still be far easier for her body to extract nutrients from juices then from solid food. If she could tolerate the fresh vegetable juices, then that would be ideal because the baby would receive adequate phytonutrients as well. I felt the vegetable juices together with the Absorb Plus shakes, Udo's oil, and supplements should provide a fairly well-balanced diet with an adequate range of Remember that during a /f_lare, nutrients for a developing fetus.

So far, Anna is the only person I've heard from who has attempted this variation of the IBD Remission Diet whilst pregnant. I have heard from numerous other readers who've used the Absorb Plus shakes along with the recommended supplements above during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but not exclusively. Initially, Anna was worried about whether the Diet and juicing would provide adequate nutrients. My view is that you have to balance it out against the alternative: What do you think will do more damage to your baby, Prednisone or missing a few nutrients for a while? When I think of what the average North American woman eats during pregnancy, I'm sure their babies are not getting adequate nutrition either! If it happens that you need to go on the IBD Remission Diet during your pregnancy (or breastfeeding), then please post your story in as much detail as possible to my blog at: www.ListenToYourGut.com so that we can share information and other pregnant women can bene/f_it from your experience. /four.oldstyle/one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT IBS and IBD are conditions that are triggered by emotional and physical stress. Parenting an infant and toddler is probably the most stressful thing you will ever do in your life. THE PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL STRESS OF PARENTING Conception, pregnancy, breastfeeding and parenting provide special challenges for people with IBD or IBS, for several reasons. Firstly, IBS and IBD are conditions that are triggered by emotional and physical stress. Parenting an infant and toddler is probably the most stressful thing you will ever do in your life. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. I have traveled and worked around the globe, I've moved countries seven times, I've owned my own business(es) since I was /one.oldstyle/nine.oldstyle, been in car accidents, boat accidents, survived a hurricane (in a /two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle foot wooden boat), fought my way out of a date rape, etc., etc. I have been through a lot of stressful experiences in my life, but nothing compares to the stress of parenting. /T_his is because the early years (newborn - age /two.oldstyle or /three.oldstyle) o/f_ten involve excruci - ating sleep deprivation. Ongoing sleep-deprivation results in immune system suppression, hormonal/endocrine malfunction, physical and mental exhaustion, loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, and many lesser eects. For a strong, healthy person these rami/f_ications make life dicult. For people whose health is already compromised, ongoing sleep deprivation, combined with breastfeeding and daily chores, is devastating. Emotional Stress Next, is the emotional and mental stress of coping with an infant and toddler. Sure there is ongoing stress at all stages of parenting, but for someone with compromised health, the early years are de/f_initely the worst. /T_he parents I've seen who cope best with childcare are the people who are naturally high-energy and love running around all day. If you're this type of person by nature and you have the requisite energy, you'll have a much easier time of it. However, if you're more of an introspective, quiet person, who needs a fair amount of space and time alone - well, parenting is just going to wipe you out! /T_he emotional stress of wanting to provide the best possible care - for all levels of a developing human being - but being continually restricted by your physical health, can be wearing. It is also very dicult for a free and /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 unrestricted adult to suddenly become restricted in every way imaginable by this incredibly precious being who needs you (literally) all the time. Adjusting to this loss of freedom - and you almost need to develop new personality traits to cope eectively with your new reality - takes a fair bit of time and is very emotionally stressful. Financial Stress /T_hen you have to weigh up the additional /f_inancial stress. If you're in poor health and your brain is not functioning well (due to sleep deprivation), For people whose health is you're probably not going to make as much money as you usually would. already compromised, ongoing /T_hen, not only do you have the added costs of the physical needs of your sleep deprivation, combined with child, but you will also likely have added costs for additional childcare and breastfeeding and daily chores, home help. Unless you have outstanding family support - in the form of is devastating. either monetary or physical support - the added /f_inancial pressure is going to be quite stressful. Physical Stress Another source of physical stress during the early years, is the diculty of eating enough food to keep both you and your baby healthy. Why is it your infant always needs attention when you sit down to eat? If you're breastfeeding you not only have to eat (and absorb!) enough calories for yourself every day, but also for your baby. And God help you if you get a baby with a metabolism like my son Oscar's! I had to eat four meals per day, plus healthy snacks, just to maintain my weight. He fed (full feeds, both breasts) every hour or two, during the night, for the /f_irst six weeks. /T_hen for the next seven months, he fed every two to three hours. Boy, was I glad I had formulated Absorb Plus and could drink that in place of a regular meal! Also, many people with IBD or IBS are not able to eat or digest properly when stressed. My kids are two and /f_ive right now, and yesterday I had to get up (all for good reasons) seven times just during breakfast. During supper tonight I was up three times (for varying lengths of time) and because my throat constricts during times of stress, it took me almost two hours to eat my meal. Sometimes it's just so stressful trying to eat that I give up and just have an Absorb Plus shake instead. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Most normal parents rely substantially on take-out and fast food during the /f_irst two years of their child's life. This is because they are simply too exhausted to shop, plan meals, and prepare meals from scratch. Unfortunately, you will not have that option because you physically cannot eat processed food with toxic additives. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT /T_hen there are the diculties with food preparation itself. Most normal parents rely substantially on take-out and fast food during the /f_irst two years of their child's life. /T_his is because they are simply too exhausted to shop, plan meals, and prepare meals from scratch. Unfortunately, you will not have that option because you physically cannot eat processed food with toxic additives. So, in spite of your exhaustion and ill health, you'll still have to cook your meals from scratch every day. Today I have made four meals (actually three - my husband cooked one) because my kids have large appetites. If I tried to eat fast food pizza or hamburgers on a regular basis because I'm too tired to cook, I'd be ill in no time. Plus, knowing what I do about health and diet, I could never feed such low quality food to my kids every day anyway! So you're stuck. You'll have to cook nutritious, unprocessed meals from scratch, for both you and your kids, and that takes a fair amount of time and energy. You can reduce the load somewhat by buying frozen prepared meals at your organic grocer - but there's not a huge selection and this can get very expensive. If you have the funds, there are a growing number of personal chef services, who will deliver meals to you every week according to your dietary guidelines. Another option is to enlist the help of family and friends. If you have family members who can cook large meals (according to your tolerance/guidelines) and drop o the extra food to you, that can work well. If you're very organized you may be able to set up a 'cooking cooperative' with two or three other mothers/fathers where you each take turns cooking and make extra that the other families pick up close to dinnertime. But again, you'll have to /f_ind like-minded, health-conscious people who are willing to use quality ingredients and account for intolerances. It is also a very good idea to get into the habit of cooking in volume, when you do cook, and cooking foods that can be frozen. When I make soup, stew, or lasagne, for example, I make a huge amount and then freeze the extra in single serving portions. It's not that much extra work to make triple (or quintuple!) the amount of food, but it does take planning. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 Attachment Parenting So, here you have your physical health, which is substantially (if not primarily) triggered by stress, and you are entering into (or have already entered into) the most stressful period of your life! If you leave your baby/ child to cry themselves to sleep during the night, then you will probably avoid a good deal of the sleep deprivation and its subsequent stressors. For myself, I would never do that to my children. /T_he last thing I want to teach my kids is that they can cry and cry, and mummy never comes. I don't want to abandon my children emotionally to that kind of body/mind/spirit If I nurture my children with trauma and I don't want to teach them that they are alone in this world. If I compassion, then they will grow nurture my children with compassion, then they will grow to be nurturing, to be nurturing, compassionate compassionate people. We have to be the change we want to see in the people. We have to be the change world, and that begins in utero and continues for the rest of your child's life. we want to see in the world, and If you're going against the /f_low of western civilization by wanting to provide that begins in utero and continues deep levels of attachment, intimacy and security for your child, then Mothering magazine is a fantastic resource and source of encouragement. for the rest of your child's life. It's available in many organic grocery stores, or online at: www.mothering. com. Kindred (an Australian magazine) is another excellent resource with lots of online articles: www.KindredCommunity.com . You've already read in earlier chapters of this book about the physical consequences I've suered as a result of exhaustion and extended sleep deprivation. But I tell you, I revel in who my children are (their kindness, compassion, nurturing, intimacy, strength, charisma, fantastic health, joy in living, etc.) every day, and I don't regret a single sacri/f_ice. However, I sure wish someone had prepared me for the reality of childcare (as much as you can prepare someone who doesn't actually have children!) by outlining all the myriad stressors I would need to plan for - as I have done for you above. I'm also going to give you my advice as to what you need to have in place (or implement now) to minimize the deleterious eects of these stressors, as much as possible. Obviously, dierent people are going to have dierent levels of implementation for these suggestions due to their own belief system, support network and /f_inancial reality, but I'm going to give you my ideal and you can go from there. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson Remember that your needs are much greater than that of normal, healthy people, and you need to take extra care of yourself to avoid a /f_lare-up of symptoms. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Setting Up Your Home Help When you are still pregnant, line up at least three months of daily help following the birth of your baby (six months would be ideal). /T_his may seem like a lot to you, but remember that your needs are much greater than that of normal, healthy people and you need to take extra care of yourself to avoid a /f_lare-up of symptoms. If you can have help at night too, that would be ideal. About three months prior to the birth of my second child, Zara, I said to my mum, \"I need help for three months following the baby's birth, do you want to be that help, or should I hire someone? I'm /f_ine either way, but I need to know now so I have enough time to interview and choose someone if you don't want to do it.\" My mother chose to come and stay with us for three months and she also took Zara at night, bringing her into my room to feed and changing her diaper when necessary. /T_his took a huge load o me and greatly reduced the excruciating postnatal sleep deprivation. It also helped that Zara's metabolism is much slower than Oscar's, and she only needed to feed every three hours during the night. I also hired a cook/ housekeeper to come in three a/f_ternoons per week during the whole time my mum was there. If someone's helping you do nights, you can't expect that person (even if they're perfectly healthy) to have the energy to do all the cooking and cleaning during the day as well. So, make sure the help you set up for those /f_irst three months encompasses someone to at least do cooking, laundry, and clean the bathrooms and kitchen (these are the minimum essentials). You will also need to instruct your help in how to do their tasks (schedule this for /two.oldstyle - /three.oldstyle weeks before your due date), because it will be too stressful and exhausting to do this a/f_ter you've given birth. Your help can consist of any combination of husband/ partner, family members and paid help that may work for you. Don't expect yourself to be able to do anything other than recover from childbirth, nurse your baby, eat your meals, get out for a gentle walk each day, and spend quality time with your other children for the /f_irst three months. If you have other children, you'll need help arranged to look a/f_ter a lot of their physical needs as well, so you can keep your energy for looking a/f_ter their emotional and mental needs. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/four.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 A/f_ter that initial three month period, arrange for regular home help to assist with cooking, cleaning and occasional childcare until your baby is two years old. No, I am not kidding, and I am not being excessive. Even just three hours per day, /four.oldstyle - /five.oldstyle days a week will change your life. Also, get your husband/partner or other family member/friend to do your grocery shopping (grocery shopping with young children can be a very stressful event). Remember, if you want to preserve your health and avoid a /f_lare-up (where everyone loses, including your baby, husband/partner, and family), you're going to need a lot of help. You will not be able to parent your child You need to have a support properly if you are in the hospital, or unable to breastfeed. If you feel too structure in place so that you guilty to get this amount of help, then use EFT (see Chapter Six) to get have daily assistance with yourself over the guilt. You are not a normal, healthy person and you need cooking, cleaning and childcare a lot more help than most people/mothers around you. Accept this and you - otherwise, the overwhelming will have a chance at being able to care for and nurture your baby properly. physical and emotional stress will Remember that if your health goes, you will not be able to feed or nurture your child properly - so what's the point? Feel guilty, go into debt to pay for degrade your health and then it, ignore the sniping of others and do whatever it takes to get the help you everyone loses. What use is having need to keep yourself healthy. money in the bank, or being able It's also better to plan for more help than you think you'll need - because, to say 'we're debt-free!' when if you haven't had children before, it's unlikely you'll be able to anticipate you're in the hospital and can't the amount of help you're going to need (all new parents are absolutely breastfeed your own child? gobsmacked by how dicult and exhausting it is). If it turns out you don't need as much help as you arranged, then it's very easy to scale back. /T_he last thing you need to be doing with a newborn is interviewing and training new home help because you don't have enough - that would be very stressful! My friend Sarah in Hong Kong, who is perfectly robust and healthy, recently had her fourth child. Both she and her husband work for /f_inance companies and hold demanding, well-paid positions. /T_hey have no family members in the city - they're all in Europe. So she has two nannies and a full-time maid during the day. With the birth of her fourth child, she hired a night nanny as well - to do what my mother did for me. /T_his is a woman who has planned well for her extra needs, and this is probably one /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/five.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT of the reasons she remains strong and healthy! So if you think what I'm advocating is excessive or unrealistic, just remember her story. If you feel guilty about arranging help, remember the fact that Sarah has never had a serious illness in her life, and she was still smart enough to arrange enough help to ensure her good health and vitality would continue. But I Can't Aord It! Over and over again I've had other mothers comment on my housekeeper Notes: and say, \"/T_hat would be really nice, but we can't aord it.\" People routinely go into debt so they can build a bigger house, or renovate, buy a car, or go on a vacation. Compared to these things, isn't giving your child a foundation of health and security that will last their whole life, a much worthier reason to go into debt? Don't let /f_inancial excuses stop you from providing health, compassion, nurturing and security for your children and yourself. Nothing in life is more important than this. By choosing to have a child, I believe it is my responsibility to give that child the best emotional, physical and spiritual foundation I can. /T_his is hard for even normal parents to do. It will be doubly hard for you because your health is compromised right from the start and you have a susceptibility that normal, healthy people do not. If you don't have family who are willing to step in and help out, then you will have to pay for help - and you may even need to have some combination of family and hired help. Because of the extra demands of my health, I simply do not have the stamina and tolerance for stress that normal people do. It's like once you've had a bad knee injury, that knee is never going to be able to do the things that a healthy, non-injured knee can. You will always have to make special allowances for your knee. It's the same with your gut. Even though you may be perfectly healthy and strong when you get pregnant, your gut/health will not have the same tolerance level as that of someone who's never had a problem with their digestive system. So you need to be prepared. You need to have a support structure in place so that you have daily assistance with cooking, cleaning and childcare - otherwise, the overwhelming physical and emotional stress will degrade your health and then everyone loses. /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/six.oldstyle PREGNANCY & BREASTFEEDING CHAPTER 9 What use is having money in the bank, or being able to say 'we're debt-free!' when you're in the hospital and can't breastfeed your own child? What use is money in the bank, when your vulnerable, young children or babies are in daycare /one.oldstyle/two.oldstyle hours a day - having their core self formed by people who don't even love them? I read an article once where the author wrote something like, 'What does it say about us, when the richest country in the world cannot aord to raise its own children?' Another option is to ask for /f_inancial help from family members - if they It's also better to plan for more cannot, or don't want to, physically come over and help out. Don't let your help than you think you'll need guilt or pride stop you from asking for money to safeguard your health and - because, if you haven't had raise healthy, secure children. Present your case to your parents or other family member - let them know that you have extra needs and you can't children before, it's unlikely you'll carry the workload of a normal, healthy person. You're not asking for money be able to anticipate the amount of to enjoy a life of leisure, you're asking for money to keep you alive and help help you're going to need. you take care of your most precious little ones. Don't worry (for those of you feeling guilty), even with all the help I've outlined above, you will still be exhausted every day. But hopefully, you won't be ill. And you'll be able to provide for your children's physical, emotional and soul-level needs, without winding up in the hospital. Now, if you have the sense of self-worth and functionality necessary to move beyond survival (i.e. being exhausted every day, but not ill), then this is obviously ideal. However, since I'm only just beginning to approach that point myself, I don't feel quali/f_ied to write or give advice about it! But if you're already there, and you can set your life up to have actual 'ease' during these early childcare years (and why not!), then know that I'm admiring you and cheering you on with all my heart. Hopefully, this chapter (along with the rest of this program) has given you enough tools and encouragement to have a healthy, drug-free pregnancy. I have already received many thanks from readers who were told, or believed, they'd never be healthy enough to bear children, but with the tools in this program, they have. As I mentioned earlier, please feel free to share your stories, struggles, triumphs at my website: www.ListenToYourGut.com . /four.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/seven.oldstyle Now go to the Healing Journey Workbook and complete the section for Chapter Nine, if applicable.

It enables you to take the huge amount of information presented in the manual, and apply it directly to your situation. I suggest you print o the workbook and put it in a binder. /T_hen, if you need extra room to answer certain questions, you can just insert an extra blank page where needed. You may also /f_ind it useful to get some colored sticky tabs to mark pages or sections that you need to come back to at a later date. Some sections (Chapter Four, for example) will take a long time to complete, so it's useful to have tabs to mark the questions you need to come back to. In six months, or one year's time, you may want to print out the workbook again and /f_ill it in a second time, since your symptom pro/f_ile, environment and treatment priorities will likely have shi/f_ted. It's time to apply all this wonderful healing information to your own life. TREATMENT SUMMARIES /T_he Treatment Summaries folder contains three separate action plans that give you a step-by-step treatment plan for what you need to do to heal yourself. Some plans are more thorough and comprehensive than others. You can choose which plan to follow depending on your current motivation, energy, and time available. /one.oldstyle. Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan - This is the best plan to ensure whole body healing. It guides you through creating your unique, customized, Optimum Treatment Plan based on your answers in the Healing Journey Workbook . This is the best treatment plan of the three offered, since it is the most thorough plan, and completely customized to your specific needs. Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan presents you with the highest chance of success in implementing the healing protocols in this program. However, you need to have completed the Healing Journey Workbook in order to fill out this plan. /two.oldstyle. Jini's General Treatment Plan - If you haven't had time, or don't want to, complete the Healing Journey Workbook , then this plan contains a /four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/one.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan is the best treatment plan of the three offered, since it is the most thorough plan, and completely customized to your specific needs. summary of generalized treatments for each illness (IBS, diverticulosis, colitis, Crohn's). Using a General Treatment Plan is not as good as compiling your own, individualized Optimum Treatment Plan, but it is the next best thing. Don't forget to read through the Quick & Easy plan as well, to get additional ideas. /three.oldstyle. Jini's Quick & Easy Treatment Plan - This plan is a list of quick-action points, for those of you who don't have the time or energy to follow either the Optimum Treatment, or General Treatment plans. Even if you just implement the first item on this list, you'll see an improvement in your health. Once you see an improvement, maybe you'll then have the energy or motivation to implement one of the more comprehensive treatment plans. HEALTH ASSESSMENT & TRACKING TOOLS /T_he Health Assessment & Tracking Tools folder contains numerous dierent self-assessment tests that you can take to assess various aspects of your health. You'll be directed to take some of these tests at certain points throughout the Healing Journey Workbook to help you identify and compile your symptom lists. You may also /f_ind these tests useful to pinpoint other organs or systems in your body that need healing, but are beyond the scope of this book (e.g. nervous system, endocrine system, etc.). You can then address these health concerns with your naturopathic or holistic medical doctor. Again, you can perform these tests periodically (every three or six months) to help you track your progress and pinpoint areas that still need addressing. /T_his folder also contains two Symptom Tracking Charts that you can use to track your symptom progress and also evaluate which areas of your body still need healing. You'll be directed to use these Charts throughout the various Treatment Summaries. Also in this folder are numerous tools to assist you in tracking and implementing the dietary guidelines from Chapter /T_hree. /T_hey include a /four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/two.oldstyle HOW TO USE THE LISTEN TO YOUR GUT CD CHAPTER 10 Food Diary, Food Reintroduction Chart, and Quick Reference Guides for each of /T_he Healing Diets .

If you've already done that, then go straight to Jini's Optimum Treatment Plan (in the Treatment Summaries folder). If you are not able to complete the Healing Journey Workbook , or you need an interim plan to use whilst you're working your way through the Workbook, then go to Jini's General Treatment Plan (in the Treatment Summaries folder). If, for whatever reason, you're not able to implement any kind of comprehensive treatment plan, then go to Jini's Quick & Easy Treatment /four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/three.oldstyle Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Be kind and gentle with yourself, be patient. Give yourself the time and space that you need to implement change and heal yourself. Plan (in the Treatment Summaries folder), and just start with point /numbersign.oldstyle/one.oldstyle from the Quick-Action list. Your Healing Journey Begins My intent with this program has not been to overwhelm you, but rather to give you the tools and knowledge you need to take control of your life and health and begin the process of healing yourself. /T_he timeline for that healing is going to depend upon the severity of your condition, length of time the dis-ease or imbalance has been present in your body, environmental and relational factors blocking you from health, and the commitment with which you choose to pursue your healing. Also, as I've stated numerous times throughout this book, long-term healing involves healing all the aspects of your self - mental, emotional, spiritual and physical. /T_his program should provide you with the template for your physical healing, and hopefully has also been a springboard to motivate you and make you aware of the other levels of yourself that also need healing. As I mentioned at the beginning of this program, choose the area that's easiest for you to change/work on and start there. If all you do as a result of this book is point /numbersign.oldstyle/one.oldstyle from Jini's Top Ten Quick-Action Points - then great! You'll be better o than before and that's all that matters. Any change that we make for the better, is better than no change at all. So be kind and gentle with yourself, be patient. Give yourself the time and space that you need to implement change and heal yourself. Above all, love and accept yourself, seek out the joy in life and allow it to /f_low through you once again. /four.oldstyle/three.oldstyle/four.oldstyle Footnotes \u0003\u0003 Jini Patel Thompson LISTEN TO YOUR GUT Chapter One /one.oldstyle. \"Gut Feelings: The Surprising Link Between Mood and Digestion\" Emeran A.

B./one.oldstyle Excerpts from the article: \"/T_he nation's leading manufacturer of endoscopes has known for a decade that some scopes contain cavities inaccessible to cleaning by hand but has failed to /f_ix the oversight, said David Lewis, a University of Georgia research microbiologist who has conducted research for the federal Environmental Protection Agency on the issue of dirty endoscopes. /T_here is wide consensus that it is dicult to sterilize the devices, which can cost /dollar.oldstyle/two.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle,/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle each, without using temperatures so high that the scopes themselves become damaged. /T_he scopes have numerous cavities that are dicult to clean, even by hand, critics say.

He and other microbiologists advocate sterile disposable parts for endoscopes as well as the use of a condom-like sheath for each new patient. But they say manufacturers and health-care providers have resisted such solutions because of added costs.\" You can read the entire newspaper article at: http://www.sheller.com/NewsDetails.asp?NewsID=/two.oldstyle/two.oldstyle /four.oldstyle/six.oldstyle/four.oldstyle RESEARCH AND REFERENCES /two.oldstyle. /T_his next article highlights the ongoing debate over how exactly to eectively sterilize endoscopes (include bronchoscopes, sigmoidoscopes, colonoscopes, gastroscopes, etc.). /T_he sterilant most widely used for scopes which are damaged by high heat (and most are) is Gluteraldehyde. See the next article to see why Gluteraldehyde is NOT a good sterilant for the patient receiving a colonoscopy. \"Endoscope decontamination: Where do we go from Gluteraldehyde on colonoscopes (the residue le/f_t a/f_ter sterilization), can result in toxic colitis - symptoms within /four.oldstyle/eight.oldstyle hours of the colonoscopy included cramps and abdominal pain, tenesmus (painful, urgent straining to defecate), rectal bleeding and in some cases, hemorrhaging. Also, if you've been diagnosed with ischemic colitis, you may in fact Gluteraldehyde-induced toxic /four.oldstyle. Also important to note, is that Gluteraldehyde (the most commonly used disinfectant for endoscopes) is not very eective against mycobacterium (remember that Mycobacterium Avium Paratuberculosis has been detected in /nine.oldstyle/two.oldstyle-/one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of Crohn's patients - incidence varies between studies). /T_he normal amount of time a hospital immerses a colonoscope in Gluteraldehyde is /one.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle-/two.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle minutes. /T_his article shows that even a/f_ter /four.oldstyle/five.oldstyle minutes, mycobacterium still remained in four out of \"Mycobacteria glutaraldehyde: /five.oldstyle.

And this is where the frequent occurrence of human error, lack of time, lack of sta, etc. comes into play: \"High-level disinfection or \"sterilization\" /T_his article highlights the fact (in a TWO YEAR study) that whether manual or automated sterilization procedures were used, colonoscopes were more o/f_ten contaminated than gastroscopes or bronchoscopes: \"Evaluation of bacteriological contamination of gastrointestinal and pulmonary endoscopes a/f_ter cleaning and disinfection procedures\" by Duc D.L., Sing Mallaret M.R., /eight.oldstyle. /T_his study shows that following standard colonoscope sterilization procedures, /six.oldstyle/two.oldstyle./three.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the outside surfaces were still contaminated and /four.oldstyle/zero.oldstyle./three.oldstyle/percent.oldstyle of the channels were still contaminated with infectious bacteria.
