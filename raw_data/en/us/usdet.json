This manual includes a startup guide that walks you through key requirements and setup considerations plus documentation of all key tasks. Thanks again, and welcome! 8/24/23 2How to Use This Manual This reference manual was designed to support a variety of learners and roles at differen t stages . Maybe you took the training during enrollment, but now some time has passed and you're not sure where to begin. Or maybe you're a new hire thrust into supporting an existing COVID -19 program you know nothing about. Or maybe your provider location is introducing a new COVID -19 vaccine product and staff need training. This manual provides training or a refresher and serves as an electronic reference on the job. It includes everything you need to know to implement the COVID -19 Vaccination Program in your practice. Provider Organizations & Locations Multi -County Entities Local Health DepartmentsWho Will Benefit Bookmark or check back frequently. This manual is updated frequently to keep pace with the COVID -19 pandemic. 8/24/23 3Special Note for Providers You play a critical role in helping to end the COVID -19 pandemic. For patients, you are one of the most trusted sources of information when it comes to vaccines. Patients may have questions and concerns about COVID -19 vaccines. You can help them understand the importance of vaccination, provide your strong recommendation, and build confidence in vaccines. Strong vaccine confidence leads to more people getting vaccinated, which leads to fewer COVID -19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths. Thank you for the efforts you and your practice staff are making to keep California healthy. 8/24/23 4About the Program In December 2019, a new coronavirus known as SARS -CoV-2 was first detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, causing outbreaks of coronavirus disease (COVID -19) that then spread globally at a rapid pace. In response, the federal government established the COVID -19 Vaccination Program to purchase and distribute COVID -19 vaccines and ancillary kits at no cost to jurisdictions* and share clinical and operational guidance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focuses on learning about COVID -19 disease -how it spreads and affects people - sharing with Americans and the rest of the world what they 've learnedVaccine manufacturers provide specific administration, storage & handling, and clinical guidance for their products. California Department of Public Health shares guidance from manufacturers & CDC; partners with local health departments, multi -county entities, providers, retail pharmacies, long -term care facilities, rural health centers, and other partners to ensure vaccines are allocated and distributed equitably to all eligible Californians. Local health departments ensure vaccines are distributed equitably to health systems and hospitals, independent pharmacies, providers, and tribal communities within their jurisdictions. They also provide vaccine transport services for providers, schedule and conduct mass vaccination clinics, and monitor and adjust vaccination efforts to ensure residents in vulnerable areas have equitable access to COVID -19 vaccines. *Includes the 50 states; the District of Columbia; New York City, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands; and three independent countries in compacts of free association with the United States (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau).8/24/23 5Program Enrollment All COVID -19 vaccines in the United States have been purchased by the U.S. government for administration exclusively by providers enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccination Program. Provider organizations enroll and sign the CDC Provider Agreement in myCAvax. Key points are highlighted below. The provider Enrollment Kit provides more details. Vaccination Provider Agreement Providers must be legally authorized in your jurisdiction to administer vaccines. COVID -19 vaccines are 100% free for the patient. No administration fees, copays, or co - insurance can be charged. However, vaccination providers may seek reimbursement for vaccine administration fees. Staff must administer vaccines in accordance with all program requirements and recommendations , including those of CDC, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ,and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . Staff must store and handle COVID -19 vaccines according to CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit and COVID -19 Addendum to maintain the vaccine cold chain that protects vaccines. COVID -19 vaccine preparation differs among COVID -19 vaccine products and is different from that of routinely recommended vaccines. Therefore, vaccine preparation training is essential. Program & Vaccine Product Training All healthcare professionals must complete the required Program Training and COVID -19 Vaccine Product Training to ensure vaccines are stored, handled, administered, and managed correctly. Product training must be ongoing as new vaccines become available and recommendations evolve. Vaccination Reporting Sites must enroll in the California Immunization Registry (CAIR), record vaccine administration information into your organization's medical record system within 24 hours of administration, and report that information to CAIR within 72 hours. Sites must report inventory to VaccineFinder by the second Wednesday of each month. Healthcare providers are required to report certain adverse events related to COVID -19 vaccines to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), as well as all vaccine administration errors, regardless of whether the error led to an adverse event.

Vaccine Coordinator & Backup The onsite primary and backup Vaccine Coordinators (identified on Section B as Vaccine Coordinators) should be experts on your storage and handling protocols, and will complete and implement your vaccine management plan; receive and store vaccines, monitor storage unit temperatures, and manage vaccine inventory; monitor emails regarding vaccine orders, shipments, and temperature monitoring; may be delegated to report inventory to VaccineFinder; and ensure the location's providers and key practice staff complete the required vaccine product training. Email changes to this role to providercallcenter@cdph.ca.gov ; copy your Organization Vaccine Coordinator (or CEO or CMO). 8/24/23 15Determine Which Vaccine Products Your Location Will Offer The goal of the COVID -19 Vaccination Program is to provide vaccines at no cost to all eligible recipients who want to be vaccinated. All COVID -19 vaccines are ACIP - recommended for eligible populations and may be stored in routine refrigerators. Refer to FDA's Fact Sheets for HCPs for storage, administration, or clinical questions, or contact the Provider Call Center with questions.Startup Guide Small Orders When evaluating minimum order sizes, keep in mind that sites may request fewer doses if identified as small -order eligible by their local health department. Contact your local health department IZ Coordinator to see if you are eligible.Considerations: Which patient populations does your location serve? Which vaccine products are most requested by your patients?Available Products Refer to the COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for a list of available vaccine products, storage and handling requirements, minimum order sizes, NDCs, and more. 8/24/23 16Determine If Your Practice Will Redistribute Vaccines Redistribution is the routine transport of vaccines to additional clinic locations (e.g., for large organizations whose vaccines are shipped to a central depot and require redistribution to affiliated locations). Receiving locations must be affiliated COVID -19 provider locations covered under the Organization's CDC Provider Agreement (Section A). Prior approval by CDPH is required.Startup Guide Program Requirements There must be a signed CDC Supplemental COVID -19 Vaccine Redistribution Agreement for the facility/organization conducting redistribution and a fully completed CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Provider Profile Information form (Section B of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement) for each receiving vaccination location. (See CDC Agreement) Organization must preserve all records related to COVID -19 vaccine management for a minimum of 3 years. (Provider Agreement #7e) Key Points Sender must sign the CDC Redistribution Agreement and be authorized by CDPH to redistribute COVID -19 vaccines to affiliated locations. (See Before You Apply .) Sender must complete their Redistribution Vaccine Management Plan , which details their storage and handling and transport protocols that will be followed. Sender assumes full responsibility for ensuring receiving provider locations are covered under a signed CDC Provider Agreement (Section A), represented by a separate Provider Profile (Section B) form, and adhere to all program requirements. Sender must ensure validated cold -chain procedures are in place in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit and COVID -19 Addendum. Redistribution events must be reported in myCAvax within 24 hours of vaccine delivery. Temporary or pop -up clinic locations do not have to be enrolled separately if the permanent location of the provider (with the responsibility for transporting and administering vaccine for those clinics) has been enrolled. 8/24/23 17Determine If Your Practice Will Implement Standing Orders The use of standing orders for vaccination facilitates the delivery of immunization services to patients in clinics, hospitals, and community settings. Standing orders have been shown to increase vaccination coverage rates.Startup Guide What is a standing order? Standing orders authorize nurses, pharmacists, and other appropriately trained healthcare personnel to assess a patient's immunization status and administer without the need for clinician examination or direct order from the attending provider at the time of the interaction.Who recommends standing orders for vaccination? CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) specifically recommends standing orders for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations and several other vaccines (e.g., hepatitis B, varicella). Who is authorized to sign the standing orders? In general, standing orders are approved by a medical director in a healthcare setting, a physician, or another authorized practitioner. State law or regulatory agency might authorize other healthcare professionals to sign standing orders. Content quoted from Using Standing Orders for Administering Vaccines: What You Should Know .Templates for Standing Orders for Administering Vaccine : Comply with Administration & Clinical GuidanceStartup Guide 1. Strongly encourage vaccination for all eligible patients. 2. Prepare clinicians to comply with ACIP recommendations and CDC's Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of COVID -19 Vaccines . 3. Prepare clinicians and vaccinators to comply with FDA's EUA Fact Sheets for HCPs . 4. Determine how Fact Sheets for Recipients & Caregivers will be distributed in your location: paper electronicAll COVID -19 vaccines are ACIP -recommended. As vaccines are authorized, FDA publishes Fact Sheets for Healthcare Providers and Recipients & Caregivers; ACIP reviews submitted clinical data and makes its recommendations; and CDC reviews and may adopt recommendations. Finally, Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup issues its recommendations. Organizations must comply with all guidance. Program Requirements Organization must administer COVID -19 vaccine in accordance with all requirements and recommendations of CDC and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). (Provider Agreement #1) Before administering COVID -19 vaccine, Organization must provide an approved Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) fact sheet or vaccine information statement (VIS), as required, to each vaccine recipient, the adult caregiver accompanying the recipient, or other legal representative. (P .A. #5) Organization must report any adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (1 -800-822-7967 or http://vaers.hhs.gov/contact.html ).

Download CMA's COVID -19 Vaccine Reimbursement Quick Guide . 2. See Billing & Reimbursement for more details. 3. Never turn away recipients due to inability to pay administration fees or coverage status; update protocols as needed.Providers must administer COVID -19 vaccine regardless of recipient's ability to pay vaccine administration fees or coverage status. Providers may seek appropriate reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID -19 vaccine administration fees for the vaccine recipient, but may not seek any reimbursement, including through balance billing, from the vaccine recipient. Donations are also not allowed to be accepted. 8/24/23 20Review CDC's Pandemic Guidance The COVID -19 pandemic has caused healthcare providers to change how they provide essential services to patients. CDC has issued interim guidance to reduce transmission of SARS -CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19, in a variety of clinical settings.Startup Guide How to d eliver vaccines safely during the COVID -19 pandemic Administration of vaccines is an essential medical service. Assess the vaccination status of all patients across the life span at every healthcare visit. Administer routinely recommended vaccines to children, adolescents, and adults (including pregnant people). COVID -19 vaccines may be coadministered with other vaccines - on the same day, as well as within 14 days of each other. Follow this guidance to prevent the spread of COVID -19 in healthcare settings. Encourage vaccination at the patient's medical home. Implement effective strategies to keep patients up to date on vaccinations. Communicate with patients or families about how they can be safely vaccinated during the pandemic. Review CDC's Guidance for Immunization Services during the Pandemic to reduce transmission of SARS -CoV-2 in your practice or clinic. Program Requirements Organization's COVID -19 vaccination services must be conducted in compliance with CDC's Guidance for Immunization Services During the COVID -19 Pandemic for safe delivery of vaccines. (Provider Agreement #6) 8/24/23 21Determine How Your Practice Will Maintain COVID -19 Records Providers are required to maintain all paper and electronic records related to the COVID -19 Vaccination Program for a minimum of three years and, upon request, make these records available for review.Startup Guide Sample paper or electronic records that must be maintained Vaccine ordering records COVID -19 vaccine or ancillary product packing slips redistribution, t ransfer, and trans port logs temperature logs and electronic data logger temperature data files certificates of calibration testing (for data loggers) billing records vaccine administration records (including medical records of vaccine administration) any other COVID -19 related records Program Requirements Organization must preserve the record for at least 3 years following vaccination, or longer if required by state, local, or territorial law.

Storage units must be properly serviced to maintain required temperatures. Refer to the COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for a list of vaccine products and their storage requirements.Startup Guide Program Requirements Organization must comply with CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management. Those requirements include the following: a) Organization must store and handle COVID -19 vaccine under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with the manufacturer's package insert and CDC guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , which will be updated to include specific information related to COVID -19 vaccine. b) Organization must monitor vaccine storage unit temperatures at all times using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit ; c) Organization must comply with each relevant jurisdiction's immunization program guidance for dealing with temperature excursions; d) Organization must monitor and comply with COVID -19 vaccine expiration dates. (Provider Agreement #7A -D) Purpose -built or pharmaceutical -grade units are recommended Commercial or household standalone units are acceptable If necessary, combination units may be used but frozen vaccines must be stored in a standalone freezer Temperatures must be monitored by data loggers to ensure vaccines are stored in recommended temperaturesNever store vaccines in freezer compartment of household -grade combination unit Never store any vaccine in a dormitory - style or bar -style combined refrigerator/freezer unit 8/24/23 32Set Up Storage Unit and Data Logger Each site must have proper storage and monitoring equipment that is set up correctly. This equipment protects patients from inadvertently receiving compromised vaccine and protects your facility against costs of revaccinating patients and losing patient confidence in your practice. This requirement has several steps.Startup Guide Estimate storage needs for vaccines & ancillary kits. For product or ancillary kit details including supplies and vial tray or outer carton dimensions, please refer to CDC's COVID -19 Vaccine Product Information Guide , which is updated as new products are authorized. Protect your storage unit's power supply. Plug in only one storage unit per electrical outlet to avoid triggering a safety switch that turns power off Use safety -lock plug or outlet cover to prevent unit from being unplugged Post \"DO NOT DISCONNECT\" signs on outlets and circuit breakers for vaccine storage unitsAvoid using Built -in circuit switches (may have red reset buttons) * multioutlet power strips * outlets that can be activated by a wall switch * If these must be used, make sure the power strip is rated to carry the maximum current as specified by the manufacturer of the refrigerator or freezer. Contact the storage unit manufacturer for any additional questions or guidance regarding circuit switches, power strips, or surge protection.Even with appropriate equipment and temperature monitoring practices in place, power disruption can result in destruction of your entire vaccine supply. 8/24/23 33Set Up Storage Unit and Data Logger (Cont.)Startup Guide Organize & label shelf space or baskets. Organize storage units so staff can locate the correct vaccine product to reduce errors caused by inadvertent administration of products with similar cap colors or vial labels or close in age indicators. adult 8/24/23 34Set Up Storage Unit and Data Logger (Cont.)Startup Guide Set up and install your data logger. CDC requires that COVID -19 vaccines be monitored with data loggers at all times. For accurate ultra -cold temperature monitoring, your data logger must use an air - probe or probe designed specifically for ultra - cold temperatures. To ensure you are notified if temperatures drift outside recommended ranges, configure device alarm settings carefully (see Data Logger Setup & Use ). Always use devices with a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing . If feasible, keep an extra device on hand for vaccine transport or in case your primary device fails. Place buffered probe in center of storage unit near vaccines and secure vertically to prevent leakage and inaccurate readings (see proper probe placement ). Place digital display where it can be easily read Set to record every 30 minutes or less so you can respond promptly to alerts Set HI & LO alarm limits to reflect recommended temperatures for COVID -19 vaccines you're storing Be sure device is recording storage unit temperatures buffered probedigital displayrecording temperatures 8/24/23 35Set Up Storage Unit and Data Logger (Cont.)Startup Guide Start recording storage unit temperatures. Before using a unit for vaccine storage: Set storage unit temperatures to the recommended range for COVID -19 vaccines. Monitor and record temperatures twice daily for several days. Record your data logger's CURRENT, MIN, and MAX readings on your temperature log, or use this COVID -19 temperature log .

Managing Vaccine Inventory Efforts to vaccinate your patients fall short if your inventory is not managed to ensure vaccine potency and removal of expired vaccine. Thi s section prepares you to protect the cold chain in or out of the clinic, and to manage expiration dates to ensure expired vaccine is not inadvertently administered. Audience Vaccine Coordinators About Inventory Management Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures Reporting Temperature Excursions Managing E xpiration & Beyond -Use Dates About Wastage & Missed Vaccination Opportunities Reporting & Disposal of Nonviable Doses Reporting Inventory to VaccineFinder Transporting Vaccine Redistributing Vaccine Transferring Vaccine 8/24/23 88Managing Vaccine Inventory About Inventory Management Never miss a vaccination opportunity because of fear of vaccine wastage! Manage your inventory to maximize vaccinations, protect vaccine potency, and minimize wastage where possible \u2014but don't turn away potential recipients to avoid puncturing a vial at the end of the day! Inventory Checklist Once you get into a routine, inventory management tasks will quickly become part of your practice protocols to protect vaccines and minimize patient revaccination. Tasks fall into four broad categories. Use this checklist to get started. Cold Chain: Store vaccine under recommended temperatures at all times; record temperatures twice daily and report any temperature excursions in myCAvax. Expiration Dates: Rotate vaccine weekly and whenever a new shipment arrives so that vaccines soon to expire are stored up front to be used first; check inventory routinely and remove any expired vaccine. Need to lookup an expiration date? Use expiry lookup tools for Janssen Moderna | Novavax | Pfizer -BioNTech . Nonviable Doses: Report doses spoiled, expired, or wasted in myCAvax and dispose of nonviable vaccines following practice protocols. Inventory: Report updated inventory to VaccineFinder, including new shipments, nonviable vaccine removed from inventory, and vaccine redistribution and transfers. 8/24/23 89Managing Vaccine Inventory Monitoring Storage Unit Temperatures Record storage unit temperatures at the beginning and end of the clinic day. Accurate and consistent temperature monitoring is a critical task. If temperatures drift out of range in the afternoon but aren't discovered until the next day, your entire vaccine supply may be wasted. Program Requirements Organization must comply with CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management. Those requirements include the following: Organization must store and handle COVID -19 vaccine under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with the manufacturer's package insert and CDC guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, which will be updated to include specific information related to COVID -19 vaccine; Organization must monitor vaccine storage unit temperatures at all times using equipment and practices that comply with guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit; (Provider Agreement #7a and b) Temperature Logs Record data logger's current, MIN, and MAX readings twice daily on your temperature logs for refrigerated, frozen, or ultra -cold vaccines, or use this COVID -19 Temperature Log . (VFC Providers: Use blended logs .) Post logs on storage units to prevent recording errors. Keys to Success Ensure staff are trained to record storage unit temperatures properly and report temperature excursions immediately. Ensure staff are trained to operate your data loggers and download any temperature data file in the event of an excursion; refer to your device's product guide. Some devices must be cleared (MIN/MAX and alarm symbol) after each recording to ensure staff don't record previous readings again; check your device's product guide. Train staff not to ignore alarm alerts; if temperature alarms go off repeatedly, do not disconnect the alarm until it has been confirmed as a false alarm. Supervisors should plan to review logs to ensure staff understand how to record temperatures, record twice daily, and respond to all out -of-range temperatures. 8/24/23 90Managing Vaccine Inventory Reporting Temperature Excursions Vaccine Coordinators may report excursions in myCAvax. If temperatures drift out of recommended ranges, immediately label vaccines DO NOT USE and contact the manufacturer to determine if vaccines are okay to administer. Program Requirements Organization must comply with CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management. Those requirements include the following: Organization must comply with each relevant jurisdiction's immunization program guidance for dealing with temperature excursions; (Provider Agreement #7C) Organization must preserve all records related to COVID -19 vaccine management for a minimum of 3 years, or longer if required by state, local, or territorial law. (P .A. #7E) What's a Temperature Excursion? Any temperature outside manufacturer -recommended ranges is considered a temperature excursion and may spoil vaccines. A temperature excursion triggers a visual or audible alarm or alert depending on the data logger. Staff will need to confirm when the excursion occurred and its duration. There may be multiple temperature excursions overnight or over weekend. What's a Temperature Data File? Your device may have a temperature data file that must be downloaded to get the data that manufacturers will need to determine whether vaccines may be administered. The manufacturer's determination is only as accurate as the data you provide.myCAvax 8/24/23 91myCAvaxManaging Vaccine Inventory Vaccine Stability Determination Contact the vaccine manufacturer to determine if vaccines stored in storage units may be used after exposure to out -of-range temperatures .

Save data files for 3 years.1Clear MIN/MAX and any alarm symbol to ensure staff don't respond to previous alerts during the next recording. How to Report Temperature Excursions Vaccine Coordinators may report excursions in myCAvax. If an alarm goes off, take action immediately to determine if vaccines may be used then report the temperature excursion.myCAvaxManaging Vaccine Inventory 2Label exposed vaccines DO NOT USE and alert your Vaccine Coordinator or supervisor that vaccines may have been damaged. Report temperature excursions in myCAvax. 6 Do not administer vaccines without the manufacturer's determination. If vaccines are not okay to use, report and dispose of nonviable doses . 7Instructions Make sure your data logger is recording storage unit temperatures. 8 8/24/23 93Managing Vaccine Inventory Managing Expiration & Beyond -Use Dates Managing your vaccine inventory to ensure that vials soon to expire are used first helps to minimize vaccine wastage; removing expired vaccine immediately prevents inadvertent administration errors than may require patient revaccination. Program Requirements Organization must comply with CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management. Those requirements include the following: Organization must monitor and comply with COVID -19 vaccine expiration dates. (Provider Agreement #7D) Beyond -Use (Use -By) Dates Vaccines may have a shortened beyond -use date (BUD), which replaces the expiration date. Always discard vaccine after the earlier of the expiration or beyond -use date. Before First Puncture: Manufacturer -shortened expiration dates may apply if storing unpunctured vials under conditions other than coldest recommended temperatures. Apply CDC's vaccine -specific BUD tracking labels so vaccines aren't used past these reduced limits. After Puncture: All COVID -19 vaccines are packaged in multidose vials, which have use -by date after puncture. Label vial with puncture date/time so vaccine is not used after this time limit. See COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for storage limits before and after puncture.Expiration Dates For COVID -19 vaccines, expiration dates may not be printed on the vial and may change as more stability data become available. Never administer expired vaccine. To check dates: Janssen: Scan QR code on outer carton, check online , or call 800 -565-4008. Moderna: Scan QR code on vial or carton or check online . Novavax: Check online . Pfizer -BioNTech: Check online . 8/24/23 94Do not administer expired vaccine. Strictly comply with vaccine manufacturer guidance on expiration and beyond -use (use -by) date/time limits. 42As expiration dates draw near, check for extensions using Moderna | Novavax | Pfizer -BioNTech expiry lookup tools; label product with updated expiration dates to prevent errors. 1Rotate vaccines weekly and whenever a new shipment arrives to ensure vaccines soon to expire are used first. How to Manage Expiration DatesManaging Vaccine Inventory IMMEDIATELY remove vaccine after the earlier of the expiration or use-by date to prevent inadvertent administration errors.5Instructions 3If unable to use vaccines before expiration, report doses to myCAvax Vaccine Marketplace (well before expiration) for redistribution to other locations. myCAvax Report expired vaccine in myCAvax then dispose of COVID -19 vaccines following manufacturer recommendations and practice protocols. Update VaccineFinder to reflect updated quantities.6myCAvaxRotate vaccine stock regularly to reduce wastage and remove expired vaccine immediately to prevent inadvertent administration. 8/24/23 958/24/23Managing Vaccine Inventory About Wastage & Missed Vaccination Opportunities Never miss a vaccination opportunity because of fear of vaccine wastage! Do your best to follow clinical and inventory management best practices to maximize vaccinations and minimize dose wastage where possible. Key Points Vaccine wastage is expected, may be unavoidable, and may even increase because more providers, including smaller provider sites, are now receiving vaccine; vaccine continues to be available only as multi -dose vials; and vials must often be punctured without using the full number of doses on the vial label. Never Miss a Vaccination Opportunity Vaccinate every eligible person who presents at a vaccination site \u2014even if it means puncturing a vial at the end of the day - to increase vaccination coverage by up to 20% . Tips: Vaccinate family members or friends who accompany patients even if they are not established patients at the practice. Arrange vaccination events with employers or other partners with large networks.Punctured vials must be used within: 12 hours Moderna 6M -5Y Tips to Reduce Wastage Post excess or soon -to-expire doses to the Vaccine Marketplace so your LHD can redistribute vaccine to other providers. Work with your LHD in advance to determine thresholds for the number of vials in danger of being wasted. Coordinate the number of vials needed with the anticipated number of patients when preparing for daily clinics to reduce over - thawing of vaccine. Follow guidance in CDC Toolkit to reduce waste in vaccine storage, transport, handling, and administration . For infants & toddlers: The State has received all doses it will get due to lower vaccination rates in California . Here are tips to best use what's left on hand: Schedule younger patients on the same day when possible to maximize vaccinations and reduce waste. Post excess doses to Vaccine Marketplace so other providers can use them. 96Managing Vaccine Inventory Reporting & Disposal of Nonviable Doses Vaccine Coordinators may report nonviable doses in myCAvax. Remove spoiled, expired, or wasted vaccines from storage unit immediately. Do not return vaccines to manufacturer or McKesson. Report updated inventory to VaccineFinder . Program Requirements Organization must report the number of doses of COVID -19 vaccine and adjuvants that were unused, spoiled, expired, or wasted as required by the relevant jurisdiction. (Provider Agreement #8) Organization must comply with all federal instructions and timelines for disposing of COVID -19 Vaccine and adjuvant, including unused doses. (Provider Agreement #9) myCAvax Spoiled Vaccine Report doses as spoiled if manufacturers determine vaccines were exposed to out -of-range temperatures and may not be used. Vaccines could spoil as a result of these conditions: data logger indicates that storage unit temperatures are out of the recommended range storage unit temperatures were not monitored as required Vaccines were not stored properly upon receipt vaccines spoiled during transfer natural disaster, power outage, or mechanical failure Consistent and accurate temperature monitoring minimizes spoilage. Expired Vaccine Report doses expired if past the earlier of the expiration or beyond -use (use -by) date as identified in product EUA fact sheet. Careful and consistent vaccine management minimizes expired vaccines. Disposal of Nonviable COVID -19 Vaccines Report nonviable doses in myCAvax before disposing of vaccine following local regulations and practice protocols for disposing of regulated medical waste. Janssen, Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer : These vaccines may be disposed of in a pharmaceutical waste container, or a comingled pharmaceutical/Sharps waste container. 8/24/23 97Managing Vaccine Inventory Reporting & Disposal of Nonviable Doses (Cont.) myCAvax Wasted Vaccine Report doses as wasted and dispose of as a result of these conditions: vaccine was deauthorized by FDA (e.g., Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer monovalent including Comirnaty); use \"Other\" option to add comment that product is deauthorized) punctured vials are past the use -by date/time limits unable to draw the maximum doses printe d on the vial label because low dead -volume needles/syringes were not available; any remaining unused doses will be identified as waste (never pool vaccine from multiple vials to make a single dose) vaccines were drawn into the syringe but not administered vaccines in open vials were not administered by vaccine's use -by limits vials are damaged (e.g., due to a drop causing damage to vial integrity or sterility) vaccines are lost or unaccounted, unable to draw a dose in vial (see below) Vaccine Coordinators may report nonviable doses in myCAvax. Remove spoiled, expired, or wasted vaccines from storage unit immediately. Do not return vaccines to manufacturer or McKesson. Report updated inventory to VaccineFinder . Careful vaccine management and administration should minimize wasted vaccines. 8/24/23Maximum Doses per Vial CDC defines the maximum doses that would be reported as waste per vial. If a vial meets the criteria for wastage, report any unused doses up to these maximum amounts: Moderna Bivalent 6M+ (Dark Blue Cap) : 5 doses (count all doses as adult) Moderna Bivalent 6M -5Y (Dark Pink Cap): Don't report if 2 doses withdrawn All other COVID -19 vaccine products: number of doses on vial label Medical Waste Management Reminder: All providers should be registered as waste generators either through their Local Enforcement Agency or CDPH, depending on their county (see guidance ).Providers under state jurisdiction can contact CDPH for MWMP .Providers under the jurisdiction of a Local Enforcement Agency can find contacts here . 98Managing Vaccine Inventory Reporting Doses On Hand to VaccineFinder Providers report COVID -19 vaccine inventory to VaccineFinder at least monthly by thesecond Wednesday of each month once initial shipments arrive. Weekly reporting is not required when inventory is depleted; automated reminder emails will stop once inventory is zeroed out in VaccineFinder. (See the Startup Guide for VaccineFinder registration details.) Program Requirements Organization must report the number of doses of COVID -19 vaccine and adjuvants that were unused, spoiled, expired, or wasted as required by the relevant jurisdiction. (Provider Agreement #8) Providers must report COVID -19 vaccine supply levels at least weekly by close of business on Fridays. Reporting for Pharmacies Report using the PIN (state or federal PIN) associated with your vaccine orders. Exceptions: Pharmacies with federally and state -allocated doses report under federal PIN only Pharmacies reporting centrally report under federal PIN only Reporting for Community Health Centers (HRSA) Report federally allocated inventory to CDC's Provider Order Portal (VPOP) using federal PINs. Report state -allocated doses to VaccineFinder using state PINs. 8/24/23 998/24/23Managing Vaccine Inventory Reporting Doses On Hand to VaccineFinder (Cont.) Locations must begin reporting COVID -19 vaccine inventory to VaccineFinder at least monthly by the second Wednesday of each month once shipments arrive.

Total transport time alone, or transport plus clinic workday, should not exceed 8 hours, or manufacturer's guidance if it is different. Transport equal amounts of vaccines, diluents, and ancillary supplies. Transporting punctured vials is not recommended; if necessary, transport time counts towards use -by limits; follow U.S. Pharmacopeia COVID -19 Vaccine Toolkit for guidance; do not transport punctured vials from one provider to another, or across state lines. Monitor temperatures using a data logger and report temperature excursions in transit.Managing Vaccine Inventory Transporting Vaccine Do not ship vaccines. Vaccines should not be routinely transported. If necessary, transport vaccines following guidelines in CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit using appropriate packing materials that provide the maximum protection. Refer to CDC's emergency transport guidance as needed. Program Requirements Organization must comply with CDC requirements for COVID -19 vaccine management. Those requirements include the following: Organization must store and handle COVID -19 vaccine under proper conditions, including maintaining cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times in accordance with the manufacturer's package insert and CDC guidance in CDC's Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit , which will be updated to include specific information related to COVID -19 vaccine.

If necessary, transport vaccines following guidelines in CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit using appropriate packing materials that provide the maximum protection. Refer to CDC's emergency transport guidance as needed. Transport Equipment Vaccines may be transported using a portable vaccine refrigerator and a data logger (or qualified containers and pack out). CDC does not recommend transporting ultra -frozen vaccine; if necessary, use a portable ULT freezer that can maintain a temperature of -80\u00b0 C. Qualified Container & Pack -out These products are specifically designed for use when packing vaccines for transport. For example, PCM (see below) refrigerated or frozen vaccine transport container. Soft -sided containers specifically engineered for vaccine transport are acceptable. IMPORTANT: Hard -sided insulated container or Styrofoam may only be used in emergencies and in conjunction with the Packing Vaccines for Transport during Emergencies tool. Coolants for Transport Phase change materials (PCMs) at 4 \u00b0C to 5 \u00b0C (39 \u00b0F to 41 \u00b0F) may be used to maintain proper temperatures. Follow manufacturer's instructions to reduce risk of out -of-range temperatures during transport. Do not use frozen gel packs or coolant packs from original shipments. Digital Data Loggers Vaccine transport containers must be monitored using a data logger that meets specifications in CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit and has a current and valid Certificate of Calibration Testing. For ultra -low-temperature transport, use a device with an air -probe or a probe designed specifically for ultra -cold temperatures. 8/24/23 102Managing Vaccine Inventory Beyond -Use/Expiration Dates by Transport OptionManaging Vaccine Inventory Transporting Vaccine (Cont.)

Complete as much of the Vaccine Transport Log as you can. Set up the data logger using the vendor user guide or video. Transport equal amounts of vaccines, diluents, and ancillary supplies (e.g., record cards and PPE).4 Upon arrival, store vaccines properly according to manufacturer recommendations. Confirm that vaccines were not exposed to out -of-range temperatures; report any temperature excursions immediately. Record temperatures upon arrival on your trans port log .53 Remove vaccines from storage unit and pack for transport. Remove vials quickly but carefully. Complete the t ransport log including temperatures prior to transport. (Vaccine may have QR code to identify lot numbers and expiration dates.) Consider the Vaccine Transport Time Tracker if vaccines will be stored for off -site clinics. Ensure the data logger is set up and recording temperatures. Insert transport log into transport container before sealing. Drive (don't ship) vaccines to the destination location.1 Determine how many vaccine vials will be transported. How to Transport VaccineManaging Vaccine Inventory InstructionsRefer to CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit for detailed guidance. Ideally, limit total transport and clinic time combined to a maximum of 8 hours or follow manufacturer guidance if it differs. 8/24/23 104Managing Vaccine Inventory Redistributing Vaccines Redistribution is the routine transport of vaccines to additional clinic locations. Receiving locations must be affiliated COVID -19 provider locations covered under the Organization's CDC Provider Agreement. Prior approval by CDPH is required. Key Points Sender must hav e a signed CDC Redistribution Agreement and completed Redistribution Vaccine Management Plan. (See Determine If Your Practice Will Redistribute Vaccines .) Do not redistribute COVID -19 vaccines to any location not covered under a signed CDC Provider Agreement (Section A) and represented by a separate Provider Profile (Section B) form. Coordinate with receiving locations to redistribute only quantities that are needed. Only redistribute vaccines once from the primary shipping location to secondary sites. Do not redistribute punctured multi -dose vials to another provider or across state lines. Sender Vaccine Coordinator must report redistribution events in myCAvax within 24 hours of vaccine delivery; report must indicate if vaccines were exposed to a temperature excursion in transit. Sender and receiving location must ensure updated inventory counts are reflected in their reporting to VaccineFinder. Keep all documents for three years.

(P .A. #12) 8/24/23 110Key Points Refe r to the Patient Visit Checklist to incorporate these key steps into practice protocols: Screen recipients (using My Turn or the CDC checklist ) for contraindications and precautions before administration. Administer doses per authorized intervals, including any additional doses as recommended. (See COVID -19 Vaccine Timing by Age & Spanish | Timing for 2nd Doses | Everyone Could Use a Boost .) Strongly recommend COVID -19 and flu vaccines if eligible. Dispel misinformation (flyer). COVID -19 vaccines may be administered without regard to timing of other vaccines ; use these coadministration tips to help patients catch up and stay up to date . Distribute EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients (paper or electronic) BEFORE administration. Carefully read vial labels. DO NOT RELY ON CAP COLOR. Observe recipient for 15 minutes (30 minutes for history of allergic reactions or contraindications; monitor and respond to potential anaphylaxis ). Report any moderate to severe adverse events to VAERS . Distribute completed (or updated) vaccination record cards (i.e., manufacturer, dosage, lot number, date) to each recipient for doses administered; complete second card when full and staple cards together. (Shred \u2014don't return \u2014excess cards that can't be used. Recommend v-safe (for check -in and next -dose reminder) and Digital COVID -19 Vaccination Record . Report administration data daily using My Turn or EHR/EMR connected to CAIR2/RIDE; request recipient mobile number and email required for digital vaccination record. Dispose of residual vaccine/diluent per practice protocols and report nonviable vaccine . Administer vaccine at no out -of-pocket cost to the recipient; refer to CMA's Reimbursement Guide and the billing section for billing for administration fees.The Big Picture (Cont.) Vaccinate every eligible person! Incorporate these steps into practice protocols to ensure recipients are informed of products administered and leave with proof of vaccination and next appointments scheduled .

This guide addresses training issues and setup required to support new pediatric vaccine products.Patient Visit See Age Transitions and Interchangeability . 8/24/23 112Key Points Follow Vaccine Administration Checklist to minimize administration errors and revaccination. Prepare dose immediately before administration if practical to minimize vaccine wastage and exposure to out -of-range temperatures. Read labels carefully. Vaccine vials may have similar cap colors. Check expiration dates of vaccines (and diluents, if applicable) before preparation; never administer vaccine past the earliest of the expiration or use -by date. Prepare vaccines in a clean, designated medication area away from any potentially contaminated items. If coadministering with routine vaccines , consider establishing separate stations for mixing or drawing vaccine into syringes to avoid medication errors. Predrawn syringes should be labeled with name of vaccine, dosage (amount), exact beyond - use date/time, lot number, and initials of preparer. Prepare vaccines (e.g., thawing, mixing, drawing) according to manufacturer requirements and CDC guidance. (Refer to EUA Fact Sheets on next page .) Double check vial to determine if vaccine needs to be reconstituted and confirm diluent amount. (See COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for a summary chart.) Use low dead volume (LDV) syringes/needles (included in kits) when possible to maximize number of doses withdrawn from each vial. Never draw more doses than indicated by the EUA fact sheet. Always label punctured vials and syringes with the name of the vaccine and expiration or beyond -use date/time and discard once the beyond -use date/time has been reached. Report and dispose of expired or residual vaccine in a multidose vial (or diluent vial if applicable) when there's not enough for a full dose. Never combine partial doses to make a full dose.Vaccine Preparation Proper preparation and administration help to ensure patients receive sufficient protection after vaccination and minimize revaccination efforts due to administration errors. Patient Visit 8/24/23 113Vaccine Preparation (Cont.) Proper preparation and administration help to ensure patients receive sufficient protection after vaccination and minimize revaccination efforts due to administration errors. Refer to the Vaccine Administration Checklist .Patient Visit Special Circumstances Large throughput settings: It may be necessary to predraw vaccine into syringes to support a fast - paced workflow. Predraw doses that can be administered prior to the use -by date/time in a mass vaccination clinic. Ensure the maximum time allowed for keeping the vaccine at room temperature is observed. Outdoor settings: Pay close attention to the pace of the workflow so that vaccines can be moved into room temperature for protection if needed and the quantity of syringes that are predrawn adjusted accordingly. Shield predrawn syringes from direct sunlight at all times. Vaccine should be predrawn in quantities that can be administered prior to beyond -use date/time. (See Hosting Temporary, Satellite, and Off -Site Clinics .) EUA Fact Sheets for HCPs Caregivers Moderna Novavax Pfizer -BioNTech 8/24/23 114Key Points Follow Vaccine Administration Checklist to minimize administration errors and revaccination. Always check labels, dosage, and expiration or beyond -use dates (as noted in the EUA) before administering vaccine (see COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for summary chart). If more than one vaccine is being administered, consider separating recipients by vaccine type in clearly designated waiting lines/areas, with separate administration stations for each vaccine type, to prevent medication errors. Always use proper hand hygiene between vaccine recipients. Always use new needles and syringes for each vaccine recipient injection. Use age, weight, gender, and location are used to determine needle selection. (See CDC Needle Gauge and Length .) Verify vaccine recipient information (i.e., name and date of birth) so vaccine is administered to the correct recipient. Administer COVID -19 vaccines at a 90 -degree angle (intramuscularly or \"IM\") in the deltoid muscle of the arm (preferred) or vastus lateralis muscle of the anterolateral thigh.Vaccine Administration Vaccine must be administered in accordance with product -specific requirements and clinical guidance from CDC and the respective manufacturer. Patient Visit Program Requirements Organization must administer COVID -19 vaccine in accordance with all requirements and recommendations of CDC and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

(P .A. #12) 8/24/23 115Vaccine Administration (Cont.) Vaccine must be administered in accordance with product -specific requirements and clinical guidance from CDC and the respective manufacturer. Refer to the Vaccine Administration Checklist . Patient Visit Key Points (Cont.) Use these tips to help ease anxiety during vaccination. Follow your practice protocol for vaccine and diluent disposal. Report and dispose of expired or residual vaccine in a multidose vial (or diluent vial if applicable) when there's not enough for a full dose. Never combine partial doses to make a full dose. Inform recipients of any administration errors and respond following this guidance . Regarding Adverse Events Providers should observe COVID -19 vaccine recipients following vaccination for a minimum of 15 minutes or 30 minutes if the recipient has a history of an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a vaccine or injectable therapy or a history of anaphylaxis due to any cause. CDC encourages all providers to keep the necessary supplies to treat anaphylaxis immediately available. COVID -19 vaccination providers are required to report moderate and severe adverse events to VAERS . 8/24/23 116Responding to Administration Errors A vaccine administration error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm. Administration errors can have many consequences, including inadequate immunological protection, possible injury to the patient, cost, inconvenience, and reduced confidence in the health care delivery system. Patient Visit Key Points Use the Vaccine Administration Checklist to train staff on proper protocols for COVID -19 vaccination. Ensure check -in staff and vaccinators are properly trained on vaccine timing by age (Spanish ) including additional doses as authorized and recommended. Also see Timing for 2nd Dose for Moderna and Pfizer -BioNTech. Ensure vaccinators are properly trained on any COVID -19 vaccine products your location will administer \u2014paying extra attention to dilution of Pfizer vaccines. Organize storage units and separate products with similar packaging or labels. If more than one vaccine is being administered, consider separating recipients by vaccine type in clearly designated waiting lines/areas, with separate administration stations for each vaccine type, to prevent medication errors. In the event of administration errors, follow guidance in Preventing Administration Errors to locate training tips for each error type.Common Causes Training : Insufficient staff training; changes in recommendations and eligible populations Protocols : Lack of standardized protocols, nonstandard or error -prone abbreviations Performance : Distraction, patient misidentification Packaging : Easily misidentified products (common cap colors or label borders) 8/24/23 117Responding to Administration Errors (Cont.) A vaccine administration error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm. Administration errors can have many consequences, including inadequate immunological protection, possible injury to the patient, cost, inconvenience, and reduced confidence in the health care delivery system. Patient Visit Step Action 1. Inform the recipient of the vaccine administration error. 2.

Follow this guidance to introduce a new vaccine into your practice. Review Clinical and Safety Data Clinicians should review EUA Fact Sheets for any new Moderna , Novavax , and Pfizer - BioNTech vaccines and prepare vaccinators to administer new products. Review Clinical Talking Points for Providers of Pediatric Services , if appropriate. Complete Required Vaccine Product Training Ensure staff who store, handle, administer or manage COVID -19 vaccines complete the required product training (or study the manufacturer's EUA Fact Sheets) for each new vaccine as related to their role. (Refer them to the COVID -19 Vaccine Product Guide for summary chart of storage, handling, and administration details by product.) 8/24/23Review Timing Schedules Ensure staff know how to identify which vaccine is authorized for which age group. This chart (also in Spanish ) includes two schedules (routine and for moderately and severely immunocompromised). Also : See Age Transitions and Interchangeability . 125Introducing New Vaccines in Your Practice (Cont.)Infrequent Tasks Determine If Your Process Flows Change Review current workflows to ensure no opportunities to vaccinate are missed and expand capacity to reach new patient populations if applicable. Would separate staffing or stations (e.g., for 5 -11 years and under 5) work well in your clinic? (Staff could then specialize in one age group until proficient then rotate to expand proficiency to other ages.) Consider offering COVID -19 and other routine vaccines, as feasible, to additional eligible persons (e.g., siblings, family members, community members). If co -administering ( see tips ) with routine vaccines, ensure staff know your practice's vial - checking and syringe -labeling protocols to prevent mix -ups. 8/24/23Organize Storage Units to Reduce Administration Errors Ensure staff can locate the correct vaccine quickly to reduce inadvertent administration of products similar in packaging or close in age indicators. Group vaccines by age (pediatric, adolescent, adult). Clearly label cartons, baskets, or shelf space in large lettering. Store vaccine and diluent together if storage requirements are the same; never freeze diluent. When new vaccines are introduced into your practice's supply, ensure staff are properly trained on what's new and reinforce storage and handling basics staff already know. Follow this guidance to introduce a new vaccine into your practice. 126Infrequent Tasks Add Vaccine to VaccineFinder Inventory Begin reporting new vaccines to VaccineFinder upon receipt of shipment.

CDC and CDPH do not recommend specific brands or equipment. Providers agree to follow CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit & COVID -19 Addendum.Infrequent Tasks Storage Unit Selection Use purpose -built or pharmaceutical -grade units designed for storage of refrigerated or frozen biologics, including vaccines. These units can be compact, under -the-counter style or large. These units often have: Microprocessor -based temperature control with a digital temperature sensor (thermocouple, resistance temperature detector [RTD], or thermistor) Fan-forced air circulation with powerful fans or multiple cool air vents promoting uniform temperature and fast temperature recovery from out -of- range temperatures. If not an option, commercial or household standalone units are acceptable; as the name implies, these units are designed and marketed for home use. If necessary, combination units may be used \u2014but frozen vaccines must be stored in a standalone freezer. Never store any vaccine in a dormitory -style or bar -style combined refrigerator/freezer unit. Placement Place a storage unit in a well -ventilated room, leaving space between the unit, ceiling, and any wall. Nothing should block the cover of the motor compartment. The unit should be firm and level with the bottom of the unit above the floor. Most units work best when placed in an area with standard room temperatures between 20 \u00b0 C and 25 \u00b0 C (68 \u00b0 F and 77 \u00b0 F). Make sure the unit door opens and closes smoothly and fts squarely against the body of the unit. If not secured properly, unit doors pose a particular risk to maintaining appropriate internal temperatures for vaccine storage. Check manufacturer -supplied owner's manual for additional guidance on placement. 8/24/23 129Setting Up a New Storage Unit & Data Logger (Cont.) This section identifies resources than may assist with selection of storage unit types and subsequent setup . CDC and CDPH do not recommend specific brands or equipment. Providers agree to follow CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit & COVID -19 Addendum.Infrequent Tasks Storage units must be equipped with a digital data logger; devices with a buffered probe provide more accurate readings. For ultra -cold storage units, device must use an air -probe or a probe designed for ultra -low temperatures. Keep a backup device on hand for vaccine transports and should primary devices fail. Devices must have a current and valid Certificates of Calibration Testing. Refer to CDC's Vaccine Storage & Handling Toolkit for device specifications and calibration. Digital Data Logger Equipment Setup New storage units and data loggers must be properly setup and stable temperatures must be recorded for new storage units over several days before storing vaccines. Refer to this setup guidance to minimize inaccurate temperature readings that can damage vaccines. 8/24/23 1307.
