Bridging basic and clinical research, CRIPT: - Is one of five Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - Develops tools and provides expertise that complement ongoing public health programs to rapidly respond to emerging human respiratory pathogens of pandemic potential, including influenza viruses - Combine inter-related human studies to understand the factors contributing not only to zoonotic emergence but also to disease severity, transmission, and immune protection by previous infection and/or vaccination - Pursues basic research projects on virus and host determinants of virulence, host responses, antigenicity, tropism, and pathogenesis Provide service to rapidly respond to pre-pandemic and pandemic events in order to mitigate the public health impact of such events, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
