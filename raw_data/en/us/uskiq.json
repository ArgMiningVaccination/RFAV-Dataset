Spiritual Adoption is an opportunity for us to intercede on behalf of a child in danger of abortion who may not have anyone else to pray for them, \"that they might have life and have it to the full.\" (John 10:10). While this child will remain unknown to his or her \"spiritual parent\", God knows each of them. Many people find it helpful to name their spiritual baby to keep them focused in prayer. Bishop Fulton Sheen promoted this adoption with the following prayer: Jesus, Mary ,and Joseph, I love you very much. I beg you to save the life of the unborn baby that I have spiritually adopted, and is in danger of abortion. Mary, our Mother in Heaven, pray for us, and especially for your little ones in danger of abortion! What is a Spiritual Adoption Program? While anyone can pray for the unborn at any time, a spiritual adoption program is a parish, religious education program or school wide program where participant pledge to pray for nine months for a baby in danger of abortion. Many will begin at the Annunciation on March 25 and run until the Nativity of Our Lord on December 25. Other programs will run the 9 months of a school year. Others will use whatever timing works best for their parish. During this time, participants learn about the growth and development of children in the womb. Fetal Development posters are helpful in educating participants in the growth of children in the womb. In addition, you may consider offering \"Precious Feet\" pins or fetal models. See the resources section below. At the end of the program, many will sponsor a \"baby shower\" of donated items or money to be given to local pregnancy care centers or other charities caring for babies and their mothers.
