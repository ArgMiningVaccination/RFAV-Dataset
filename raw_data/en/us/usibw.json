In addition to a natural energy supplement like Tohi Burst, you can also increase your daily energy levels by getting more sleep, drinking more water, and making changes to your diet and exercise routine. Although it may sound counterintuitive if you are struggling with low energy, getting more exercise every day will help you feel lighter, more focused, and more motivated. Even a short walk or a few minutes of light stretching can act as a natural energy booster! For most people, the best time to take a preworkout is 30-60 minutes before you begin your workout. However, the exact timing depends on your individual activity level and metabolism. As you begin taking a preworkout supplement, notice how it affects your energy levels to see when it \"kicks in,\" then plan your dosage accordingly. Although caffeine often gets a bad reputation, low to moderate amounts can actually be beneficial. According to many [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26677204/), caffeine can improve cognitive function, improve mood, and increase focus. However, it's important to be mindful of caffeine consumption and avoid overuse. If you have a heart condition or other medical issues, consult your physician prior to using energy supplements that contain caffeine. Each Tohi Burst soft gel contains 16mg of caffeine. For comparison, the average cup of coffee contains 95-180mg of caffeine. Tohi Burst also uses caffeine sourced from green tea, which contains a natural compound called L-theanine that helps create a smooth, steady flow of caffeinated energy rather than a sudden spike followed by a crash.
