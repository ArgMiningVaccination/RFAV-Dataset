Results from Novavax's Phase 3 trial in the United Kingdom demonstrated the vaccine candidate's efficacy and showed that it protected against the U.K. variant of the virus. Results from another trial, in South Africa, showed that it was also effective against the variant that emerged there, although efficacy was lower. Stanley Erck, president and CEO of Novavax, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said the trial results show that the vaccine \"has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis.\" L.A. mayor vaccinated though he's not in priority group LOS ANGELES \u2014 Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti made clear in December that he would wait his turn to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, echoing county policy that nursing home residents, people 65 and older and medical workers will be first in line. \"I'm not jumping any queue,\" he said. But the 49-year-old Democrat was quietly vaccinated last week at the recommendation of medical personnel, after spending several days assisting health care workers at a large coronavirus vaccination center at Dodger Stadium. His office said Wednesday he received the first dose of the vaccine Jan. 21, his fifth day working at the site where he was \"interacting with hundreds of Angelenos each day.\" Over 1,000 Columbia students on tuition strike, demanding pandemic concessions More than 1,000 Columbia University students are withholding this semester's tuition as they demand that the Ivy League school in New York City lower its cost amid financial burdens and the move to online classes prompted by the [Covid-19](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/coronavirus) pandemic. Students initiated the tuition strike last Friday, when payments for the semester were due. In a sweeping list of demands, students accused the school of demonstrating a \"flagrant disregard for initiatives democratically supported within the community.\" The striking students are asking the school to lower tuition by at least 10 percent and to increase financial aid. The letter also asks the school to end its expansion into and gentrification of West Harlem, defund its university police force and bargain in good faith with campus unions. Fauci backs CDC's recommendations on reopening schools Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that he supports re-opening schools amid the coronavirus pandemic under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines. \"I would back the CDC recommendations because that is really based on data... we need to try and get the children back to school and that's the goal of President Biden that in the next one hundred days to get the K to eights back in school,\" Fauci said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" The CDC said in a recent study that schools should bring back in-person learning as soon as possible if social distancing and masks are mandated. The research, [published online in the journal JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875), offered guidance for local officials, school administrators, and parents on how to open schools safely while limiting the spread of Covid-19. California lawmakers vote to extend eviction moratorium as Covid continues to stifle economy California lawmakers voted to extend the state's eviction moratorium through June 30 as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic continues to create economic uncertainty for millions of renters. Under the proposed legislation, $2.6 billion in federal funds would be used as rental subsidies and would reimburse landlords 80 percent of unpaid back rent that occurred between April 2020 and March 2021 if the landlords agree to forgive the remaining 20 percent. Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously said he will sign the legislation. \"These bills aren't perfect and will not solve the problem in the long run, but we had to take action now to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling into homelessness in the next couple of months,\" said Assemblymember Richard Bloom, a Democrat who represents Santa Monica and surrounding communities. \"For many, this would be a potential death sentence.\" Democrats prepare to go it alone on Covid relief if Republicans don't cooperate WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are discussing a path to [bypass Republicans](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/imperiling-quick-1-400-checks-moderate-republicans-push-back-biden-n1255332) and approve an aggressive Covid-19 relief package on a party-line basis as prospects for bipartisan support for President Joe Biden's top priority diminish. White House economic adviser Brian Deese and Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zientz held a call Thursday with Senate Democrats as they grapple with whether to cut a slimmed-down deal or use a process known as reconciliation to bypass the Senate's 60-vote rule to avoid a filibuster. \"The sentiment is this: We would like Republicans to work with us to be part of the solution to deliver emergency help, but we can't wait, it's urgent, and we need to double-track this process,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was on the call, told reporters. \"So we will continue to reach out to Republicans, but I'm a big supporter of having an insurance policy in place through reconciliation.\" Beloved Asian American photographer Corky Lee dies after bout with Covid-19 Acclaimed New York photographer Corky Lee, who passionately chronicled the Asian American experience through his lens, [died Wednesday following ](https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN29X025)a brief bout with Covid-19, his family said.

In Florida, with its large Brazilian community, worries over Covid variant MIAMI \u2014 Even though Teresa Frade was infected with Covid-19 over the summer and already got both doses of the vaccination, she is still apprehensive about visiting her family in Brazil. The last time she was there was in late February last year, and she returned just before Florida went into lockdown. Frade, 54, a health care worker in South Florida is not sure if she has can get reinfected with the Brazilian variant that has ravaged parts of the South American country and worries whether it can spread here. Florida [leads the country with the highest number](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article248761805.html) of cases caused by the more transmissible and possibly more deadly Covid-19 variant from the United Kingdom, but new concerns are emerging over the potential spread of the Brazilian variant, also more contagious.

The makeshift memorial is for fallen \"pandemic soldiers\" \u2014 doctors who have died since the coronavirus struck this South American nation last year and unraveled the public health care system. \"Our country, like the other countries in the world, is not prepared for this pandemic. Even more so, the most affected are developing countries like ours,\" said Dr. Gerardo Campos, a spokesman for the Medical College of Peru. The college represents physicians and its headquarters is the site of the memorial, where a cleaning worker wearing a face mask recently dusted off each photo and placed flowers in front of them. Several hundred doses of Moderna vaccine may have spoiled at Vermont hospital Several hundred doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine may have spoiled at a Springfield, Vermont, hospital after being stored at the wrong temperature. The doses were distributed to Springfield Hospital. The state health department said on Wednesday that it was monitoring the situation and was looking into whether the doses were still viable. \"They have not been discarded as yet,\" the agency said in a statement. \"At this time, we're still seeking final guidance from the manufacturer on the potential loss of doses due to a temperature excursion.\" Department spokesman Ben Truman told NBC News on Thursday that officials were still in talks with Moderna about how to handle the situation. Covid death toll at N.Y. state nursing homes 50 percent higher than reported, AG says The New York state health department underreported the Covid-19 death toll in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent, the state's attorney general charged Thursday. More nursing home residents died from the coronavirus than the department's \"published nursing home data reflected and may have been undercounted by as much as 50 percent,\" Attorney General Letitia James' investigators concluded [in the report](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-nursinghomesreport-final.pdf). \"As the pandemic and our investigations continue, it is imperative that we understand why the residents of nursing homes in New York unnecessarily suffered at such an alarming rate,\" she said in a statement.

The state Department of Health and Environmental Control said experts agreed that existing vaccines would work against this variant. While this variant does appear to spread easier and quicker, the department said there was \"no evidence to suggest that the B.1.351 variant causes more severe illness.\" The DHEC added that there was no known travel history or connection between the two adults who tested positive for the variant \u2014 one was from the Lowcountry region of South Carolina and the other from the Pee Dee region. Late Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified state health officials that one sample contained the Covid-19 variant first found in South Africa, according to NBC affiliate [WIS](https://www.wistv.com/2021/01/28/covid-variant-first-found-south-africa-detected-south-carolina-dhec-says/). The other case was discovered at the DHEC's Public Health Laboratory, the station reported. The variant has been detected in 30 other countries, according to the station. The CDC said in a statement on Thursday that the agency would continue to monitor the Covid-19 variant and recommended that people avoid travel at this time. Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC's interim public health director, said in a statement that the variant was an \"important reminder to all South Carolinians that the fight against this deadly virus is far from over.\" \"While more COVID-19 vaccines are on the way, supplies are still limited. Every one of us must recommit to the fight by recognizing that we are all on the front lines now. We are all in this together,\" she said. Can the U.S. keep Covid variants in check? Here's what it takes. The Covid-19 variants that have emerged in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and now Southern California are eliciting two notably distinct responses from U.S. public health officials. First, broad concern. A [variant that wreaked havoc in the U.K.](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/boris-johnson-warns-u-k-variant-may-be-deadlier-experts-n1255353), leading to a spike in case numbers and hospitalizations, is surfacing in more places in the U.S. This week, another worrisome variant seen in Brazil surfaced in Minnesota. If these or other strains significantly change the way the virus transmits and attacks the body, as scientists fear they might, they could cause yet another prolonged surge in illnesses and deaths in the U.S., even as case numbers have begun to plateau and vaccines are rolling out. On the other hand, variants aren't novel or even uncommon in viral illnesses. The viruses that trigger common colds and flus regularly evolve. Even if a mutated strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, makes it more contagious or makes people sicker, the basic public health response stays the same: monitor the virus and any mutations as they move across communities. Use masking, testing, physical distancing and quarantine to contain the spread. 2 children die at Texas hospital in the same week Covid-19 claimed the lives of two children at a pediatric hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, this week. Cook Children's Medical Center, a leading pediatric hospital, said in a statement that a 9-year-old and a child under the age of 1 who both had the virus died this week. The baby's death was announced Monday, and local media reports suggested the 9-year-old passed away sometime Tuesday. The hospital did not release other information about the children due to HIPAA rules. University of Michigan students told to stay home due to Covid-19 variant University of [Michigan students were told ](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2021/01/27/university-of-michigan-students-asked-to-stay-home-to-curb-virus-spread/)to stay home by county authorities Wednesday, in hopes of curbing the spread of a contagious coronavirus variant. The Washtenaw County Health Department's recommendation means nearly all classes at the Ann Arbor campus will be likely be remote until at least Feb. 7. \"Students are being asked to remain at their campus-area addresses and to not gather with others outside of their household members,\" according [to a health department statement](https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1400). \"Students are permitted to leave their residence only to participate in limited activities, including in-person classes, work or research that cannot be completed remotely, obtaining food and medical care and other approved activities.\" WHO team in Wuhan for Covid origins study leaves quarantine WUHAN, China \u2014 A World Health Organization team emerged from quarantine in the [Chinese city of Wuhan ](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/who-wuhan-probing-covid-s-origins-politics-hangs-over-mission-n1255148)on Thursday, to begin field work in a [fact-finding mission ](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/who-wuhan-probing-covid-s-origins-politics-hangs-over-mission-n1255148)on the origins of the Covid-19 virus. The researchers, who were required to complete [14 days in quarantine](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-team-arrives-wuhan-investigate-pandemic-origins-n1254236) after arriving in [China](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china), left their hotel and boarded a bus in the midafternoon. The mission has become [ politically charged](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/who-wuhan-probing-covid-s-origins-politics-hangs-over-mission-n1255148) as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. A major question is where the Chinese side will allow the researchers to go and whom they will be able to talk to. Yellow barriers blocked the entrance to the hotel, keeping the media at a distance. Before the researchers boarded, workers in full protective gear could be seen loading their luggage onto the bus. The driver wore a full-body white protective suit and the researchers wore masks. U.S. is in a 'race against time' with new coronavirus variants, scientists warn The United States is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible before other potentially more worrisome variants of the coronavirus emerge, according to experts. Vaccination efforts in the U.S. have been hamstrung by delivery issues, insufficient supply and hesitancy to get the shots. But to avert another surge of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, scientists say it may be necessary to rethink how the vaccines are rolled out to ramp up the number of shots administered and to protect against [ new strains of the virus](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/why-are-new-coronavirus-variants-emerging-u-s-n1254454). \"We really are in a [ race against new variants](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/covid-19-peak-variants-muddy-forecasts-coming-months-n1255242),\" said Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"We need to prepare as much as possible before things increase to a level that puts more strain on our health care systems.\" South Dakota has successful vaccination program but high infection rate South Dakota has one of the [highest Covid-19 infection rates](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity) in the country, but it's also got one of the most successful vaccination programs in the land. So far, health workers have been able to administer 82,823 doses, a rate of 9,362 per 100,000 people, that is seventh best in the country, according to the latest federal [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). And the reason it's been so successful is because South Dakota already has a well-established vaccination program in place, said Victor Huber, a biomedical sciences professor at the University of South Dakota. \"Since South Dakota has an excellent infrastructure in place for delivering vaccines, this is an example of our state benefitting from those efforts being applied to the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,\" Huber said in an email to NBC News. \"This is a good sign for our state moving forward.\" South Dakota, which has a population of just 885,000, has a Covid-19 infection rate of 27.18 percent, which is the sixth worst in the country, according to [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity). The state has recorded 107,608 cases and 1,739 deaths due to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to [NBC News data](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-deaths-u-s-map-shows-number-fatalities-compared-confirmed-n1166966).

Miami Heat to welcome back fans with help of Covid-sniffing dogs The Miami Heat will have fans in the stands Thursday night for the first time in months with the help of some particularly fast and accurate Covid-19 detectors \u2014 virus-sniffing dogs. Ticket holders will be screened by Covid-19 detection dogs when they arrive at America Airlines Arena for the 8 p.m. game against the Los Angeles Clippers, officials said on the team's website. The dogs will walk past each fan upon arrival, according to a [video posted to the site](https://www.nba.com/heat/health-and-safety). If a dog sits down, the dog is indicating that it has detected the virus, and the person and their party will not be allowed in the arena. The Heat website specifies that the Covid-sniffing dogs have been specifically trained to identify the virus and won't sit down in the presence of someone who has simply been vaccinated. Lebanon's coronavirus lockdown stokes hunger, fear among desperate families Shadia has run out of rice for her family of nine. The [Syrian](https://www.nbcnews.com/syrias-suffering-families) mother had hoped the 5 kilos she bought last week would be enough to feed them for the duration of the [draconian national lockdown](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/lebanon-imposes-all-day-curfew-coronavirus-spins-out-control-n1254234) that [Lebanon](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-leaders-offer-beirut-aid-join-protesters-demands-reform-n1236257) imposed Jan. 14 in response to surging coronavirus case numbers. More than a week later, however, little food is left in the family's single-room bungalow. A 24-hour curfew is in place, with residents allowed outside only for what are officially deemed \"emergencies.\" Supermarkets across the country are closed. The lockdown, which initially had been scheduled to last 11 days, has now been extended until Feb. 8, leaving Shadia, 33, and her husband frantic about how their family will survive. In addition to the lack of food, the terra cotta roof of their home has collapsed, leaving the family to huddle together on the floor under blankets to stay warm. Fauci: Covid-19 vaccine rollout must prioritize people of color The U.S. Covid-19 vaccine rollout must account for the virus' disproportionate impact on people of color, Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an [interview with the New England Journal of Medicine.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2101618) \"I think that's the one thing we really got to be careful of,\" Fauci, who is the president's chief medical advisor as well as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. \"We don't want in the beginning that most of the people who are getting it are otherwise, well, middle-class white people.\" Fauci's comments come amid [a reported distrust](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/racial-disparities-create-obstacles-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-n1249627) in the medical community among racial minorities in the U.S. Triggered by a dark history of medical experimentation and less access to care, people in Black and Latino communities struggling with high Covid-19 rates are among those least likely to get vaccinated, according to health advocates. \"You absolutely have to respect the hesitancy of the minority population. They keep coming back and saying the history of Tuskegee,\" Fauci added, referring to the infamous 1932 experiment, in which the U.S. government denied African-American men treatment for syphilis and documented how the disease destroyed their bodies for nearly four decades in Alabama.
