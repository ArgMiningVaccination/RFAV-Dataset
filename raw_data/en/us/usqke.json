They continue to struggle with lingering symptoms long after testing negative for the virus. Reports of fatigue, joint pain, and cognitive difficulties are common. We are also seeing new research out confirming what clinicians have known all along: that acupuncture can help calm the inflammation associated with chronic post-coronavirus symptoms. Viruses are responsible for many long-term illnesses. We know a virus causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and suspect viruses are a major component in bringing on autoimmune diseases. Now we have evidence COVID-19 induces a [chronic post-viral syndrome](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/could-covid-19-trigger-chronic-disease-in-some-people-67749?fbclid=IwAR1Lr-Y4_-MVDBetYEnVbLBxbG5cb8j5MxnQ-eo9yze5CVSlUNk0MQ5q7GQ) in many patients. Symptoms Vary Widely Symptoms of post-viral syndromes include: - Fatigue that is persistent & often worse with activity - Unrefreshing sleep Waking up exhausted after a full night of sleep - Cognitive/neurological problems Difficulty remembering things, poor concentration, brain fog, inability to process new information - Muscle or joint pain - Digestive symptoms Nausea, diarrhea and/or constipation - Increased sensitivity to light, smell, or sound - Racing heart beat - Headaches Fatigue is often the most common and pronounced symptom. Fatigue often follows a viral infection, but people usually bounce back. This kind of fatigue is persistent and often worse after even just light exercise or performing simple tasks. It can be so bad that people will skip bathing or preparing meals because it just takes too much effort. Other symptoms that COVID can bring on include insomnia, anxiety or depression. These are not usually directly caused by the virus, but result from the atmosphere of prolonged uncertainty we are currently experiencing in learning how to adapt to living with it. Cytokine Storm It is not fully understood why some people develop longterm symptoms, but one factor seems to be a \"cytokine storm\". Cytokines are inflammatory markers, and when they stay elevated, indicate your immune system is stuck in overdrive. Many patients with post-viral syndromes will exhibit these elevated cytokine levels, indicating the body thinks it is still sick. Conventional medicine doesn't have much to offer these people. Some doctors conclude there is nothing wrong with these patients because test results are often not conclusive. Acupuncture Successfully Treats Post-Viral Syndromes Fortunately, [acupuncture](https://silverneedlewellness.com/shakuju-therapy-rumson/) has a long history of excellence in treating these lingering syndromes. Master physicians wrote texts 2,000 years ago outlining how to successfully treat the epidemics sweeping through Asia at the time. A vital aspect of this tradition was and continues to be keeping people healthy so they don't succumb to these diseases in the first place, or if they do, to decrease the duration and severity of the illness. Modern [research](https://nypost.com/2020/08/17/how-acupuncture-could-help-coronavirus-patients-study-says/?utm_source=flipboard&utm_medium=syndicated&utm_campaign=partnerfeed&fbclid=IwAR165U5Z7_OZgaCZqDpLdwCkHTyyWxEYK1dtMIFbYPtIZrUzu9FaeLDfTgw) backs up the tradition. A recent study demonstrated acupuncture as very effective in calming the cytokine storm of an out-of-control immune system. It also showed acupuncture worked extremely well when used as a preventative treatment. We still don't know the full long-term consequences of COVID-19. As a result of this virus, some people are reporting experiencing a post-viral syndrome for six months now. Are you or someone you love suffering with long-term symptoms?
