The word chakra (pronounced shock-ra or chock-ra) means vortex, wheel or disk in Sanskrit. There are seven main chakras located at the center of the body running up and down the spine. The best way to picture your chakras is to imagine them as spinning balls of energy and light. What is Chakra Balancing? Chakras need positive energy and light frequencies to function properly. When an emotional event occurs in a person's life, the energy or feelings from that event influence the state of the chakra. If the energy is positive, the chakras benefit. If the energy from that event is negative, the chakra becomes imbalanced. In short, our emotions have an effect on our chakras and our chakras have an effect on our physical bodies. The imbalance of a chakra doesn't ordinarily occur in response to a single event; rather it's the repetition of similar events without relief that eventually causes the chakra to become too closed, too open, or impaired. How Chakra Healing Works Chakra balancing works by cleaning and healing the chakras from old issues and negative energies. Chakra balancing is like a super-charged [healing session](/shop-healing-sessions) and is an extremely powerful way to make changes in your life. With any healing process, you may experience a clearing and find you have more energy.

Chakra balancing is a procedure by which your personal frequency is filled with energy so you can receive life energy.
