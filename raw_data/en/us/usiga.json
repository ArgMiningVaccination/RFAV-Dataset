Leaflet R1645 Dennis Maxwell, cattle manager, McNay Farm Kevan Flaming, adjunct assistant professor, veterinary medicine Merlin Kaeberle, professor, veterinary medicine Summary Respiratory disease in beef calves has been associatedwith the stress of weaning. Management practicescommonly delay vaccination of calves to this time, andweaning stress could potentially suppress the immuneresponse. To reduce this stress we have beenexperimenting with a procedure termed \"pastureweaning\" in which the dams are removed and the calvesremain on pasture. Observation suggests that calvesweaned with this approach adapt to the weaned statemuch better than those held in drylot. Consequently,one would expect less stress-mediated effects includingthose on the immune system. Calves were weaned and assigned to groups that were pasture or drylot weaned, and calves within the groupswere vaccinated with one of two inactivated virusvaccines by either the intramuscular or subcutaneousroute. Weaning placement did not affect antibodyresponses to the viruses included in the vaccines. Theroute of administration did not influence responses withsubcutaneous injection inducing responses equivalent tothe intramuscular site. Utilization of this route forvaccination could be advantageous because it precludesthe tissue damage and hidden abscessation thatsometimes results from intramuscular injections. Adistinct difference was noted in the immunogenicity ofthe vaccines with the Vira Shield product yieldingsignificantly better responses to all viral entities . Introduction Respiratory disease is a common occurrence in calves during the period following weaning. Weaned calves areundergoing stress and maternal antibodies have wanedcontributing to the susceptibility to infectious disease.Immunization can be an effective management practice toreduce the incidence of respiratory disease. However, thechoice of vaccine and vaccination protocol are important inensuring the effectiveness of the immunization process. Our previous observations indicated that calves weaned on pasture (\"pasture weaning\") seem to be less stressed thanthose weaned in drylot. Stress is known to affect theimmune system in some situations and to suppress immuneresponses. Some inactivated virus vaccines have beenreported to be more immunogenic than others. Theintramuscular route is usually recommended by manufacturers of these vaccines, although the subcutaneousroute may be preferable. Therefore, the objective of thisexperimentation was to determine the effects of weaningapproach, vaccine source and route of vaccineadministration on the antibody responses of calves. Materials and Methods One hundred twelve crossbred calves born in the spring of 1997 were administered a modified live IBR-PI3 virusvaccine intranasally on August 19, 1997 (Nasalgen IP, Coopers Animal Health). The calves were weaned onSeptember 8 and randomly assigned to one of severaltreatment groups designated A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3and B4. Experimental treatment for each of these groupsdiffered in respect to weaning placement, vaccine, and routeof vaccination (Table 1). Table 1. Groups of experimental animals and treatment. Group No. of Animals Treatment A1 15 Pasture, Vira Shield 5 IM*A2 15 Pasture, Vira Shield 5 SQ**A3 15 Pasture, Triangle 4 IMA4 15 Pasture, Triangle 4 SQ B1 14 Drylot, Vira Shield 5 IMB2 15 Drylot, Vira 13 Drylot, Triangle IMB4 Drylot, Triangle 4 SR *IM - intramuscular administration **SQ - subcutaneous administration The vaccines contained infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) and bovine virus diarrhea(BVD) viruses and were Vira Shield 5 from GrandLaboratories or Triangle 3 from Fort Dodge Laboratories.Two doses of each vaccine were administered with a 30-dayinterval between vaccinations. Calves were bled for serumat the start of the experimentation and at 20, 50 and 70 daysthereafter. Sera were tested with virus neutralization testsfor antibodies to BVD type 1 and type 2 viruses, IBR virusand PI-3 virus. An analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Initially, the data were analyzed as a 2 x 2 x 2 (housing,vaccine, injection site) factorial. This analysis indicated thathousing had no real effect on antibody responses. Becausethe animals were all housed together (on pasture, or in thelot) a second analysis using housing as a blocking factor wasperformed. Vaccine and injection site were handled as a 2 x2 factorial. The probability values from this second analysisare reported.1999 Beef Research Report\u2014Iowa State University Results Antibody responses of the experimental calves are indicated in Tables 2, 3, and 4. Increased titers to IBR andPI-3 viruses by the second bleeding indicated a positiveresponse to the intranasal vaccine administered at the start ofthe experimentation. Weaning location did not have a significant effect on the response of calves to vaccination although levels ofantibodies to each of the viruses at the end of theexperimentation was higher in the drylot-weaned calves(Table 2). Route of inoculation did not significantlyinfluence the humoral responses to vaccination (Table 3).At the final bleeding, antibody levels were somewhat higherin calves vaccinated by the subcutaneous route but thedifference was statistically significant only with antibodytiters to BVD type 2 virus. The most dramatic effect was the higher level of antibodies in Vira Shield vaccinated calves compared withTriangle vaccinates (Table 4). This effect was statisticallysignificant and represented antibody responses to all theviruses. Discussion We had anticipated that the observed differences in stress of pasture- and drylot-weaned calves would influencethe immune response to vaccination. However, this provednot to be the case. This finding may be due to a lack ofstressful effects or to a long term induction activity on thepart of the vaccines. These inactivated virus vaccines areadjuvanted and tend to prolong antigenic exposure of theimmune system. This could potentially overcome the short-term effects of weaning stress. The responses of thesecalves to the oil adjuvanted vaccine were significantlygreater than to the other vaccine. Inactivated virus vaccineshave been criticized for a lack of immunogenicity.However, the findings indicate that this observation cannotbe applied to all vaccines, and selection of a vaccine for usein young calves should be a primary consideration.

Theintramuscular route is recommended by the manufacturers.However, use of the intramuscular route with associatedtissue damage and potential for hidden abcessation is beingdiscouraged by the meat industry. When subcutaneousadministration induces equivalent immune responses there isgood reason to change to that route for vaccination.
