The AAMA is committed to insuring public health and safety by ensuring that all persons practicing any type of medicine, in cluding acupuncture, are properly trained and educated. It is imperative that courts and medical bodies main tain and preserve strict standards of education and training in acupuncture before any person undertakes inserting a needle into a patient. An ill-trained practitioner could, as a result of lack of educati on or ignorance, cause substantial medical injury. Acupuncture, like Western Medicine is a complex subject . It cannot be mastered in a weekend or in a month. All AAMA members in addition to four (4) years of medical school (MD or DO), must have 300 hours of didactic and clinical ac upuncture education and training. A non-physician must have in excess of 2,000 hours of clinical and didactic education a nd training before they can become certified to treat patients in most states. Dry needling is the use of solid n eedles (contrasted with the use of hollow hypodermic needles that are used for injections) to treat muscle pain by stim ulating and breaking muscular knots and bands. Unlike trigger point injections used for the same purpose, no anesthetics are used in dry needling. There is controversy regarding the definition of dry need ling. Licensed medical physicians and licensed acupuncturists consider dry needling as Western St yle Acupuncture or Trigger Point Acupuncture whereby the insertion sites are determined by tender painful areas and tight muscles. These sites may be treated alone or in combination with known acupunctu re points. Other practitioners take the position that dry needling is different from acupuncture in that it is not a holistic procedure and does not use meridians or other Eastern medicine paradigms to determine the insertion sites. Dry needling is an invasive procedure. Needle le ngth can range up to 4 inches in order to reach the affected muscles. The patient can develop painful bruises after the procedure and adverse sequelae may include hematoma, pneumothorax, nerve injury, vascular injury and infection. Post procedure analgesic medications may be necessary (usually over the counter medications are sufficient). There has been controversy in the United States as to who is qualified to practice dry needling. Since it is an invasive procedure using needles, many take the position that it should only be performed by licensed acupuncturists or licensed medical physicians (M.D. or D.O.). In Illinois, this sentiment was echoed by a decision to reverse legislation permitting physical th erapists to perform dry needling. These and other practitioners were performing this procedure who are not trained nor do they otherwise routinely use needles in their practices. The AAMA recognizes dry needling as an invasive procedure using acupuncture needles that has associated medical risks. Therefore, the AAMA mainta ins that this procedure should be performed only by practitioners with extensive training and familiarity with routine use of needles in their practice and who are duly licensed to perform these procedures, such as licensed medical physicians or licensed acupuncturists.

The guidelines on basic training cover basic requirements for training non-physician acupuncturists and physicians wishing to use acupuncture in their clinical work and include a core syllabus. These are intended to assist national health authorities in setting standards and establishing official examinations as well as medical schools and institutions wishing to arrange training programmes. The guidelines on safety in acupuncture are intended fo r hospitals, clinics, and practitioners and provide standards for safety in the clinical practice of acupuncture. Introduction Acupuncture is an important element of traditional Chinese medicine. It began to be used more than 2500 years ago, and its theory was already well developed at a very early time, as is shown in many of the Chinese classics. It was introduced to neighbouring countries in Asia in the 6th Century, being readily accepted, and by the early 16th Century it had reached Europe. Over the past two decades acupuncture has spread worldwide, which has encouraged the further development of this therapy, particularly through studies from modern medical perspectives and research methodologies. Many elements of traditional m edicine are beneficial, and WHO encourages and supports countries to identify safe and effective remedies and practices for use in public and private health services. It has paid particular attention to supporting research in and the proper application of acupuncture and, in 1991, the Forty-fourth World Health Assembly urged Member States to introduce measures for its regulation and control (Resolution WHA44.34). With the increasing use of acupuncture, the need for a common language to facilitate communication in teaching, research, clinical practice and exchange of information had become pressing and, in 1989, WHO convened a Scientific Group which approved a Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature which is being widely disseminated and applied. The Scientific Group also recommended that the Organization develop a series of statements and guidelines on acupuncture relating to basic training, safety in clinical practice, indications and contraindications, and clinical research. Guidelines for clinical research on acupuncture were issued by the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific in 1995. The present document consists of guidelines on basic training and safety in acupuncture. More than 50 international experts shared their knowledge and experience in their preparation. Safety in acupuncture These guidelines are meant for hospitals, clinics and pr actitioners, and provide standards for safety in the clinical practice of acupuncture. Their purpose is to minimize the risk of infection and accidents, to alert acupuncturists to contraindications, and to advise on the management of complications occurring during treatment. Section I: Basic training in acupuncture The increasing popularity in recent years of acupuncture as a form of therapy and the interest of some countries in introducing it into primary health care mean that national health authorities must ensure safety and competence in its use. In countries with a formal system of education in traditional medicine, and where acupuncture is firmly established as a normal component of health care, training may extend over several years at college level, and suitable mechanisms for supervision of its practitioners have been created. However, for other countries, where \"modern Western medicine\" forms the only basis of the national health system, the position is different and there may be no educational, professional or legislative framework to govern the practice of acupuncture. Making use of acupuncture in modern medical care means taking it out of its traditional context and applying it as a therapeutic technique for a limited number of conditions for which it has been shown to be effective, without having to reconcile the under lying theories of modern and traditional medicine. In this type of situation, lengthy periods of in struction in traditional medicine as a background to acupuncture are neither feasible nor necessary, and shorter training must suffice. Furthermore, in many countries, acupuncture is not yet officially recognized and regulations and registration requirements, where they exist, vary c onsiderably. In some, only qualified physicians may practice acupuncture, while in others, practitioners trained in traditional medicine may also do so. It seems useful, therefore, to provide guidelines for relatively short periods of theoretical and practical training in acupuncture which, with well designed curricula and skilled instructors, would be sufficient to ensure the safety and competence of those so trained. In recent decades, the theoretical and practical aspects of acupuncture have been developed in various countries, particularly in those where moder n Western medical perspectives and research methodologies have been applied to studies of this traditional therapy. The achievements of these studies should be included in the training. However, since a new theoretical system has not yet been established, traditional Chinese medical theory is still taken as the basis of the Core Syllabus. 1. Purpose of the guidelines These guidelines will, it is hoped, assist national heal th authorities in countries where modern Western medicine forms the basis of health care to establish regulations concerning: general requirements for basic training in and the practice of acupuncture; the knowledge and experience of modern Western medicine required of acupuncture practitioners employed as such in the national health care system; and the knowledge and experience of acupuncture required of physicians and other health staff wishing to include acupuncture in their professional work in modern Western medicine. 2. Use of acupuncture in national health systems A decision by the Ministry of Health to incorporate acupuncture in primary health care (or at any other level of government health services) in a system based on modern Western medicine raises a number of important issues which would need to be taken into account. 2.2 Examinations and licensing A system of examination and licensing would be needed to ensure the competence of those trained, and to prevent unauthorized practice of acupuncture. This would bring under control the situation, current in certain industrialized and developing countries, where commercial exploitation of acupuncture training and practice is not uncommon, with all the harmful consequences that may ensue. 2.3 Supervision, monitoring and evaluation The introduction of one or more new categories of personnel in the health system would probably make it necessary to provide for: a period of supervised practice after training; monitoring of performance of the trainees individually and as a group; and evaluation of the benefits (or otherwise) of including acupuncture in primary health care (and at other levels) where it was not previously availabl e, and of its cost-effectiveness compared with other forms of treatment for common conditions. 3. Levels of training The guidelines address four levels of training in acupuncture, namely: full training for those with little or no prior medical education or experience, who wish to qualify as recognized acupuncture practitioners licensed to practise independently, subject to the limitations imposed by the Ministry of Health; full training of qualified physicians (modern Western medicine) in acupuncture; training of qualified physicians (and certain other medical graduates) from schools of modern Western medicine, who wish to include acupuncture as a technique in their clinical work; and limited training of other health personnel (modern Western medicine) working in the primary health care system of their country. 4. Training programmes The basic training of the four groups is different. For traditional acupuncture practitioners, a complete course extending over two years is recommended. For physicians and medically trained non-physicians, training would be adapted to their specific requirements and confined to the clinical applications of acupuncture. An indication of the period of training to be desired in each case is given in Table 1 below. Table 1 Basic training in acupuncture Category of Personnel Level of Training Acupuncture (ACU) Core Syllabus Theory Clinical Supervised PracticeModern Western Medicine ( Theory + Clinical Acupuncture practitioners (non- medical) Full course of training 1000 hours 500 hours 500 hours 500 hours Qualified physicians Full course of training 500 hours 500 hours 500 hours Qualified physicians Limited training in ACU as a technique for their clinical work Not less than 200 hours Other health personnel Limited training in ACU for use in primary health care Varies according to application envisaged 1 State examination in acupuncture and mode rn Western medicine (at appropriate level) 5.1 Acupuncture practitioners This training programme is designed for personnel of suitable educational level, but with little or no formal training or experience in modern Western health care. 5.3 Duration of training Two years full time (2500 hours), or the part-time equivalent, with not less than 1000 hours of practical and clinical work. 5.8 Examination On completion of the full period of training, the student's theoretical knowledge of and proficiency in acupuncture, and knowledge of modern Western medicine (at the appropriate level), should be evaluated by an official examination, recognized by national health authorities as evidence of the suitability of the trainee to be licensed to practise. 6. Full training in acupuncture for qualified physicians This training programme is designed for qualified physicians (modern Western medicine) who wish to practise acupuncture independently, treating the various conditions for which patients are commonly treated by acupuncture practitioners. Qualified physicians who already have adequate k nowledge and skills in modern Western medicine, would only need to follow the Core Syllabus for acupuncture. The theoretical course could be shortened, as qualified physicians can learn traditional medi cine more easily than those with no prior medical education. The course should comprise at least 1500 hours of formal training, including 1000 hours of practical and clinical work. On completion of the course and after passing an official examination, participants should be entitled to practise acupuncture in various fields of medicine where it is indicated. 7.1 Basic training Shorter training courses would be suitable for qualified physicians (and certain other graduates) who wish to become competent in acupuncture as a form of therapy in modern Western clinical practice (or as a subject for scientific research). For them, a brief introduction to traditional acupunctu re (derived from the Core Syllabus) would probably suffice, and the training would then be largely orientated to the use of acupuncture in modern Western medicine. The course should comprise at least 200 hours of formal training, and should include the following components: 1. Introduction to traditional Chinese acupuncture 2. Acupuncture points Location of the 361 classical points on the 14 meridians and the 48 extraordinary points. Alphanumeric codes and names, classifications of points, direction and depth of insertion of needles, actions and indications of the Commonly Used Points selected for Basic Training. 3. Applications of acupuncture in modern Western medicine Principal clinical conditions in whic h acupuncture has been shown to be beneficial. Selection of patients and evaluation of progress/benefit. Planning of treatment, selection of points and methods of needle manipulation, and use of medication or other forms of therapy concurrently with acupuncture. 4. Guidelines on safety in acupuncture 5. Treatment techniques General principles. Specific clinical conditions. On completion of the course and after passing an official examination, participants should be able to integrate acupuncture into their clinical work or speciality. 8. Limited training in acupuncture for primary health care personnel The introduction of \"acupuncture\" into primary health care at community level would require the training of a considerable number of personnel over a short per iod, if it is to have a demonstrable effect. This would probably strain the teaching and supervision resources of the country concerned. It would seem wiser, in such cases, to train such personnel in acupressure ( zhi-ya ) rather than in acupuncture itself. Training in acupressure would make no great demands, could be incorporated into the general training of primary health care personnel, and would carry no risk to the patient. The use of acupressure in primary health care would have to be evaluated after a suitable trial period. Some personnel who show particular aptitude might be chosen for basic training in acupuncture, a training programme being arranged according to the applications envisaged. 9. Selected acupuncture points for basic training Participants at the WHO Consultation on Acupuncture at Cervia, Italy in 1996 drew up a list of Commonly Used Points suitable for inclusion in basic training courses. These were selected from the document A Proposed Standard International Acupuncture Nomenclature: Report of a WHO Scientific Group (WHO, Geneva, 1991). As may be seen from the table below, the selection includes 187 of the 361 classical points, and 14 of the 48 extra points. Thus, the basic training courses for the categories of personnel described lay emphasis on the use of only 201 of a total of 409 points. The guidelines on safety, which follow, mention certain points as being potentially dangerous and requiring special skill and experience in their use. Some of these are included in the selection of Commonly Used Points, and attention is drawn to this fact. Section II: Safety in acupuncture In competent hands, acupuncture is generally a safe procedure with few contraindications or complications. Its most commonly used form involves needle penetration of the skin and may be compared to a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Nevertheless, there is always a potential risk, however slight, of transmitting infection from one patient to another (e.g. HIV or hepatitis) or of introducing pathogenic organisms. Safety in acupuncture therefore requires constant vigilance in maintaining high standards of cleanliness, sterilization and aseptic technique. There are, in addition, other risks which may not be foreseen or prevented but for which the acupuncturist must be prepared. These include: broken needles, untoward reactions, pain or discomfort, inadvertent injury to important organs and, of course, certain risks associated with the other forms of therapy 5 classified under the heading of \"acupuncture\". 5 Acupunture treatment is not limited to needling, but may also include: acupressure, electro-acupunture, laser acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, scraping and magnetotherapy. Finally, there are the risks due to inadequate training of the acupuncturist. These include inappropriate selection of patients, errors of technique, and failure to recognize contraindications and complications, or to deal with emergencies when they arise. 5. Injury to important organs If administered correctly, acupuncture should not injure any organ. However, if injury does occur, it may be serious. There are a great many acupuncture points, some which carry little or no risk and others where the potential of serious injury always exists, particularly in unskilled or inexperienced hands. As training programmes in acupuncture are intended for different levels of personnel, it follows that they should be adapted to the knowledge, abilities and experience of those concerned. At elementary levels, the selection of acupuncture points should be limited. At professional levels, the range can be expanded but, even so, the use of certain points and manipulations should still be restricted to those with great experience. The following passages present examples of points whic h carry particular potential risk. As in all forms of treatment, it is important to measure risk against expected benefit. 5.2 Precautions to be taken Special care should be taken in needling points in pr oximity to vital organs or sensitive areas. Because of the characteristics of the needles used, the particular sites for needling, the depth of needle insertion, the manipulation techniques used, and the stimulation given, accidents may occur during treatment. In most instances they can be avoided if adequate precautions are taken. If they do occur, the acupuncturist should know how to manage them effectively and avoid any additional harm. Accidental injury to an important organ requires urgent medical or surgical help. Chest, back and abdomen Points on the chest, back and abdomen should be needled cautiously, preferably obliquely or horizontally, so as to avoid injury to vital organs. Attention should be paid to the direction and depth of insertion of needles. Lung and pleura Injury to the lung and pleura caused by too deep insertion of a needle into points on the chest, back or supraclavicular fossa may cause traumatic pneumothorax. Cough, chest pain and dyspnoea are the usual symptoms and occur abruptly during the manipulation, especially if there is severe laceration of the lung by the needle. Alternatively, symptoms may develop gradually over several hours after the acupuncture treatment. Liver, spleen and kidney Puncture of the liver or spleen may cause a tear with bleeding, local pain and tenderness, and rigidity of the abdominal muscles. Puncturing the kidney may cause pain in the lumbar region and haematuria. If the damage is minor the bleeding will stop spontaneous ly but, if the bleeding is serious, shock may follow with a drop of blood pressure. Central nervous system Inappropriate manipulation at points between or beside the upper cervical vertebrae, such as GV 15 yamen and GV 16 fengfu may puncture the medulla oblongata, causing headache, nausea, vomiting, sudden slowing of respiration and disorientation, followed by convulsions, paralysis or coma. Between other vertebrae above the first lumbar, too deep needling may puncture the spinal cord, causing lightning pain felt in the extremities or on the trunk below the level of puncture. Other points Other points which are potentially dangerous and whic h therefore require special skill and experience in their use include: BL 1 jingming and ST 1 chengqi, located close to the eyeball; CV 22 tiantu, in front of the trachea; ST 9 renying, near the carotid artery; SP 11 jimen and SP 12 chongmen, near the femoral artery; and LU 9 taiyuan on the radial artery. Circulatory system Care should be taken in needling areas of poor circulation (e.g. varicose veins) where there is a risk of infection, and to avoid accidental puncture of ar teries (sometimes aberrant) which may cause bleeding, haematoma, arterial spasm or more serious complications when pathological change is present (e.g. aneurysm, atherosclerosis). Generally, bleeding due to puncture of a superficial blood vessel may be stopped by direct pressure.

A review into the incidence of risks of dry needling reveals very limited literature with only one case report and no review articles identified. Based on the similarities between acupuncture and dry needling, the extensive litera ture on the serious risks of acupuncture is extrapolated to evaluate the risks of dry needli ng. Dry needling is not a new or separate practice to acupuncture; rather it is a subsystem of musc uloskeletal acupuncture which has been practised continuously for at least 1 400 years. Dry needling is a pseudonym for a brief course of study in myofascial acupuncture also known as ashi acupuncture and trigger point acupuncture. Dry needling is likely to result in an increased incidence of serious risks, particularly pneumothorax, due to the short training cou rses and deep needling techniques which typify the practice . In the interest of public health and saf ety, the practice of dry needling should be restricted to suitably qualified practitioners.\" \"Given the foregoing discussion and that the practice of dry needling is identical to the practice of trigger point acupuncture and ashi acupuncture th e serious risks associated with acupuncture can be extrapolated to understand the risks of dry needling. ... A search of English language articles in Scopus using keywords ' acupuncture' and 'risks' and limited from the year 2000 to 2011 resulted in 604 results.

The author s note that pneumothorax is not only the most common cause of death but also the most frequent serious non-fatal complication arising from acupuncture. The authors observe that all deaths would likely be avoided with adequate acupuncture training . In another review the authors speculate on the reasons for different rates of reporting from different Asian and Western countries but conclude that adverse events would be avoided if all acupuncturists were trained to a high level of competency .\" \"In an Australian study of adverse events in Chinese medicine (primarily acupuncture) it was found that 'adverse event rates for practitioners with 0-12 months of CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) education were significantly higher than for those with 37-60 months education' . In the same study it was found that the risk of pneumothorax among medical practitioners practising acupuncture was twice the rate of non-medically trained acupuncturists. The study found that only 25 of 458 medical pr actitioners surveyed had completed more than 12 months of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) e ducation with the remaining 72% either not answering the question on training or had completed less than two weeks of training.\" \"While studies into deaths and serious risk s associated with acupuncture support thorough training in acupuncture, there is an assumption that much of this study should be focused on anatomy. The Australian study demonstrates that it is not enough to have thorough training in anatomy and biomedicine alone . Comprehensive training in acupuncture seems to be associated with a lower risk profile than bei ng a medical practitioner. TrP-DN and IMS favour deep needling methods which carry an inherently greater risk of organ puncture than superficial methods. \"The paper has demonstrated that dry needling is not a new or separate practice from acupuncture which has its roots in Chinese medicine and whic h continues to evolve and develop within the domains of scientific research, medical acupunc ture and Chinese medicine. Dry needling is a pseudonym for very brief training in myof ascial acupuncture also known as trigger point acupuncture and ashi acupuncture. The deep needling techniques which are preferred and characteristic of the dry needling approach have an inherently higher risk of pneumothorax and other serious risks than other needling methods. Acupuncture is safe in well-trained hands; however the risk of serious adverse events , though rare, has been found to be much higher among practitioners who have minimal training in acupuncture even if they have detailed knowledge of anatomy and biomedicine .\" Article C: Lee, Jun-Hwan, Hyangsook Lee, and Dae-Jean Jo. \"An Acute Cervical Epidural Hematoma as a Complication of Dry Needling.\" Spine 36.13 (2011): E891-893.

The Oregon Court of Appeals ruled \"dry needling\" is n ot within the scope of practice of chiropractic medicine. \"Dry needling \" is the insertion of solid, stainless steel needles into specific points on the body for therapy of muscle pain. The Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the Oregon Board of Chiropractic Examiners (OBCE) dry needling administrative rule allowing chiropractic physicians to perform \"dry needling\" after 24 hours of training. The Oregon Court of Appeals stated that \"dry needling \" is not within the scope of chiropractic medicine and that the rule exceeds the scope of the OBCE's statutory authority. In Oregon this decision allows only appropriately licensed and trained practitioners to provide acupuncture care to patients. \" 'Dry needling ' is acupuncture and should be regulated and licensed according to Oregon's existing practice act,\" said Beth Howlett, OAAOM President. \"Licensed acupuncturists are required to obtain over 700 hours of supervised training. This ruling ensures patient safety for all who receive acupuncture in the sta te of Oregon.\" The Oregon Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (OAAOM) is the state's professional and advocacy organization for acupuncture and Oriental medicine.
