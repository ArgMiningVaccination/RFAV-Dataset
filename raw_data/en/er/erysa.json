Our aim was to report trends in CAM use among US adults with current asthma. We conducted a serial cross-sectional study using nationally representative data from the BRFSS Asthma Call-Back Survey (ACBS) collected between 2008 and 2019 (sample size per cycle, 8222 to 14,227). The exposure was calendar time, as represented by ACBS cycle, while the main outcomes were use of at least one CAM and eleven alternative therapies. We analyzed CAM use overall and by population subgroups based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and daytime and night-time asthma symptoms. Our findings show that there was an increase in the use of at least one CAM from 41.3% in 2008 to 47.9% in 2019 (p-trend < 0.001) and an upward trend in the use of herbs, aromatherapy, yoga, breathing exercises, homeopathy, and naturopathy (p-trend < 0.05). However, the use of vitamins, acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology, and other CAM therapies remained stable (p-trend > 0.05). These trends varied according to population characteristics (age, sex, race, income) and asthma symptoms. In conclusion, our study suggests that CAM use among US adults with current asthma is either increasing or stable, and further studies are needed to explore the factors influencing these trends.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-21", "cleaned_text": "Trends in the Use of Complementary and Alternative Therapies among US Adults with Current Asthma [https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia4010010](https://doi.org/10.3390/epidemiologia4010010) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. It is characterized by recurrent respiratory symptoms, including wheezing, chest tightness, cough, and shortness of breath, which fluctuate in severity and frequency, and are accompanied by unpredictable expiratory airflow restriction [ [1](#B1-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. An estimated 21 million adults and 4 million children are living with asthma in the United States, with 10 million (41%) of those affected having at least one episode of an asthma attack within the past 12 months [ [2](#B2-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. With an increasing prevalence yearly, asthma is a significant health and economic burden to the patient, their family, and society. With no cure, asthma is a condition that remains poorly controlled in many people despite the availability of pharmacological interventions, evidence-based treatment guidelines, and multiple care pathways [ [3](#B3-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. This has led to many people seeking non-pharmacological approaches to manage their asthma symptoms, even without their physician's knowledge [ [4](#B4-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [5](#B5-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Patterns of CAM use differ according to age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, geography, and religious and spiritual backgrounds [ [6](#B6-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Younger age, female patients, white race, higher education, and income were characteristics associated with more use [ [6](#B6-epidemiologia-04-00010), [7](#B7-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Several studies have identified why people seek complementary and alternative treatment. Vincent and Furnham (1996) conducted an empirical study that revealed the primary factors motivating patients to seek complementary treatment [ [8](#B8-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. These included a favorable assessment of complementary medicine, the lack of efficacy of conventional treatment for their specific ailment, apprehension regarding the harmful side effects of conventional medicine, apprehensions about communication with physicians, and the accessibility of complementary medicine [ [8](#B8-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. A review by Slader et al. (2006) estimated that 4-79% of adults with asthma use CAM [ [10](#B10-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. However, they noted challenges in making conclusions due to poor methodology and little consistency among the available studies. Even though studies have shown varying degrees of benefit from their use a need to acknowledge the potential for harm. CAM may directly harm patients due to poorly understood mechanisms of action, either as a result of potential toxicity, or as a result of improper practice or use [ [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Furthermore, CAM may interfere with other medications and reduce their efficacy, leading to worse outcomes [ [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Indirectly, the harm of CAM use may result from patients delaying or avoiding seeking proper asthma treatment, leading to worsening symptoms and overall quality of life [ [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Hence, there is a need to understand how these trends have changed over time as there is no current study, to the best of our knowledge, that has examined trends in CAM use among asthmatics in the last decade. [7](#B7-epidemiologia-04-00010), [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010), [10](#B10-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [11](#B11-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Similar studies also documented that the prevalence of herbal use in asthma treatment is increasing and shows promise for the future but is limited by a lack of quality clinical trials [ [12](#B12-epidemiologia-04-00010), [13](#B13-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Homeopathy involves the use, in dilution, of substances that cause symptoms in their undiluted form [ [14](#B14-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. It is one of the most widespread forms of alternative therapy for asthma. Even though little is understood about their mechanism of action, a systemic review concluded that their effects are holistic [ [14](#B14-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The treatment results also varied based on the type of homeopathy used, but they show that its use continues to grow in recent times [ [14](#B14-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medical practice that involves the insertion of thin needles into various body parts [ [15](#B15-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. This therapy regulates the balance of blood and body by stimulating acupuncture points of the human body to achieve the effect of balancing the Qi [ [15](#B15-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. A systematic review by Chen et al. (2020) found that the frequency of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of acupuncture for asthma is rising. However, its evidence-based medicinal benefit is still lacking [ [16](#B16-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Traditional yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines to control and unite the mind, body, and spirit [ [17](#B17-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. A meta-analysis involving RCTs concluded that asthma patients observed symptom relief through yoga, especially when combined with breathing exercises [ [17](#B17-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Breathing exercises are another documented therapy in the literature. Exercises that include hyperventilation reduction techniques can improve asthma symptoms or reduce inhaler medication use in adults with poorly controlled asthma without harmful effects [ [18](#B18-epidemiologia-04-00010), [19](#B19-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Studies have found nothing to support or deter their complementary therapy use [ [9](#B9-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Reflexology is a therapy that involves applying finger pressure to various areas of the body [ [20](#B20-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Its application in asthma management has also been increasing [ [7](#B7-epidemiologia-04-00010), [10](#B10-epidemiologia-04-00010), [20](#B20-epidemiologia-04-00010), [21](#B21-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Acupressure is a kind of therapy that involves applying manual pressure to specific acupoints on the body [ [22](#B22-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Acupressure encourages the movement of life energy through the meridians inside the body [ [22](#B22-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. There is a well-reported benefit when acupressure is combined with acupuncture and reflexology [ [15](#B15-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Due to a small number of clinical trials, a difference in clinical outcome in adults has not been established, highlighting the need for more clinical trials [ [22](#B22-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Naturopathy includes a wide range of natural treatments that help induce positive health and ease disease symptoms by acting at physical and mental levels [ [7](#B7-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Aromatherapy is a type of therapy that uses essential oils to achieve physical and mental well-being [ [7](#B7-epidemiologia-04-00010), [10](#B10-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population [23](#B23-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [24](#B24-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. 2.1.1. Complementary [26](#B26-epidemiologia-04-00010), [27](#B27-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. 2.2. Statistical Analysis [28](#B28-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and Microsoft Data Analysis ToolPak for Excel 2016 version. Results were presented in tables and graphs. 3. Results 3.1. Use of any CAM among US Adults with Current Asthma in 2019 [Table 1](#epidemiologia-04-00010-t001)). 3.2. CAM Trend across Years [Table S1 in the Supplement](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). Use of any CAM increased among adults aged 18-55 years and in adults 55 years or older ( [Figure S1 in the Supplement](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). Although women reported more CAM use than men, trends increased in both groups. Use of any CAM among non-Hispanic white adults increased between 2008 and 2019 (p < 0.05; difference, 6.7% [95% CI, 3.5% to 9.9%]), remained stable among multiracial/other (p > 0.05) and Hispanic adults (p > 0.05) but decreased among non-Hispanic black adults (p < 0.05; difference, 3.98% [95% CI, 16.2% to 8.2%]). Trends in ever using CAM increased among adults with 2 days/week daytime symptoms (difference, 9.82% [95% CI, [95% CI, 4.6% to 15.8%]), and daytime symptoms throughout the day (difference, 5.7% [95% CI, 1.7% to 9.7%]). There was also an increasing trend among adults with 2 times/month night-time symptoms to 10.2%]). The use of aromatherapy [95% CI, 4.5% to 8.6%]), yoga 1.0% exercises (difference, 5.8% [95% CI, 2.0% to 9.6%]) increased in adults with income >$25,000. In contrast, vitamin, acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology trends, and other alternative therapy use remained stable in adults with incomes <$25,000 and >$25,000 ( [Table S1](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). [Table S1](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). Daytime symptoms noted some mixed trend patterns: use of naturopathy decreased in those with 2 days/week daytime symptoms and increased in adults with >2 days/week and throughout the day, acupuncture and acupressure use increased in adults with 2 days/week and remained stable in those with >2 days/week and throughout the day, and use of other CAM therapy increased in those with >2 days/week and remained stable in adults with 2 days/week and throughout the day ( [Table S1](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). [Table S1 in Supplement](#app1-epidemiologia-04-00010)). 4. Discussion [29](#B29-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. In our study, the increasing trend seen among users of any CAM is largely driven by increasing trends in some of the individual therapies, principally herbal, aromatherapy, homeopathy, yoga, breathing exercises, and naturopathy across the 12-year survey cycle. [8](#B8-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Increasing trends in herbal use, for example, could stem from evidence from clinical trials. For example, a 4-week double-blind, randomized trial compared oral doses of Anti-asthma Herbal Medicine Intervention (ASHMI) with prednisone and found that although ASHMI showed significantly fewer improvements in lung function compared to prednisone, it still displayed clinically relevant reductions in patient symptom scores and enhancements in lung function, suggesting potential use among patients with less severe forms of asthma [ [11](#B11-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Additionally, although yoga cannot be considered a routine intervention for asthmatic patients, it may be considered an ancillary alternative to breathing exercises for asthma patients [ [17](#B17-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The increasing trends in CAM use could also be due to changes in treatment guidelines, such as international guidelines for the management of asthma that include the option of breathing exercise programs as an adjuvant to pharmacological treatment [ [1](#B1-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. We found stabilization of the trends in using vitamins, acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology, and other alternative therapies across all-year cycles. The stable trend seen in vitamin use may reflect the increased scrutiny of multivitamins and minerals following studies showing no benefit [ [30](#B30-epidemiologia-04-00010)] and the stance/recommendations of several professional bodies that concluded that there was insufficient or no evidence to support their use [ [31](#B31-epidemiologia-04-00010), [32](#B32-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Furthermore, weaker evidence for the use of acupuncture [ [16](#B16-epidemiologia-04-00010)], acupressure [ [22](#B22-epidemiologia-04-00010)], and reflexology [ [20](#B20-epidemiologia-04-00010)] could deter further use, especially in the current explosion in accessible health information. [33](#B33-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Barnes et al. (2008) reported increased prevalence in the use of deep breathing exercises, yoga, and naturopathy in the general US adult population [ [33](#B33-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The general trend seen among our asthma population likely corresponds to general trends seen among the US population for these therapies. [34](#B34-epidemiologia-04-00010), [35](#B35-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. We also found increasing trends in the use of naturopathy and homeopathy in the lower-income group and stable trends in vitamin, acupuncture, acupressure, reflexology, and other alternative therapy use in both adults with income <$25,000 and >$25,000, which highlights similar findings in the extant literature of the less consistent trends between CAM use and income [ [36](#B36-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. [33](#B33-epidemiologia-04-00010), [37](#B37-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. A similar study also found that CAM use was higher in women with or without chronic diseases than in men [ [38](#B38-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The reason for this continuously increasing trend remains to be determined. Some explanations proffered include women being more open to the utilization of health services [ [39](#B39-epidemiologia-04-00010)] and increased health-seeking behaviors of females compared to males [ [40](#B40-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Some researchers have suggested modern society's progressive and dynamic nature, which supports women's independence and personal transformation through self-reflection and self-discovery [ [41](#B41-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. However, further longitudinal studies are needed to understand why these differences by gender exist across all spectrums of CAM use in patients with disease states. [8](#B8-epidemiologia-04-00010)], these findings have not been consistent across studies [ [35](#B35-epidemiologia-04-00010), [36](#B36-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Bishop et al. (2010) reported the use of CAM to be more common only in 21 out of their 55 studies in people with poor disease severity, providing evidence against the stereotypical belief that CAM users have more severe diseases or symptoms [ [36](#B36-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The inconsistent findings regarding trends in CAM use and asthma symptom severity might also be partly due to the cross-sectional study designs and cohort effects necessitating further prospective studies to understand this relationship. [42](#B42-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Surprisingly, we found increasing trends among black non-Hispanics in the use of herbs, breathing exercises, naturopathy, and acupuncture and stable trends among Hispanics in most of the eleven CAM modalities. The reason for these findings are unclear, as research has documented decreased use of these modalities of CAM among black non-Hispanic adults [ [43](#B43-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. The stable trend among Hispanics in our study is also different from prior studies that reported increased CAM use due to limited access to conventional medicine [ [43](#B43-epidemiologia-04-00010)]. Further studies to understand the drivers of these trends are warranted. 5.
