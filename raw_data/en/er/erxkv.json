Study Questions: How immunogenic is the messenger RNA vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA-1273 in older adults? Methods: The Moderna full-length spike glycoprotein trimer (S-2P). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored initial phase 1 open-label clinical trial of mRNA-1273 was expanded to include 40 adults 56 years old who were administered a dose of 25 g or 100 g of the vaccine at days 1 and 29 of the study for a total of two doses. The participants were stratified by age groups: ages 56-70 (n = 20), and ages 71 (n = 20). No screening for past or current SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed at enrollment. Participants were followed until day 57 for adverse effects, quantification of antibody and neutralizing responses, and T-cell responses. Results: No serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, myalgia, chills, and injection-site pain, occurring more frequently and with stronger intensity in those receiving the 100 g dose. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers to S-2P and receptor binding domain increased rapidly after vaccination in a dose-dependent fashion, with participants 71 years having higher titers compared to those ages 56-70 years. Similarly, a dose-dependent viral neutralization response was noted and similar in magnitude in both age groups and compared to that previously reported in participants ages 18-55 years. Neutralizing activity remained high for up to 4 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T (Th1) cells among participants in the two age subgroups who received the 100-g dose, and among participants between the ages of 56 and 70 years who received the 25-g dose. Conclusions: The mRNA-1273 vaccine is safe in older adults even at higher doses, and induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses successfully. Perspective: This substudy of the phase 1 clinical trial for Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine, while small in sample size, provides reassuring findings regarding its tolerability and immunogenicity. The study of vaccines in the elderly is essential, for: 1) they represent the population at highest risk of severe illness and would benefit the most from an effective vaccine, 2) aging is associated with immune-senescence, or dysfunction of the immune system, and 3) accordingly, responses against vaccines for other diseases are attenuated in the elderly. In-vitro assessments of immunogenicity, however, does not necessarily translate to effectiveness in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or abrogating its severity. It is also unclear whether immunogenicity persists beyond the short period of the study. We await with cautious optimism data on the effectiveness of the vaccine.
