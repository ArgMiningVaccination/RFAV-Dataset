The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and [new age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_age) medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts. Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners. For example, the [United States National Institutes of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Institutes_of_Health) department studying alternative medicine, currently named the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Integrative_Health) (NCCIH), was established as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) and was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) before obtaining its current name. Therapies are often [framed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(psychology)) as \"natural\" or \"holistic\", implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is \"artificial\" and \"narrow in scope\" Guatemala Alternative Medicine Two Day Workshop The focus of this introduction to Guatemala Alternative Medicine is to teach you how to make your own treatments from Plants.
