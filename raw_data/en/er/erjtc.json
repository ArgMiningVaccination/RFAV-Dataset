Psoriasis is a skin condition that most commonly causes red, scaly patches in areas along the body like the knees, scalp, and elbows. While this long-term chronic condition has no cure, lotions can relieve dryness, itchiness, irritation, and discomfort. Mark Lebwohl, MD, a New York board-certified dermatologist and member of the American Academy of Dermatology, told Verywell Health that people should seek an expert opinion if over-the-counter topicals don't relieve their psoriasis symptoms, as a prescription topical could provide better results. When looking for a lotion for psoriasis, make sure the product is free of fragrances, dyes, and chemicals that will further irritate the skin. We researched dozens of psoriasis lotions and evaluated them for ingredients, price, and whether it contained any irritants. A dermatologist from our Medical Expert Board reviewed the contents of this article for medical accuracy surrounding what to look for in a lotion for psoriasis, when to use it, and the root cause of psoriasis. Here are the best psoriasis lotions on the market today.

The salicylic acid will work as an exfoliant to remove any dead skin cells that form from psoriasis. What to Look for in a Lotion for Psoriasis Ingredients Not all ingredients are created equal in psoriasis topicals, as some can provide more benefits than others depending on your skin type. Universally, Dr. Lebwohl recommends avoiding any allergens, as they could further irritate the patches. If you like thicker lotions, then ones with ingredients like petroleum jelly are great choices. Salicylic acid is another beneficial ingredient to incorporate in your lotion. Location of Psoriasis \"Scalps are going to be treated differently than the body; the body is going to be treated differently than the groin; body folds are actually treated differently,\" Dr. Lebwohl says. Paying attention to the location of your psoriasis and using products accordingly will better address the skin condition. If you're not sure which product is best for your specific situation, consult your dermatologist. Type Psoriasis is a very personal skin condition, meaning what works for some people won't work for others. That also is true with the type of lotion you can use. If you like a greasier product and have found it better relieves your patches, then look for something with petroleum jelly. For people who find greasier lotions irritating, it is best to avoid ingredients like petroleum jelly. Frequently Asked Questions Should you put lotion on psoriasis? Dermatologist Alix J Charles, M.D. says lotions can help: \"Putting moisturizing creams and lotions on psoriasis lesions can make them less dry and could help to reduce the inflammation and itching that can be associated with active disease.\" What is psoriasis cream used for? Topical creams and ointments are often the main treatments used for mild to moderate psoriasis. Over-the-counter options include steroids (hydrocortisone) to reduce inflammation and itching, coal tar, moisturizers, anti-itch creams, and scale removers. Other medicated psoriasis creams are available by prescription. What is the fastest treatment for psoriasis? Dr. Charles told Verywell Health, \"The treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis has been revolutionized by the emergence of a class of drugs called injectable biologics. These drugs dampen down the immune system and, in many cases, can almost completely eliminate the visual presence of psoriasis on the skin.\" What is the root cause of psoriasis? Dr. Charles explains, \"Psoriasis is a chronic, body-wide, immune system mediated disease that is characterized by red, scaly itchy skin lesions and, in some patients, by arthritis and tendon pain. For reasons that are poorly understood, certain immune system cells in psoriasis patients abnormally collect in the skin or in joint spaces, releasing potent chemicals that then cause inflammation in those areas.\" Why Trust Verywell Health As a seasoned health writer, Danielle Zoellner knows the importance of finding just the right product to fit your medical needs.
