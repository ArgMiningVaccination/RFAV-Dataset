Interpol and the World Customs Organization (WCO) reported that seizures of substandard and falsified medical products, including person - al protective equipment (PPE), increased for the first time in March 2020. The emergence of trafficking in PPE signals a significant shift in organized criminal group behaviour that is directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought huge demand for medical products such as PPE over a relatively short period of time. It is foresee- able that, with the evolution of COVID-19 and developments in medicinal treatments and/or the repurposing of existing medicines, criminal behaviour will shift from trafficking in PPE to the development and delivery of a COVID-19 vac- cine. Furthermore, cyberattacks on critical infra-structure involved in addressing the pandemic are likely to continue in the form of online scams aimed at health procurement authorities. Challenges in pandemic preparedness, ranging from weak regulatory and legal frameworks to the prevention of the manufacturing and traffick- ing of substandard and falsified products and cy- ber security shortcomings, were evident before COVID-19, but the pandemic has exacerbated them and it will be difficult to make significant improvements in the immediate short term. The report concludes that crime targeting COVID-19 medical products will become more focused with significantly greater risks to pub- lic health as the containment phase of the pan- demic passes to the treatment and prevention stages. 8 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthKEY MESSAGES COVID-19 has been the catalyst for a hitherto unseen global market for the trafficking of PPE. There is also some evidence of the trafficking of other forms of substandard and falsified medi- cal products, but not to the same extent as PPE. Research will be required to determine the rea- sons for this. It can be expected that as a treat- ment becomes available and a vaccine to prevent contracting COVID-19 is identified, the focus will move away from PPE scams towards vaccine and treatment scams, including cyber scams. The shift in cyberattacks towards medical product supplies and health infrastructure correlates with the spread of COVID-19. As the pandemic further develops to the stabilisation phase, it is anticipat - ed that any suspension of ransomware attacks on critical health facilities and the medical product supply chain will resume. In the context of COVID-19, the absence of an ef- fective and comprehensive regulatory framework in some countries, including weak technical ca- pacity, constrained access and ineffective over- sight to address substandard and falsified medi- cal products, is not only life-threatening for those countries, it is also a challenge for the global com- munity.The global challenge to countries and international organizations to respond to the immediate effects of COVID-19 has been impacted by the traffick- ing of substandard and falsified medical products, which undermined their preparedness for the pan- demic and their capacity to prevent the spread of the disease. Strengthening legal frameworks and penalties with a view to achieving a more harmonized global approach to the criminalization of the manufactur- ing and trafficking of falsified medical products will enable better national, regional and international responses to this type of crime, which impacts in- dividual and public health on a global basis. Building governance improvements by address - ing good practices in the procurement of medical products and the elimination of opportunities for corruption is an essential development to prevent substandard and falsified medical products from entering the health system. Preventing, detecting and responding to medical product-related crime will require new or addition - al cross-skill training in the medical product sector and enhanced national coordination mechanisms by all relevant actors to address current and future challenges. 9 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthPURPOSE AND SCOPE This report covers the COVID-19-related traffick- ing of substandard and falsified medical products, including personal protective equipment intended for medical purposes, as a threat to public health. Substandard and falsified medical products ex- clude intellectual property infringements or viola- tions. LIMITATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH BRIEF The aim of this research brief is to present a con- densed assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trafficking of substandard and falsified medical products. It builds on information UNODC has collected from: Responses submitted by Member States to UNODC following a call for information on the impact of COVID-19 on drugs and crime; Information provided by UNODC field offices; Systematic analysis of open sources, official evidence, media and institutional reports. The analysis presented here should be viewed as a preliminary assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on activities related to trafficking of sub- standard and falsified medical products, including illicit events such as cybercrime, fraud, and scams associated with this phenomenon. Some of the content of this Brief may be based on anecdotal information with the aim to alert the international community of the possible threat posed by orga- nized crime in relation to the trafficking and sup- ply of substandard and falsified medical products over the short and long term, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. USE OF TERMS IN THIS REPORT Substandard medical products1: also called \"out of specification\", these are authorized medical products that fail to meet either their quality stan- dards or specifications, or both. Unregistered medical products: medical prod- ucts that have not undergone evaluation and/or approval by the national or regional regulatory au- thority for the market in which they are marketed/ distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national or regional regulation and legisla- tion. Falsified medical products: medical products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source. A falsified medical product in this report includes an intentionally man- ufactured substandard medical product. Medical products: medicines, including vaccines, excipients and active substances, as well as med- ical devices, their parts and materials, and acces- sories used in conjunction with medical devices.2 Organized criminal group: a structured group of three or more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit.3 Serious crime: conduct constituting an offence punishable by a maximum deprivation of liberty of at least four years or a more serious penalty.4 INTRODUCTION Organised criminal groups have adjusted to the opportunities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic to exploit the vulnerabilities and gaps existing in health and criminal justice systems.5 They exploit fears and uncertainties among populations and authorities to generate a demand for scarce med- ical products. The falsification of medical products at the manufacturing stage raises significant risks for public health, as such products may not prop- erly treat disease or illness and may facilitate the development of drug resistance. The evidence to date indicates that such criminality involving man- ufacturing and trafficking has closely followed the spread of COVID-19.6 At the onset of the pandemic, demand for medical products, including PPE to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, suddenly outstripped supply. Crimi- nal groups quickly adapted by providing substan- dard and falsified medical products, including PPE, and offering non-existent supplies of products to defraud individuals and procurement agencies. Public pressure on health systems to acquire suffi- cient PPE for a country's needs created an oppor- tunity for criminals to take advantage of the situa- tion and supply substandard and falsified PPE with lower good governance checks. While no medicine has been shown to prevent or cure COVID-19, this has not hindered the offering of treatments and in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test kits by those exploiting uncertainty and fear for illicit gains. As media and other public commentary reports on clinical trials of potential medicinal substances that may prevent or treat COVID-19,7 it is anticipated that those substances and existing medicines will be diverted from their legitimate markets and that substandard and falsified versions will emerge. 10 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthTHE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON CRIME RE- LATED TO SUBSTANDARD AND FALSI- FIED MEDICAL PRODUCTS Exploitation of an opportunity provided by COVID-19 COVID-19 has been the catalyst for a hither- to unseen global market for trafficking8 by or- ganized criminal groups of substandard and falsified medical products including PPE.9 The quantities of substandard and falsified medical products and PPE seized worldwide (see Maps) indicate that criminal groups have taken advan - tage of the emerging opportunities. Criminal groups involved in drug trafficking have in the past shown their adaptability in taking advantage of crises to get their products to the market and it is likely that they will do so again with regards to substandard and falsified medical products in the COVID-19 crisis.10 The production capacity needed to resource materials and manufacture significant quantities indicates an ability to shift illicit production activities to PPE manufacturing at short notice. This is indicative of organised crime involvement with a level of organization and agility to adapt to an emerging opportunity which is matched by the ability to access cus- tomers and effect the supply of substandard and falsified products on a global basis.11 COVID-19 has created a fertile crisis environ - ment for an effective fraud scheme to flourish leading to the betrayal of medical product pro- curement bodies and individuals. The emer- gence of the pandemic has seen data-com- promise frauds, including phishing, scamming and business email compromise, through the manipulation of corporate websites, to con- vince purchasers that firms are genuine. In many data-compromise frauds, there is no in- tention to supply medical products; it is simply a scheme to deprive the buyer of the purchase price. During COVID-19, high profile instanc- es of fraud have been uncovered12 along with ransomware attacks on hospitals,13 other orga- nizations and critical infrastructure engaged in combating COVID-19, all of which require signif- icant planning and resources on the part of the perpetrators. The trend of illicit events related to COVID-19 substandard and falsified products over time correlates with the spread of the pan- demic.14 11 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health Figure 1: Trends in the number of illicit events15 related to COVID-19 involving medical products recorded in selected countries in Asia16: Source: Elaborated by UNODC from European Commission Joint Research Centre, Infectious Diseases Data Observatory Medicine Quality Monitoring Globe Index and UNODC field offices and W orldometer (for data on new COVID-19 cases recorded daily). 12 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health Note: For further information see Endnotes.17 13 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthCONTRIBUTING AND EXPLOITED WEAKNESSES Regulatory and legal frameworks Organized criminal groups exploit gaps and dis- crepancies in national legislation and criminal jus- tice systems.18 Weak and/or inconsistent regulato - ry and legal frameworks for preventing, deterring and punishing offenders who manufacture or traf- fic in falsified medical products has become more evident in the rapidly evolving circumstances of the pandemic. National or regional regulatory authorities involved in protecting public health evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines, and standards authorities evaluate medical devices. However, WHO reports that 30 per cent of national regulato - ry authorities do not have full effective capacity to perform their functions.19 To fulfil their roles effec- tively, such authorities require rigorous regulatory standards and access to the latest technologies and information systems. In some countries, un- der-resourcing is a significant challenge for regu- latory authorities and weak or ineffective regulato - ry frameworks, including for the classification of medical products, may contribute to a lack of de- tecting and reporting the trafficking of substandard and falsified medical products. Many developing countries do not have well-functioning regulatory bodies and have weak capacity to enforce regula - tions.20 Some countries in Africa, for example, do not have a medical device legislative or regulatory frame-work. COVID-19 challenges this situation even further where fear and uncertainty promoted by organized criminal groups ensure that people de- prived of essential medical products will not ques- tion the substandard and falsified products that they are offered.21 In weak regulatory systems, the supply of sub- standard and falsified products, for example face masks or IVD test kits, may at best constitute an infringement relating to non-compliance with stan- dards without addressing the seriousness of the risk to the public and public health or the degree of criminality. Due to a failure to recognise that many substan- dard and falsified medical product-related crimes have serious implications for society, crimes have often been relegated to administrative infringe - ments.22 The gap in recognizing the seriousness of such crimes has provided an additional opportuni - ty for organized criminal groups during COVID-19, as evidenced by the large quantities of PPE being seized or rejected by countries as substandard. Evidence of seizures is more striking in Europe, North America and Asia, although limited data on Africa also indicates the interception of PPE and COVID-19-related medicines (see Maps). Gaps in legislative frameworks typically include inadequate medical product sector-specific laws and a lack of harmonization with other laws and international standards. Some laws lack defini - tions, allow for insufficient penalties or fail to des- ignate offences as predicate offences in anti-mon - ey-laundering legislation.23 In addition, the online and distance selling of medical products is often inadequately addressed.24 Substandard and falsified medical product-related crimes are sometimes treated the same as proper - ty fraud, intellectual property crimes and currency counterfeiting, notwithstanding the health impact involved with substandard and falsified medical products. 14 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthMAP 1: ILLICIT EVENTS INVOLVING COVID-19-RELATED SUBSTANDARD AND FALSIFIED MEDICINE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IN SELECTED COUNTRIES IN ASIA Source: Elaborated by UNODC from European Commission Joint Research Centre, Infectious Diseases Data Observatory, Medicine Quality Monitoring Globe Index, UNODC field offices and UNODC-WCO Global Container Control Programme.

Any diminution of the capacity for preventing, de- tecting or responding to such reports is perceived by criminals as an exploitable weakness. Countries lacking in knowledgeable cross-skill- trained staff, or the technical capability to detect substandard and falsified medical products, are more vulnerable to exploitation during the pan- demic. Criminal groups adapt quickly to changed landscapes, often much faster than law enforce- ment authorities, which may lack the cross-skill- trained staff able to identify changing offending activities, the products involved and the traffick- ing methods. In some countries, inadequate enforcement may have existed before the crisis, and combined with a lack of understanding of the risks posed by sub- standard and falsified medical products, author- ities may overlook the supply of such products due to a perception that it may be better to have such products than not to have any products at all for those without the means to acquire genuine medical products.27 Challenges in investigation and prosecution The sudden emergence of a market for substan- dard and falsified products during the pandem - ic has allowed authorities little time to recognize the status of suspected substandard and falsified products and the consequent harm to citizens. This is also a hindrance to investigation, the col- lection of evidence and the possibility of a conse- quent prosecution. Moreover, at the end of the substandard and falsi- fied products supply chain, or the decisive crime, there may be no products remaining to analyse or test, or no chain of evidence to facilitate a pros- ecution and falsified documentation may be the only surviving evidence. Furthermore, backlogs and blockages are creat- ed by a shortage of scientific analytical facilities for analysing medicines or testing medical prod-ucts, often due to such facilities being diverted to COVID-19 testing, further hindering the timely (if any) results which are needed both to protect victims and to contribute to the criminal justice process. These weaknesses impact victims as they lead to an inability to determine the cause of injury from substandard and falsified medical products and the information needed to assist them in their re- covery and as well as depriving them of the pos- sibility of obtaining justice for the harm done to them. In addition to chain of custody, analysis and testing gaps, few prosecutors have the skills or resources to deal with the particular aspects of crime related to falsified medical products that may be transnational and complex and require expert testimony and legal assistance from other countries. Cooperation and collaboration Significant efforts have been made by the inter- national community over the past 10 years to improve cooperation and collaboration among national agencies involved in medical product-re - lated crime.28 However, the lack of collaboration between various public agencies involved in com- bating substandard and falsified medical prod- ucts is still a common challenge which becomes evident in a crisis.29 Substandard and falsified medical product investigation requires a high lev- el of collaboration among agencies nationally and internationally to trace traffickers over borders using all available resources. This cooperation is also hampered by resource deficiencies. While digital records have become common and require digital forensic analysis to examine them, investigators do not always have access to such facilities. Cooperation between national agencies also involves budgetary and other types of competing interests, as well as legislative blockages, to the detriment of the ex- change of vital information and support.30 The absence of reports on substandard and fal- sified medical products from countries during COVID-19, for which there may be various reasons, could be an indicator of a lack of in- ternal collaboration, which subsequently im- pacts international action against offenders.16 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health Pangea Operation XIII, 3-10 March 2020 In March 2020, Interpol coordinated Operation Pangea XIII to target illegal online sales of med- icines and medical products. Law enforcement and health regulatory authorities from 90 countries participated in the joint action which led to 121 ar- rests worldwide and the seizure39 of substandard and falsified face masks as well as over US$14 million worth of potentially dangerous pharmaceu - tical products.40 Compared to an earlier operation in 2018, Interpol reported an increase of about 18 per cent in seizures of unauthorized antiviral med- ication and a more than 100 per cent increase in seizures of unauthorized chloroquine (an antima- larial), indicating a surge in substandard and falsi- fied medical products and unauthorized medication circulating in the market that may be connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. ONGOING THREATS Criminals exploit corruption, the relaxation of due diligence checks and systemic weaknesses ex- acerbated by COVID-1931 to the detriment of the health budget. This particularly applies to authori - ties vulnerable to succumbing to scamming opera - tions where money is paid and nothing is received in return, as has been evident during the COVID-19 crisis.32 Public health contracts for medical products, in- cluding PPE, are lucrative, and are therefore sus- ceptible to corruption.33 Corruption in public health systems is a global problem34 that together with the challenges of COVID-19, creates optimal con- ditions for the illicit diversion of publicly owned and funded medical products. This extends to theft from supply chains and hospitals,35 as well as pro- curement corruption.36 While a rapid emergency response is imperative, governments must also re- main accountable for how resources are spent. An effective way to increase accountability is to iden - tify and manage corruption risks within authorities mandated with procuring and distributing medicine and medical supplies. The illicit diversion of legitimate medical products to sell to other markets as COVID-19-related prod- ucts reduces the stock available for the intended market. This results in shortages, referred to by the World Health Organization (WHO) as stockouts, of products which in many cases have already been paid for by the national public health budget. This occurs in both developing and developed coun- tries.37 Shortages of medical products create op- portunities for medical product traffickers. Organized criminal groups in the Western Balkans are believed to be involved in money laundering and investing their illicit gains in the production and trafficking of falsified medical products and PPE.38 The high demand for scarce medical products, combined with curtailment in the supply of17 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Healthlegitimate products due to movement restrictions, has created a significant sales and supply oppor - tunity for criminals, resulting in a manifold increase in advertisements41 and supply directly connected to the COVID-19 pandemic.42 There is every rea- son to expect this trend to continue, especially in regions where the illicit drug trade is under pres- sure from movement controls43 and law enforce- ment. Interpol reported that Operation Pangea XIII in March 2020 saw significantly increased seizures of COVID-19-related medical products.44 While it remains to be seen if this trend is specific to COVID-19 or includes other contributory causes, any further continuation will increase the threat to individual and public health and to criminal justice systems as criminal groups bring their product ac- quisition skills and trafficking networks to subvert legitimate medical product supply chains. Dark Web The darknet remains a small but growing trafficking space for the illicit marketing of substandard and falsified medical products which does not seem to have been significantly altered by the COVID-19 crisis. However, this may change in the future, par- ticularly when a COVID-19 treatment or vaccine is developed. Monopoly Market, a Dark Web marketplace, banned its vendors from supplying medical products that are in short supply because of the pandemic, as well as the use of COVID-19 as a marketing tool. While this may be a welcome message, the risks continue as such declarations do not exclude the legitimate health care supply chain, or the pharmaceutical, medical device or medical PPE industry from at- tack. Other cybercriminals have not made any such declaration to exempt critical COVID-19-related targets and are expected to continue with cyberat- tacks.45 The opportunities for gain during COVID-19 will continue to be exploited as long as the pandem - ic continues to cause disruption and chaos. A study of some of the largest English-language on- line marketplaces on the Dark Web was conducted in April 2020 to identify transactions involving med- icines and medical equipment related to COVID-19 and to determine the quantity and type of products being listed and sold.46 The marketplaces surveyed included: Empire Market, Dark Market, Versus, White House Market, Tor Market and Monopoly. The analysis did not produce significant convincing evidence of major sales involving COVID-19-relat - ed medicine and medical equipment. Although a small number of listings of relevant products was observed, these appear to generate very little reve-nue. Notably, on Monopoly market, which is smaller than the other marketplaces covered by the survey, only one COVID-19-related product was listed - hy- droxychloroquine sulphate. Market administrators posted a warning to potential buyers that the drug is not to be considered a reliable cure for COVID-19 and that self-diagnosis is not advisable. A breakdown of sales of COVID-19-related prod- ucts on Empire Market in April 2020 shows that the overwhelming majority of transactions involved COVID-19 test kits, including antibody tests. Sales of face masks, hydroxychloroquine and other COVID-19-related medicines such as remdesivir accounted for approximately 15 per cent of such sales.

Unknown threats It is likely that new threats will emerge during and following the treatment and prevention phases of COVID-19. Seizures of small quantities of sub- standard and falsified COVID-19-related medical products may indicate the emergence of new illicit markets. A seizure of 3,300 thermometers was re- ported in Thailand following their trafficking through three other countries47 and a report of thermome- ters which do not conform with EU regulations was also noted in Italy.48 Further reports of similar seizures in other countries may emerge over time with serious public health implications for COVID-19 infection temperature in- dicators if they are not detected. There have been 18 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Healthreports of substandard and falsified ventilators49 50 in Russia, where a fraud enquiry has begun, as well as in the UK, where ventilators supplied were substandard and potentially dangerous.51 The supply of substandard ventilators was also report- ed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.52 Medical oxygen is also an essential component for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in critical care, even for those that do not require a mechanical ventilator. However, no seizures of substandard and falsified medical oxygen have been reported to date. Pulse oximeters, used by patients with chronic respiratory illnesses to monitor their blood oxygen levels, are reported to be in demand by healthy individuals concerned about COVID-19.53 This risks creating a shortage of pulse oximeters to the detriment of ill patients which would be ex- acerbated if that shortage were to be filled by sub- standard and falsified pulse oximeters. The products mentioned above have been in high demand and short supply, but contrary to PPE, seizures of trafficked substandard and falsified products have not been reported. This could be because they are not considered a priority and consequently, they are not intercepted by law en- forcement authorities, or because of a lack of ca- pacity. The most opportune falsified medical prod- ucts for criminals to produce are those that no one knows are falsified. Were this to occur, they may go undetected but could have tragic consequenc - es. Demand-led supply during COVID-19 and the fu- ture criminal threat involving vaccines The demand-supply gap in COVID-19-related products that naturally arose in the early contain - ment phase of the pandemic is gradually being reduced for some products. Producers and sup- pliers of non-pharmaceutical medical products, including medical grade face masks and surgical gowns, are responding more rapidly by increasing manufacturing capacity thereby reducing opportu - nities for scams and trafficking in substandard and falsified products. Since the production of such products does not require highly technical infrastructure or sophisti - cated know-how, the supply chain can be quick- ly adapted to larger demand. However, when it comes to pharmaceutical medicines to prevent and treat the virus, no such products have yet been found, and building a supply chain to satis- fy global demand will require a much longer time scale. This time gap, in the absence of a scientific solu-tion, is an opportunity for criminal groups to sell substandard and falsified medical products. For legitimate vaccine products, the global manufac- turing capacity is limited by many technical and regulatory factors as well as the fact that there are only a relatively small number of such manufactur- ers in existence, and they may not readily cope with rapid change.54 It is to be expected that criminal actors will seize new opportunities to market substandard and fal- sified vaccines as soon as a legitimate vaccine candidate is announced and before the genuine product can be legitimately produced and sup- plied.55 Again, as demand is likely to be greater than the ability to supply legitimate vaccines, the illicit mar- ket space will continue to expand whenever there are anecdotal reports of unproven remedies.56 Some illegal activities surrounding falsified vac- cines have already emerged, even though a vac- cine has not yet been discovered. A website ad- vertising a fraudulent coronavirus vaccine was detected in the United States of America. The US Department of Justice has subsequently is- sued a public warning against criminals seeking to exploit the state of emergency and uncertainly surrounding COVID-19 by advertising illegitimate vaccines.57 SOLUTIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS Enhancing regulatory and legislative measures Medical product-related crime involves the traffick- ing of products from source production countries, through transit countries, to the destination coun- tries where they will be used. The challenge is thus an international responsibility to be addressed by all affected countries and regions. Putting in place strong legislative and regulatory frameworks to combat substandard and falsified medical product-related crime requires a focus on criminalising behaviour and protecting the integrity of medical products and legitimate supply chains in order to protect public health and deter offend- ers. This would be best achieved through a common in- ternational approach to building systems for com- bating substandard and falsified medical products. However, in the absence of such an approach, the implementation of good legislative practices to develop national laws would bring a commonality throughout regions and globally. 19 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthThis would nevertheless still require significant cooperation through an integrated approach among neighbouring countries and others in- volved in pursuing the traffickers of substandard and falsified medical products and should include the application of preventive measures. Victims The manufacture and trafficking of falsified med- ical products are crimes of deception. However, in contrast to other types of fraud, human health, welfare and lives are impacted by substandard and falsified medical products. This distinction is not often noted by criminal justice systems, or by criminal elements. The impact distinction is left to aggravating fac- tors and victim impact statements in the event of a conviction by the courts. International organi - zations and countries have increasingly begun to recognise the need to focus on victims, the impact on public health system protection and the crim- inalisation of offending behaviours.58 COVID-19 may provide the impetus to criminal justice sys- tems to move this opportunity to fruition. Victims, whether individuals or public procure - ment authorities, need to be encouraged to re- port crimes, however embarrassing they may be, despite the risk of inviting political scrutiny in the case of public authorities. Openness and trans- parency in public service are crucial to stopping criminal exploitation, preventing harm to patients and recovering lost funds. Denial of the situation only enables such frauds to continue and others to become victims, to the detriment of vital public health funds. Poor governance in the public sec- tor allows organised crime to prosper.59 Staffing resources The diversion of relevant staff at this time, in- cluding law enforcement, regulatory and analyt- ical laboratory personnel, away from addressing medical product crime, further risks weakening national and international responses. Lessons learned from this crisis should be incorporated into new or additional training. Inter-agency cooperation There is general agreement that cooperation at the national level between medical product reg- ulatory authorities, police, customs and judicial authorities, and other stakeholders, is the most effective means of addressing the impact of the trafficking of substandard and falsified medical products on individual and public health. This is evidenced by many publications, includ - ing legal instruments, guides on drafting legis - lation, reports and studies, some of which are mentioned in this report. Obvious areas for coop- eration include the investigation of substandard and falsified medical products, which is no longer seen as the preserve of policing alone, but as also requiring the active involvement of medical prod- uct regulators, customs authorities and industry. Challenges remain in many countries while oth- ers are improving in this respect.60 In order to reduce criminality, there is a need to address weaknesses in legitimate medical prod- uct supply chains and improve the cooperation infrastructure between the authorities responsi - ble for preventing, detecting, investigating and responding to cases of substandard and falsified medical products. It is imperative that national au- thorities establish or strengthen investigative and cooperative agreements between agencies to facilitate the exchange of information and intelli - gence and the processing of evidence for judicial examination. Risk communication and awareness-raising Public awareness campaigns on the identification of substandard and falsified medical products are required and such messages need to be ef- fectively communicated. WHO is working on risk communication and awareness raising and has produced materials to address deficiencies and provide support to Member States in this area.61 UNODC has also released an awareness cam- paign on COVID-19-related issues, including the risk of purchasing substandard and falsified med- ical products. The use of risk communication and awareness campaigns can increase the public's confidence to discriminate between reliable fact- based sources of information and suspect infor- mation and services.62 Good governance Several international organizations have raised questions about fraud and a lack of governance in public health procurement processes and pro- vided guidance to reduce the threat of corruption. Good governance and the building of resilient and pandemic-ready health procurement pro- cesses should be part of a coordinated effort to consolidate guidance from all relevant bodies into a single response document. 20 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthEnsuring that candidate medicines and existing finished dosage forms of medicines are reported responsibly as potential treatments for COVID-19 would help reduce the irrational demand for ex- isting medicines which risks diverting them away from their indicated use. Irrational advertising on social media and tech- nology platforms could be addressed through en- hanced vigilance by service providers to prevent the promotion of false claims and remedies. While some social media63 and e-business platforms64 are tacking misinformation and the offering of un- founded medical products related to COVID-19, much more could be achieved through internation - al agreements with those providers. ACTIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS UNODC and WHO, working in partnership with other stakeholders, including Interpol and WCO, will need to build a cohesive approach to support- ing international efforts to determine results-driven objectives and then work collaboratively towards achieving them. Developing countries and those in need should be supported with confidence-building measures to correct identified deficiencies and weakness - es. This action needs to take place in the near future to significantly impact the anticipated shift in COVID-19-related medical product crime over the next 12 months when a vaccine may be devel - oped, but not yet available to the global popula - tion. Much uncertainty exists regarding when such a vaccine might become readily available.65 COVID-19 has impacted the normal approaches of UNODC and WHO under their specific man- dates on substandard and falsified medical prod- ucts from the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)66 and the World Health Assembly (WHA)67 respectively. UNODC focuses on criminal offences relating to substan- dard and falsified medical products from the crim- inal law perspective, while WHO focuses on the health impact of substandard and falsified medical products, strengthening regulatory systems and addressing regulatory prevention, detection and responses. Both involve separate confidence-building initia - tives with Member States and developing the sep- arate frameworks within which Member States' different agencies operate. COVID-19 introduced the imperative to collaborate and possibly con- duct joint developments to address the trafficking of medical product-related offences impacting on public health as a single focused issue. While there has been significant progress towards developing frameworks to focus specifically on substandard and falsified medical products in the last 10 years, few countries have an adequate legal and regulatory system in place to address substandard and falsified medical product-related crimes associated with COVID-19. As highlight - ed by the CCPCJ, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime can be used as an instrument to address the trafficking of substandard and falsified medical products68 and UNODC has developed a Guide to Good Legisla - tive Practices related to substandard and falsified medical product crime.69 The only dedicated international criminal law in- strument in the field of substandard and falsified medical products, the Medicrime Convention, fo- cuses on the primary aim of criminalising offend- ing behaviour to protect public health.70 Regula - tions relating to falsified medicinal products focus primarily on protecting the integrity of products in order to protect public health.71 Awareness-raising Awareness-raising among the public, regulators, law enforcement and healthcare professionals is a necessary component of preventing, detecting and responding to medical product-related crime involving substandard and/or falsified medical products. For the public, awareness-raising pro- grammes are important \"to support consumer pro- tection, understanding and involvement in ensur- ing their safety and preventing the consumption of falsified medical products\".72 To achieve these aims, appropriate communica - tions tools (social media, internet platforms, televi- sion, online and physical newspapers etc.) can be used to reach the target audience taking into ac- count the demographics of existing and potential victims, product types and distribution channels. Support from the media and civil society organiza - tions should be sought to provide training to rele- vant stakeholders and support awareness-raising campaigns. Risk awareness is supported by risk communi - cation which should be underpinned by reporting mechanisms to ensure the targeted collection of quality data in the desired quantities. COVID-19 highlights the challenges to ensure that people and communities receive reliable and evidence-based information. 21 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthDuring the pandemic, actions by some social media and e-commerce platforms73 indicate an awareness of the weaknesses exposed by the onset of COVID-19 and an understanding that their users require adequate and fact-based in- formation. However, other information providers may have not yet recognised the actions that are now needed to protect the public. INTERPRETATION OF SEIZURE DATA This report is limited by the statistical data avail - able on seizures that would enable the deduc - tion of trends across regions and globally. The recorded quantities of substandard and falsified medical and PPE products seized provide a global picture of trends building since the start of 2020. Regional trends indicate that significant sei- zures of protective equipment, mostly substan- dard and falsified face masks and IVD test kits for COVID-19, have occurred in the regions where the highest number of deaths and infec- tions were first recorded: Asia, Europe and the Americas. Substandard and falsified medicines were identified in several regions, including Afri- ca, where several seizures of chloroquine tablets have been reported. The extrapolation of the statistics on seizures is limited to the disclosures by certain countries, as not all countries have supplied data or disclosed that they have not made any such seizures. Furthermore, the collection of data is dependent on the understanding within a given country of which products can be legally seized, how they might be classified and having the resources to seize and report on them. It is not necessarily indicative that the African region, which is known to already be impacted by COVID-19, is still in the pre-containment phase when there is the op- portunity to acquire appropriate PPE before con- tamination escalates. While this conclusion could be drawn from the identified trends, it is acknowledged that the med- ical product regulatory framework, especially for medical devices, is not strong in parts of Africa and this could account for the statistical deficit. There are numerous examples throughout the world of intentionally supplied substandard medical prod- ucts74 and PPE75 during COVID-19. However, it should be noted that some countries may have viewed the products simply as substandard and not recorded them as falsified. More research is needed when statistical data becomes available on a wider basis to encompass all regions and as many countries as possible.CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS Data collected by UNODC on the extent of sub- standard and falsified medical products seized globally indicates that initial trends focused on the containment phase of the pandemic while ef- forts to find a treatment and a vaccine to prevent the disease are ongoing. This confirms trends observed by other organi - zations. It is anticipated that, if or when a viable medical treatment is identified, it will be subject- ed to falsification, theft or diversion by organised criminal groups. It is also likely that the approval of a viable vac- cine will lead to similar targeting. Both expect- ed trends will be accompanied by greater plan - ning and execution by organised criminal groups bringing significantly greater risk to individual and public health due to the type of medical products involved. The following key outcomes have been identi - fied: COVID-19 has been the catalyst for a glob - al market for the trafficking of PPE not seen before. Other forms of substandard and falsi- fied medical product supplies do not appear to have altered to any significant extent at this point. It can be expected that a viable treatment and a preventive vaccine will be the subject of fal- sification, theft and diversion by organised criminal groups. An increase in cyberattacks correlates with the spread of COVID-19. Such attacks are expected to continue despite declarations by some cybercriminals that they will not attack the public health infrastructure. The absence of an effective, comprehensive and enforceable regulatory framework in many countries to address substandard and falsified medical products, in particular medi- cal devices, has life-threatening consequenc - es and is a challenge for the global commu- nity. The absence of international coordination in addressing the manufacturing and trafficking of falsified medical products hinders a cohe- sive approach to responding to this type of crime which impacts individual and public health both locally and on a global basis. The international community needs to bring order to the individual efforts of relevant stakehold -22 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health ers to develop effective systems acceptable to all. Building governance improvements by imple - menting good practices in the procurement of medical products and the elimination of the op- portunity for corruption is an essential devel - opment to prevent substandard and falsified medical products and associated PPE from entering the health system. Relevant interna - tional bodies can support countries to imple - ment such improvements by developing a sin- gle set of governance recommendations for good practices. Preventing, detecting and responding to sub- standard and falsified medical product crime will require new or additional cross-skill training in the medical product sector to address cur-rent and future challenges. This may be best achieved through a coordinated effort by rel- evant international bodies including UNODC, WHO, Interpol, World Customs Organization and other stakeholders.76 The international community has a responsibil - ity to foster and facilitate shared approaches to developing global solutions for combating the trafficking of substandard and falsified medical products affecting individual and public health both nationally and internationally.77 Advertising and selling COVID-19-related medicines and medical equipment on the Dark Web A growing body of evidence shows that COVID-19-related scams are taking place on the 'surface web',78 which refers to the Internet pages indexed by search engines. Less is known about the scope of illicit activity on the Dark Web involv - ing COVID-19-related products, including medi- cines and medical equipment.79 A study of several Dark Web anonymous marketplaces conducted in April 2020 sought to address this gap and iden - tify a range of transactions involving medicines and medical equipment related to COVID-19.80 The marketplaces included in the study were: Empire Market, Dark Market, Versus, White House Market Monopoly and Tor Market, which are among the largest English-language darknet markets. Empire Market was identified as the largest active online anonymous marketplace, with over 33,500 drug listings. Two of the mar- ketplaces covered by the survey, Monopoly (466 listings) and Tor Market (322 listings), are so- called boutique markets which are much small- er than the other four. Monopoly specializes in drugs such as narcotics and prescriptions med- icines whereas Tor Market is only active in New Zealand. Previous studies suggest that a positive correlation should not be made directly between the number of listings on a marketplace and pur- chases of the advertised commodities, as the for- mer is not considered to be a reliable indicator of actual economic activity.81The marketplaces were surveyed by applying three categories of queries to item titles and de- scriptions: 1. Miracle cures, including keywords/ tags such as 'hydroxychloroquine', 'chloroquine' and 'azithromycin'; 2. General terms, using key- words such as 'corona' and 'covid'; and 3. Testing and protection, which included keywords such as 'N95', 'mask' and 'test kit.' The queries were entered into the search boxes of all six market- places; results were manually inspected and classified. The clusters of key words included in the queries yielded different results in each of the marketplaces. On White House Market, searches for 'hydroxy - chloroquine' or 'chloroquine' produced no results. 'Azithromycin', on the other hand, appeared in four listing, however this medicine is indicated for treating a range of diseases, from bacterial infec- tions of the respiratory tract to venereal diseas - es, and is not advertised as a COVID-19 cure. Searches of the keyword 'COVID' yielded 142 results, all of which were special offers, i.e. 'dis- counted' prices on traditional recreational drugs such as marijuana and MDMA. Searches of key- words covering PPE (face masks) and test kits produced no results. Searches for 'hydroxychloroquine' or 'chloro - quine' conducted on Empire Market yielded 45 results, many of which were duplications and rep- resented only seven relevant listings. This sug- gests that listing counts are not a reliable indica - tor of economic activity on marketplaces and may lead to errors. One of the vendors advertising hy- droxychloroquine products at the time of the sur- vey was subsequently banned, indicating that the ANNEX23 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health product advertised could have been fraudulent. One of the medical items advertised on Empire Market was a set of twenty-five COVID-19 IgG/ IgM rapid tests with a price of US$290. Other COVID-19-related products included antibody test kits advertised at US$43.48 each. Limited evidence of a recorded sale of 25 test kits for US$395 was found on Empire Market, however the proceeds are negligible in comparison to the overall volume of transactions involving narcotics on such marketplaces, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year.82 Nevertheless, some vendors selling COVID-19-re- lated medical equipment on Empire Market ap- peared to be established outfits, suggesting they may have good access to pharmaceutical labo - ratory supplies. A small number of sales of face masks was also detected on that marketplace, al- though at unusually high prices e.g. two N95 face masks at a price of US$100. Only one sale of this type of face mask was documented by the survey. The high price could suggest the vendor had a limited number of items in stock and was trying to discourage buyers from purchasing the prod- uct. Furthermore, some vendors advertising face masks were subsequently banned by the market- place, suggesting the activity was suspected to be fraudulent. Dark Market is another major marketplace in- cluded in the survey, with approximately 34,150 listings advertised on the platform. In terms of COVID-19-related activity, searches for 'hydroxy - chloroquine' and 'chloroquine' yielded only one listing. Notably, 180 query results seemed to be COVID-19-related, but the vendors were in fact advertising traditional products, such as canna - bis and MDMA, while using COVID terminology to capitalize on the pandemic to advertise their products. Monopoly market, smaller than the other mar- ketplaces covered by the survey, had only one COVID-19-related product listed - hydroxychlo - roquine sulphate. Market administrators posted a warning to potential buyers that the drug is not to be considered a reliable cure for COVID-19 and that self-diagnosis is not advisable. While the market did allow the product to be sold, vendors were cautioned against profiting from the pan- demic and advertising hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19. The analysis of leading online marketplaces did not produce significant convincing evidence of major sales involving COVID-19-related medicine and medical equipment. Although a small number of listings of relevant products was observed, they appear to generate very little revenue. The limit- ed number of transactions is unsurprising, given that regular buyers on such marketplaces are well versed in purchasing drugs and have a relative - ly high level of technical acumen. This suggests that buyers engaging in transactions on the Dark Web are less likely to purchase medicines tout- ed as COVID-19 miracle cures and overpriced face masks, or potentially fraudulent PPE. Nota- bly, some COVID-19-related items listed on the marketplaces seemed to be advertised by ven- dors who had executed several online transac- tions. This may indicate that vendors were able to access a significant number of pharmaceutical products. Of the various marketplaces surveyed, the largest share of activity was observed on Em- pire Market. In one instance, market administra - tors actively sought to regulate transactions and prevent vendors from profiting from the ongoing pandemic through advertisements for hydroxy- chloroquine as a cure for COVID-19. To conclude, the largest markets on the Dark Web did not exhibit significant transactions involving products directly related to COVID-19. Neverthe - less, COVID-19 appeared to be used in several cases as an advertising tool for traditional nar- cotics. Long-term monitoring of transactions on such marketplaces is needed to assess whether the situation is evolving. Furthermore, other illicit channels, such as unlicensed Internet markets, which paradoxically may be less regulated than Dark Web markets, should also be included in future monitoring efforts, to determine the extent to which online markets contribute to the sale of COVID-19-related products. Further in-depth analysis of vendor behaviour on Dark Web marketplaces may offer insights into the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing illicit online sales of goods such as medical devices and equipment and licit pharma - ceutical medicines. Studying the long-term impact of COVID-19 on online narcotics sales will be of equal importance, as buyers may face obstacles in meeting dealers face-to-face and as a result may turn increasingly to online sources to purchase illicit drugs. Furthermore, confinement measures and the closure of borders introduced in many countries to contain the spread of the pandem - ic pose significant challenges to online vendors seeking to ensure the shipping of their products is not disrupted. Disruptions or alterations to tra- ditional procurement and shipping flows may be able to be identified through studying the long- term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online sales of illicit drugs. Furthermore, such a study may also identify changes in vendor and buyer behaviour and profiles triggered by COVID-19 as well as other social and economic upheavals as- sociated with the pandemic.24 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public Health Changes in the modus operandi of organized criminal groups triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic Evidence shows that organized criminal groups are using the COVID-19 pandemic to infiltrate the legal economy and strengthen governance activities in response to emergencies triggered by the ongoing crisis.83 The involvement of orga- nized criminal groups in the provision of medicines ostensibly related to COVID-19, such as chloro - quine, both in terms of infiltrating the legal supply chain and managing their illicit trade, is supported by evidence from seized shipments of illegal med- ical products in several countries.84 85 Such groups are reconsidering their strategies and increasingly switching to other types of crime involving falsi- fied goods such as PPE and medicines.86 Various types of cybercrime involving fraudulent medical products have been linked to new modus operan - di of organized criminal groups resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as illustrated by the follow - ing examples: The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it took down more than 2,000 on- line coronavirus scams in March 2020 which included 471 fake online shops selling fraudu- lent COVID-19-related items.87 Police in France removed 70 fraudulent websites claiming to sell chloroquine in April 2020.88 COVID-19-related scams in the USA amount- ed to approximately US$13.4 million from the beginning of January to mid-April 2020 and have affected more than 18,000 citizens.89 In the first four months of 2020, 1,541 cyber- attacks related to COVID-19 were detected in the United Arab Emirates including 775 mal- ware threats, 621 email spam attacks and 145 URL attacks.90 A considerable number of cyberattacks and scams related to the COVID-19 pandemic was recorded worldwide during the first four months of 2020. Such scams include social media advertisements and websites for the purchase of PPE, test kits, sanitizer and falsified medicines. Qualitative assessments of the situation in North Macedonia indicate that organised criminal groups are moving away from drug trafficking to other types of crime involving falsified medical products such as protective equipment and pharmaceutical products.91 Cybercrime using various malware and ransomware packages themed around COVID-19 are also predicted to be part of the new modus operandi. In Mexico, it has been reported that organised criminal groups, such as drug cartels, are likely to switch to cybercrime. It is expected that online fraud, including through phishing attacks, will rise during the period of emergency measures put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic.92 Due to the growing demand for protective equip - ment, there are increased shipments of medical equipment circulating worldwide, which organized criminal groups may take advantage of to trans- port illicit drugs from one country to another. A case involving 14 kg of cocaine smuggled into the UK in a consignment of face masks was reported in April 2020.93 Large-scale transnational fraud in- volving the purchase of protective equipment has also been identified as part of the new modus ope- randi of organised criminal groups emerging as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 25 COVID-19-related Trafficking of Medical Products as a Threat to Public HealthMAP 3: ILLICIT EVENTS INVOLVING COVID-19-RELATED SUBSTANDARD AND FALSIFIED MEDICINE AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IN SELECTED COUNTRIES IN NORTHERN EUROPE Source: Elaborated by UNODC from European Commission Joint Research Centre and Infectious Diseases Data Observatory, Medicine Quality Moni - toring Globe Index.

Unregistered medical products that have not undergone evaluation and/ or approved by the National or Regional Regulatory Authority for the market in which they are marketed/distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national or regional regulation or legislation. Falsified medical products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source.

This definition takes into account the very close relationship between medicines and medical devices, as well as the fact that criminals do not distinguish between the two types of medical products in their criminal activities and, ultimately, that both falsified medicines and falsified medical devices cause harm to members of the public. 3 United Nations, United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (New York, 2004), Annex 1, Article 2(a).

There is no requirement for countries to introduce a definition of serious crime or to follow the definition of the Convention. The definition of serious crime is included to define the scope of application in the Conven - tion and to invoke the international cooperation provisions of the Convention. In other words, for the Organized Crime Convention to apply to the most serious falsified medical product-related offences, States should provide for maximum penalties of at least four years. 5 WHO, Global Surveillance and Monitoring System for substandard and falsified medical products: executive summary (Geneva, 2017), p.5.
