Design/methodology/approach Webbased survey data were provided by 578 employees working at one of four locations (main office, client location, satellite office, and home). Multiple regression analyses were used to identify differences in WLB support, job satisfaction, and inclusion across employees working at the four locations. Findings Results showed that main office and homebased workers had similar high levels of WLB support and job satisfaction. Main office workers reported higher levels of WLB support than satellite and clientbased workers. Additionally, main office workers reported the highest levels of workplace inclusion. Research limitations/ implications Data were originally gathered for practical purposes by the organization. The research design does not allow for manipulation or random assignment, therefore extraneous variables may have impacted the observed relationships. Practical implications Allowing employees flexibility in choosing their work locations is related to positive outcomes. The authors suggest several practices for the effective implementation of alternative work arrangements. Originality/value This paper is among the first to examine the outcomes of telework across locations. It uses a large single organization and a quasiexperimental design, enhancing the validity of the findings.
