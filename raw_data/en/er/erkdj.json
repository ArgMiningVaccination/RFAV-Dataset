When energy flows through/in/out of the fields in a healthy environment, it produces a state of health. When there are blockages, disturbances or depletions within the fields it causes dis-ease or injury. The goal in energy medicine / vibrational medicine is to move, unblock or balance life energy over the physical, energetic and spiritual body. Energy medicine / Vibrational medicine therapies and modalities are based in these principles. Energy Medicine / Vibrational Medicine Modalities include: Acupuncture, Acupressure, Aromatherapy, Bach Flower Remedies, Flower Essences, Homeopathic Remedies, Ayurvedic medicine, Reiki to name a few.
