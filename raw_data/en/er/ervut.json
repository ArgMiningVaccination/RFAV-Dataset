I offer nutritional consultations and health coaching packages as well as whole food cleanses and applied kinesiology, a system of testing the body to see which of the healing supplements are needed, or which foods may be causing an inflammatory response and therefore need to be avoided while undergoing healing.

Standard Process' scientists, composed of highly trained and degreed microbiologists and chemists, work meticulously to guarantee customers receive the highest-quality products. The quality control unit ensures label claims are met and testing is performed after critical stages of production to confirm products are free of bacterial contamination. Additionally, shelf-life studies are conducted on each product to make certain that label claims are met throughout the life of the product. No synthetic fertilizers or pesticides are ever used in the organic growing process. 2011\u2014Organic Excellence Selected for its commitment to organic farming, Standard Process was one of two companies, and the only whole food supplement company in recent history, to receive the award. Standard Process believes in being a positive example by demonstrating to other businesses and farmers that farming organically provides valuable health benefits and can be successful on both large- and small-scale farms. In 2011, more than 6.5 million pounds of vegetables were grown on the company's 420 acres of certified organic farmland. In addition, 75 different groups, from farmers to customers, and from elementary students to college students, visited the Standard Process Farm to learn about organic farming.
