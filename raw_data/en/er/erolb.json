Read our full disclosure [here.](https://www.shinesheets.com/affiliate-disclosure/) In the past, precious stones were considered treasures and commonly used as ornaments. While many remain to be used for the same purposes, some gemstones are now being used in alternative medicine. These gemstones are also called healing crystals, as they're believed to alleviate illnesses and foster health and wellness. While many of the healing properties attributed to essential gemstones are yet to be scientifically proven, many users attest to the health benefits they've experienced using healing crystals. Some holistic wellness doctors also recommend using these gemstones in conjunction with treatment and an improved and healthier lifestyle for better results. Because of the beneficial properties healing crystals are believed to have, some people are utilizing these precious stones as accessories such as [crystal bracelets](https://tinyrituals.co/).

If you're wondering whether using healing crystals may be a good idea, here are some of the reasons why you should give them a try. The History of Healing Crystals The use of gemstones as talismans and amulets dates back millennia. Ancient Egyptians, for example, would use turquoise for protection, lapis lazuli for wisdom, and carnelian for energy. Similarly, in ancient India, certain gems were associated with different planets and were believed to protect the wearer from any negative influences of those celestial bodies. The Greeks and Romans also wore and used gems for various reasons, including protection in battle, to improve health, and to attract love or wealth. The Science Behind Healing Crystals Modern science acknowledges the unique compositions and structures of each gemstone. Each gem is composed of different minerals, leading to its unique color, hardness, and other properties. While skeptics argue that any therapeutic effects are simply the result of the placebo effect, some believe that the vibrations or energies of certain stones interact with the body's energies, bringing balance and healing. It's worth noting, however, that while certain crystals like quartz have piezoelectric properties (which means they generate voltage when mechanical pressure is applied), this does not necessarily translate to health benefits. Scientific research is still ongoing, and while anecdotal evidence abounds, rigorous scientific proof remains elusive. Can Healing Crystals Boost Your Health?
