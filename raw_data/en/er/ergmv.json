Musayeva; Baku/AZ L. E. Derchi; Genoa/IT RPS 104-3 Deep learning for estimating pulmonary nodule malig nancy risk using prior CT examinations in lung cancer screening *K. V. Venkadesh*, T. A. Aleef, A. Schreuder, Nodule size, morphology, and growth are important f actors for accurately estimating nodule malignancy risk in lung cancer screening CT examinations. In this work, we aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm that uses a current and a prior CT examination to estimate the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules. Methods or Background: We developed a dual time-point DL algorithm by stacking the nodules from the current and prior CT examinations in the input channels of convolutional neural networks. We used 3,011 nodules (286 malignant) and 994 nodules (73 malignant) as develo pment and hold-out test cohorts from the National Lung Screening Trial, res pectively. The reference standard was set by histopathologic confirmation or CT follow-up of more than two years. We compared the performance of the algor ithm against PanCan model 2b and a previously published single time-poi nt DL algorithm that only processed a single CT examination. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to measure dis crimination performance and a standard permutation test with 10,000 random permutations to compute p-values. Results or Findings: The dual time-point DL algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 - 0.97) on the hold-out test cohort. The algorithm outperformed the single time-point DL algorithm and the 0.001), Conclusion: Deep learning algorithms using current and prior CT examinations have the potential to accurately estim ate the malignancy risk of pulmonary nodules. Limitations: External validation is needed on other screening datasets to generate further evidence.

Tian*, Y. He, J. Song, A. Liu, Z. Li; Dalian/CN (istiandi@163.com) Purpose: Radiomics for classifying minimally invasive and invasive lung adenocarcinoma presenting as ground-glass nodules contrast-enhanced computed tomography. retrospectively included 98 ground glass nodules (GGNs) that were surgically confirmed as mi nimally invasive adenocarcinomas (MIAs) or invasive adenocarcinomas (IAs). Each GGO was segmented manually using 3D-slicer, and texture features were extracted from the enhanced venous phase image. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was applied to select optimal radiomics features whose performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The radiomics model was compared to the radiographic model and the radiomic s-radiographic CT combined model using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results or Findings: The radiomics model in CT-enhanced venous phase showed better performance (training AUC,0.85; test than the radiographic CT model (training AUC,0.78; test AUC,0.62). The combined model (training AUC,0.85; test AUC,0.85) did not demonstrated improved performance compared with the radiomics model. Conclusion: A radiomics model based on contrast-enhanced CT imaging have the best diagnostic performance to distinguish MIAs from IAs in GGNs when compare with the radiographic CT model. Limitations: It was a single-center retrospective study, and the re is deviation between collection and inclusion.

Franck*\u00b9, F. Zanca\u00b2, K. Carpentier\u00b9, H. El \u00b9Edegem/BE, \u00b2Heverlee/BE Purpose: Deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) has been shown to reduce radiation dose compared to iterative reconst ruction (IR) for chest CT. It is whether the nodule volume meas urements with DLIR are comparable with IR at different dose levels. Methods or Background: An anthropomorphic chest phantom (Lungman, Kyoto Kagaku), containing six six lobulated, and 3D- printed solid nodules (volume range 28-392 mm\u00b3), was scanned at six dose levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 3, 6 mGy). Images were 1.25 mm reconstructed with ASIR-V 60% and three levels of DLIR (TrueFidelity L ow, Medium, High). The volumes of 432 nodules (18 nodules x 6 doses x 4 re constructions) were measured by five independent observers in a semi-automatic fashion. Mean percentage error in nodule volume measurements was assessed for all reconstructions and dose levels, with respect to th e ground truth (high dose scan, 11 mGy). Subsequently, data were stratified per nodule type. A smaller absolute percentage error indicates a higher accuracy. Results or Findings: In general, mean % errors decreased with increasing dose. On average, errors were significantly lower w ith TrueFidelity (3.6/3.4/3.0% for Low/Medium/High) than with ASIR-V (4.1%), for all dose levels (p=0.001). With increasing DLIR level, error s decreased for the lower dose range (0.2-0.8 mGy), while for higher doses (1.5-6 mGy) values were comparable. When stratifying per morphology, the largest error was found for chest CT, volume measurements with TrueFidelity showed a significantly higher accuracy compared to ASIR-V, f or all dose levels and all nodule types. Lobulated nodules showed the highest absolute error in volume measurements. Limitations: Only phantom images were used. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: 27 benign and 38 malignant GGN were retrospectively studied. The 120kVp polyenergetic i mage (PI), EDM, and 40- 80keV VMI were reconstructed, in which the CT value , electron density (ED), and CT features were analysed between benign and malignant lesions. The CT features included lesion size, location, shape, edge, internal structure, adjacent structure, and nodule type. The statistically significant CT signs and quantitative parameters were analysed by logistic r egression analysis to obtain the independent risk factors for GGN malignancy, then all the independent risk factors were united to analyse by ROC curve. Results or Findings: The lesion shape, spiculation, lobulation, location, size, CT PI, 40-80 keV VMI, and ED were signific ant different between two groups (P<0.05), which were enrolled in logistic regression analysis by taking if GGN was malignant as the dependent variable. The ED M had higher efficacy than other VMI with AUC 0.722. Logistic regression analysis results showed (P=0.044), lesion size (P=0.004), and spicu lation (P=0.002) were independent risk factors for GGN malignancy. ROC analysis showed that the AUC of ED, size, spiculation, and a combination of the three were 0.722, 0.772, 0.698, and 0.885, respectively. The AUC of c ombined diagnosis was the largest with sensitivity specificity of 92.1% and 74.1%, respectively. Conclusion: The diagnostic efficiency of DLCT images in differe ntial diagnosis of pulmonary GGN, EDM has a higher efficiency than other VMI, and the diagnostic efficiency is further improved when EDM combines with lesion size and spiculation is analysed comprehensively.

Author ( CT) might be able to provide clinically relevant imaging biomark ers and might be associated with histopathology features in tumours. The present study sought to elucidate possible associations between texture features deri ved from CT images with proliferation index Ki-67 and grading in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours. Methods or Background: 38 patients (n= 22 females, 58%) with a mean age of 60.8 \u00b1 15.2 years were included into this retros pective study. Texture analysis was performed using the free available Maz da software. All tumours were histopathologically confirmed. Discrimination and correlation analyses were performed. Results or Findings: In discrimination analysis, \"S(1,1)SumEntrp\" was significantly different between typical and atypical carcinoids (mean 1.74 \u00b1 0.11 versus 1.79 \u00b1 0.14, p=0.007). The correlation analy sis revealed a moderate positive association between Ki-67 index with the f irst order parameter kurtosis (r=0.66, p=0.001). Several other texture features w ere associated with Ki-67 index, the highest correlation coefficient showed S (4,4)InvDfMom\" (r=0.59, p=0.004). Conclusion: Several texture features from CT were assoc iated with proliferation index Ki-67 and might therefore be a valuable novel biomarker in pulmonary neuroendocrine tumours. \"Sumentrp\" might be a promising parameter to aid in the discrimination between typi cal and atypical carcinoids. Limitations: First, it is a retrospective study with possible kn own inherent bias. Second, the patient sample is rather small based up on pNET low prevalence among lung tumours. Third, only 60% of patients had a Ki-67 index available, which further reduces the size of the patient sampl e.

Purpose: Chest x-ray is frequently performed in daily clinic al practice. The detection of lung nodules on radiographs is an indi cation for chest CT referral. Since lung nodule detection in chest x-ray has a low accuracy, the sensitivity can be improved by computer aided diagnosis (CAD) s ystems. However, the risk of large false positive rates can lead to redu ndant referrals for chest CT and contribute to unnecessary radiation exposure. I n this retrospective study, we investigated the impact of an automatic lung nodule detection (ALND) algorithm on the evaluation of chest radiographs and referral for chest CT. Methods or Background: Between July and September 2020, 1468 consecutive routine PA chest radiographs of adult, non-pregnant patients were retrospectively collected at a tertiary care center . Images were screened for positive ALND annotations in combination with refer ral for chest CT. In addition, the correlation of the ALND result with a true positive lung nodule was investigated. Results or Findings: The ALND algorithm detected 591 lung nodules on chest radiographs. Among these, 12 were indic ated as known lesions, 301 were reported as false positive, whereas 220 ALND findings were not reported. On 9% (49/524) of the radiographs, 58 nod ules were deemed suspicious and referred for CT. In 55% (27/49) of t he cases a CT examination was actually performed of which in 56% (15/27) of t he patients a nodular lesion was found. Conclusion: In approximately 1 out of 10 patients, a positive annotation by an ALND algorithm leads to chest CT referral. When a s ubsequent chest CT is performed, the suspected nodule correlates with a t rue lung nodule in more than half of the investigated patients. Limitations: Not applicable.

Ferri, focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-i nvasive local treatment procedure that uses thermal energy to abl ate prostate cancer (PC) lesions. In this study, we evaluated 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PMSA11 PET/MRI before and after treatment with HIFU to assess the accuracy of localisation and response to treatment. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 7 Methods or Background: Fourteen men with newly diagnosed PC were prospectively enrolled. Pre HIFU, patients underwent prostate biopsy, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-R M2 SMA11 For ided into 12 segments (apex, mid, and base, medial and lateral respectively, left and right) using PET/MRI data and MIM software. Maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) of PC lesions and the background of each s egment were collected. Results or Findings: Pre HIFU biopsy revealed 23 lesions of which 18 wer e clinically significant with Gleason score (GS) 7 and mpMRI showed 15 lesions with 13 being PIRADS 4. 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI each identified 25 positive lesions including all index lesions. Post-HIFU imaging was available in 9 participants. 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI were negative for the respective treated area in all pat ients. SUVmax of target lesions decreased significantly after HIFU A) and PSA density were 8.23\u00b13.60ng/mL and 0.19\u00b10.09ng/ml2, respectively, and decreased significantly after PET/MRI identified the dominant lesion for HIFU ablation pretreatment and were able to accurately verify response to treatment in 100%.

Duan*, V. Ferri, P. Ghanouni, Targeting of lesions seen on multiparametric MRI (m pMRI) improves prostate cancer (PC) detection at biopsy. However, 20-65% of highly suspicious lesions on MRI prove to be false positiv es (FP) at biopsy. We evaluated the potential utility of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients with suspected PC and prior negative biopsy or equivocal MRI. Methods or Background: Ten men with suspected PC were prospectively enrolled to undergo 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MR I, including mpMRI. The prostate was divided into 12 segments (a pex, mid, and base, lateral and medial, respectively, left and right) using PET/MRI data and MIM software. Maximum standardised uptake values (SUVmax) of suspected PC lesions and background for each segment were collec ted. Biopsies after PET/MRI included 1 core through each of the 12 segm ents and targeted sampling of any lesions seen on PET. Results or Findings: PSA and PSA density were 10.77\u00b16.27 ng/mL and 0.19\u00b10.11 ng/mL2, respectively. mpMRI was negative in 5 patients, 4 showed PIRADS 4 and 1 PIRADS 5. 68Ga-PSMA11 identified 25 lesions of which 52% were verified PC and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI showed 26 les ions with PC verification in 50%. PET/MRI guided biopsy led to t he additional finding of 3 clinically significant tumours and 2 GS 6 cancers. For 68Ga-PSMA11, mean SUVmax for true positives (TP) was slightly higher than FP, however not statistically significant whereas for 68Ga-RM2, SUV max of TP PC lesions were significantly higher than FP (11.56 \u00b1 results 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI are feasible for biopsy guidance in suspect ed PC, and most importantly identified additional clinically signif icant cancers not seen on mpMRI.

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate was subsequently performed on the same magnet, with apparent diffusi on coefficient (ADC) values calculated automatically and extracted from the same tumour regions. Whole-mount surgical sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, with tumour grade and per cent Gleason pattern 4 (%GP4) evaluated by an experienced genitourinary pathologist. Results or Findings: The study included 10 patients with 15 lesions, of which 2, 11, and 2 harboured grade 1, 2, and 3 disease, r espectively. 2/15 lesions were not reported prospectively on mpMRI and were detected retrospectively on HP 13C-MRI using whole-mount pathology as refere nce. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the presence of SNR and (rs=0.62, P=0.04). Conclusion: HP 13C-MRI was superior to mpMRI for evaluating the true burden of disease in patients with multifocal PCa, with lesion-derived [1- 13C]lactate production acting as a metabolic surrogate of tumour aggressiveness. Non-invasive assessment of %GP4 usi ng HP 13C-MRI may be used clinically to improve the selection of suit able candidates for active surveillance, for which %GP4 is critical.

Taha*, M. Shalaby, J. AbdAllah, Y. O. H. Omar; Purpose: To evaluate the role of 68Ga PSMA PET/CT in the sta ging of patients with pathologically proved prostatic adeno carcinoma. Methods or Background: Prostate cancer is the 2nd most common male malignancy and is the 4th leading cause of death fr om malignancies. The key issue for optimal patient management is accurate pr etreatment staging. 50 patients with pathologically proven prostate cancer , without any treatment or intervention, were included in this study. The PET/ CT findings were correlated with the pathology reports, Gleason score and PSA l evels. The patients were evaluated for local staging (T stage), including pr ostatic lesions extra-prostatic extension and seminal vesicles invasion, the region al nodal staging (N stage), and distant metastatic spread (M stage), including distant nodal, osseous and visceral metastases. Results or Findings: A significant statistical relationship was found between PSA level, Gleason score and the findings in PET/CT including the pathological grade of the prostatic lesions with th eir extensions, the regional nodal deposits and the distant metastatic deposits. 68Ga PSMA shows 94% sensitivity in detecting prostatic lesions and its sensitivity increased with the increase of the PSA level of the patient, also it s hows a significant P-value in detecting extra-prostatic spread either regional or distant. Conclusion: 68Ga PSMA PET/CT is a powerful staging tool showing high sensitivity and specificity in the staging of patie nts with recently diagnosed prostate cancer. Limitations: Nothing significant.

Lara; Monterrey/MX (goba.xavier@gmail.com) Purpose: Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of death in men who die from malignant neoplasia, so new tools are being so ught to objectively predict the probability of malignant infiltration of the ly mph nodes for the adequate staging of the disease. Radiomics is the process of converting medical images into data allowing the extraction of quantitative c haracteristics. The aim of the study was the analysis of radiomic features of lymph nodes, using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, as a standard reference. Methods or Background: The design was a retrospective, cross-sectional, analytical study, which was developed with a total of 41 patients with prostate cancer diagnosis randomly selected from a database of 253 patients. 3DSlicer software was used to obtain radiomic features. Sixt een nodes were segmented per patient (pelvis, retroperitoneum, mediastinal, axillary, and cervical). The nodes segmented were those with the highest SUVmax value in the positive studies and those with the highest short axis in th e negative studies. Results or Findings: Thirty-three variables of shape and textural analys is of radiomic tomographic features were found that allow differentiating between positive and negative lymph nodes for malignancy. Conclusion: Radiomic analysis of lymph nodes in prostate cancer could detect the nodal metastatic disease even in lymph nodes of normal morphology and size. Limitations: The limitations of our study were the small sample size and that it had a retrospective design, but it was performed by a blinded observer. Also, the PET/CT images were evaluated and segmented by a single observer, so the reproducibility of the results between different observers was not evaluated.

Maksudov*, U. Khaydarov; Tashkent/UZ (muzmac@list.ru) membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 PET/CT and magnetic reso nance (MR) imaging in patients with prostate cancer. Methods or Background: Forty-five men who were scheduled for radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection wer e recruited for this study. Multiparametric MR imaging (including diffusion-wei ghted imaging, T2- weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast material-enhanced imaging) and PET/CT data were correlated with results of final p athologic examination and pelvic nodal dissection to yield diagnostic accurac y. PET/CT with 68Ga-PSMA- 11 was performed according to the whole-body protoc ol. Interpretation of images was carried out visually and quantitatively with the calculation of SUVmax. A mean dose of 3.8 mCi \u00b1 0.6 (140.6 MBq \u00b1 2 2.2) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was administered. Whole-body images were acquired s tarting 60-90 minutes after injection by using a Philips Ingenuity TF PET /CT scanner. Metabolic parameters were compared by using a paired t-test and were correlated with clinical and histopathologic variables. Results or Findings: High focal (24 cases) or diffuse (21 cases) 68Ga-PS MA- 11 uptake was found in the prostate gland in all patients with primary prostate cancer. Whereas multiparametric MR imaging depicted PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System) 4 or 5 lesions i n 36 patients and PI- RADS 3 lesions in five patients. Pathologic examination confirmed prostate cancer in all patients. In 18 patients, nodal metas tases were additionally diagnosed. Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT has a high potential in the wor k-up of prostate cancer patients, including primary diagnos is and staging, while MR imaging provides detailed anatomic guidance. The combined use of both imaging methods provides valuable diagnostic inform ation and may inform the need for pelvic node dissection. Limitations: Limitations are not required.

Methods or Background: We prospectively enrolled 101 participants with suspected NAFLD. RS85A ultrasound scanner was used with TAI and TSI applications. Patients were divided into 5%, 5%-10%, and 10% groups based on magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat-fraction (MRI-PDFF). Spearman's correlation, logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated for both TAI and TSI. Interobserver reliability was assessed with the int raclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results or Findings: P<0.001) and TSI ( showed a significant correlation with MRI-PDFF. TAI overperformed TSI in the detection of both (AUROC=0.89 vs. 0.87) and linear regression analysi s, MRI-PDFF proved to be an independent predictor of both TAI ( =1.03; P<0.001) and =-0.86; P<0.001) was negatively associated with TSI. Interobserver analysis showed excellent r eproducibility with TAI (ICC=0.95) and moderate reproducibility with TSI (I CC=0.73). Conclusion: TAI and TSI could be used successfully to measure t he severity of hepatic steatosis in clinical practice. Limitations: Limitations were single-centre study design, a smal l number of participants, mixed aetiology of NAFLD, selection bias, lack of histological samples.

Non-invasive criteria to stratify liver decompensat ion risk remained an unmet need in patients with compensated cirrhosi s. We aimed to develop and validate a non-invasive model based on spleen v olume and simple serum markers to predict decompensation in compensated ci rrhotic patients. Methods or Background: 239 compensated cirrhotic patients were enrolled from three centres in China from January 2016 to Ju ne 2020 in this retrospective study. They were followed up until the occurrence of liver decompensation. Abdominal CT and laboratory workup were collected at baseline. Spleen volume was measured automatically using an in-house AI algorithm with Dice > 0.98 in spleen segmentation. We used these data to develop a spleen volume-based model to determine th e risk of decompensation in the first centre comprising 66 patients (Training cohort). We validated it in the other two centres comprising 94 and 79 patients (Test cohorts 1 and 2). And compared with Child-Pugh scor e, MELD, and FIB-4. Results or Findings: 58 patients (24%) developed liver decompensation ov er a median follow-up of 25 months. Using a combinatio n of spleen volume, PLT, GGT, and Hb, we developed a Spleen-Alert model (Mod el score > 2.14) to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at ris k of liver decompensation. HR for decompensation in patients with high risk was 13.4 in training and 6.1 and 12.2 in test, respectively. The Spleen-Alert model has good performance to predict high-risk compensated patients at risk of l iver decompensation (C- indexes of 0.82 in training and 0.82, 0.77 in two t est cohorts), outperforming traditional non-invasive tests (C- indexes from 0.5 1 to 0.74). Conclusion: Spleen-Alert model, as a simple and non-invasive cr iterion, showed considerable performance in stratifying the individual risk of liver decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhos is.

Methods or Background: One hundred patients with 64 adrenal adenomas and 36 metastases were included eventually. Several spectral parameters of tumours such as the CT values of virtual non-contrast images (CTVNC), slopes of spectral HU curves (s-SHC), and iodine-to-CTVNC ratios were measured on spectral based images in each phase. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the diagnostic values o f combined or independent spectral parameters between adenomas an d metastases. Results or Findings: In the venous phase, all spectral parameters were significantly different between adenomas and metast ases. Combined spectral parameters showed a better diagnostic performance i n the venous phase compared with the arterial or delayed phase. In the venous phase, higher AUC was obtained for iodine-to-CTVNC value compared wit h the other spectral parameters in the differential diagnosis of adenomas and metastases, with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 90.5% and 73.8%, respectively. Higher AUC was also obtained for CTVNC value compared with the other spectral parameters in the differential diagnosis of lipid-r ich adenomas and metastases, with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 90.9% and 81.8%, respectively. In the differential diagnosis of lipid-poor adenomas and metastases, the AUC for s-SHC value was higher than those of other parameters, with diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 96.6% and 75.0%, res pectively. Conclusion: On DLCT images, spectral parameters in the venous phase such as iodine-to-CTVNC, CTVNC or s-SHC values have great clinical value in differential diagnosis of adrenal adenomas and metastases. Limitations: This was a single-centre clinical trial with a relatively small sample and the metastasis group was not pathologically confirmed.

J. Lee*, T. M. Kim, J. H. Kim, H. Chang, M. H. Choi, J. Y. Cho, S. Y. Kim; Seoul/KR (hjrosetta@gmail.com) Purpose: Monitoring adults with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is challenging due to variability in clinical and laboratory settings. Moreover, guidelines for adrenal imaging in CAH are not yet available. We evaluated the relationship between adrenal morphology and disease control status in classical CAH. Methods or Background: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 90 adult CAH patients and age and sex-matched healt hy controls (n=270). Adrenal volume, width, and tumour presence were ass essed using abdominal Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 10 computed tomography. Correlations of adrenal volume and width with hormonal status were evaluated. The diagnostic perf ormance of adrenal volume and width of patients with CAH for identifyi ng disease control was assessed. Results or Findings: Adrenal morphology of CAH patients hypot detected in 12 patients (13.3%). The a drenal volume and width of CAH patients were significantly larger than that in the control group (18.2\u00b112.2 vs. 7.1\u00b12.0cc, 4.7\u00b11.9 vs. 3.3\u00b10.5mm, - hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and androstenedione were the highest in patients with adrenal hypertrophy, followed by norm al adrenal gland for both). with adrenocorticotropic , 11- hydroxytestosterone, pregnenolone sulfate, and dehy droepiandrosterone sulfate in both male and female patients (r = 0.33-0.95, P<0.05 for all). We obtained the optimal cutoff values of 10.7cc and 4m m for classifying well- controlled patients using adrenal volume and width, respectively (AUC 0.82- 0.88, P<0.001 for both). Conclusion: We may use both adrenal volume and width as reliabl e quantitative parameters for monitoring patients wit h classical CAH. Limitations: Measuring the adrenal volume is time-consuming and laborious compared with measuring the width. To apply in clinical practice, automatic or semi-automatic volumetric assessment of the adrenal gland is warranted. Ethics committee approval: IRB approval. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Bonanomi*, P. A. Bonaffini, P. N. Franco, C. Va P. Marra, A. Falanga, S. Sironi; Milan/IT abdominal com plications in COVID-19 patients. To correlate these complications with lung involvement, laboratory tests, comorbidities and eventual antico agulant treatment. Methods or Background: Thirty COVID-19 patients underwent an abdomen CECT for not lung-related clinical symptoms (i.e. abdominal pain) between March 10th and April 26th 2020, were retrospectivel y evaluated. Ischaemic and haemorrhagic complications were recorded. For lung involvement, a parenchymal stage (early, progressive, peak, absorp tion) was assigned. Blood coagulation values, eventual anticoagulant therapy, comorbidities and eventual presence of PE were assessed. Results or Findings: Ischaemic complications had been demonstrated in 10 patients: 6/10 bowel ischaemia (thickened, intestinalis) with bowel obstruction and 4/10 is (layered wall and submucosal oedema). Main mesenteric vessels were pa tent but 1 case with superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. Two ischaemia cases also presented concurrent splenic infarctions. Bleeding complicati ons were found in 20 patients: spontaneous haematomas in soft tissues in 15, retroperitoneal hematomas in 2 and gastro-intestinal bleeding in 3. Ten presented foci of active bleeding. Platelet and lymphocyte counts wer e in their normal range. D- Dimer levels demonstrated a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.005), being higher in ischaemic cases. Most of the patients had severe lung disease (45% peak, 29% absorption). Only 2 pat ients had evidence of PE. 22 patients (hospitalised) were under anticoagulant treatment. Conclusion: Ischaemic and haemorrhagic abdominal complications may occur in COVID-19 patients, particularly during extended lung disease. CT plays a key role in the diagnosis of these potentially life -treating conditions. Limitations: Retrospective nature of the study. Small populatio n study.

Guo, S. Du, *L. Zhang*; Shenyang/CN Purpose: To investigate the value of radiomics-based tumour heterogeneity changes after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using a high spatiotemporal resolution DCE-MRI for early predict ion of pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with breast cancer. Methods or Background: A total of 140 patients (training: test=7:3) with breast cancer underwent Differential Subsampling wi th Cartesian Ordering (DISCO) DCE-MRI before (t0) and after one cycle (t1 ) of NAC. Radiomic features were extracted from postcontrast early (CE e), peak (CEp) and delay (CEd) CE-MRI phases, respectively. Feature changes (t) were computed for each phase. For training, the strongest features that associated with pCR were selected. Logistic regression classifiers based on DCE-MRI at t0, t1, t were constructed for differentiating pCR patients. The performance under different contrast phases was evaluated and compared. Clinico pathological information and the optimal imaging classifier were fused to enhance the predictive performance. Results or Findings: Imaging classifiers using radiomic feature changes (t) achieved superior performance in both training and test cohort for CEe (AUC=0.840/0.825), CEp (AUC=0.772/0.744) and CEd (A fference of NRI and IDI (all p<0.05 in the training cohort). For DCE-MRI at t0 a nd t, the CEe was the optimal contrast phase for pCR classification. After adding receptor status to CEe at t, the classifier showed the highest AUC of 0.828 in the testing. Conclusion: Using DISCO DCE-MRI, changes in radiomic features a fter one cycle of NAC, that reflect tumour heterogeneity cha nges could provide a non- invasive approach for early prediction of breast ca ncer response regardless of knowledge of the receptor status.

Niell, M. C. Lee, Czerniecki, H. Soliman; is a modified oncolytic herpes simplex 1 virus. Subjects with TNBC in this phase II trial un derwent ultrasound-guided intratumoral TVEC injections followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. Baseline and post-treatment breast MRIs were evaluated for partial vs complete response (mCR). MRI quantitative analysis was performed on dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images with v oxels assigned 8 habitats based on two criteria: high (H) or low (L) maximum contrast enhancement per Otsu algorithm, and the sequentiall y numbered dynamic sequence of maximum enhancement (H1-4, L1-4). Then, the % habitat makeup (%HM) of tumour and whole breasts (%HM of habitat X=habitat X Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 11 voxels/total voxels in the segmented volume) were evaluated and correlated with pathologic response (PR). Statistical analyses were performed using paired and unpaired t-tests, with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Results or Findings: Twenty patients were included in the study, and 11 achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). Predic tion of tumour %HM for each habitat differed significantly from whole breasts (p=0.001 or less). The %HM of ha bitat H1 (early phase, high enhancement) decreased the most after treatment (-18%, p=0.0004) followed by H2 and H3 (-14% and -4%, respectively). Conversely, %HM H4 (late phase, high enhancement) increased (12%, p=0. 031). The H1-3 combination decreased 34%, and this was more pronounced in patients with pCR (-44% vs -22%, p=0.036). Conclusion: In patients undergoing TVEC NAI/NAC treatment for T NBC, a decrease in %HM of early and mid-phase high enhancement habitats correlates with pathologic response. Limitations: Sample size.

(panagiotis.kapetas@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: To evaluate whether machine-learning (ML) models us ing selected clinical and radiomic features from pre-therapeutic , B-mode breast ultrasound (US) can predict response to neoadjuvant chemothera py (NAC). Methods or Background: 253 patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing NAC were included. One B-mode US image o f each tumour from the baseline examination was selected. Tumours were manually segmented (without-ROI1 and with inclusion of surrounding tis sue-ROI2) and overall 851 radiomic features were extracted using dedicated software. Two analyses were performed: first, principal component analysis was used for feature reduction and a multilayer perceptron neural network was trai ned using remaining radiomic and selected clinical features. 1/3 of the cases were used as an external validation set. Second, a decision tree us ing the exhaustive chi- squared automatic interaction detection method with 10-fold cross-validation was constructed. Postoperative histology was the reference standard. Diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results or Findings: 104 patients (41.1%) achieved pathological complete response. In the first model, the combination of ra diomic features, age and molecular subtype showed the highest AUC, validation set. The resulted in 66.3% correct classifications considering ROI1 and 55.4% using ROI2 in the validation set. On the other hand, decision trees based on molecular subtype and 5-6 radiomic 83.4% and 82.6%. Conclusion: ML models based on radiomic features from baseline B-mode breast US and simple clinical features have the pot ential to predict response to NAC.

R. D. grading system based tumour in breast cancer (LABC ) treated with third-generation aromatase inhibitors. Methods Fifty postmenopausal patients with ER- positive/HER-2 negative LABC treated with neoadjuva nt letrozole and exemestane were given sequentially in an intra-pati ent cross-over regimen for at least 4 months with MRI response monitoring at b aseline as well as after at least 2 and 4 months on treatment. The MRI morphological response pattern was classified into 6 categories: 0/complete Histopathological tumour regression was assessed based on the recommendations from The Royal College of Pathologi sts regarding tumour cellularity. Results or Findings: Following 2 and 4 months with therapy, the most common MRI pattern was pattern II (24/50 and 21/50, respectively). After 4 months of therapy, the most common histopathological tumour regression grade was grade 3 (21/50). After 4 months an increasing correlation is observed between MRI patterns and histopathology. T he overall correlation, between the largest tumour diameter obtained from MRI and histopathology, was moderate and positive (r=0.50, P-value=2e-04). Among them, the correlation was highest in type IV (r=0.53). Conclusion: The type II MRI pattern \"fragmentation\" was more fr equent in the histopathological responder group; and types I and IV in the non-responder group. Type II pattern showed the best endocrine responsiveness and a relatively moderate correlation between sizes obtai ned from MRI and histology, whereas type IV pattern indicated endocrine resista nce but the strongest correlation between MRI and histology.

Cimino*, M. Conti, A. Franco, A. De Filippis, C . Esposito, E. Bufi, D. Terribile, P. Belli, R. Manfredi; Rome/IT Purpose: To investigate the influence of radiological featur es measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital mammograp hy (DM), in addition to clinical factors on surgeons' choice between breast conservative surgery (BCS), oncoplastic surgery (OPS) or conservative mastectomy (CM), in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC T). Methods or Background: Preoperative MRI and DM of 255 women who underwent BCS (118 patients), OPS (50 patients) or CM (87 patients) after NACT in 2016-2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Pr eoperative radiological features analysed including the extent of micr ocalcifications, tumour volume/breast volume ratio (TVBVR) on DM and MRI, multifocality/multicentricity, in addition to histotype, grading and clinical features (menopause, BRCA mutations, ptosis, previo us breast surgery). All parameters were correlated with final surgeons' choice. Results or Findings: On univariate analysis BCS has proved to be the surgeons' choice in patients with a unifocal tumour of microcalcifications <0,42 % on DM and <3,53 % on MRI. OPS showed a significant correlation with m ultifocal tumour, the extent of microcalcifications 55-79,9 mm, TVBVR ratio pre- NACT 0,4-1,38 % on DM and 3,54-10,27 % on MRI. CM was correlated with mul T >1,38 % on DM and >10,27 % on MRI. On multivariate analysis these res ults were confirmed and were used to create a specific score to define whic h type of surgery to suggest Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 12 to patients. ROC curves were produced for each type of surgery (AUC BCS=0,840, OPS=0,751 and MC=0.871). Conclusion: Radiological features measured on DM and MRI play a fundamental role in the surgeons' choice between BC S, OPS or CM in patients treated with NACT.

Conclusion: There are complex factors determining the response to NACT. There is no standardised ADC cut-off value determining the response. ADCdiff with indirect interpretation of microvascular chang es and the rate of growth may also provide information regarding the response to NACT, as higher ADCdiff values in pCR group on pre-treatment MRI and early response assessment exam may contribute to better response a nd more adequate assessment.

Depretto, *C. De Berardinis*, G. Della Pepa, S. Di P. Scaperrotta; Milan/IT (cla.deberardinis@gmail.com) Purpose: We aimed to investigate the clinical value of mammographic density (MD) in a large consecutive cohort of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods or Background: We prospectively collected data on all NAC treated BC patients in our Institute from May 2009 to April 2020. We evaluated MD on mammograms as categorised by the Breast Imaging-Rep orting and Data System (BI-RADS), according to the following categories: A (almost entirely fat), B (scattered areas of fibroglandular density) , C (heterogeneously dense), D (extremely dense). Multivariable logistic regress ion was used to assess the odds ratios (OR) for pathological complete response (pCR), comparing BI- RADS categories with adjustment for patient age and BMI, and pre-NAC tumour characteristics. Results or Findings: We analysed 442 patients; 120 (27.1%) attained a pC R following NAC. At multivariable analysis, cases classified as BI-RADS C showed an increased likelihood of pCR as compared t o A (OR= 2.79), B (OR= 1.70), and D (OR= 1.47) age, BMI ( OR underweight vs 3.76), clinical N and (OR T1/Tx 87), molecular subtype (HER2 vs luminal= 10.74; triple-negative vs luminal = 8.19). In subgroup analyses, the strongest association of MD with pCR was observed in triple- negative (ORs of B, C, and D versus A: 1.85, 2.49, and 1.55) and HER2 BC cases (ORs 2.70, 3.23, and 1.16). No significant di fferential effect of MD with respect to pCR was observed in luminal (ORs of B, C , and D versus A: 0.88, 2.01, and 1.58). Conclusion: Patients with dense breasts are more likely to attain a pCR after NAC at net of other current clinical and pathologic al predictive factors. Limitations: The single centre design study.

Vilgrain; Clichy/FR ductal adenocarcinoma on pre-diagnostic cross-sectional im aging *M. S. Hoogenboom\u00b2, A. Chuprin\u00b9, adenocarcinoma Methods or Background: single-centre, retrospective, case-control study of 87 pre-diagnostic cross-sectional imaging studies (CT (N=60) and MRI (N=27)) of patients diagnosed with PDAC <3 years later, and 338 matched control studies (CT (N=235), MRI (N=103)). Two boar d-certified radiologists, blinded status, independently reass essed each exam. One radiologist was then unblinded and utilised the 2016 revised RADPEER criteria to grade radiological errors and further classify t hem according to the classification proposed by Kim and Mansfield (AJR, 2014). Results or Findings: Pancreatic masses were retrospectively suspected in around 57.0% of CT and MRI cases, and 1.6% of contr ols. Respectively, in comparison to available original CT and MRI reports , the reviewers concurred with the original report in 43.8% and 26.8% (RADPEE R 1), with understandable discrepancies in 29.2% and 33.3% (RA DPEER 2) and unacceptable discrepancies in 27.0% and 38.1% (RADP EER 3). The 'under- reading' error was by far the most common, occurrin g in 57.2% of CT and 45.5% of MRI cases. Errors of 'satisfaction of sear ch' occurred in 31.9% of MRI cases and 10.7% of CT cases, and 'faulty reasoning' in 17.9% of CT cases and 4.5% of MRI cases. Conclusion: Unidentified, early findings of PDAC that should not have been overlooked occur up to 27.0% of CT and 38.1% of MRI cases. Given the detrimental effects of a delayed diagnosis in this deadly disease, radiologists must be aware of these findings and be trained to p revent the most commonly occurring errors.

Mansueto; Verona/IT Purpose: The ISGPS has pancreatectomy acute pancreatitis (PPAP) requires: sustained postoperative hyperamylasemia, features and r adiological alterations consistent with PPAP. Our purpose is to analyse the CT Background: Patients who underwent major pancreatic resections between 2016 and 2021, and had a MDCT between POD3 and POD15 were incl uded. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their spAMY patterns : spAMY1: values always within/below the reference range or with a single i ncrease in spAMY>upper limit of normal at any POD; spAMY2: sustained incre ase on POD0+1; spAMY3: sustained increase in spAMY including POD1+2. Two r eaders in consensus, blinded to spAMY trends, analysed the exams and log ged arterial enhancement homogeneity, main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter, peripancreatic oedema, and fluid collections. Results or Findings: 473 patients were included (288 males, 185 females, mean age 63 years). Inhomogeneous arterial enhancem ent was more common in spAMY3 patients in spAMY2 or spAMY1 p atients 40%, 2. 40\u00b11.68mm; p<0.001). Peripancreatic fat stranding (p=0.005) and fluid collections, especially (p<0.001), were significantly more c ommon in spAMY3. Conclusion: A clear definition of the CT features of PPAP is fu ndamental for the radiological description of this entity, which will lead to its accurate and early diagnosis and thus to better treatment.

Methods or Background: Preoperative CECT images of 72 patients with GEP-NENs were retrospectively reviewed and divided into two groups (G1-G2 in class 0, G3-NEC in class1). A total of 107 radio mics features were extracted from each neoplasm ROI in CECT arterial phases acquisitions with a 3DSlicer. The Mann-Whitney test and the LASSO regression method were performed in R for feature selection and reduction to build the radiomic-based predictive model. The model was developed for a training cohor t (75% of the total) and validated on the independent validation cohort (25% ). ROC curves and AUC values were generated on training and validation co horts. Results or Findings: 40 features were found to be significant in class distinction. From the LASSO regression, 3 features were identified as suitable for group classification and used to construct the tumour grade radiomic-based prediction model: MajorAxisLength, Mean and 90Percentile, also individually statistically for group differentia tion (p-values respectively 0.001, <0.001 and <0.001). The validation cohorts, respectively. Conclusion: CT-radiomics analysis may aid in differentiating the histological grade for GEP-NENs. Limitations: Due to the low incidence of the disease, the study population is numerically limited to perform 4 groups (G1, G2, G3, NEC separately) classification statistics.

However, malignancy may occur in small cysts. Since branch-duct (BD) IP MN aren't perfect spheres, and morphologic analysis might better correlate with mucin production and grade of dysplasia. Nonetheless, their role in malignancy (high- grade dysplasia/invasive cancer) prediction has been poorly investigated. Previous studies evaluating RC also included patients with IPMN-associated/ concomitant pancreatic cancer (PC), which may affec t RC's yield. This study aimed to assess the role of volume, morphology, and other well-established RC in malignancy prediction in patients with BD- and mixed-type IPMN after excluding IPMN-associated/concomitant PC. Methods or Background: Retrospective study of 106 patients (2008-2019) with histopathological diagnosis of BD- and mixed-t ype IPMN (without associated/concomitant PC) and preoperative MRI available. Standard imaging and clinical features were collected and cyst volum e and elongation value [EV=1-(width/length)] calculated on T2-w images. Logistic regression analysis was performed and predicted probabilities (PP) were calculated. Statistical significance set at two-tails, p<0.05. Results or Findings: Neither hypothetical male >=70-years -old increased from 0.08 (95%CI:0.02-0.27) with no risk-factors, to (95%CI:0.63-0.99) with all three risk-factors. Conclusion: Volume EV mixed- MN, MPD>=5mm and elevated CA19-9 are ass ociated with higher malignancy risk even after the exclusion of IPMN-as sociated/concomitant PC.

Messner*, A. Schindl, A. Ba-Ssalamah; Vienna/ AT Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of MRI to differentiate pa ncreatic malignancy from focal pancreatitis. Methods or Background: Ninety-six patients underwent dynamic contrast- enhanced MRI, DWI and secretin-enhanced MRCP on a lesion morphology, margins, vascular infi ltration, signal intensity, enhancement, measurements of lesion and duct and du ct penetrating sign and double duct sign, were evaluated by one reader blin ded to clincal and histopathological data. Imaging diagnosis was compared to the ground truth, histopathology. Analysis was performed using descri ptive statistics as well as the Chi-square test, Student's t-test and logistic regression. Results or Findings: Histology was benign in 43 subjects (45%), malignant in 53 subjects (55%). Benign lesions (1,9%). MRI evaluated by an expert yielded a sensitivity of 94.3%, specificity of 74.4%, positive predictive value of 82.0%, negative predictive value of 91.4% and an accuracy of 85.4%. Logistic regression found that defined of t he duct penetrating sign (OR=46.854, p<0.001) were associated with malignanc dynamic sequences, DWI and secretin-enhanced MRCP can distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic lesions. While sensitivity is high for an expert ra diologist, there are many useful imaging characteristics that can aid less experienc ed radiologists in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions.

In this study, we aimed to validate the rol e of DPAR as a predictive biomarker for short-, mid- and long-term outcomes a fter TACE. Methods or Background: We retrospectively reviewed laboratory and imaging data for 103 treatment-na\u00efve patients undergoing initial TACE treatment at our tertiary care centre between January 2016 and Novem ber 2020. DPAR and other wash-in and washout indices were quantified i n the triphasic computed tomography performed before the initial TACE. The i nfluence of the DPAR on the 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month survival rates and t he median overall survival (OS) was compared to other established washout indi ces and estimates of tumour burden and remnant liver function. Results or Findings: The DPAR was significantly higher in patients who survived the first 6 months after TACE (122 vs 115, p=0.04). In addition, the number of patients with a DPAR > 120 was significantly higher in this group (n=38 vs n=8; p=0.03). However, no significant diff erences were observed in the 12-, 18-, and 24-month survival rates after the initial TACE. Regarding the median OS, no significant difference was observed f or patients with a high DPAR compared to those with a low DPAR (18.7 months vs 12.7 months, p=0.260). Conclusion: Our results confirm DPAR as the most relevant washo ut index for predicting the short-term outcome of patients with HCC undergoing TACE. However, DPAR and the other washout indices were not predictive of mid- and long-term outcomes. Limitations: Single center study and retrospective design.

Methods or Background: Patients who underwent debTACE for HCC before liver transplantation between June 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. All the patients had a co ntrast-enhanced CT or MRI examination at baseline and 1 month after treatment ; patients lacking radiological data or pathological reports of the ex planted liver were excluded. All the lesions were evaluated at baseline according to LI-RADSv2018 criteria, and the treatment response was evaluated according to mRECIST and LRTRv2018 criteria by two expert radiologists (8 and 10 years) in consensus. The pathological necrosis was calculated as a percentage on the nodular section. The statistics were performed with ROC cur ve analysis. Results or Findings: Thirty-four nodules (median diameter 19mm, range 12- 75mm) in patients (26M:4F; median age 57 y.o., r ange 51-62) were evaluated. At baseline, 4 nodules were classified as LR-M, 19 nodules as LR-5 and nodules as LR-4. 20 nodules (59%) had a compl ete response according to mRECIST and 18 (53%) according to LRTRv2018. At pathology 13 nodules (38%) had complete necrosis. mRECIST criteria achieved a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 94% and 53% (AUC 0,732, p=0,0005) for 79% Conclusion: and LRTRv2018 criteria demonstrated a comparable correlation with pathological necrosis of treated H CC.

(PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the standard of care imaging (SCI) for the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) in prim ary abdominopelvic malignancies. Methods or Background: Adult subjects were prospectively and consecutively enrolled from 4/2019 to 1/2021. Inclusion criteria were: (a) acquisition of whole-body contrast-enhanced (CE) F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/MRI (b) pathologically confirmed primary abdominopelvic malignancies. Exclusion criteria were: (a) greater than 4 weeks interval between SCI and PET/MRI and (b) unavailable follow- up. SCI consisted of with CE-CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and/or CE- MRI of the abdomen \u00b1 pelvis. If available, pathology or surgical findings served as the primary reference standard; otherwise, imagi ng follow-up was used. When SCI and PET/MRI results disagreed, medical rec ords were checked for management changes. Follow-up data were collected until 8/2021. Results or Findings: One hundred sixty-four subjects were included, eigh ty- five (52%) were female, and the median age was 60 y ears (IQR 50-69). At a subject level, PET/MRI had higher sensitivity (0.97, 95% CI 0.86-1.00) than SCI (0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.71), p<0.001, without a di fference in 0.90-0.98) for 0.93-1.00) for SCI, p=0.25. Fused PET/MRI was more sensitive MRI, p=0.023, and stand-alone PET, p<0.001. Conclusion: PET/MRI improves detection of PC compared to SCI, w hich frequently changes management.

To assess which morphologic and metabolic lymph node features in MR I and PET/MRI are the most informative to determine lymph node dignity. 3. To determine whether an adjusted threshold can increase the sensitivity of PET/MRI to exclude lymph node involvement with sufficient confidence to spar e node-negative patients and invasive procedures such as SLNB. Methods or Background: 255 patients from two centres were included for the training sample, and 48 patients from a third centr e were included for the validation sample. (PET/)MRI datasets were evaluate d regarding axillary lymph nodes. Histopathology of axillary lymph nodes served as the reference standard. For the assessment of the diagnostic perf ormance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy were calculated. Diagnostic performances were compared by a McNemar test. Results or Findings: There were no significant differences in the diagnostic performance of radiologists and machine learning al gorithms in MRI (p=0.671) and PET/MRI (p=0.683). The most important lymph node feature was a tracer uptake (ratio of SUVmax of the lymph node/SUVmax of Aorta ascendes, cut-off 1.3-fold of mediastinal blood pool), followed by ly mph node size (cut-off 7.5 mm). Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of a random forest class ifier in detecting axillary lymph node metastases is compara ble to that of an experienced radiologist. A size of 7.5 mm and a tracer uptake of 1.3-times the mediastinal blood pool are the most important features to determine the dignity of a lymph node. By adjusting the threshold, the sensitivity of the random forest classifier can be increased in a way that 54.5% of patients can be spared an invasive procedure such as an SLNB.

J. Choi*, K. W. Kim, D. W. Kim, H. Ahn; Seoul/K R (stefaniamariarita.rizzo@eoc.ch) Purpose: Diffusion-weighted imaging that reflects tumour cel lularity is emerging as a preferred method for evaluating the r esponse in oncologic imaging. For the clinical utilization of DWI as a q uantitative parameter, the repeatability and accuracy of the ADC value is crit ical. In this study, we aimed to validate variable MRI systems using Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA)/ National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) protocols and to confirm the reliability of current ly used clinical DWI protocols. Methods or Background: In this prospective study, a NIST/QIBA developed phantom with 13 PVP vials of known ADC value was us ed. The validation of the MRI systems was performed on four 1.5T and 3.0T MRI systems using the QIBA and the clinically used DWI protocols. Acquired DWI images were analyzed by commercially available web-based software (CaliberMRI, Inc., qCal-MR QC Software), and the parameters for qualit y control according to the QIBA claim were assessed. The linearity and bias of ADC measurement for each DWI protocol were calculated with linear regression. The difference of ADC values between the two protocols was evaluated with a paired T-test and a Bland-Altman plot. Results or Findings: The regression slope of estimated ADC values on all MRI systems were 1.01 (range, 1.00-1.02) for the QI BA protocol and 1.02 (0.95-1.02) for the clinical protocol within the QI BA claim. The estimated ADC values were not statistically different between the two DWI protocols. Conclusion: ADC estimation from variable MRI systems using QIBA and clinical protocols was accurate, and ADC could be c onsidered as imaging biomarker in the clinical field. Limitations: This study was performed with a small number of MRI examinations using four MRI systems. Further studie s with more examinations and MRI systems are needed to robust DWI's usefulne ss.

Seco ndary purposes were to evaluate association between sarcopenia and survival, and differences in body composition profiling at baseline and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods or Background: The study population was retrospectively selected from patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Clinical data were recorded, and CT images at the level of the 3rd lum bar vertebra were stored. By using specific software, skeletal muscle area (S MA), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and sk eletal muscle density (SMD) were extracted. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed to identify body composition features predictive of dose reduction, premature end of chemotherapy and c ycle delays. Kaplan- Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 16 Meier analyses were performed to assess overall sur vival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Wilcoxon test was performed to compare body composition features before and after neoadjuvant c hemotherapy (NACT). Results or Findings: Sixty-nine patients were included. A significant association was found between VAT and cycle delays (OR=1.01, z=2.01, 95%CI: 1.00-1.02, p< 0.05), between (OR=1.03, z=2.10, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05, p< (OR=0.92, z=-2.70, 95%CI: 0.87-0.98, p< 0.01). No significant difference emerged for OS in sarcope nic and non-sarcopenic patients, nor in CT body composition features befor e and after NACT. Conclusion: In ovarian cancer patients, CT-derived body composi tion profiling might predict the risk of chemotoxicity. In particular, VAT and SMD are associated with chemotherapy cycle delays and SMA w ith early discontinuation of chemotherapy. Limitations: No limitations identified.

Methods or Background: Consecutive patients confirmed with acute myocarditis on CMR from May 2018 to September 2020 who underwent a cardiac DECT were included in this retrospective monocentric study. Global/ maximal ECVs of the whole heart and global/maximal ECVs per layer were measured on delayed phase iodine maps. MAE included death, heart failure and serious rhythm disturbance. Pearson correlation between investigated biomarkers, univariate and multivariate analyses fo r prediction of MAE and log- rank test for survival curve (Kaplan Meier) at one- year follow-up were calculated. Results or Findings: Sixty-one patients (78.3% male, 30 (25-42) years) w ere recruited. Delay between symptoms onset and DECT was 1 (0-3) days. Eight MAEs were recorded during the first week of symptom s onset. No patient was lost to follow-up. ECVs were increased in MAE group (P values<0.05).

Magnetic Resonance (MR) myocardial T1-rho mapping has emerged as a promising tool for detecting myocardial injuri es without an exogenous contrast agent. Yet, the parameters influencing changes in T1-rho and the applicability of the technique to the broad spectrum of acute and chronic myocardial injury remains unexplored territory. The aims of this study were to identify clinical correlates of myocardial T1-rho and to examine how T1-rho mapping performs against conventional MR sequences under various diseases. Methods or Background: The 113 subjects comprised 69 patients with known ischemic (N=18) and non-ischemic (N=51) heart disease and 44 healthy controls. MR was performed on a 1.5T System (Aera, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen). Injured and remote areas were defined by an expert on LGE images. Quantitative analysis was achieved by traci ng regions of interest on pre-contrast T1-rho and T2 maps, and on post-contrast T1 and ECV maps within remote and injured areas, on short-axis slic es. Results or Findings: In healthy controls, the mean myocardial T1-rho was 47\u00b12ms. T1-rho positively related to age (R=0.4, P< 0.01) and showed higher values in females than males (48 vs 46ms, P<0,01). T1-rho increased significantly in patients with acute focal myocardi al injury (69 vs 48ms in remote, P<0.01, N=9), with focal fibrosis (64 vs 47 ms in remote, P<0.01, N=27), and with diffuse myocardial involvement (52 vs 47ms in controls, P<0.01, N=8) Myocardial T1-rho values are gender and age-dependent. The technique appears to be sensitive to acute, chronic , focal, and diffuse myocardial injuries, and may thus be a contrast-free adjunct to LGE for gaining new and quantitative insight into acute and chronic myocardial structural disorders.

Methods or Background: Prospective multicenter study involving 97 consecutive patients with AM confirmed by a multidi sciplinary heart team evaluation based on multimodality imaging (comprisi ng CMR performed according to 2018 LLc), laboratory testing, clinical features, and endomyocardial biopsy (perfomed in 33(34%) patients ). Results or Findings: Male:female ratio was 67:30. Median age was 38 year s [IQR=27-44]. All patients had increased troponinT ( 404[81-887]ng/L). 77(79%) patients had infarct-like (IL) presentation with ch est pain. The remaining 20(21%) patients had non-IL presentations with hear t failure (HF) in 14(14%) and arrhythmia in 6(6%) patients. Ejection fraction was reduced in 20(21%) patients, with significantly lower values in HF gro up (27% vs 57% and 63% in IL and arrhythmic presentation, p=0.021). 2018 LLc were positive in 97(100%) patients. 2009 LLc were positive in 77(100%) patients with IL presentation, 10(92%) with HF presentation, and 4(67%) with arrhy thmic presentation. 2018 LLc significantly improved CMR sensitivity in non-I L presentation (Fisher's exact test p-value=0.001). Patients with non-IL presentations had lower scar burden (3[1-11]% vs 9[5-13]%, p=0.005) and higher global native-T1 (1103[1059-1197]ms 68.8[32.5-100]%, p= 0.014). Conclusion: In patients with AM, CMR performed according to 2018 LLc significantly improves sensitivity in non-IL presentation. In this group, despite the smaller volume of scar, parametric mapping show s more intense and diffuse myocardial alterations. Limitations: Limited number of patients with non-IL presentation.

De Foer; Antwerp/BE RPS 808-3 Pre-intraoperative evaluation in affected CT-MR is a serious pathological condition t hat requires surgical excision as definitive treatment, with the least invasive technique. CT is the first level examination for the anatomical e valuation of the middle ear; however, it does not allow the differentiation of c holesteatoma margins from surrounding inflammatory tissue. On the contrary, R M-DWI has high specificity, with a reduced spatial resolution. The purpose of t he study is to evaluate whether CT-MRI fusion images can increase the accur acy in the diagnosis and localization of cholesteatoma, with the aim of impr oving pre-operative planning Methods or Background: 83 patients with cholesteatoma were included in our study in the time frame between October 2019 and May 2021; 20 underwent CT-MRI examination for pre-surgical planning. MR an d CT images were co- registered using a dedicated console (BrainLab, Fel dkirchen, Germany). The images with hypersignal in DWI-SE compatible with c holesteatoma were used to construct a three-dimensional \"cholesteatoma\", t o be displayed on multiplanar and 3D co-registered CT images. Results or Findings: A statistically significant difference was found be tween the volume of the cholesteatoma tissue and the surr ounding inflammatory tissue (mean volume: 1.8cm3; p <0.05). In 80% of cases, the surgical approach to the patient was modified according to the information o btained from CT-MRI fusion images. No tissue residue was detected in the group of 20 patients surgically treated using the information from CT-MRI fusion. I n the control group (63 patients), residual cholesteatoma was present in 6 cases (9.5%). Conclusion: CT and MRI images are complementary to each other. In selected cases, they should be co-registered in the pre-operative evaluation of cholesteatoma in order to optimize surgical time and aim at radical surgical resection.

Results or Findings: The 15.3mGy CTDIvol demonstrated a superior anatomical delineation and reduced quantitative art efacts compared to the two lower radiation levels (mean 3.8 / 2.9 / 1.6; 406 / 471 / 506HU; each p>0.05). Image noise showed no significant differences. Imag e artefacts decreased with higher iterative levels (no QIR = 512HU, QIR level 4 =379HU, p>0.05). Hr72 showed the best anatomical delineation (median 3.8 / 3.2-1.8) and lowest image noise (68 vs. 127-320HU) compared to Hr84, 96, and 98 (each p>0.05). Hr72 and 84 demonstrated the lowest artefact levels compared to Hr96 and 98 (388 and 357HU / 515 and 582HU, each p>0.05). Elect rode delineation showed no significant difference with perfect visibility in all radiation levels. Conclusion: In clinical PCCT of the temporal bone after cochlear implantation, a sufficiently good electrode delineation was seen in all radiation levels. Optimal anatomical delineation and artefact reducti on on higher radiation levels and lower kernels (Hr72) and quantitative artefacts reduction by higher iterative levels.

Sel*, Y. Karag\u00f6z, D. \u00d6. A. S. Mahmutoglu; Istanbul/TR (ipek_sel@yahoo.com) Purpose: Incomplete partition type II (IP II) is one of the most frequently encountered congenital inner ear malformations in c ochlear implant candidates. It is characterized by modiolar apical defects and mild vestibular enlargement. Anomalous child will develop sensorine ural hearing loss (SNHL) worsening progressively with ageing supposedly with minor traumas. Radiological diagnosis of malformation could be dif ficult with equivocal changes in tiny labyrinthine structures, especially with inexperienced viewers. Methods or Background: Our study was a retrospective case-control study including 34 SNHL patients with IP type II (66 ears ) and 24 patients (48 ears) with normal audiographic findings who underwent tem poral CT imaging. A normal group was examined tomographically for inflammatory conditions or trauma not involving labyrinthine structures. Measurements of defined inner ear structures were performed by two observers sepa rately; observer 1 is a senior neuroradiologist and observer 2 is a novice radiologist with 1 year of experience in neuroradiology. The parameters measur ed in patient and control groups were compared and interobserver reliability was calculated. Results or Findings: Lateral interscalar notch angle, lateral scalar hei ght, medial interscalar notch depth, medial scalar height, vestibular aqueduct (VA) width at the middle, VA width at operculum level, v estibular height and width were found to be significantly larger while lateral interscalar notch depth and LSSC bone island surface area were significantly sm aller in the patient group (p<0.05). These findings especially the lateral coc hlear measurements are valuably proving structural changes secondary to apical modiolar deficiency. Conclusion: CT measurements in SNHL could help to diagnose IP t ype II anomaly especially in patients with equivocal audiological and radiological findings. Limitations: No limitations identified.

Kalcioglu; Istanbul/ TR (bilgineser@hotmail.com) Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between cochlear nerve myelination and hearing loss in children with congenital non-syndromic sensorineural profound hearing loss. Methods or Background: Patients who underwent cochlear implant surgery in our university hospital were retrospectively evaluated, and 33 patients (19 boys, 14 girls) with congenital non-syndromic senso rineural profound hearing loss (>100db) were included. Current knowledge has shown that the myelinated cochlear nerve can be measured with MRI T2-weighted sequences. So that, the experienced observer measured cochlear nerve circumference (CNC) and surface area (CNSA) from FIESTA-C images taken in the sagittal oblique plane of these patients. Pearson correlation was done to understand the relationship between age and CNC and CNSA, and with t-test was done to compare means of 24 months under-over children of C NC and CNSA. Results or Findings: The mean age of the individuals is 22.52 (SD: 12.37, Range: 5 - 55) months. CNC in male patients is 3.88 (SD: 0.10) mm and in female patients 3.71 (SD: 0.09) mm, and there was n o difference. The mean CNC was 3.81 (SD: 0.41) mm. The mean CNSA we found was 1.08 (SD: 0.23) Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 20 mm2. A moderate positive correlation was found betw een age and CNC (r=0.38, p=0.03), CNSA n ot significant the t\u00adtest (p=0.06), children under 24 months (1.02, SD: 0.15 mm2) had a smaller CNSA than those over 24 months (1.17, SD: 0.32 mm2). Conclusion: This study provides weak evidence that myelination continues in its normal course in children with a congenital non \u00adsyndromic sensorineural profound hearing loss despite the absence of a hear ing signal.

Methods or Background: This interim report of an ongoing prospective clinical trial included 31 patients with HCC, who r eceived 58 cTACE procedures between 09/2020\u00ad08/2021. Peripheral bloo d was sampled before, 24h, and 8 weeks after cTACE for fluorescence\u00adactiv ated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. was employed CT were registered and Hounsfield units (HU) in a segmented tumour mask were quantified. The mean HU of the entire cohort was defined as a threshold for tumoural Lipiodol uptake. Statistics included normality and paired mixed\u00adeffects with post\u00adhoc testing. Results or Findings: Compared to threshold tumoural Lipiodol uptake (p=0.001) but values returned to baseline levels at 8 weeks (p<0.001), as compared t o patients with above Lipiodol uptake (p=0.043), where levels remained increased 8 weeks post\u00ad cTACE (p>0.999). However, in patients with below th reshold Lipiodol uptake at 24h, CD8+ TC expressing the exhaustion marker PD1 w ere higher than in patients with above threshold Lipiodol uptake (p=0. 019), but not 8 weeks post\u00ad cTACE (p=0.293). Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate possibly favorable cTACE\u00adinduced antitumoural T cell response, suggest ing Lipiodol as an imaging biomarker for the functional TC status.

De Cinque*, C. Mosconi, A. Cucchetti, A. experience and skill to be effective. The aim of th is study was to identify the determinants of survival in patients with hepatocel lular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on the learning curve, technical advanceme nts, patient selection and role of subsequent therapies. Thus, TARE results ac hieved in the initial period (2005\u00ad2012) were compared to those obtained in recent years (2012\u00ad2020). Methods or Background: From 2005 to 2020, 253 patients were treated with TARE. From 2005 to 2012, delivered activity was cal culated using body surface area (BSA) formula while, after 2012, parti tion model was used and, for the most part, selective treatments were performed. Results or Findings: Of 253 patients, 68 were treated before January 201 2 and 185 after 2012. In the second period, patients had an ECOG-PS score of 1 (p=0.025) less frequently, less liver involvement (p=0.006) and a less advanced degree of vascular invasion (p=0.019). The median overall survival (OS) of patients treated before 2012 was 11.2 months and that of patients treated beginning in 2012 was 25.7 months. After reweighting to isolate the effect of the treatment period, the median OS of pa tients before 2012 increased to 16 months. The median OS of patients w ith an adsorbed dose <120Gy was 15.7 months and that of patients with an adsorbed dose 120Gy was 26.0 months. Of subsequent therapies, only surg ery provided a survival advantage. Conclusion: Better patient selection, refinement of technique and adoption of personalized dosimetry improved survival after TARE . Conversely, the addition of sorafenib after TARE did not impact life expecta ncy. Limitations: Limitations intrinsic to retrospective studies.

Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), bilioplasty and internal\u00adexternal biliary drainage (IEBD) are standard treatments. The aim of this report is to present the preliminary experience with a new biodegradable biliary stent in the management of post SLT biliary strictures. Methods or Background: In addition to the standard treatment, 6 paediatric patients (4 males; median age 8 years, interquartil e range 6.25\u00ad9.75) with SLT underwent percutaneous biliary stent, featuri ng a slow degradation profile. To our knowledge the device is unique and the first to be CE\u00admarked for the use in this indication. Results or Findings: Percutaneous stent implantation was technically successful in all 6 patients. In the first case, ea rly stent dislodgement and migration in the bowel was demonstrated with X\u00adrays after 72 hours, without sequelae. No complications occurred during a 6\u00admont h follow\u00adup. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 21 Conclusion: Preliminary data suggest that implantation of a new biodegradable biliary stent is feasible and safe, t o be considered in the management of post SLT cholestasis in paediatric patients. Some technical considerations must be done during implantation. This device may prolong biliary drainage and may relieve the discomfort of long-term IEBD. Limitations: Small cohort study.

Knapen*, R. Korenblik, S. James, G. Dams, S. De Boer, R. Van Dam, C. Van Der Leij; Maastricht/NL (robrecht.knapen@mumc.nl) Purpose: Before liver surgery, hypertrophy-inducing procedur es, such as Portal Vein Embolization (PVE), can be performed to stimulate future liver remnant (FLR) hypertrophy. This is to reduce the ch ance of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Thermal ablation can induce l iver hypertrophy as well, but the exact influence of Radiofrequency or Microwave Ablation (RFA/MWA) on liver hypertrophy remains unclear. Therefore, liver volume changes after RFA/MWA were retrospectively analyzed. Methods or Background: Consecutive patients, with primary or secondary liver lesions, treated with RFA/MWA between January 2015 and May 2021 were included. Patients with earlier liver treatment or insufficient imaging were excluded. Total Liver Volume (TLV), volume of segment II+III, ablation volume and TLV minus ablation volume (absolute liver volum e, ALV) were calculated using OsiriX DICOM viewer and Syngo.via. ALV change after >9 weeks was used as primary outcome variable. Wilcoxon tests were used for analysing volume changes. Results or Findings: 56 patients were analysed, 36 patients with primary and 20 patients with secondary liver lesions. ALV in pa tients with secondary liver lesions increased with an average of 74.80mL (p=0.052), an average of 104.08% (SD=93.80-114.36%). Segment II+III increased with an average of 10.30mL (p=0.044), percentage average of 104.34% (S D=93.37-115.31%). ALV and segment II+III in patients with primary liv er lesions remained stable with an average of 100.98% (SD=92.02-110.94%, p=0.863) and 101.82% (SD+85.22-118.42%, p=0.551), lesions ALV and segment II+ III increased after MWA/RFA with 4%, while livers with primary liver lesions remained stable. This suggests that performing an a blation in livers with secondary liver lesions could further increase the FLR, and can be additional to FLR-hypertrophy inducing procedures. This might fur ther help decrease PHLF, but needs to be validated in clinical trials. Limitations: No limitations identified. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

J. J. Freichel, T. To retrospectively evaluate the development and tec hnical progress in local oncological treatments of hepatocellular c arcinoma (HCC) regarding survival rates between 1993 and 2020. Methods or Background: In total, 1.046 HCC patients (824m/222f) were 4.1 cycles/ patient). Results were evaluated regarding overall survival (OS) according to Kaplan-Meier and log- rank test for comparing the groups. A p-value 0.05 was considered significant. Results or Findings: Median survival was 593 days for LITT with 1-/3-/5- year survival of 64.0%/24.0%/20.0% and 959 days for combined LITT+TACE with 83.6%/40.3%/14.9%. The total complication rate per LITT treatment subcapsular haematoma and cutaneous wound infections, but no mortality. Median survival for MWA+TACE was 1,505 days. In the MWA group 1-/3-/5- 91.2%/76.9%/75.0%; for MWA 83.3%/ 55.7%/ 48.3%. The median survival time for TACE only was 474 days with 1-/3-/5-year survival rates of 58.1%/34.7%/30.2%. Conclusion: Survival rates of MWA and MWA+TACE are significantl y higher with less complication rates vs. TACE monotherapy a nd both LITT groups. However, prospective data remain necessary to furth er evaluate the superiority of either modality. Limitations: Retrospective study design.

Cignini*, Menchini, C. Gazzera, P. Fonio; Turin/IT Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of a new 150-W generator for microwave ablation of liver lesions. Volume, spheri city of the ablation zone as well as adverse events were evaluated. No available data are present in the literature. Methods or Background: Prospective collection of data was performed including all the patients who underwent microwave ablation, treated using the 150-W generator since March 2021. Procedures were p erformed under conscious sedation in the CT room for immediate con trol of the ablation zone; the microwave ablation antenna (Emprint Medtronic 14G) was inserted under US guidance. Collected data included among the others: ablation mean time, pre- and post-ablation volume, sphericity index, ablation margins, presence of gas artefacts in the veins, THAD. Adverse events we re evaluated according to Clavien-Dindo Classification. Results or Findings: 16 hepatic who underwent percutaneous MWA where included in this observational prospective study. A blation time was 5,8 min. The mean ablation and ablation volumes of previously reported series using the 100 W generator with the same antenna. Me an sphericity index was 0,8125 (range 0,7-1,1), similar to the manufacturer chart and other series using the 100 W generator. Vascular abnormalities at the immediate CT control were observed in 5 patients (3 THAD, 4 gas artefacts in the veins). No adverse events were registered. Conclusion: The new 150-W generator provides effective and large ablation volume with predictable sphericity index and high s afety profile, in absence of severe adverse events.

Van Ongeval; Leuven/BE (hilde.bosmans@uzleuven.be) Purpose: To verify the performance of a newly installed, new generation photon-counting CT scanner for potential applicatio ns in high-resolution CT scanning and spectral imaging. Methods or Background: A quality control program was developed for commissioning a Siemens-Healthineers NAEOTOM Alpha CT including tests for 2 specific applications: virtual non-contrast i maging (VNC) and ultra-high resolution (UHR). Results were to Siemens- Healthineers Force (CT_F) and Edge CT (CT_E). Automatic exposure choic es were verified for different phantoms/conditions. The measurements use d an in-house phantom with different iodine concentrations, the Catphan p hantom, and QRM phantom with liver lesion inserts for model observer (MO) detectability. Results for 120kV spectral imaging (4 dose levels/3 matrix size s) and 120kV UHR scanning are reported. Results or Findings: Median and range of iodine HUs in the VNC of iodine- filled tubes were respectively -4.7 HU and 9.6 HU f or the NAEOTOM, 0.6 HU, and 18.9 for CT_F and -14.7 and 17.7 for CT_E. HU difference showed less variation versus dose for the NAEOTOM. The 50% valu e of the task transfer function (TTF) for the Catphan air insert was 0.38m m-1 for all three scanners in standard mode, while this value was 1.41 mm-1 for t he NAEOTOM UHR. Reconstructed volume size impacted MO results: imag es with slice 1024x1024 slice voxel matrix had significantly lower threshol d 4.22mm \u00b1 0.08mm, compared at 512x512 (p<0.03). Conclusion: The results confirmed the added value of the new generation scanner. Added value is expected from the UHR scanning and the improved spectral characteristics. Virtual non-contrast imag es have a minimal fraction of iodine contamination; many choices for the pre-programmed parameters selections were confirmed. Limitations: More test result will be presented at the conferenc e. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: We scanned a phantom at three dose levels: standard dose (13mGy), reduced dose (9mGy), and low dose (4mGy). Raw data was reconstructed using three different soft t issue kernels for FBP and MBIR at three levels. The noise power spectrum (NPS ), the normalised one (nNPS), and the task-based transfer function (TTF) for one phantom's insert were computed following the method by AAPM-TaskGroup-233. Detectability of simulated lesion (low-contrast with (NPWE). Results or Findings: The nNPS, NPS, and TTF changed differently depending on kernels and MBIR levels. The NPS for i mages reconstructed using the highest level of MBIR showed a reduction of 50% for the noise magnitude, but also a shift of about 30% in peak fr equency. The noise magnitude using Qr36 and Br32 kernels was 25% and 4 0% less than Br40. These variation, combined with the different TTFs, had an effect on detectability, which increased by about 10% and 5%, respectively. For each dose and kernel, the use of MBIR increased the detectability by more than 40% if used at the highest level. However, NPS's al terations, due to different MBIR levels and kernels, turned out in a different image texture, which was not always well accepted in clinical setting. Conclusion: Starting from the detectability of standard protoco l, we could reduce the dose choosing a new kernel-IR combinatio n maintaining the same detectability. Depending on MBIR's level currently used, the dose reduction ranged from 15% up to 55%. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

In current dose tracking systems, statistical parameters are calcul ated based on full distribution of the patients doses. The aim of the study is to c heck the differences between 75th percentiles of both distributions and evaluate the possible impact for decision whether mean dose exceeds LDRL. Methods or Background: Dose data collected by DTS was exported to excel files and subsequently statistical parameters were recalculated. Analysed data concern, according to ICRP 135 recommendation, total DLP form whole examination that means 1st phase without contrast a gent (chest, abdomen, pelvis), 2nd phase after 35s (chest + abdomen), and 3rd phase after 60s (abdomen + pelvis). Mean, median, and 75th percenti le were calculated for 2110 patients divided by 6 relevant group of BMI (t otal 1567 patients) and one group of 543 patients for which BMI data wasn't available. Results or Findings: The impact of the ICRP 135 methodology, result in change of the LDRL by the factor -1,1%\u00b10,8% which i s around 10,3%\u00b18% of the interval between median and 75th percentile of dose distribution. For the cohort without BMI data, change in LDRL is 0,7%, which is 1,9% of the 36% dose between median (825,9 mGy*cm) to ICRP 135). Conclusion: Calculations provided by DTS, which do not implement the ICRP 135 approach, are connected with small statistical error and therefore should not impact the main purpose of the dose management, which is optimisation and general check if LDRL is exceeded e.g. due to equipment issues or changes in protocols.

Riga, D. Curto, F. M. Felis i, C. De Vanzulli, A. Torresin; Milan/IT (gaia.muti@unimi.it) Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the dose reduction achievable to obtain same detectability across computed tomography scanners w ith different model- based iterative-reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm dev eloped by three manufacturers. Methods or Background: Three CT system with full (IMR, Philips), partial (Asir-V, GE), and advanced (ADMIRE, Siemens) MBIR w ere used to scan a phantom at three doses: standard dose (13mGy), reduced dose (9mGy), and low dose (4mGy). The study was conducted using a st andard kernel across different vendors and raw data were reconstructed using filtered-back projection (FBP) and three IR level (low/medium/high). The noise power spectrum (NPS), the normalised one (nNPS), and the task-based transfer function (TTF) for one phantom's insert were comput ed following the method proposed by AAPM-TaskGroup-233. Detectability of sm all lesion for soft tissue (contrast-task | HU|=100, 5mm diameter) was calculated using non-pre - whitening with eye-filter model observer (NPWE). Results or Findings: NPS, nNPS, and TTF changed differently depending on CT systems. The highest value of detectability was found for advanced-MBIR, followed by full-MBIR, and last partial-MBIR for same dose and iterative strength: detectability of GE and Philips were about 40% and 25% lower than Siemens, respectively. For each system, same detect ability of standard dose FBP reconstruction was achieved with lower doses ch oosing a higher iterative level. For Siemens there was a reduction of 10%, 30%, and 50% using an ADMIRE level 1, 3, and 5; for Philips there was a r eduction of 40%, 45%, and 50% using an IMR level 1, 2, and 3; for GE there wa s a reduction of 15%, 20%, and 30% using an Asir-V level of 30%, 50%, and 70%, respectively. Conclusion: Different MBIR algorithms were compared and the pos sible dose reduction using higher iterative levels was evaluat ed by a task-based metric. Limitations: Not applicable.

M. S. Sawall, M. Kachelrie\u00df; Heidelberg/DE Purpose: scatter artifacts in cone-beam CT (C BCT) scans without requiring specific knowledge of the scannin g system and without the need for Monte Carlo simulations or trained neural networks. Methods or Background: The image quality of CBCT scans often suffers from scattered radiation. Scatter corrections can be done using Monte Carlo simulations or the deep scatter estimation [Maier et al., Med. Phys. 46(1):238- 249], for example. A drawback of such methods is that they require detailed knowledge about the CT system to be able to model s catter accurately enough. We propose the empirical scatter correction (ESC), which generates scatter-like basis projections from each projection image. A linear combination of these basis projections is subtracted from the m easured projections in intensity domain. The log is taken and an FDK reconstruction is performed. The coefficients needed for the linear combination are determined automatically such that the reconstructed images show almost no scatter artifacts. We demonstrate the potential of ESC by c orrecting simulated and measured data. Results or Findings: ESC is able to improve the image quality of the simulated data and the CBCT scan significantly. In soft tissue areas with severe scatter artifacts, the CT values closely mat ch those of the ground truth (e.g. for the phantom measurement: difference to sl it scan: -13 HU corrected, - 289 HU uncorrected). Conclusion: As the simulation results and the comparison to a s lit scan show, ESC is able to reduce artifacts caused by scatter s olely based on the projection data. Knowledge about the x-ray spectra or the materials involved is not required.

Devic\u00b9, M. both t he equipment and the patient may lead to a paradigm shift in computed tomography dosimetry. The aim of this work is to compare dose index measu red by a new real-time in vivo dosimeter under clinical CT conditions and est imated dose index displayed by scanners, and to detect any anomalies during CT procedures. Specific cases are presented. Methods or Background: A multicentric study was conducted in 4 French medical centers and 5 CT scans from 3 different manufacturers. An innovative detector, based on a scintillating optical fiber (I VIscan\u00ae, FIBERMETRIX, France) has been used routinely to measure CTDI and DLP. The IVIscan\u00ae system was also used to determine the z-axis CTDI m apping and distribution for procedures including those involving several ac quisitions. Results or Findings: Dose indexes were generally consistent with those displayed by the scanners independently of the manu facturer, which validates the use of the IVIscan\u00ae device under clinical condi tions. However, large differences have been observed for some examinations and allowed us to detect scanner modulation failures and poor patient positioning leading to overdoses up to +300%. In addition, CTDI mapping al lows a better assessment of the dose actually delivered during a CT procedur e compared to the average CTDI usually used especially for procedures with several acquisitions. Conclusion: Thanks to reliable real-time measured dose indexes and an innovative CTDI mapping system, IVIscan\u00ae is an independent dosimetric monitoring tool which allows to detect dose heterog eneities and identify possible malfunctions of the CT device or unusual p ractices. Limitations: Headrest head CT could not be integrated in this st udy. Ethics committee approval: The data used in this study do not require ethics committee approval. Funding for this study: This study is part of the development of the materi al used and did not require specific research funding.

Liu, Serrao, T. Sadler; Cambridge/UK (michael.morgan9@nhs.net) Purpose: Iodinated contrast (IC) mediums are vital in various imaging modalities. Reported allergies to IC can lead to su boptimal diagnostic workups and the erroneous denial of indicated procedures. W e aimed to determine the number of suboptimal CT studies due to IC allergy i n our institution and understand whether referral to the immunology aller gy service provided any benefit. Methods or Background: The electronic medical records (EMR) of all patient s who underwent a CT and were documented to be \"aller gic to IC\", in a two-year period at a single tertiary care hospital were retr ospectively reviewed. EMRs were evaluated for documented allergies to 'brand' and 'generic' IC, type of allergy and relevant allergy clinic referral. Aller gies were coded as mild, moderate, severe, physiological or unknown. Results or Findings: 141652 CT studies were performed over the period wi th 1% (545 patients) meeting the study criteria. Suboptimal imaging was acquired in 40.5% of the relevant CTs (221 patients). 75/221 patients had a 'mild' allergy. A total of 26 patients were referred to an allergy clinic, with 54% cleared upon review. Cleared patients had a 'mild' or 'unknown' allergy severity in 79% of the cases. Conclusion: IC medium is essential for providing accurate diagn oses and is relatively safe. An erroneous allergy to IC can dep rive patients of crucial diagnostic imaging. We found that allergies occurred in 1% of our CT volume and patients with a 'mild' or 'unclear' allergy gai n the most from allergy testing referral, with 79% being cleared of their allergy. Limitations: External allergy testing would not be captured by o ur EMR leading to a potential underestimate in the number of our patients who have undergone testing.

Andropova*, D. G. Cheremisin, P. Gavrilov; St. Petersburg/RU (polin.and@icloud.com) Purpose: The objective of this study was to describe the agr eement in the assessment of early ischaemic changes in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory between expert raters of various qualific ations. Methods or Background: We identified patients presenting with hemiparesis or aphasia at the emergency department who underwen t CT. Eight raters of different skill levels and various qualifications r eviewed and scored the anonymised CT scans of 100 patients. The list of ex pert raters included: two neuroradiology fellows, two radiologists (with thre e years of experience in emergency neuroradiology), two radiologists (with t hree years of experience not in urgent medicine), and two experienced emergency neuroradiologists (more than eight years experience). The expert raters completed a preliminary interpretation form that included their classificat ion of the interpretations as follows: \"presence,\" \"absence,\" of signs of an MCA stroke. And also, the presence or absence of such signs as (1) hyperdense MCA sign, (2) sulcal effacement, (3) par enchymal hypoattenuation, and (4) focal swelling or mass eff ect were appreciated. Interobserver agreement was measured with the kappa statistic, sensitivity, and specificity. Results or Findings: The measured interobserver agreement had an interval of 0.2-0.7 for any aforementioned early ischaemic c hanges. The detection of early signs of ischaemia changes with CT had a mean accuracy of 85%, a sensitivity of 81%, and a mean specificity of 88%. Conclusion: There's a clear necessity in further elaboration of determination of most reliably detected signs and understanding t he role of scoring systems in detection improvement. Limitations: The experts were not presented with data on the cli nical manifestation indicating the ischaemic hemisphere. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institute of Human Brain of RAS.

H. Halldorsson\u00b9, M. T. Nummela\u00b2, with severe penetrating trauma may require emergency surgery on arrival, and postoperative CT can reveal additional significant injuries. To determine the utility of postoperative CT performed within 48 hours of emergency surgery after penetrating trauma. Methods or Background: Trauma registry data was retrieved retrospectively over a seven-year period (2013-2019) at a single level 1 trauma center. All patients, 17-years and older, admitted with penetrating injury, who underwent urgent surgery and postoperative CT imaging within 48 hours, were included. Preoperative and intra-operative medical records were compared to CT findings. Results or Findings: Patients with gun shot wounds (GSWs) had a longer ICU length of stay and were more severely injured t han patients with stab wounds (SWs) (mean ISS, 23.00; range, 1-75; for GSW 28.19, = 0.0422). 20 out of 38 patients (52. 6%) had additional findings at postoperative CT, most of which were minor. Six patients (15.8%) had previously unidentified or underestimated findings at CT that were severe enough to warrant additional surgery or interventio nal angiography. Conclusion: CT imaging after emergency surgery in penetrating t rauma is an important tool in evaluating the injury as a whole and revealing previously undiagnosed and unexpected injuries. Six out of 38 (15.8%) patients had findings at postoperative CT that warranted additional surgical or angiographic intervention. Limitations: Our analysis is retrospective and patients were onl y selected from a single level 1 trauma center. Small cohort size w ith limited statistical power. No control group.

W. P. Wong*, E. Sun, E. Goralnick, A. Salim, B. Khurana; Boston, MA/US Purpose: The WHO estimates that one out of six elders has ex perienced some form of abuse over the past year, with impact ranging from diminished quality of life to physical injury and death. Scree ning is a recognised strategy for detection, but less effective in elders with a diminished ability to communicate or psychosocial reasons to fear disclos ure. This study aimed to identify imaging findings of elder abuse. Methods or Background: This retrospective case control study identified 12 patients above 60 years of age with keywords \"assault\" and \"abuse\" from a multi-institutional trauma registry database from 2015-2020, as well as 12 age and gender matched controls. Demographic information, clinical information, and imaging findings were reviewed. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 25 Results or Findings: Our case series demonstrated excellent agreement wi th known risk factors for elder abuse. Rib fractures, extra-axial head injuries, and upper extremity injuries were most commonly seen, c onsistent with prior reports of successfully prosecuted cases of elder abuse. In one case, radiologists identified injuries occult on physical examination but extensive on imaging in a patient who was reported to have falle n. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that radiologists can be helpful in the assessment of elder abuse, identified head injuries and upper extremity injuries as warning signs of elder abuse, and highlighted the importance of further research to identify imaging findings of elder abus e. Limitations: This case control study was limited by the small number of patients identified as victims of elder abuse, draw n from the northeastern United States, and limited assessment of patient an d abuser risk factors.

P reoperative recognition of the condition is difficult but imperative to institute early management. We did a pilot study, involving 10 cases of abdominal cocoon, all secondary to abdominal tuberculosis and evaluated the most common radiological findings. The aim of the study was to evaluate the most commo n findings of cocoon secondary to Koch's abdomen. Methods or Background: All ten patients underwent radiological evaluation in the form of ultrasonography (USG) followed by cross -sectional imaging in the form of computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic r esonance imaging (MRI). All the radiological findings were recorded and compared with clinico- pathological findings. Results or Findings: In all ten patients, the disease was diagnosed accurately with radiological investigations using clinical and pathological findings as the gold-standard. In eight out of ten cases, follow-up imaging following ATT revealed complete resolution while in rest 2 case; diagnosis was confirmed with biopsy and ATT following laparotomy done for i ntestinal obstruction. Conclusion: Prior to imaging era, the correct diagnosis of abdo minal cocoon was usual only at surgery where the abdominal cocoo n appeared as a dense grey white capsule containing a part or whole of th e small bowel. The bowel loops within the cocoon can usually be easily freed in spite of adhesions. Late cases, however, may be associated with necrotic cha nges in the bowel wall requiring bowel resection. Abdominal cocoon is an uncommon feature of tuberculosis. Thick fibrotic peritoneal membrane wr apping the small bowel is pathognomonic. This condition can be diagnosed with confidence by utilising various radiological investigations. Early recognit ion results in proper management and prevents the need for bowel resectio n.

Crivelli; Sassari/IT (g.piga88@virgilio.it) Purpose: The goal of this study was to establish how CT infl uenced subsequent therapeutic choices in patients with sus pected acute colitis. Methods or Background: Between January and June 2021, we retrospectively reviewed the CT scans of 48 patient s admitted to our Emergency Department, with a suspected clinical dia gnosis of colitis. CT findings were compared to the clinical, surgical, or endoscopic findings. The severity of the CT findings was assessed on the bas is of the wall patterns and/or associated complications. The type of treatm ent each subject underwent in relation to the CT findings was then e valuated. Results or Findings: All the patients showed transmural wall thickening at CT. Thirty/48 patients (62,5 %) had target and/or halo sign and treated conservatively. Two people (4,1 %), one with pneuma tosis and one with reduced wall enhancement, underwent surgical coloni c resection. Two/48 patients with an abscess collection (4,1 %) were tr eated with percutaneous drainage. Three patients (6,2 %), one with perforat ion secondary to wall ischemia and peritonitis and another two with sever e and extensive pneumatosis, rapidly died. Therefore, the CT signs that changed the clinical decision were pneumatosis, ischemic wall changes or abscess. Based on the CT findings, 46/48 (95,8 %) patients were treated c onservatively. Conclusion: High performance of CT allows to direct the patient towards NOM (Non-Operative Management), alternatively to surger y or percutaneous drainage, allowing a timely differential diagnosis, reducing the number of unnecessary laparotomies and the number of intra and extra-hospital mortality. Limitations: Retrospective study, with limited sample. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Devereux, R. Young, *M. F. F. McEntee*; Cork/IE (mark.mcentee@ucc.ie) Purpose: Dementia is an umbrella symptom, encompassing a num ber of different diseases. It results in progressive cogni tive decline. Diagnostic imaging plays a major role in the diagnosis of dementia, however patients with dementia attend from imaging for diagnosis of all diseases and injuries. Caring for them in a short visit can be challenging. The aim of this study is to determine Irish radiographers' opinions towards car ing for patients with dementia in the radiology department and to examine the protocols that exist. Methods or Background: This was a qualitative study, which utilised two focus groups to collect study data. A total of elev en radiographers participated in the data collection. The focus groups were trans cribed and thematically analysed using NVivo software. Results or Findings: Participants reported being apprehensive in caring for patients with dementia. No guidelines existed for c aring for patients with dementia in Irish radiology departments. The themes that emerged were: (1) practice concerns (patient care, distress, quality of imaging fear, physical violence, safety, consent, justification, compassion), (2) change management of patient care (improving practice, willingness to change), (3) infrastructure and staffing (time, scheduling, carers, support) an d (4) knowledge and attitudes (experience, expectations, knowledge, und erstanding, stigma). Conclusion: Radiographers have concerns about caring for patients with dementia. There is a lack of knowledge about dement ia care amongst the participants. Improvements in knowledge should be addressed. The development and implementation of best practice gui delines to care for patients with dementia would standardise the care of patients. Limitations: Only one researcher interpreted and analysed the focus group data. Going forward it would be worth assessing radiographers in multiple hospitals, both within the public and private sectors.

Myklebust; Drammen/NO (elin.kjelle@usn.no) Purpose: To assess how healthcare managers and personnel exp erience the quality, organisation and value of a rural telemedi cine, remote-controlled CT stroke evaluation service. Methods or Background: Semi-structured interviews were conducted and covered ten individual and one focus-group interview including managers, paramedics, radiographers, and junior doctors. The interview guide consisted of the following themes: experience of working with the service, task shifting, quality, management and challenges. Interviews were recorded and transcribed before thematic content analysis was us ed to develop a narrative of the findings. Results or Findings: Findings were categorised into teamwork, quality, v alue of the service, organisation of the project, and fr om project to permanent service. Participants perceived the service as valuable for patients and the local community. The service included task shifting where paramedics positioned the patient in the CT-scanner, while the radiographer ran the scan remotely. This required education, training and changing of routines to facilitate the telemedicine service. The participants experienced the process as both challenging and interesting. The service was consid ered to improve patient care and health services in the community. Conclusion: The service was perceived as valuable to the local community and of high quality. Communication, training, flexi bility, and cooperation within and between the departments locally, as well as wit h the external hospitals appears to be a key factor for a successful impleme ntation and long-term sustainability of the service. Limitations: This study has a combination of one focus group and several individual interviews. This was due to two factors: the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty in recruitment. This combination may lead to a different depth in data obtained from managers in t he focus group compared to managers and personnel in the individual interviews .

Chukwuani*\u00b9, The aim of this paper is to review the current stat e of imaging service delivery for elderly cancer patients, and examine how to shape the future direction of clinical imaging service delive ry to cater for an increasingly ageing population. Methods or Background: Due to ageing, cancer is majorly a disease of the elderly. It is also clearly established that clinic al imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cancer. Clinical im aging is utilised at all stages of the cancer patient pathway: diagnosis, st aging, selecting the appropriate therapy, and follow up. In a nutshell, an increasingly ageing population means more cancer cases, resulting in more demand for imaging service needs. Results or Findings: The elderly have special needs, and the imaging study of the elderly poses unique challenges. The current heterogenous models of care are majorly adapted to local priorities, needs and available resources. There is an urgent need to draw up models of care s pecially tailored to address the needs of the elderly in imaging. With the NHS Long Term Plan mapped out, it is hoped that the care for elderly cancer patients should see a significant boost in resource allocation. Some of these resourc es could be channelled into drawing up plans on how to ensure the provision of dedicated imaging service for elderly cancer patients. Conclusion: Looking into the future, imaging service will requi re a lot of investment in imaging equipment, and human resources - skillfully trained to effectively understand and cater for the special needs of an increasingly ageing population. Limitations: This paper is the result of review of available lit erature, and focused on the UK experience. Ethics committee approval: Ethics Committee approval was obtained for this study.

To gain an insight into the main barriers and facilitators to inclusive and safe MRI examinations when scanning autistic adults or child ren. Methods or Background: Two online surveys were used, one for autistic individuals over 16 years of age, and the other for parents/carers of autistic individuals, with prior MRI experience. Snowball sampling was employed; the surveys were distributed through the researchers' networks and through the autistic community on Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, the National Autistic Society and the London Autism Group. The surveys were open between February 1st and April 30th, 2021. Patient and publ ic involvement was employed during all stages of the project. The SPSS software was used for statistical analyses. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 28 Results or Findings: A total of 128 valid responses were received (112 autistic adults and 16 parents/carers of autistic c hildren). The main barrier to a successful MRI scan was poor communication either between healthcare services or between patients and practitioners. Non-disclosure of autism occurred in more than half of the responses (53,6%) . Failure to provide customised MRI examinations or autism-friendly MRI environments with reasonable adjustments (82.9%) were major contribut ing factors to a poor patient experience. Conclusion: Current practice in MRI scanning is not taking into account the autistic service user's needs. Optimal communication throughout and provision of reasonable environment adjustments is vital to ensure inclusive MRI scanning practices. Limitations: Both research design and methodology, and recruitme nt of participants were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions . Convenience sampling means results should be interpreted with caution.

Methods or Background: An online survey was constructed on Qualtrics and pilot-tested by field experts. All UK-based MRI radiographers were invited to participate. The snowball sampling technique was em ployed. The survey was distributed by three recruitment agencies between D ecember 2020 and February 2021 on social media. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the results using the SPSS software. Results or Findings: This study received 130 valid responses. Effective communication between the patient and the MRI radiographer, adjusted MRI unit environment, and customisation of the MRI exam ination were found to be beneficial for a successful MRI examination. However, a persistent lack (but also desire) of autism-related training was noted ( 75.6%). Poor patient- practitioner communication, lack of training (41.5% ), lack of Special Educational Needs experts (38.6%), and lack of spec ific guidelines (37.7%), were the main barriers to a successful MRI examinat ion. Conclusion: Reasonable adjustments are required when scanning autistic individuals, mainly in the context of communication and the MRI unit environment. Formal training is required for MRI radiographers, and guidelines should also be established to assist them in clinic al practice. Limitations: The number of responses and the use of convenience sampling mean that the results cannot be seen as representat ive of the UK-based MRI radiographers, but they still offer some useful ins ights. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the recruitment of radiographers as they were working on the frontline during the second nat ional lockdown.

Ellul\u00b9, *F. (francis.zarb@um.edu.mt) Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether the introduction of music medicine (MM) during mammography examinations, has an effect on the anxiety level experienced by clients undergoing breast cancer screening. Methods or Background: This study followed a quantitative, prospective, an d experimental design. Participants were imaged accor ding to the local breast cancer screening protocol, with the experimental gr oup being exposed to MM, selected based on the literature. Anxiety levels we re measured before and after each mammogram via the State-Trait Anxiety In ventory for Adults research tool. Results or Findings: Participants in both experimental and control groups experienced a statistically significant increase in anxiety levels before the mammogram, when compared to their normal anxiety levels (p=<0.001). Both groups experienced a statistically significant decr ease in anxiety levels after the mammogram when compared to their anxiety levels before the mammogram (experimental group: p=0.005; control group: p=0.001). No significant statistical difference (p=0.907) in the anxiety levels after the mammograms was recorded between the experimental an d control groups. Conclusion: Anxiety levels indicated that mammography screening induces anxiety and that anxiety levels were reduced in bot h groups after the mammography examination. A variable contributing to this reduction could be MM. Thus, MM could be used in the clinical setting since it is non-invasive and cheap. Nonetheless, in this study MM had no statist ical significant effect in decreasing anxiety levels during mammography screening. Limitations: Due to the cost of the research tool, the study had a small sample size (n=50). Thus, only MM was investigated as a va riable and no music choice was given to participants. Further studies w ith a larger sample size, a choice of music from different genres and investiga ting other variables which affect anxiety levels are recommended.

K oskinen\u00b2; diagnostic accuracy gy CT (DECT) for the detection of ACL tears in the acutely and subac utely injured knee with arthroscopy as reference method. Methods or Background: Patients with suspected ACL injury were imaged with DECT (Somatom Force, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and 3.0 T MRI (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Nether lands). Clinically blinded images were independently read by two radiologists. ACL was classified as normal or abnormal. Arthroscopy served as reference standard. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Al so, sensitivity between DECT and MRI was assessed. Results or Findings: 48 patients (26 M, 22 F, mean age 23 years, range 15- 37 years) were imaged a mean 25 days following trauma. Of these, 21 patients Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 29 underwent arthroscopy with a mean of 195 days after trauma. Arthroscopy revealed 19 ACL tears and 2 ACLs with no tear. The sensitivity was 76.3% (95% CI 66.8\u00ad85.9) and 86.8 (95% CI 71.9\u00ad95.6) for MRI, respectively (p=0.223). The positive predictive val ue (PPV) was 93.5 (95% CI 84.3\u00ad98.2) and 91.7 77.5\u00ad98.3) for DECT and MRI, respectively. Conclusion: DECT has lower sensitivity to detect an ACL rupture than MRI but the difference was not statistically significant. The PPV was high in both methods. Limitations: The age of the subjects (15\u00ad40 years) limits the generalizability of the results to older populations. The low number of true negatives did not allow to calculate specificity.

Mandl\u00b9, Sch\u00f6llnast\u00b9; \u00b9Graz/AT, \u00b2Schlad ming/AT Purpose: To assess the frequency of ramp lesions (RL) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries in MRI of patients with ver ified anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, and to describe the coexistence of these injuries with further injuries of the knee. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 163 patients with surgical repair of ACL tears were included. MRI sca ns were reviewed for RL, which were defined according to Greif et al., and A LL injuries. In addition, all coexisting meniscal injuries, injuries of the medial and lateral collateral band and bone marrow oedema were recorded. The correlati on of RL and ALL\u00ad injuries with coexisting injuries was tested for st atistical significance using Pearson's chi\u00adsquare test. After Bonferroni correct ion for multiple testing a p<0.003 was defined as statistically significant. Results or Findings: RL occurred in 52 patients (31.9%). RL were significantly associated with tears of the posterio r horn of the medial meniscus (67.3% versus 19.8% of patients with/without RL, bone oedema in tibia with/without ALL\u00adinjuries were detected in 52 patients (31.9%). ALL\u00adinjuries were significantly associated with a tear of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscu s (51.9% versus 16.2% of patients with/without ALL\u00adinjury, respectively), te ar of the medial collateral ligament (40.4% versus 16.2% of patients with/witho ut ALL\u00adinjury, respectively) and tear of the lateral collateral ligament (19.2% versus 0.9% of patients with/without ALL\u00adinjury, respectively). Conclusion: The findings of our study demonstrate that in patie nts with ACL\u00ad tears, the frequency of RL and ALL\u00adinjuries is abou t 32%. Both injuries are frequently associated with further injuries of the knee, which are different between RL and ALL\u00adinjuries. Limitations: Lesions not confirmed with arthroscopy.

Klontzas*\u00b9, Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) of the knee are commonly found in the context of subchondral insufficiency fractures (SIF ) and advanced osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of our work was to utilize deep l earning in the form of convolutional neural networks to differentiate betw een the two conditions. Methods or Background: The study dataset consisted of MRIs of knees with BMLs in the context of SIF (n=212) and OA (n=102), which were retrospectively collected and augmented to create a final dataset of 1174 images. Transfer learning was applied by utilizing an ImageNet\u00adpretrained InceptionV3 convolutional neural network (CNN) whic h was fine\u00adtuned with the use of the aforementioned MRI dataset. CNN performa nce was assessed on a validation cohort of 87 images of each group and was compared to that of two MSK radiologists with the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and areas under the curve (AUC). Precision, recall and f1\u00adscores were computed for the CNN and expert readers. Results or Findings: InceptionV3 achieved an AUC and 81/87 images. The first of the two MSK radiologists performed equally to the CNN, achieving an AUC of 91.95%, whereas the performance of the second expert MSK ra diologist was significantly lower compared to both the CNN and th e other reader (P<0.001) reaching an AUC of 82.76%. Conclusion: A CNN model was highly accurate in differentiating between SIF and OA, achieving a higher or equal performance to MSK radiologists. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: 250 symptomatic subjects prospectively underwent knee MRI on a 3T system with a 15\u00adchannel knee coil . The essed T2\u00adweighted standard 2D TSE minutes) and a commercially available multi\u00adcontrast 3D CAIPIRINHA SPACE TSE protocol (9: 26 minutes). Approximately 13% of the patients (n=33) previously underwent anterior cruciate ligament and/or meniscus surgery. Two expe rienced musculoskeletal radiologists independently evaluated all datasets f or technical image quality and identified pathologies of knee structures using a 4\u00adpoint Likert scale representing the level of diagnostic confidence. The interchangeability of 2D and 3D protocols was tested under the same\u00adreader s cenario using a bootstrap percentile confidence interval. Finally, interreader reliability and intermethod concordance were assessed for all detec ted pathologies. Results or Findings: Although 2D acquisitions scored better in terms of image quality and diagnostic confidence, standard 2D and accelerated 3D protocols were found interchangeable for diagnosing structural abnormalities, except for patellar Additionally, i nterreader reliability was high for both 2D and 3D protocols (range , 0.785\u00ad1 and , 0.725\u00ad0.964, respectively) and the intermethod concordance was v ery good for all diagnoses (range , 0.817\u00ad0.986). Conclusion: This study contributes to the growing evidence that accelerated 3D protocols are a valuable time\u00adsaving alternative for standard 2D knee MRI. Yet, the radiologists' preference for 2D images needs to be further challenged to achieve a paradigm shift. Limitations: Not applicable.

Gilbert *; Cambridge/UK (fjg28@cam.ac.uk) Purpose: To explore the additional value of pharmacokinetic parameters from DCE-MRI at early time-points in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in breast cancer. Methods or Background: Women >18 years receiving NACT prior to surgery for breast cancer underwent baseline and post cycle 1 DCE-MRI examinations at 3T. DCE-MRI series were analysed using the exten ded Tofts' derive Ktrans, kep, ve and hotspot Ktrans (hs-Ktrans). pCR was defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast at surgery but allowing for the presence of in situ carcinoma. The area under the curve (AUC ) was calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of logistic regression models including standard prognostic factors (histology, grade, molecular subtype) with and without the addition of DCE-MRI parameters. Results or Findings: Data from 82 patients (86 lesions) were analysed. T he majority tumours were grade 2 or 3. 27/86 (31%) lesions showed pCR. Across all cancers, adding baseline hs- Ktrans increased AUC from 0.77 to 0.80, while the inclusion of Ktrans af ter 1 treatment cycle yielded the highest increase in AUC (0.72 to 0.76). For the HR+ group, the largest increase in AUC was observed for baseline hs-Ktrans (0.80 to 0.85). The addition of baseline hs-Ktrans and post cycle-1 kep showed the best predictive triple-negative 0.76 vs 0.59; DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters at early time-points to standard prognostic factors can impr ove pCR prediction in HR+ and triple-negative breast cancer.

Hoogt\u00b9, R. Wessels\u00b2 Purpose: DWI to identify pCR in stage I-III HER2+ breast cancer patients with radiological complete response (rCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) on DCE-MRI. Methods or Background: We retrospectively identified patients treated with trastuzumab-containing NAC between January 2015 unt il September 2019 who had rCR (absence of pathologic enhancement) on post-chemotherapy DCE-MRI-breast in the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Baseline and post-NAC MRI's (Philips 1.5/3.0T) were evaluated by a dedicated breast radiologist blinded for the pathological outcome. We re-evaluat ed rCR on DCE-MRI and visually evaluated response on high b-value DW-images (b800 and higher). ADC values were measured within the original tumour region. We calculated the negative predictive value (NPV) for pCR (ypT0/i s) with a corresponding 95% standard logit confidence interval. Fisher's ex act and Mann-Whitney's U test were used for comparison between groups. Results or Findings: DCE showed rCR in 102 patients of whom 76 had a pCR. A pCR was more common in HR+/HER2+ than HR-/HE R2+ patients (40 of 46 vs 36 of 56, p=0.01). Residual DWI signal was visible in 7 patients. NPVs for DCE and for DWI among patients with Within HR+ patients with visual residual DWI signal only 1 of 6 had a pCR (16.7%, 95%CI: 2.5-61.5%). The DWI evaluation potenti ally help to identify more HR+/HER2+ patients with residual inva sive disease. Limitations: Double reader analysis will be performed before ECR .

C. Sciandrello*, M. Durando, G. Bartoli, E. Castellano, P. Fonio; Turin/IT (mariaclotilde.sciandrello@gmail.com) Purpose: To identify which MRI criteria can predict residual ALN disease in breast cancer patients undergone NAC. Methods or Background: From 2014 to 2021, pre-and post-NAC 1,5 T MRIs of 164 patients with locally advanced breast cancer were retrospectively analysed by two dedicated radiologists in consensus , blinded to histological results. We evaluated both quantitative (number, di ameter) and qualitative (irregular margins, absence of fatty hilum, cortical thickness>3mm, perifocal oedema, rim enhancement, asymmetry comparing with c ontralateral side) criteria and ADC value related to ALNs before and after NAC. ALNs status was compared before NAC with ALN biopsy and with sentin versus no-complete response(no-pCR)]. Statistical Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables) was performed. Results or Findings: At pre-therapy MRI, the two parameters that best correlated with positive ALN biopsy were irregular margins and the absence of fatty hilum (p= 0,0003 and p=0,0014 respectively), while, after NAC, relating the different parameters with pCR or no-pCR, the only statistically significant data was the irregularity of margins (p= 0,0003). T he other variables, although at the univariate analysis they seemed to demonstra te a statistically significant correlation, did not confirm this data at the multi variate analysis. Conclusion: Based on our results, irregular ALNs margins seem t o be the most reliable parameter associated to pre-therapy A LNs disease and no-pCR after NAC. Limitations: Retrospective study.

J. Artefacts in MRI represent a significant problem leading to loss of diagnostic information and substantial costs. A pos t-processing algorithm, for orthogonal phase encoding reduction of artefact (OP ERA) is proposed and tested in the clinical setting. Methods or Background: The OPERA procedure is based on the key concept that noise-induced signal intensity alterations are randomly distributed, whereas the position of ghosts and aliasing is predictable along with columns or rows of pixels. OPERA combines the intensity val ues of two images acquired with the same parameters, but with orthogo nal phase encoding directions, to correct artefacts. The efficacy of t he OPERA procedure on MRI artefacts reduction was tested at a medium-sized general public hospital by using an Espree Siemens 1.5T MR scanner for a total period of 14 months. The procedure was tested on a total of 1003 MR imag es [55 randomly selected patients (56.4% females; mean age 54.6\u00b116.7 years)] . OPERA corrected images were compared with the corresponding reference-image (Ri) by computing signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-noise- ratio (CNR). Images (OPERA vs Ri) were shown in blind at two radiologis ts with a long-standing MRI expertise by using a better-worse Likert-type s cale response, to evaluate artefacts, SNR and CNR. Results or Findings: OPERA application 4 and 5 of the Likert- scale) between 82.4% and 83.4% (inter-rater (86.9% to 88.9% K=0.722). Conclusion: The testing of OPERA in the daily MRI practice indi cates the efficacy of the algorithm in reducing MRI artefacts and improving perceived image quality.

Methods or Background: Quantitative MRI data were collected with CoverScanMD across two sites in the UK (Siemens 1.5 T and 3T). The 30 min scan assesses: inflammation of the heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas with T1- relaxation; lung function with a dynamic structural T2-weighted scan measuring the difference between max inspiration and expirati on; fat in the liver and pancreas using PDFF. Impairment for each organ was considered when the metric was outside of pre-defined reference ranges. Associations between organs and symptoms were explored with logistic regression adjusted by time from first symptoms to MRI. Results or Findings: In N=451 (44yrs, 74% female, 89% white, median 179 days following infection), inflammation was observe d in the heart (14%), liver (12%), pancreas (6%) and kidney (4%); fat in liver (22%) and pancreas (30%); estimated lung capacity was reduced in 11%. 21% had evidence of abnormality in 2 or more organs and the number of abnormal metrics negatively correlated with the length of time betwe en initial symptoms and scan (r = -0.23, P<.001) suggesting some recovery with t ime. 66% reported ongoing severe breathlessness or fatigue which was signific antly associated with increased white cell count (WCC) (P=.03) and marginally with myocarditis (P=0.06). Conclusion: Coronavirus is associated with multi-organ dysfunct ion 6 months after infection. Organ inflammation was associated with symptoms. Multi-organ MRI may provide a diagnostic tool to stratify patie nts with long COVID and aid clinical management. Limitations: Study population was limited by ethnicity.

Funding for this study: Funding was received of deep learning-based chest X-r ay classification algorithm *D. C. Bastos*\u00b9, E. P. Reis\u00b9, M. Rosa\u00b9, H. M. H. Le e\u00b9, G. Szarf\u00b9, A. Gupta\u00b2, Purpose: To evaluate the bias in the diagnostic performance of a deep learning-based chest X-ray classification algorithm on previously unseen external data. Methods or Background: 632 chest X-rays were randomly collected from an academic centre hospital and anonymised selectively , leaving out fields needed for the bias estimation (manufacturer name, age, and gender). They were from six different vendors - AGFA (388), Cares tream (45), DIPS (21), GE (31), Philips (127), and Siemens (20). The male and female distribution was 376 and 256. The X-rays were read for consolidation ground truth establishment on CARING analytics platform (CARPL). These X-rays were run on open-sourced chest X-ray classification model. I nferencing results were analysed using Aequitas, an open-source python-based package to detect the presence of bias, fairness of algorithms. Algorithm s' performance was evaluated on the three metadata classes - gender, age group, and brand of equipment. False omission rate (FOR) and false-negative rate (FNR) metrics were used for calculating the inter-class scores of bias. Results or Findings: AGFA, 60 to 80 age group, and male were the dominan t entities and hence considered as baseline for evaluation of bias towards other classes. Significant false omission rate (FOR) and false negative rate (FNR) disparities were observed for all vendor classes ex cept Siemens as compared to AGFA. No gender disparity was seen. All groups s how FNR parity whereas all classes showed disparity with respect to false omission rate for age. Conclusion: We demonstrate that AI algorithms may develop biases, based on the composition of training data. We recommend bias evaluation check to be an integral part of every AI project. Despite this, AI algorithms may still develop certain biases, some of those difficult to evaluate. Limitations: Limited pathological classes were evaluated. Ethics committee approval: IRB approved.

K. Yeung, W. Y. Ip, *V. Vardhanabhuti*; Hong Kon g/HK Purpose: Virtual non-contrast (VNC) as a concept has been us ed to create non-contrast images from contrast studies. In the c ontext of spectral CT, accurate VNC helps with the accurate material decom position (MD) properties. The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of VNC images generated from pre-clinical photon-counting CT in a phantom. Methods or Background: Commercially available iodine contrast agent (Iopamiro 370) was diluted into various concentrati ons of iodine solutions (185, 93, 46, 23, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 mg/ml), placed i n a phantom and scanned using a pre-clinical photon-counting spectral CT sc anner (MARS Bioimaging Zealand) with pre-calibrated MD protocol of multi- energy range. Iodine was decomposed by the scanner' s reconstruction algorithm and the measured iodine concentration was compared with the known diluted concentrations as reference. The images were further processed by a custom-made MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) program to explore the relationship between CT number (in HU) and iodine c oncentration with subsequent correlation analysis. After iodine remov al by VNC post-processing, the corresponding CT number of iodine vials of VNC and original contrast images were compared with the ground truth water vi al respectively. Results or Findings: For iodine images, measured iodine concentration was comparable with calculated ones (mean absolute diff erence of 9.1%). The HU values and iodine concentration was linearly and hi ghly correlated (adjusted R squared of 0.9974 with p-value of <0.001). At 32-49.9 keV energy range, the mean absolute HU difference between water and VNC i mage of typical 10 mg/ml iodine solution was 27\u00b113 HU while comparing to contrast image of 605\u00b112 HU. Conclusion: Virtual non-contrast technique is feasible in spect ral CT scanner with good accuracy and correlation with known concentrations in phantom study.

Hellwig, Eckstein, Erlangen/DE (stephan.ellmann@uk-erlangen.de) Purpose: Dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) evaluation in MR I is subject to various difficulties, as the signal intensities reflect contrast media concentration non-linearly. Moreover, individual ou tliers in the time-intensity curves may compromise the semiquantitative values of the enhancement dynamics. In addition, the plethora of analysis met hods are hardly comparable with each other. Thus, the aim of this work was the establishment of a web- based tool for the quantitative and semiquantitativ e evaluation of DCE-MRI. Methods or Background: An interactive web application was programmed using R to load DCE-MRI studies and semiautomatical ly fit the raw data to a Brix model using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by R2. From the fitted curves, the Brix-eq uation was extracted, along with (semi-)quantitative parameters: A, kel, kep, t ime to peak, peak- enhancement, area-under-the-curve. The maximum and minimum of a fitted curve's first derivative were defined as wash-in an d wash-out, respectively. In an exemplary case series, 22 neck tumour patients w ere retrospectively analysed with regard to their response to immunothe rapy. For this purpose, pre-therapeutic DCE-MRIs covering the tumour were assessed using the developed online tool. The above parameters were compared between treatment responders and non-responders. Results or Findings: Fitting the Brix model to the raw DCE-MRI data yiel ded a mean R2 of 0.939 (95%CI 0.922-0.956). Regarding the case series, treatment responders' tumours featured a significantly higher time to peak (p=0.048) and wash-out (p=0.031) compared to non-responders. Conclusion: Raw DCE-MRI data can be fit to pharmacokinetic models semiautomatically with the presented online tool. I n a case series, fitting was accurate, and the resulting parameters could be used to identify responders to immunotherapy in neck cancer patients. Limitations: Proof-of-concept-study with a fully functional web application, but only supported by a small case series. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the local ethics committee.

Methods or Background: Phantoms were created with 0, 5, 10, 25, 40, 100% fat and 0, 4.9, 7.0 mg/ml iodine, respectively. Scans were performed with the IQon Spectral CT (Philips, The Netherlands), and 3T MR chemical-shift relaxometry (MRR). Based on maps of the photoelectr ic effect and Compton scattering, three-material decomposition, including fat and iodine, was done in the image space. After written consent, n=10 patients (mean age 55 years \u00b1 18; six men) in need of a CT staging were prospecti vely included, received contrast-enhanced abdominal dlsCT scans at 120kV, a nd MRI scans for MRR. As reference tissue for the liver and the skeletal muscle, retrospectively available non-contrast-enhanced spectral CT data sets were employed. Agreement between dlsCT and MR was evaluated for the phantoms, three hepatic and two muscular regions of interest per pa tient by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman analyses. Results or Findings: The ICC was excellent in the phantoms (0.978[95%CI 0.937-0.993]) and the skeletal muscle (0.956[95%CI 0.890-0.982]). The ICC was moderate for log-transformed liver fat values ( 0.75[95%CI 0.48-0.881]). The Bland-Altman analysis yielded a mean difference of -0.714%[95%CI - 4.512-3.085] for the liver and 0.501%[95%CI -4.319- 5.321] for the skeletal muscle. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent (>0.9). Conclusion: DlsCT fat quantification delivers reliable results for the liver and the skeletal muscle, which provide information about steatosis hepatis and muscle quality as parameters of prognostic relevanc e, in retrospectively available spectral data sets of routine exams.

De RPS 1608-2 Paris/FR Purpose: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MRI Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) when characterising orbital lesions, which is challenging due to a wide range of locations and histologic types. Methods or Background: This IRB-approved prospective single-centre study enrolled participants presenting with an orbital lesion undergoing a 3 Tesla MRI prior to surgery from December 2015 to July 2019. A n IVIM sequence with 15 b-values ranging from 0 to 2000 s/mm\u00b2 was performed. Two neuroradiologists, blinded to clinical data, individually analysed mor phological MRIs. They drew one region of interest inside each orbital lesion, providing Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion fraction (f) and pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) values. T-test, Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to discriminate between orbital lesions and to determi ne the diagnostic accuracy of the IVIM parameters. Results or Findings: 156 participants (84 women and 72 men, mean age 54. 4 +/-17.5 years) with 167 orbital lesions (98/167 [59%] benign lesions including 54 orbital inflammations and 69/167 [41%] malignant lesions including 32 lymphomas) were included in the study. ADC and D we re significantly lower in malignant than in benign lesions: D* was significantly in malignant in benign ones: 12.8x10-3mm2/s [20.17] versus 7.52x10-3mm2/s 0.74, 0.72 and 0.81 for ADC, D, D* and a combination of D, f and D*, respectively. Conclusion: Our study showed that IVIM might help better charac terise orbital lesions.

Pavlova*, N. S. Moscow/RU (dr.olgapavlova@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate the influence of orbital volume and globe position on the outcome in patients with orbital trauma using T data postprocessing. Methods or Background: A total of 107 patients with orbital trauma (100%) were admitted to the Sechenov University hospital. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 50 patients (47%) in the acute period (up to 2 weeks after the trauma), period of developing of posttraumatic deformities (n=30; 28%) (up to 3 months), deformities (n=27; 25%) (after 3 months). MSCT was performed using Canon Aquilion One 640, CT data processing was performed using workstation Vitrea Core. Along with the classical bone and soft tissue trauma evaluation on CT, the examined p arameters of CT analysis included orbital volume measurement and evaluation of globe position. Results or Findings: CT revealed the bone and soft tissue structures trauma in 100% of patients, however, the parameters of CT data analysis allowed to additionally reveal increased traumatic orbital vol ume in 21 patients (19%) and additional enophthalmos in 9 patients (8%), which helped to change the treatment tactic in 12 patients (11%). Conclusion: The postprocessing of CT data allowed developing new specific criteria such as orbital volume measurement and glo be position analysis which increase the efficiency of preoperative planning and help to reduce the possibility of postoperative complications in patients with orbital trauma. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: Approved by Sechenov University ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was provided for this study.

Conventional MRI has only limited utility on this purpose. We proposed that quantitative imaging methods are superior in proper staging of TAO. Methods or Background: Twenty patients with TAO were retrospectively enrolled, and clinical activity score (CAS) was used to determine the disease activity and severity. Conventional MRI, fat fracti on, T1 imaging and T2 mapping were acquired. Volumes of intra-orbital fat were measured in T1FLAIR sequences. Fat fraction, T1 and T2 relaxation time in each extraocular muscle were measured. Independent sampl e t-test, and Spearman correlation analysis were used for statistical anal ysis. Results or Findings: No significant difference was found in intra-orbital fat volumes between active (CAS 3) and inactive (CAS < 3) TAO patients (p=0.816), the fat volumes showed no correlation wi th CAS scores (p=0.2). T2 relaxation time of inferior rectus (IR) was higher in the active group (p=0.03). Fat fraction of medial rectus (MR) decreased with C AS, T1 of IR, MR and lateral rectus (LR) increased with CAS, and T2 relaxation time of MR and LR increased with CAS (all p<0.05). Conclusion: Intra-orbital fat volumes might not help to differentiate the activity and severity of TAO. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might provide accurate parameters delineating the activity and severity of TAO, thus aiding the appropriate choice of treatment. Limitations: More cases would be involved into the analysis, as well as long- term follow-up in order to assess the role of quant itative MRI in predicting the progression and prognosis of TAO.

The purpose of this study was (1) the early identification of mucormycosis on imaging - that is essential, (2) as sessment of the spectrum of ocular involvement of mucormycosis in post-COVID st atus causing proptosis, and (3) to identify cavernous sinus involvement/thr ombosis leading to dilatation of superior ophthalmic vein. Methods or Background: Retrospective data analysis has been done from three district teaching hospitals, where CT/MRI hav e been performed for post- COVID patients presenting with unilateral proptosis to evaluate for the rhinoocculocerebral mucormycosis. 1.5 T MRI / 16 Sl ice MDCT scanner have been used for orbital imaging. We have considered all post-COVID patients who underwent imaging for unilateral proptosis for evaluation. Two radiologists, with 16 and 8 years of experience, have read PACS i mages. Results or Findings: A total of 119 patients have undergone imaging for mucormycosis among whom 65 patients had presented w ith unilateral proptosis. Involvement of mucormycosis soft tissue with erosive changes in the medial wall (from ethmoid sinus), floor (maxillary sinus), orbital apex (sphenoid sinus) leading to proptosis was found in 61 patient s. Dilated superior ophthalmic vein due to cavernous sinus thrombosis w as identified in four patients as the cause of proptosis with coexisting sinus involvement. Preseptal oedema, premaxillary oedema, oedema of soft tissue around the orbit and sinuses were found in 30 patients. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 34 Conclusion: Imaging early in unilateral proptosis helps identif y mucormycosis. Assessment of involvement of orbital wall and erosi ve changes helps as a surgical road map. Limitations: Since only unilateral proptosis is considered as a criterion. Other early symptoms/signs of facial swelling, preseptal oedema leading to imaging would identify mucor much earlier. Ethics committee approval: Retrospective study of images on PACS, approval taken.

Methods or Background: We investigated 110 patients of invasive ROCM between July 2020 -September 2021, who were treated for the Maxillofacial Surgery of the TMA. The examined patients were from 46 to 52 years old and were men - 59.5%, women - 40.5%. Results or Findings: Clinical features of these patients presents: sixty -eight (61,8%) patients had onset of their disease with toothache with one developing submandibular abscess later, one with otitis extern a and by ophthalmoplegia, and one with catarrh. Twenty-eight (25,4%) patients had altered sensorium at presentation, whi le two others developed it during their hospital stay, one due to internal car otid artery occlusion, and the other due to hydrocephalus. Ophthalmoplegia (89%) w as the most frequent presentation followed by proptosis (83%). Visual loss (80%) was observed in 26 (23,6%) patients at presentation and two patient s developed it during their hospital stay. One patient had bilateral proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and visual loss. On CT imaging, all patients had evidence of paranasal sinuses involvement. The ethmoid (86%) and maxillary sinuse s (80%) were most commonly involved, followed by sphenoid and frontal sinus in fifty-six (50,9%) each and pansinusitis in seventy-five (68,1%). Fort y-eight patients had shadow the maxilla suggestive of seconda ry bacterial infection. Intracranial extension with cerebral lobe involveme nt presenting as a hypodense area with or without rim enhancement was observed in seven (40%) patients. One of these patients had a massive cerebral infarct with marked perilesional oedema resulting in hydrocephal us, which required ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, and the other had internal carotid artery occlusion. Conclusion: Computed tomography imaging is a useful modality to assess the extent of the ROCM. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Images were reconstructed using weighted filtered back projecti on (wFBP), advanced modelled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) strength wFBP with a novel denoising postprocessing algorithm (PixelShine). Three readers with varying experience levels independently rated subjective im age quality on a 5-point Likert scale (1=worst - 5=best). An intraclass corr elation coefficient was used to measure inter-rater-agreement. Image noise (standar d deviation of Hounsfield Units from regions of interest in homogenous paraspinal muscles) was compared for objective image quality. An additional phantom scan was performed to investigate the dose-reduction capabil ities of PixelShine. Statistical analysis ensued using a mixed-effects m odel. Time to diagnosis was measured for all reconstruction methods. Results or Findings: Subjective image quality was significantly higher f or PixelShine vs ADMIRE 2 vs wFBP (4 IQR [4-5] vs 3 IQ R [2-3] vs 2 IQR [2-3]; each p<0.001) with almost perfect agreement (ICC=0. 94, p=0.001). The noise was significantly lower for PixelShine vs ADMIRE 2 vs wFBP (33.73\u00b10.85 vs 59.96\u00b1 1.23 vs 76.89\u00b11.53 HU; each p=0.001). The phantom scan revealed 100% radiation dose PixelShine to have equal noise as 325% ADMIRE 2 and 550% wFBP (each p=0.999). Overall, time to diagnosi s was significantly shorter when using PixelShine vs. ADMIRE 2 vs wFBP (2.28\u00b11.56 vs 2.45\u00b11.9 vs 2.66 \u00b12.31 min; each Compared to conventional reconstruction methods, AI postprocessing denoising may positively impact subj ective and objective image quality in pediatric ULDCT thorax scans and improve radiological workflows.

Our objective was to compare the accuracy of quantitative parameters extracted from the laboratory, ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) using machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting long- term outcome of native liver survivor patients with BA after KP. Methods or Background: Twenty-four patients were evaluated according to clinical and laboratory data at initial evaluation (median follow-up=9.7 years) after KP as with ideal (n=15) or non-ideal (n=9) medical outcome, successively they were re-evaluated after additional 4 years and classified in Group 1 (n=12) as stable and Group 2 (n=12) as non-stable in the disease course. Laboratory and quantitative US and MR imaging parameters were merged to test ML algorithms. Results or Findings: The only statistically significant parameters betwe en Group 1 and 2 were total and direct bilirubin (TB a nd DB) as laboratory parameters, while US stiffness as an imaging parame ter. The values of TB and DB were still in the normal range, but tend towards the upper limit. Na\u00efve Bayes was the best algorithm in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity values and AUCROC to predict long-term outcome, sel ecting only laboratory parameters (TB and DB), while Random Forest and k-N earest Neighbors algorithms reached the same results using either laboratory or imaging parameters. Conclusion: The ML evaluation, merging laboratory and quantitat ive imaging findings, shows the pivotal role of TB and DB values in predicting long-term outcome of BA patients after KP, even though their values may be within normal range. Therefore, clinicians should be alert when the values of these laboratory parameters show subtle changes. Limitations: The small sample size and the retrospective type of the investigation.

Maarek, A-L. Hermann, A. Kamoun, number of conventional X-ray examinations in paediatric emergency departments is constantly increasing, lea ding to avoidable errors in interpretation by the radiologist. The use of artif icial intelligence (AI) could improve the interpretation workflow by prioritising pathological radiographs and providing assistance in fracture detection. Methods or Background: A cohort of 300 anonymised radiographs performed for peripheral skeletal fracture detection in patients aged 2 to 21 years was retrospectively collected. The gold standard was es tablished for each examination after an independent review by two radi ologists experts in musculoskeletal imaging. In case of disagreement, a consensual review with a third expert radiologist was performed. Out of the 300 examinations, 150 presented at least a fracture. All radiographs were then read by 3 senior radiologists and 5 junior radiologists in training between the 2nd and 4th year of residency without and immediately after with the help of an AI. Poor quality radiographs were excluded from the cohort. Sensitiv ity and specificity for each group of radiologists were calculated without and w ith the help of AI. Results or Findings: The standalone sensitivity and specificity of the A I were respectively 91% and 90%. The mean sensitivity for all groups was 73.3% without AI, it increased by almost 10% to 82.8% wit h the aid of the AI. For the junior radiologists, it increased from 71.9% to 82. 2% (+10.3%) and for the seniors from 75.6% to 83.8% (+8.2%). On average, the specificity increased from to 90.3% (+0.7%) and from 86.2% to 87.6% (+1.4%) for juniors. For senior radiologists, the average specificity sl ightly decreased from 95.1% to 94.9% (-0.2%). Conclusion: The aid of the AI increased sensitivity by an average of 10% without decreasing specificity. Limitations: No limitations identified.

Methods or Background: After open airway surgery for LTS several complex anatomical changes of the airway can remain, leading to altered upper airway airflow patterns and increased airway resistance fo r which re-operation might be needed. In this study, CFD analyses were perform ed on free-breathing (FB) and inspiratory (Insp) MRI scans of a healthy volun teer, and of two patients post LTS repair. Digital surgery was executed to pr edict the effect of 1) widening of the vocal cords, 2) removal of the trac heal deformation (TD), 3) both widening of the vocal cords and TD removal. Results or Findings: Patient 1 had severe vocal cord stenosis and mild T D. Patient 2 had severe vocal cord stenosis and severe TD. Compared to the healthy volunteer during FB and Insp, patient 1 showed an increased total airway resistance of 269% and 180%, and patient 2 s howed an increase of 735% and 1548%. In patient 1 the best airway resist ance was achieved when just the vocal cords were widened (FB:-20.2 Pa.s/L (45.6%), Insp:-17.9 Pa.s/L (68.8%)). In patient 2 the best results were obtain ed when both the vocal cords were widened and the TD was removed (FB:-71.1 Pa.s/ L (71.0%), Insp:-133.9 Pa.s/L (87.3%)). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CFD modelling can be used to study the effect of virtual surgical upper airway interve ntions in patients with complex airway pathology.

Methods or Background: 48 kidney volumes were acquired in 45 patients with hydronephrosis by freehand 3D-US (6-1 MHz volumetric sector array, electronic rotation) in prone position (35 male; median age, 4 years; range, one month to 16 years). Semi-automated kidney segmentat ion (prototype software) was performed afterwards by two readers providing v olumes for total kidney volume, dilated collective system and renal parenchyma (total kidney volume minus dilated collective system), as well as hydron ephrosis index (renal parenchyma divided by total kidney volume). Interrater agreement was evaluated with a two-way intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The maximum anteroposterior diameter of renal pelvis was measur ed on transverse 2D B- mode images, and hydronephroses were classified grade 1-4. Results or Findings: Most hydronephroses were grade 2 (n=29), followed by grade 3 (n=15) and grade 1 (n=4). The most frequent patient history included pelvic ureteric junction stenosis (n=21). Interrate r agreement for total kidney volume, collective system, hydronephrosis index and renal parenchyma was good to excellent with ICC of 0.94, 0.87, 0.83 and 0.91 respectively (p<0.001 each). There was a positive correlation between hydronephrosis grading and ultrasonic hydronephrosis index and between 2D renal pelvis diameter and volume of the collective system (p<0.001 both). Conclusion: Novel 3D-US volumetric analysis has a high degree of interrater agreement providing parenchyma volume in hydronephr otic kidneys. Volumes of the collective system and hydronephrosis index c orrelate with the extent of hydronephrosis. Limitations: No interrater agreement was assessed.

Zerunian, Pucciarelli, and diffusion-weighted images (DWI) i n upper abdomen magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with AIR R econ Deep Learning (ARDL) algorithm with standard acquisition (non-ARD L), in terms of quantitative and qualitative image analysis and scanning time. Methods or Background: Thirty consecutive healthy volunteers (23 female, mean age 55\u00b122 years) were included and underwent unenhanced upper abdomen MRI (1.5 Tesla) from May 2021 to October 2021. Exclusion criteria were: contraindications to MRI and severe artefacts included T2 and DWI axial wi standard protocol and ARDL. A radiologist evaluated objectiv e image quality by drawing fixed regions of interest (ROIs) in the liver parenchyma, gallbladder and background to calculate signal-to-noise-ratio(SNR) and contrast to-noise- ratio(CNR). Then, subjective image quality was assessed by two radiologists independently with a five-point Likert scale including parameters as parenchyma edge sharpness, contrast, truncation and motion artefacts and overall image quality. Acquisition timing was also recorded and analysed. Results or Findings: The objective analysis showed no significant differ ences between and vs subjective analysis, ARDL sequences showed signific antly better overall image quality with lower motion and truncation artefacts and higher sharpness and contrast (all p<0,0001) with the good inter-rater agreement (k=0,83925). Acquisition timing was significantly lower in both ARDL sequences compared to non-ARDL ones Conclusion: ARDL sequences showed significantly higher overall image quality with reduced acquisition timing, in particular for DWI. Limitations: Reduced number of sequences tested and small population sample.

Joskowicz, radiologists compare the prio r current study with improved detection of lesions. We aimed to verify i f liver lesions detection and segmentation in a CECT is more accurate with deep l earning classification trained on pairs of current and prior scans. Methods or Background: We developed two deep learning 3D R2U-Net classifiers. The singles classifier is trained with individual CECT liver lesion annotations; the pairs classifier is trained with pairs of registered prior and current CECT liver lesion annotations of the same p atient. While singles classifier discriminates lesion voxels based on abs olute appearance, the pairs classifier discriminates based on relative lesion/healthy tissue appearance differences. We evaluated the performance of the si ngles and pairs classifiers with 174 retrospective clinical CECTs of 59 patients from two centres with metastatic disease with a total of 2,897 liver metastases manually delineated by an expert radiologist. The singles and pairs classifiers were trained/ validated/tested with 126/15/33 single CECTs and 350/35/101 pairs of CECTs created from the same 174 CECTs. Their performance was quantified by comparing the test sets results of each to the manu al expert annotation with the liver metastasis precision/recall detection and the segmentation Dice coefficient and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD). Results or Findings: The pairs classifier yields significantly better Di ce, ASSD and precision and similar recall results than the s ingles classifier for liver metastases whose diameter is vs 0.87\u00b10.16 (same, p- value=0.985). Conclusion: Deep learning classification of liver lesions train ed on pairs of registered current and prior scans increases lesion detection and segmentation accuracy.

Scalco\u00b9, *M. M. Mori*\u00b2, Purpose: To assess the impact of features harmonisation accounting for inter- scanner variability in stratifying patients with pancreatic carcinoma according to the risk of early distant relapse after surgery. Methods or Background: Pre-surgical CT images of 114 patients who underwent upfront pancreaticoduodenectomy were acquired in a single institute using 3 different scanners. Tumour volumes were delineated by expert radiologists and 181 IBSI-consistent radiomic features were computed. The ComBat harmonisation method was adopted to correct for batch effect related to the acquisition scanner; significant differences among scanners groups were assessed through ANOVA test before and after harmonisation. A previously validated and published 3-variable model including clinical and radiomic features was applied to the original and harmonised dataset. During the original model's training, radiomic features were r educed by removing those with low inter-observer reproducibility and retaini ng those (3 morphological, 4 texture, 1 statistical) most significantly associated with the endpoint. The prediction performances of the features retained in the first selection were also compared considering original and harmonised values . Results or Findings: The ComBat method was able to remove differences among the 3 scanners groups (28/181 features with p _value<0.05 before harmonisation; none after harmonisation). Despite t his improvement, the model's performances were almost equal before/after harmonisation: the hazard ratios resulting from applying the published score to stratify low-vs- high-risk patients in multivariable logistic ha rmonisation. Univariate logistic regression performed on the 8 most relevant radiomic features confirmed that very similar performances (regressio n coefficients, p-value, odds ratio and 95% CI) were obtained before/after harmonisation. Conclusion: The performances of predictive radiomic features and of a multi- variate model built on pancreatic CT images were po orly affected by inter- scanner variability. Limitations: Homogeneous acquisition protocols across the scanners. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was obtained. Reference: 28/INT/2015.

This study assessed the usefulness of pretreatment CT-based radiomics f or predicting pathological complete response (pCR) of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) to nCRT, and to develop a predictive model. Methods or Background: Patients with LARC who underwent nCRT followed by total mesorectal excision surgery from July 2010 to December 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. A total of 340 radiomics features were extracted from pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT images. The most relevant features to pCR were selected using the least absolute shrinkag e and selection operator (LASSO) method and a radiomics signature was generated. Predictive models were built with radiomic features and clinicopathol ogical variables. Model performance was evaluated using discrimination, cal ibration, and decision curve analysis, and validated in an independent coh ort. Results or Findings: pCR was achieved by 44 of the 216 consecutive patients (20.4%) in this study. The model with the best perf ormance used both radiomics and clinical variables, including radiomi c signatures, distance to the anal verge, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, and carci noembryonic antigen. This combined model discriminated between patients with and without pCR with an area under the curve of 0.926 and 0.872 in the trai ning and the validation cohorts, respectively. The combined model also show ed better performance than models built with radiomic or clinical variabl es alone. Conclusion: Our combined predictive model was robust in differe ntiating patients with and without response to nCRT. Limitations: This was a retrospective study, making case selecti on bias possible and affecting the performance of our predi ctive model. Future prospective, multicentre studies are needed to vali date our results.

Methods or Background: In this retrospective analysis polyps of all size categories and morphologies were manually segmented on supine and prone CTC images and classified as benign (hyperplastic polyp or regular mucosa) or Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 39 premalignant (adenoma) according to histopathology. Two models based on convolutional neural networks were trained to predi ct the polyp class (benign vs premalignant). Model SEG was trained on 3D CTC i mage subvolumes covering individual polyps and additionally polyp s egmentation masks. Model noSEG was solely trained on the CTC subvolumes. The diagnostic performance of both models for the determination of premalignant from benign was then validated in an external multicenter test sample. The operating point for both models was selected individually to maximi ze the respective Youden- Index. Results or Findings: The training set consisted of 107 colorectal polyps in 63 patients (mean age: 63\u00b18 years, 40 men) comprising 169 polyp segmentations. The external test set included 77 polyps in 59 pati ents comprising 118 polyp segmentations. Model SEG achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.83, the sensitivity of 66%, and specificity of 92% on the external test se t for determination of premalignant from benign polyps. Model noSEG yielde d a ROC-AUC of 0.75, the sensitivity of 65%, and specificity of 79% on t he external test set. Conclusion: Deep-learning-based image analysis in CTC enabled t he differentiation of premalignant and benign colorect al polyps, with the potential to facilitate the identification of high-risk color ectal polyps as an automated second reader. Limitations: The sample size was small. Results of this study ar e only applicable to polyps clearly detectable in CT colon ography and a selection bias cannot be fully ruled out.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a deep learnin g model (DLM) that can automatically detect renal cysts in ultras ound images and predict the appropriate position of a pair of measurement marke rs (MM) to measure their size. Methods or Background: In total, 2664 ultrasonographic B-mode images with MM of renal cysts obtained from January 2019 to May 2020 were split into 70/30% for training and testing. The DLM adopted a fine-tuned YOLOv5 for detection of renal cysts and a pretrained UNet++ for prediction of heat maps representing the position of MMs. Preprocessed ultr asound images were input to YOLOv5, and images cropped inside the bounding b ox detected from the input image by YOLOv5 were input to UNet++. Three s onographers manually placed MM on 100 unseen test data. The MM positions annotated by a board- certified radiologist were used as the ground truth. We have evaluated and compared the accuracy of sonographers and the DLM. Their performances were evaluated using precision-recall metrics and m easurement errors. Results or Findings: The evaluation result (precision, recall, position- error, and length-error) for DLM was 0.87, 0.90, 3.73\u00b13.68 mm, and respectively. the respec were 0.86, mm, and 0.96\u00b11.07 Conclusion: Our DLM was able to detect renal cysts with the com parable level of accuracy as sonographers, and the measurement pr ediction was slightly less accurate. Hence, it might help to automate the process of measurement in ultrasound analysis. Limitations: No external validation. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was obtained; #20170018.

Beyer, Rausch; Vienna/AT (alejandra.valladares@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: The development of MRI phantoms presents several challenges in terms of materials and is mainly limited to water-f illed compartments and gel- based components. Here, we present a novel design t o additively manufacture solid objects with adjustable MRI contrast based on the integration of MRI- visible supporting material. Methods or Background: Eleven homogeneous cubic probes and one spherical object mimicking a necrotic tumour were d esigned and printed using additive manufacturing. Each probe comprises a soli d internal structure and a specific percentage of commonly-used support materi al. The models were scanned using standard spin- and gradient-echo puls e sequences on a 3T PET/MRI system. We evaluated MRI visibility and T1 and T2 relaxation rates over time. Results or Findings: For most probes, measurable signal intensities were obtained. T2 values ranged from 22 ms to 40 ms, com parable to reported values for some body tissues at 3T. T1 values were relatively short compared to similar reports with relaxation times of 109 ms to 131 ms. T1 and T2 relaxation times were stable over three months. Conclusion: The proposed design allowed the adjustment of imagi ng contrast in MRI, based mainly on the spin density contributi on of the MRI-visible supporting material within a voxel. Furthermore, we demonstrated the possibility of creating a one-compartment object to mimic necrosis in tumours, which is advantageous to create complex models for tumour heterogeneity in MRI and PET/MRI. Limitations: The current design does not allow mimicking the var ying contrast with different T1 and T2- weighing MRI sequences. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

G. Cu\u00f1a*\u00b9, compare quantitative susceptibility quantificati on between simulated and experimental phantom containing iron. This would help to adjust processing pipeline parameters to obtain quantitati ve susceptibility mapping (QSM). Methods or Background: A phantom was constructed by inserting small vials into a cylindrical container. Vials contained FeCl2 at four different concentrations (range 0.22-1.79mM) in two forms: cl ustered and free. The phantom scanned GRAPPA=2). For simulations, the same geometry as the real phantom was used. Susceptibility values were assigned to three different regions: background (1ppm), body (0ppm) and iron vials. A molar susceptibility of 1ppm/mM was assigned. For clustered iron vials, random noise (with a uniform probability distribution, from 0 to 1) was generated and multiplied by the corresponding iron concentration. Phase images at T E=6ms were obtained by Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 40 convolution of the phantom geometry with the macros copic unit-dipole function. Morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI)2 was applied to the earliest echo- time phase images (6ms) to obtain QSM for experimen tal and simulated data using lambda1=1000 and lambda2=10 for background re gularisation. Results or Findings: For measured QSM images, clustered iron led to highly localised field effects, also captured by simulatio ns. For experimental data, best curve fittings were obtained after applying a Laplacian-based unwrapping pre-processing, with determination coefficients >0. 88. In the simulations, QSM- values in both clustered and free iron showed a lin ear increase with iron (determination coefficient >0.99). In both cases, estimated molar susceptibility was lower with clustered iron. Conclusion: Our simulation method captures the effect of iron c lustering in QSM calculations as seen in experimental phantom ac quisitions. Limitations: QSM processing pipelines need to be refined to achi eve higher accuracy for local field effects, as also seen in A lzheimer's beta-amyloid plaques.

Segmentation and volumetry are generally time-consuming, creating a need for rapid but accurate analysis tools. This work aims t o present a new segmentation tool (developed under a custom framework, DicomFlex [RS]) that combines the speed of automatic pre-segmentation wi th the reliability of a brief interactive revision. Results were validated agains t a widely used commercial tool (SliceOmatic). Methods or Background: Validation was performed on MRI datasets (1.5 T Achieva XR, Philips Healthcare) from 20 patients (1 0 women/men), 25.1-63.1 (mean 48.5) years old, with BMIs between 28.3 and 5 8.8 (mean 36.8) kg/m2. Two independent readers analysed the abdominopelvic SliceOmatic) . Coefficients of determination (R2) as well as bias and limits of agreement (Bland Altman) were determined. Results or Findings: Segmentation performance (R2 between methods) was excellent for both readers for SAT (> 0.99) and ver y high for VAT (around 0.90). The novel method was almost twice as fast as the reference - 19 (R2) and 25 (R1) s/slice vs 34 and 40 s/slice. On a subj ective level, readers appreciated the intuitive workflow resulting from t he standardised interface. Conclusion: The open-source semiautomatic PC segmentation tool enables a fast and accurate quantification of whole abdominop elvic adipose tissue volume. Development under a standardised software f ramework (Dicomflex) allows for further extensions or adaptations. Limitations: Limitations include single-centre-design, limited n umber of readers (n=2) and specific patient selection based on BMI(>25kg/m\u00b2).

Wachholz*, H-J. Mentzel, A. Heinrich, H. Cho-N\u00f6th ; Jena/DE Purpose: Foetal MRI will an adjunct to sonog raphy in foetal pathologies. Generally, MRI is related with heat, c aused by radiofrequency waves produced during MRI scans. The purpose of thi s prospective study was to confirm that there is no heating in pregnant wom en during MRI. Methods or Background: 20 pregnant women (aged between 19 and 45 years) in a range of 20 to 35 pregnancy week underw ent foetal MRI for various indications. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T MRI ( AERA, SIEMENS, GERMANY) without sedation or contrast media. Imaging time was between 30 and 45 minutes. Two probes Tesla M3 (Mammendorfer I nstitut f\u00fcr Physik und Medizin, GERMANY) were used for measuring the skin temperature: one on the leg outside the field of view (FOV) (TL) and the second one next to the belly button within the FOV (TFOV). Before and after each MRI investigation the body core temperature was estimated by evaluati on of the ear temperature (Tc). Results or Findings: Both probes demonstrated in all 20 pregnant women a n increase of the skin temperature of 0.1\u00b0C per imagi ng minute. max 1.2\u00b0C). Conclusion: We observed a significant increase in temperature i n pregnant women during MRI. We don't know if there is any sid e effect on the foetus. Therefore, possible health consequences, also for t he fetus, should be checked. Limitations: The limitations are the missing online rectal and i ntrauterine temperature measurements.

Critical in this process is the correction for the slice profile. However, conventional \"rect\" profiles have zeroes in the kZ passband, causing undesirable attenuation of high spatial frequencies in the slice direction. The purpose of this work is to investigate alternative slice profiles which allow improved fidelity. Methods or Background: First, several alternative RF profiles were identif ied with no zeroes in the kZ passband. These are a Gaus sian and a (1+cos) (raised cosine, or \"rCos\"). Second, experimental im ages using these were compared with a standard \"rect\" profile using a phantom with resolution patterns varying from 0.15 to 0.50 lp/mm. Third, sagittal images were acquired of the prostate in vivo from several subjects. Axial sampling using 3mm thick slices with the various slice profiles was simulated using several levels of additive noise, super-resolution reconstruction per formed, and results compared with the original sagittal image. Finally, results were compared with sagittal reformats made from the actual axial acqui sition. Results Gaussian and rCos RF pulses allow full restoration of spatial frequencies up to 0.50 1/mm using SR reconstruction, equivalent to 1mm slice thickness. rCos excitation consistently provides improved sharpness vs Gaussian over all noise levels. Sagittal reformats of SR-reconstructed axially acquired data well resemble direct sagittal acquisition. Conclusion: Alternative (non-rect) RF slice profiles such as Ga ussian and rCos allow improved fidelity of high spatial freque ncies in the slice direction with resolution finer than that in the acquired sli ces. Limitations: The number of subjects studied is limited. Finer (< 1mm) slice resolution is desirable. Ethics committee approval: Approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Wang*\u00b9, J. A. U. Perucho\u00b9, L. Han\u00b2, E. M. F. Wo ng\u00b9, G. Y. P. Lee\u00b9; radiomic features in differentiating high-grade ser ous carcinoma (HGSC) and non-HGSC of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Methods or Background: A total of 341 patients with EOC were enrolled in this multicentre retrospective study. Centre A with 282 patients was designated as the internal cohort and was divided into an inte rnal training set (n = 225) and an internal test set (n = 57). Centre B with 59 pat ients, was designated as the external cohort and was used for external testing. To address the class imbalance between the distribution of HGSC and non- HGSC, synthetic balanced samples were generated using Random Over-S ampling Examples (ROSE). Tumours were manually delineated on each sl ice of ceCT images to encompass the entire tumour. Radiomic features with Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and wavelet transforms were extracted. Featur e selection was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Selected features were used to build the logistic regression (LR) models for differentiating HGSC and non-HGSC. The performances of the models were assessed by rec eiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). Results or Findings: Thirty-four radiomic features were selected for modelling. The AUCs LR models for differentiating HGSC and non-HGSC were 0.944 for the internal training set, 0.945 for the internal test set and 0.805 for the external test set. Conclusion: Radiomic features extracted from ceCT were helpful in histological subtyping of EOC. The LR models offere d outstanding diagnostic efficiency in the internal cohorts, and excellent i n the external cohort. Limitations: Centre B has a limited sample size. The distributio n of HGSC and non-HGSC was different between Centre A and B. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review board (No. UW 20-251).

A comparative evaluation in an Indian co hort *S. Patra*\u00b9, S. of ORADS-MRI vis ADNEX-MR score for characterisation of ovarian- adnexal tumours as benign or malignant using histopathology as a refer ence standard. The secondary objective was to justify the transition f rom ADNEX-MR to ORADS- MRI. Methods or Background: The ORADS-MRI algorithm was recently proposed for characterising ovarian tumours, directing the m anagement of malignant tumours towards specialised oncology teams and beni gn tumours towards restricted intervention. This study was designed as a cross-sectional, observational study, with the retrospective application of ORADS-MRI and ADNEX-MR scores to a prospectively acquired data set during an IRB approved study on ovarian-adnexal masses conducted during the last 2 years. We recruited patients with ovarian-adnexal tumours, who had undergone 3T MRI with morphological, functional and dynamic cont rast-enhanced sequences and who had final histopathology diagnosed. Major e xclusion criteria at recruitment were age below 18 years, deranged renal functions, and metallic implants. Two trained radiologists initially blinded to histopathology diagnosis assessed ORADS-MRI and ADNEX-MR scores in each tumo ur. The final score and the diagnosis were assigned by consensus, ORADS 1-3 and ADNEX 1-3 as benign, ORADS as an d subsequently correlated with histopathology. Results or Findings: The cohort comprised 45 patients with 63 tumours, histopathology diagnosis was 36 benign and 27 malignant tumours. MRI vis-a-vis ORADS-MRI was superior in specificit y, PPV and diagnostic accuracy and further, since ORADS-MRI is more definitive for risk assignment in tumours with score 5 (ORADS >90%, ADN EX >50%) the transition from ADNEX-MR score towards ORADS-MRI al gorithms is adequately justified.

Y. P. Lee*, J. A. U. Perucho, G. S. Kwok, K. Y. Tse, P. Ip; Hong Kong/CN (eyplee77@hku.hk) Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of PET/CT in monitoring tr eatment response in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) afte r neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Methods or Background: Patients with advanced EOC (FIGO III-IV) were prospectively recruited to undergo PET/CT after 3-6 cycles of NACT before interval debulking surgery. PET/CT was evaluated us ing a 5-point Likert scale. Nineteen regions in the abdominopelvic cavity were evaluated on PET/CT (subdiaphragmatic spaces, perihepatic, liver serosa and lym ph nodes, and central pelvis) and correlated with surgical evaluation and histopathological assessment. Histopathological specimens were taken as the gold standard. In the event where resection was not performed and biopsy could not be safely taken (e.g. miliary serosal disease), the intra-ope rative surgical findings were taken as the standard of reference. A region-based analysis was performed. The diagnostic characteristics of PET/CT were descr ibed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negati ve predictive values (NPV). Results or Findings: The average accuracy of region-based analysis was 0.88 (sensitivity 0.38, specificity 0.96, PPV 0.56 and NPV 0.91) based on 285 regions evaluated in 15 patients with EOC. Sensitiv ity in disease detection was low in all regions evaluated, but PET/CT showed high specificity and NPV, except for disease in the omentum (specificity 0.71, NPV and central pelvis (specificity 0.71, NPV 0.63). Conclusion: PET/CT was highly specific with a high NPV in evaluating the abdominopelvic cavity of advanced EOC following NAC T. These metrics could be useful in surgical planning in stratifying patients for less aggressive and extensive debulking surgery when the disease was de emed to be absent on PET/CT.

Methods or Background: Patients who underwent a pelvic MRI on a 3T scan for clinical and/or ultrasound suspicion of deep endometriosis were prospectively enrolled (December 2020 - August 2021 ). Two radiologists (with 10 and 2 years of experience, respectively) qualitatively evaluated in consensus standard MRI sequences to detect endometr iotic lesions. The most experienced radiologist assessed the presence of si gnal voids on T2*-weighted sequences: in case of discrepancy between standard and T2* sequences, MRI images were re-evaluated in consensus. Equivocal lesions were assessed through second-look ultrasound and clinical evaluat ion. Results or Findings: Forty patients (mean age 35.5 years) with a total of 78 endometriosis foci were included in the study. 24,4% (19/78) of endometriotic lesions detected through morphologic standard sequences a signal loss in T2*-sequences. At radiologic re-evaluation, 13/19 lesions associated with signal voids (68.4%) have been related to artefacts (including air or previous surgery) or hemorrhagic foci not linked to endometriosis (i.e., hemorrhagic corpus luteum). Among lesions whose nat ure on T2* sequences was still unclear but not artefact-related (31.6%; 6/19), only 4 resulted consistent with endometriosis at the ultrasound and clinical follow-up and none was an isolated lesion. Conclusion: T2*-weighted sequences, even if can of hemosiderin deposits in endometriotic foci, do not seem to provide an added value in the assessment of deep lesions. Furthermor e, artefacts caused by undesirable sources of magnetic signal voids may le ad to diagnostic overestimation. Limitations: The limited sample size. Lack of surgical correlati on.

H. H\u00e4rm\u00e4*, S. Imboden, F. Purpose: Diaphragmatic endometriosis on MRI. Methods or In this retrospective single-centre study from 2017 to 2021, nineteen patients with detected diaphragmatic endometriosis (DE) on MRI were consecutively included. Among them (1) pat ients without DE symptoms referred for pelvic endometriosis MRI (peMRI), including upper abdomen chemical shift sequence (uaCSS) and (2) sym ptomatic patients suspicious for DE referred for diaphragm endometriosis MRI (diMRI). The image analysis was followed-up by a gynecologic radiologist. Location, number, size, laterality and accuracy of DE finding s, as clinical symptoms and correlation with pelvic/bowel deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), were investigated. The MR-graphic findings were intra-op erative and histopathologically proven. Descriptive statistics, means, medians and ranges were calculated for continuous variables; frequenci es for categorical variables. Confusion matrix/PPV/NPV (Excel 2016). Results or Findings: MRI detected 49 DE suspicious lesions in 19 patient s. 47% (9/19) of the patients were referred for diMRI, being suspicious for DE. 53% (10/19) patients were referred for peMRI with u aCSS without any suspicion on DE but pelvic endometriosis. 57% of DE lesions were located posteriorly, 33% laterally, and 10% anteriorly. The mean size of all DE lesions was 13.9 mm (range 3mm-38mm). Until now, nine patients (9/19) underwent a laparoscopic operation resulting in a PPV of 75% for DE detection on MRI. 5/9 operated patients were referred to pelvic MRI. DE w as proven in 6/9 patients intra-operatively and histopathologically. False-po sitive findings in two patients were identified as a diaphragmatic post-operative s car. Both DE and pelvic or bowel DIE was diagnosed in 58%/53% of the women. Conclusion: The current study demonstrated the importance of incorporating diaphragmatic imaging to pelvic endometriosis MRI. It allows the DE diagnosis in an early stage, offers optimal patient counselli ng, management of the surgery and anticipating its complexity. Limitations: Small patient population.

Bannas; Hamburg/DE (a.lenz@uke.de) Purpose: To determine the association normalised diameters (Z- score) and 4D aortic haemodynamics in Marfan patients. Methods or Background: We prospectively performed a 4D flow MRI at 3T of the thoracic aorta in 100 Marfan patients (36\u00b114 ye ars). Patients were divided Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 43 into two groups according to Z-score of the aortic helical and vortical flow in the ascending aorta was evaluated according to a 3-point scale (0: no, 1: rotation <360\u00ba, 2: rotation >360\u00ba). In addition, we assessed wall shear stress (WSS) and flow eccentricity at the aorta (midAAo), compared using unpaired t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. Results or Findings: Flow eccentricity at the level of STJ was to Marfan patients with Z-score <2. W SS at the level of STJ was significantly lower in Z-score >2 patients aorta were more pronounced in Z-score >2 patients; however, tatistically significant. Conclusion: Marfan patients with pathologically increased Z-sco res reveal increased flow eccentricity and reduced WSS compare d to Marfan patients with physiological Z-scores. Limitations: Visual assessment of helical and vortical flow as w ell as manual positioning of 2D analyses planes for assessment of WSS and flow eccentricity may introduce a subjective bias and affect both qualitative and quantitative results.

I. Ristow, (ch.riedel@uke.de) Purpose: intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) stent-grafts using a 3D-printed flow phantom. Methods or Background: A flow phantom mimicking the portal venous vasculature was 3D-printed using Clear Resin (Forml abs). The model consisted of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the splenic vein (SV) draining into the extrahepatic portal vein (PV), th e intrahepatic TIPS-tract, and the liver vein. A Viatorr\u00ae stent-graft was position ed within the TIPS tract. SMV and SV served as inlets for blood-mimicking fluid a nd were connected over a flow regulator and a flow sensor to a pump. TIPS fl ow rates ranging from 0.8- 2.8 L/min were preset and 4D flow MRI acquisitions were performed at 3T using a velocity encoding (venc) of both 100cm/s an d 200cm/s. 4D flow MRI- derived datasets at predefined level s including SMV, SV, PV, the uncovered part of the stent-graft as well as th e covered stent-graft (distal, central, proximal). 4D flow MRI-derived flow rates were compared to preset flow rates as a standard of reference. Results or Findings: At a venc of 200cm/s, 4D flow MRI-derived flow rates were significantly correlated with the preset flow rates at all vascular levels and within the stent-graft (all r>0.98, p<0.001). At a venc of the stent-graft at fl ow rates 2.0L/min. Lower preset flow rates were also significantly correlate d with 4D flow MRI-derived flow rates (all r>0.99, p<0.05). In the uncovered s tent-graft, 4D flow MRI underestimated the flow rate at a venc of 100cm/s by 1-6%. Conclusion: 4D flow MRI enables valid flow evaluation within TI PS stent- grafts and warrants further in vivo validation studies to determine its clinical usefulness for monitoring TIPS function and patency .

Li, K. Zhao, Z. Bi; Beijing/CN (liujia8877@126.com) Purpose: To compare the image quality of MR pul monary angiography (MRPA) with two different voxel sizes. Methods or Background: This study consisted of 29 healthy volunteers (13 males, mean age: 44.1\u00b18.0 years) who were given wri tten informed consent. All non-contrast MRPA data were collected on a 1.5T MR scanner (MAGNETOM Aera, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with an 18- channel body coil and an integrated 32-channel spine matrix coil. A free- breathing 3D turbo spin-echo (TSE) with variable-fl ip-angle sequence (SPACE) was used to acquire non-contrast MRPA data with the following two sequences of different 1) voxel size=1.2\u00d71.2\u00d74 mm 3. 2) voxel size=2\u00d72\u00d72 mm3. The subjective image quality assessment of nor mal pulmonary arteries was evaluated by one experienced radiologist on pri mary coronary images and constructed axial images separately. The image qual ity of the two groups was compared by the paired t-test. Results or Findings: The mean image quality scores of the main, left, an d right pulmonary arterial trunks on primary coronary images were 3.0\u00b10.6, 3.0\u00b10.6, 3.0\u00b10.6 (group 1) and 2.4\u00b10.6, 2.5\u00b10.6, 2. 5\u00b10.8 (group 2). The mean image quality scores of the main, left, and right p ulmonary arterial trunks on constructed axial images (group 1) and 2.0\u00b10.8, 2.1\u00b10.7, 2.1\u00b10.7 (group 2). The branch image qualit y of group 1 was better than group 2 on primary coronal images (p<0.05). However, the image quality of the left and right pulmonary artery trunk in group 2 was better than group 1 on constructed axial images (p<0.05). Conclusion: Non-contrast MRPA images with higher resolution wit hin a coronal plane can provide acceptable image quality but images with isotropy can acquire better constructed axial image quality.

Csre*, F. Purpose: Patients with lower extremity arterial disease (LEA D) often present with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in whom the use of nephroprotective imaging is of utmost importance. We compared the di agnostic performance of two such modalities: the non-contrast quiescent-int erval single-shot (QISS) angiography (CO2-DSA). Methods or Background: CO2-DSA and QISS-MRA images of patients with chronic LEAD scheduled for elective diagnostic imaging were compared. A 19- segment lower extremity arterial model was used to assess the degree of stenosis (none, <50%, 50-70%, correlation coefficient (IC C) was calculated for both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Three regi ons (aorto-iliac, femoro-popliteal, tibio-peroneal) were created by the segments for the final analysis. Diagnostic accuracy and interpretability were also evaluated. Results or Findings: 523 segments were evaluated in 28 patients (mean ag e: 71\u00b19 years). Subjective image quality of QISS-MRA w as significantly better compared to CO2-DSA for all compared to predictive value 83.2%, negative pr edictive value 93.3%. ICC regarding better diagnostic value than CO2-DSA in subjective assessment of image quality in all regio ns studied, proved to be an excellent reproducible method for the assessment of LEAD.

Talei Franzesi\u00b9, \u00b9Monza/IT, \u00b2Bergamo/IT performance of a standar dised MR angiography (MRA) protocol in the study of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Methods or Background: A total of 20 patients who underwent MRA study to investigate vascular TOS were retrospectively enrol led. Protocol sequences include Balanced Fast Field Echo M2D, Turbo Spin Ec ho T1 weighted, high- resolution TSE T1 weighted, HR TSE DIXON T2 weighte d, contrast-enhanced MRA (CE- MRA), pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted high-resolution isotropic volume examination. Baseline sequences were perform ed with the arms in adduction, CE-MRA sequences were performed both wit h arms in adduction and abduction, with an injection of contrast media repeated for each arms' position. Results or Findings: Sixteen patients showed unilateral TOS (n=16, 80%), with the left side more frequently involved (n=10, 64.5%) than the right one arterial TOS (aTOS) in one cas e an overlap between vTOS-aTOS (5%) was reported. Eight patients showed compression with the arm in abduction (50%), 8 with the arm both in adduction and abduction (50%). In 5 cases TOS was caused by an osseus abnormalities both post-traumatic or post-surgical. In 6 patients (30%) vTOS was associated with thrombosis. Twenty per cent of TOS were caused by muscle hypert rophy or wrong insertion. Five out of sixteen cases involved the s calene triangle (31%), 8/16 the costoclavicular space (50%) and 3/16 patients t he subacromial-pectoralis space (19%). In 4/20 patients vascular TOS was not identified (20%). Conclusion: A standardised MRI protocol with CE-MRA sequence wi th arms in adduction and abduction allows identifying the p resence of vascular TOS, along with the identification of the intrinsic and extrinsic abnormalities causing pathology.

E. Derchi; Genoa/IT RPS 2210-2 Value of contrast administration in patients with r heumatoid arthritis receiving a 3T MRI scan of the finger joints *M. Frenken*, D. is the most common inflam matory joint disease worldwide and leads to the destruction of bone and cartilage. This prospective study helps to evaluate the value of gadolinium-containing contrast agent application in magnetic resonance imaging (MR I) of the finger joints in patients with RA using the rheumatoid arthritis MRI score (RAMRIS) and its predictive value on treatment response and remission. Methods or Background: 31 therapy-na\u00efve patients with RA underwent pre- therapeutic MRI (t0) of finger joints and follow-up MRI at 3 (t1) and 6 months (t2) after therapy initiation. CRP was measured to determine treatment response and remission. All MRI examinations were e valuated according to RAMRIS for metacarpophalangeal joints. Synovitis as part of the RAMRIS was evaluated after contrast application as standard an d additionally with a STIR sequence instead. The extent to which RAMRIS of finger joints is a predictor of treatment response or remission was investigated for both MRI protocols, with and without contrast administration. Differences we re validated by Mann- Whitney-U test. Results or Findings: As expected, standard RAMRIS with contrast administration was a good predictor for treatment r esponse and remission after therapy STIR-based RAMRIS also showed differences between responders/non-responders or remission/non-remission at t2. Conclusion: In terms of predictive value for treatment response and remission, RAMRIS of finger joints with and without contrast administration showed similar diagnostic accuracy. The results indicate that native STIR sequences may replace contrast administration in RA imaging. Limitations: Other RA-predilection sites besides the hand could be examined.

Benjamin Abrar: Nothing to disclose RPS 2210-3 50 shades of backfill: new bone formation Several sacroiliac joint (SIJ) space in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) were previously described such as inflammation or fatty metaplasia inside an erosion, i.e. \"backfill\" . This study aims to link the aforementioned changes to CT and to understand, whi ch findings represent new bone formation. Methods or Background: Out of 178 patients from two prospective studies that included CT and MRI of the SIJs, all patients with the axSpA were selected. MRI was screened by two senior musculoskeletal radiologists in consensus for joint-space related findings and in t hree categories, Type A: hyperintense in STIR and C: hypointense in and hyperintense in T1 (backfill). By using image fusio n techniques and one-by-one comparison, the Hounsfield Units (HU) of those lesi ons, normal cartilage and spongeous and cortical bone were measured in CT. Results or Findings: Ninety-nine axSpA were identified, and 48 Type A, 8 8 Type B and 84 Type C lesions were included. The HU values of cartilage were 73.6\u00b115.0, spongiosa 188.0\u00b169.9, cartilage 1086.0\u00b11 00.3, Type Type C 446.8\u00b1123.0, respecti vely. The lesion values were significantly higher than cartilage and spongi osa but lower than cortical bone (p<0.001). Type A and B showed similar HU (p=0.93), whereas Type C lesions were less dense (p<0.001). Conclusion: All joint space lesions (Type A to C) showed a calc ified matrix and, thus, resemble new bone formation with gradual ly higher values in Type C lesions, i.e. typical backfill. Therefore, the nomenclature of those lesions should be critically re-assessed. Limitations: Image fusion between MRI and CT scans was done manually by landmarks. Up to four lesions per patient were meas ured.

Maas; Amsterda m/NL Purpose: The purpose this study was to evaluate if dual-energy CT (DECT) can be used to quantitatively assess osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Methods or Background: All patients with a diabetic foot ulcer and suspect ed osteomyelitis that underwent a DECT-scan (dual-sour ce 80kVp and Sn150kVp) between January 2018 and January 2021 wer e retrospectively included. Two observers independently measured CT-v alues in Hounsfield Units (HU) of the bone adjacent to the ulcer and of a reference bone, either the same location on the contralateral foot or, if unav ailable, the talus in virtual non-calcium images. Subjects were divided into two groups, \"osteomyelitis\" or \"no-osteomyelitis\", based on the conventional CT report. CT-values were compared between groups and between affected and reference bone within both groups. Observer agreement was tested using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results or Findings: Fifty-seven foot ulcers were identified of which tw enty- four were suspected for osteomyelitis based on the radiology report. The mean CT-value at the suspected location in the osteomyel itis group was -16.55 HU (SD 34.35) and -67.71 HU (SD 51.62) in the no-osteomyelitis group. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the osteomyelitis group, the difference between affected bone and reference bone was statistically significant (p<0.001); this was not the case in the no-osteomyelitis group (p=0.51). The observer agreement was good for affec ted bone measurements (ICC=0.840) and moderate for reference bone measurements (ICC=0.584). Conclusion: Dual-energy CT seems a promising diagnostic tool for the quantitative assessment of osteomyelitis in patient s with diabetic foot ulcers. Limitations: The main limitation is the absence of comparison wi th MRI since this is considered the gold standard.

M. Chapagain*, M. Rajeswari J. Lowe, S. Dahal, T. E. Kirkbride, S. Gieseg, P. Butler, A. Butler; C hristchurch/NZ (Krish22chapagain@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate water and lipid component measurement from spectral photon-counting CT for the detection of bone marrow oedema in acute bone injury. Methods or Background: Patients with acute bone injury were imaged using high-resolution spectral photon-counting CT in the early phase of injury. Physical phantoms were developed to mimic bone marr ow and validate water and lipid measurements. The phantoms contained a tw o-material mixture (water gel, peanut oil) and a three material mixtur e (water gel, oil and hydroxyapatite nanopowder). Lipid and water maps we re generated by harnessing the spectral information contained in th e photon-counting CT images. For both phantoms and human images, regions of interest (ROIs) Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 47 were drawn in the target areas and reference areas to quantitatively measure the water and lipid concentrations. The estimated v alues from the photon- counting CT were compared with reference values usi ng linearity plots, and the agreement between reference and estimated values were analysed with Bland- Altman plots. Results or Findings: Estimated water and lipid mass density values had a linear correlation with reference values (linearity =0.98, 0.99) The measurements were not significantly different from reference values (p=0.63, 0.91) with average quantification errors (Bias) (-1.9% and -0.4%), upper limit of agreement (11.5%, 8.7%), and lower limit of agreeme nt (-14.7%, -7.9%) for water and lipid component estimation respectively. Similar to phantom results, the targeted regions in human images showed an incr ease in water mass density. Conclusion: Lipid and water components measured from the system are validated using phantom measurements to demonstrate the bone marrow oedema in patients with an acute injury. Limitations: Comparisons with MRI is not done at this stage, whi ch will be performed in the next phase. Ethics committee approval: The ethics committee approval was received (18/STH/221).

RPS 2210-8 The diagnostic accuracy of AI for ruling out C-spin e fractures: are we there yet? *G. van den Wittenboer*\u00b9, A. de Wit\u00b9, E. Langius-Wi ffen\u00b9, B. van der Kolk\u00b9, I. R. Boomsma\u00b9; \u00b9Zwolle/NL, \u00b2Amsterdam/NL Purpose: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of a cervical spi ne (C-spine) artificial intelligence (AI) application (Aidoc Medical, Tel Aviv, Israel) for identifying C-spine fractures on CT scans. Methods or Background: A retrospective diagnostic accuracy study was performed in a level one trauma centre. Consecutive trauma patients (age 18 years; 2007-2014) were screened with CT for C-spine fractures. To set the reference standard, one radiologist and three neurosurgeons verified scans considered positive by the radiologist on-call and two radiologists verified negative scans that were flagged positively by the AI application. The index test was defined as detection of 1 fracture(s) per scan by the FDA approved and CE marked AI application. The proportion of pat ients with missed fractures that received stabilising therapy was determined to highlight therapeutic consequences of missed fractures. Results or Findings: The AI application analysed 2331 patients. After verification, the on-call radiologist's report was adjusted for 25 patients initially considered negative and flagged positive by the AI (1.2% of all negative scans), increasing the total number of fractures by 13%. The AI application detected 159/211 patients with fractures, resulting in a sensitivity of 75% (95% confidence interval (CI) 69-81%). 16/52 (31%) patients with fractures missed by the AI had received stabilising therapy. Specifi city of the AI application was 99% (95% CI 98-99%), overall diagnostic accuracy 97% positive predictive value 86% (95% negative predictive value 98% (95% CI 97-98%). Conclusion: The moderate sensitivity of the AI and the high-mis s rate of injuries that received stabilising therapy makes a stand-alone application for screening purposes less expedient, however, as a co ncurrent reader, AI could aid the radiologist by detecting previously unnotic ed fractures, thus increasing the diagnostic yield.

El-Essawy\u00b2, E. of the s ciatic and tibial nerves in patients with IBM compared with Charcot-M arie-Tooth disease type IA (CMTIA) and healthy controls using MRI and correlate these nerve measurements with the clinical data and disease scores. Methods or Background: MRI of the sciatic and tibial nerves was performed at 3T using magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence (MPRAGE) and 2D Dixon. The nerve CSA was measured at the mid-thigh and upper-calf regions by an observer blinded to the diagnosis. The measurements were correlated with clinical parameters. Results or Findings: 20 patients with IBM, 20 CMT1A patients and 29 heal thy controls (age and sex-matched) were studied. Sciati c nerve CSA was significantly enlarged in patients with IBM and CMT 1A compared to controls (sciatic nerve mean CSA 62.3\u00b122.9mm also enlarged in IB M and CMT1 patients compared to controls. There was no significant corr elation between CSA nerve measurements in patients with IBM and clinical disease scores. However, in CMT1A patients, sciatic nerve CSA correlated positi vely with age (p0.02) as well as the duration of disease r=0.56-0.61 (p 0.01). Conclusion: MRI reveals significant hypertrophy of the sciatic and tibial nerves in patients with IBM and CMT1A compared to controls . This study is the first study to demonstrate and quantify nerve hypertrophy in IBM patients using MRI. Further studies are needed to validate this fe ature, correlate with neurophysiological evaluation, and assess its diagn ostic value. Limitations: No gross limitations.

Ruivo, B. Papanikolaou; Lisbon/PT Purpose: Volumetry studies have shown that breast cancer pat ients undergoing treatment present reduced volumes in the bilateral thalamus, putamen, frontal and temporal lobes, compared with healthy controls (HC). Since cingulum fibers are interconnecting some of t hese structures, our aim was to identify local fractional anisotropy (FA) changes in patients which may explain the cancer-related cognitive impairment. Methods or Background: Brain MRI examinations of 32 non-metastatic breast cancer patients - 17 endocrine-treated (ET) and 15 chemotherapy- treated (CT) - were prospectively acquired on a 3T scanner at two timepoints, namely, before (t0) and 6 months after treatment (t 1). Additionally, 19 age- matched female HC, from two OpenNeuro datasets, wer e included in the analysis. A b-value of 1000 s/mm2 and 64 or 128 dif fusion encoding directions were used as acquisition parameters for the DTI seq uence. For regional-tract analysis, local differences in FA for the bilateral cingulum were quantified between groups by adapting an available MATLAB code. Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 48 Results or Findings: Visual analysis of fiber tracking results has depic ted local changes in FA, which motivated the cingulum r egional analysis. Overall, it was found a bilateral cingulum anisotropy reduction in patients compared with HC, both at t0 and t1. Particularly, there was a po int\u00adgroup interaction, statistically significant after multiple comparison s correction, with patients showing lower FA in the middle of the cingulum comp ared with HC. No significant differences were found between ET and C T patients. Conclusion: White\u00admatter integrity loss for the bilateral cingulum in breast cancer patients was shown. This tract belongs to a limbic circuit involved in memory and emotions, which may be associated with s ymptoms reported by patients. Limitations: Use of external HC datasets. Ethics committee approval: MRI acquisitions approved by the local ethics committee. Funding for this study: BOUNCE project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.

J. Shao*, S. Xiang, J. Fang, W. Su, Y. Yang, Y. Xiong, J. Li; Kunming/CN (wave.forever@yeah.net) Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of amide proton transfer weighted (APTw) in reflecting the pathological changes of brain tis sue, cognitive impairment in T2DM rat. Methods or Background: 48 Sprague\u00adDawley male rats were divided into control and T2DM groups. Cognitive function was ass essed using the Morris water maze experiment. The APTw signal intensity (S I)(%) was measured by APTw . Tau expression was determined using immunofl uorescence and Immunohistochemistry. Pearson and Spearman correlat ion analysis were used to study the relationship between hippocampal APTw SI (%), tau protein expression and cognitive function. Results or Findings: The escape latency time significantly reduced in th e T2DM group. The APTw SI(%) in bilateral hippocampus in T2DM group was significantly higher than that in NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with control group, the expression of t\u00adTau and p\u00adTau ser199 inc reased in T2DM group (P < 0.05). The expression of t\u00adTau protein was positi vely correlated with escape latency time (rho = 0.425 P = 0.0486). There was a positive correlation between APTw SI(%) and t\u00adTau protein expression. AP Tw SI (%) is negatively correlated with platform crossings times. Conclusion: T2DM may result in increase the expression of t\u00adTau and p\u00ad Tauser199 protein in hippocampus. The increase of t \u00adTau protein may be the cause of DACD. MRI APTw technology can be used as an imaging biomarker for the pathological changes of brain parenchyma an d cognitive function in T2DM.

(prasathswaminathan.rad@gmail.com) Purpose: DTI can detect changes of microstructural brain dam age in mTBI, however subtle changes in recovery process remains a challenge. NODDI measures orientation dispersion index (ODI), neurit e density index (NDI) and isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) which may elucidate the process in mTBI recovery. Methods or Background: 56 mTBI and 19 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. Neuropsychological assessment battery sc reening module (S\u00adNAB) performance were assessed 2 weeks post\u00adtrauma and at 3 months. The mTBI group was then divided into recovered (REC; S\u00adNAB 85) and non\u00adrecovered (NREC; S\u00adNAB <85), whereby domains affected were mainly attention and language. DTI and NODDI were done at 3 months. Usin g tract\u00adbased spatial statistics (TBSS), DTI and NODDI parameters were ob tained for 50 white matter tracts (WMTs). Data was analysed using SPSS. Results or Findings: NODDI demonstrated significant changes (p<0.050) in multiple WMTs. Significantly lower NDI was the still\u00adrecovering NREC WMT s. Significantly higher ISOVF was (0.0716, 0.1349) than NREC (0 .0526, 0.0983) in the right external capsule and left fornix/stria terminalis, which may represent increased CSF surrounding healed WMTs. No significant difference between REC and NREC was found in DTI. Conclusion: NODDI detected more microstructural WMT changes than DTI at 3 months. We postulate that at three months post\u00admT BI, there is concurrent axonal degeneration and astrogliosis following trauma, which was more abundant in the NREC group. The significantly affec ted WMTs are comparable to tracts seen in previous studies on mTBI. Limitations: Significant number of participants whom defaulted.

Methods or Background: This was one\u00adyear tertiary care teaching hospital\u00ad based case\u00adcontrol study. MRI analysis was done in 40 non\u00adepileptic controls and 40 patients with intractable epilepsy on 1.5T s canner. Visual assessment and hippocampal volumetry were done on oblique coronal IR/T2W and oblique coronal FLAIR images, respectively. T2 relaxation t imes were measured using 16\u00adecho Carr\u00adPurcell\u00adMeiboom\u00adGill sequence. All cas es were correlated with EEG findings for lateralisation of the epileptic fo cus. Results or Findings: The study showed that the highest percentage of MTLE cases were seen in patients with seizures onset in a group of 11\u00ad20 years of age and no sex predilection was noted (M:F= 1.5:1). Mean right and left hippocampal and 2.10 cm3 (P\u00advalue of <0.001) were found in the cases of study, which was decreased compared to control. T2 relaxation time was increased in MTLE cases (P\u00advalue of <0.001). Two other parameters hippocampal volume ratio (HVR) and hippocampal volume difference (HVD) were included in study to detect unilateral cases of mesial temporal sclerosis. Conclusion: There was an increase in the sensitivity of detecti on of mesial temporal sclerosis in epilepsy patients on including quantitative methods like T2 relaxometry and hippocampal volumetry with conve ntional MRI. Use of quantitative methods leads to early diagnosis and helps treatment.

Author Disclosures: Niharika Sharma: Nothing to disclose RPS 2211-8 calcaneal Marseille/FR (cecile.deniel@hotmail.fr) Purpose: To evaluate the possibility and accuracy of the medial calcaneal nerve assessment using ultra sound examination. Sec ondary objective was to define anatomical landmarks to facilitate the medial calcaneal nerve study for non musculoskeletal specialised radiologists. Methods or Background: This study was first undertaken in eight cadaveric specimens then followed by high resolution ultrasonographic examination of 20 healthy volunteers (40 legs) by a fellow musculoskeletal radiologist. The location and course of the medial calcaneal nerve w as depicted, as well as its relationship to the adjacent anatomic structures. Results or Findings: High resolution ultrasonography permitted effective study of the medial calcaneal nerve throughout its course. The medial calcaneal nerve mainly branches from the tibial ner ve. The level at which it branches is highly variable with a mean distance fr om the medial malleolus tip of 14.1mm (range -7 - 75). More distally, at the level of the medial calcaneal side, it ends close to the abductor hallucis muscle with a mean distance of 1.28mm (range 0 - 2.8). Conclusion: The medial calcaneal nerve study is achievable using high resolution ultrasonography. The definition of easy to use anatomical landmarks allows physicians to routinely explore the MCN as a differential diagnosis for heel pain.

T. Gassert*, R. Burkhardt, T. Gora, D. Munich/DE (florian.gassert@t-online.de) Purpose: The aim of this study was to show the benefit of dark-field CT imaging for the detection of radiation-induced lung damage in early stages. Methods or Background: We compared attenuation based CT imaging to dark-field (DF) CT imaging in a murine model of radiation-induced lung damage in the right lung (n=6) and a control group (n=6). Animals were scanned before irradiation and 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks and 24 weeks thereafter. Three radiologists assessed the images twice for the presence of lung damage and rated their confidence on a scale f rom 1 to 5. The inter-rater- and intra-rater-reliability was determined and rated with Cohen's respectively Fleiss' . For the quantitative analysis the ratio of the mean pixel value of the right and left lung ( =mright/mleft) was calculated. Results of the irradiated group were compared with the respective control gro up by using a t-test. Results or Findings: The sensitivity of DF CT for radiation-induced lung damage in the reader study was significantly higher at 12 weeks (Att: 36.7%, DF: 53.3%, : 91.7%, p<0.001). The overall confidence of the readers was significantly higher when reading DF images (Att: DF imaging. For attenuation based i maging the difference of the ratio between the control group and the irradiated group became significant after 20 weeks (p=0.011), while for DF imaging it was already highly significant after 16 weeks (p=0.003). Conclusion: This small animal study demonstrates that dark-fiel d CT imaging allows for the detection of radiation-induced lung damage in early stages and, in that respect, is superior to conventional CT. Limitations: This study is limited by its small cohort only. Ethics committee approval: The ethics committee approval was obtained. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Measurement of a modulation transfer function (MTF) and acquisition of a line pairs phantom were performed. An anthropomorphic lung nodules phantom was scanned un der standard, low, and ultra-low radiation doses. A human volunteer underw ent scans, at 120 kVp standard (62 mAs) and low (11 mAs) dose. High-resol ution (HR) images were reconstructed with 1024 matrix, 300mm FOV and 0.25m m slice thickness. Lung structures conspicuity and sharpness, image noise and overall image quality were independently analysed by three radiol ogists and compared to a previous scan (120kVp, 10mAs). Results or Findings: 10 % MTF was measured at 22.3lp/cm with a cut-off at 31lp/cm. Up to 28lp/cm were depicted. While mixed a nd solid nodules were depicted on standard and low dose images with FBP, ultra-low dose imaging necessitated the use of iDose and 1mm slice thickness to allow visualisation of the ground-glass component. In a human volunteer, s tandard dose SPCCT images were of greater overall image quality and lu ng structures conspicuity and sharpness than conventional CT images and comparable image noise. Low dose SPCCT images were of greater or similar conspicuity and sharpness of lung structures, of equivalent overall image quality, of lower but acceptable image noise despite a flux reduction of 89%. Conclusion: An SPCCT prototype demonstrated high-resolution tec hnical capabilities and high image quality on a human volunteer for lung imaging.

Martini; Zurich/CH Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accur acy of emphysema quantification as performed on post-proce ssed virtual non- contrast images derived from computed tomography (PCD-CT). Methods or Background: Sixty-five who chest CT on a first-generation, clinical dual-sourc e PCD-CT were retrospectively included. Scans were performed in t he multi-energy (QuantumPlus) mode at 120kV with a non-contrast images (VNC) were post- processed from the venous as well as from the arterial phase. Images w ere assessed quantitatively (global noise index (GNI)) and quali tatively by independent readers (overall image quality, emphysema assessment, delineation of small structures). Emphysema quantification (with a thres hold of -950 HU) was performed for non-contrast images, contrast-enhanced images (arterial and venous phase) and the virtual non-co ntrast images (generated from both; the atrial the venous phase) by comm ercially available software. Non-contrast images served as a reference standard for emphysema quantification. Results or Findings: Virtual non-contrast images post-processed from the arterial phase (p=0,409) as well as from the venous phase (p=0.093) showed no significant difference in emphysema quantificati on relative to true non- contrast images while there was a highly significant difference compared for the contrast-enhanced scans (arterial and venous; p<0.001). GNI showed no significant difference between the virtual non-cont rast image from the arterial and venous phase and the true non-contrast image. T he score of subjective assessment was highest for the true non-contrast im age (p<0.001) while there was no significant difference between both virtual non-contrast reconstructions. Conclusion: Computer-aided emphysema quantification with PCD-CT is feasible for virtual non-contrast-enhanced images post-processed from the venous as well as the arterial phase.

Kauczor, W. Stiller, F. Weber, D. Do, M. O. Wielp\u00fctz; Heidelberg/D E Purpose: Chronic-obstructive airway diseases show progressiv e remodelling of airway dimensions. Inflammatory activity may be visualised by contrast enhancement in computed tomography (CT) examinations, which has not been systematically studied to date. Spectral CT offers the possibility to study contrast enhancement without the need for multiphas e acquisitions. Methods or Background: 234 lung healthy patients underwent dual-layer spectral CT (Philips iQon) with four retrospective groups: non-enhanced pulmonary (PV), pulmonary arterial (PA) and systemic arterial (SA) standardised contrast phase. Ten virtual monoenergetic series were reconstructed at 40-160 keV. Fully automatic segmentations were carried out using validated in-house software. Attenuation of t he airway wall was assessed in Hounsfield Units (HU) for airway generations G2, G3, G4 and combined G5- 10. The slope of the spectral attenuation was calculated by =(HU40keV- HU100keV)/60. Results or Findings: Slopes were significantly different for all airway generations between NE ( NE,G5-10=0.3HU/keV) vs. contrast-enhanced between PV and PA phase (pG5-10<0.001) but does not vary between PA and SA phase (pG5-10>0.999). Wall thickness (WT) for generation G5-10 did not change significantly between groups at any keV level (40 keV: WTNE=1.14 mm, quantify airway wall attenuation wi th a single acquisition by determining the slope of spectral en hancement, and may separate arterial and venous enhancement. Further s tudies are warranted to analyse spectral CT for inflammatory airway disease s. Limitations: The spectral slope is only assessed in airway-healt hy patients.

Methods or Background: QIBA recommended phantom was scanned by UHR-CT with normal resolution (NR: 0.5mm\u00d780 rows/89 6 channels), high A in five times. Then, all CT data were reconstructed as 0.5mm and 1mm section thicknesses by each reconstruction. Then, CT values of all dens ity forms and CT value within lung density form were determined by ROI measurements five times. Pierson's correlation was analysed between measured CT density and each form density on all CT protocols. To compare the ca pability for radiation dose reduction on each CT data with ADCT obtained by 400mA and reconstructed with hybrid-type IR (i.e. standard protocol), CT of each protocol was compared with that of the standard protocol by pair ed t-test. Results or Findings: There was a significant and excellent correlation w ith standard reference on each protocol (0.99<r<1, p<0. 0001). At each section thickness, there were no significant differences of CT between all CT protocols except 6mA and standard protocol (p>0.05) . Conclusion: For lung density assessment, hybrid-type and model- IR, as well as DLR on UHR-CT and ADCT, can reduce 95% r adiation dose with keeping accuracy as compared with standard CT proto col and QIBA profile. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: This study was a phantom study and no need for IRB approval.

M. t he condition of the lungs' alveolar structure. It has recently been translated from the lab to the clinical stage. Here, we evaluate its performance f or the detection of emphysema, and compare its diagnostic value with conventional radiography. Methods or Background: We included 91 patients after a medically indicated CT scan, either without any lung impairment or with varying stages of emphysema. As a reference standard, visual scores based on the Fleischner scale for emphysema severity (absent, trace, mild, moderate, confluent, advanced destructive emphysema) were assigned to al l CTs by three radiologists. For dark-field chest radiography, we employed a clinical prototype, which is capable of acquiring dark-field and attenuation-based radiographs simultaneously at a dose in the range of 0.035mSv. Both modalities, displayed individually and simultaneously, were rated for pre sence and severity of emphysema (no, mild, moderate, severe) by three radiologists. Statistical analysis included receiver-operator-characteristics and comparison of adjacent groups using two-sided Mann-Whitney-U-tests with a significance level of 0.05. Results or Findings: The dark-field images showed a decrease in signal strength with emphysema severity. Compared to conventional images (AUC=0.73), readers were better able to identify mi ld emphysema when reading dark-field images (AUC=0.86). While the dif ferentiation between trace and mild emphysema was not possible reading convent ional radiographs, readers could differentiate between these stages based on dark-field radiographs. Conclusion: Dark-field radiography increases the diagnostic val ue attenuation-based radiography for the identification and staging of emphysema, especially in the early stages. Limitations: There is only a limited number of participants. Emphysema was the only lung pathology under investigation.

Wagner; Paris/FR RPS 2305a-2 Doing more with less: combining manually annotated and automated liver segmentations to train deep neural network se gmentation algorithms is time-consuming and expensive. In this study, a DCNN was trained using a novel framework t hat incorporates a small set of manually annotated imaging with a large set of automated segmentations to supplement segmentation performanc e. Methods or Background: This study included 617 arterial-phase T1-weighted MR images of which 219 had corresponding manual liv er segmentations. The 219 annotated images were split into 50/15/35% (n=1 09/33/77) training/validation/testing subsets, respectively. First, ten proportions (10- 100%, increments of 10%) of manual liver segmentati ons from the training pool were used to train ten baseline (BL) DCNN models wi th identical 3D U-net architectures. The BL models were used to generate automated liver segmentations on the unlabeled dataset (n=398) and on the remaining portion of the training pool that was not in their respecti ve training set. Second, these automated segmentations were combined with the manu ally annotated images into new training sets and used to train ten enhanc ed-training (ET) DCNNs. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to q uantify segmentation performance and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was use d for comparisons. Results or Findings: BL models trained with more manual segmentations substantially outperformed BL models trained with f ewer segmentation data. ET models significantly outperformed their respecti ve BL models (for all training sets including 10-50% of available manual segmentations: p<0.05). Some ET models significantly outperformed BL models trained with more manual segmentations (ET 30% vs 40%, ET 70% vs B L 90%, p<0.05). Conclusion: This new training approach reduced the overfitting of models trained on smaller training sets and achieved satis factory liver segmentation performance even with fewer expert annotations, out performing models that were trained with more manual segmentations. Limitations: One network architecture was used and a single cont rast phase. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the local IRB.

We therefore present a deep-learning 3D-quantification model of neuroendocrine metastases (NELM) using gadoxetic-acid MRI. Methods or Background: In 149 patients, manual segmentations of NELM and livers were used to train a neural network (278 Gd-EOB MRI scans). Clinical utility was evaluated in another 33 patients which were discussed in our multidisciplinary cancer conference (MCC) and r eceived a Gd-EOB MRI both at baseline and as follow-up examination (n = 66). The model's measurements (NELM ( relNELM; relHTL) between baseline and follow-up were compared to MCC decisions of therapy response. Results or Findings: Internal and external validation of the model's acc uracy showed a high overlap for NELM and livers (Matthew' s correlation coefficient (phi): 0.76/0.95 (internal), 0.86/0.96 (external)) with phi in volume (phi= 0.80 vs. 0.71; p = 0.003). MCC decisions were by all response absHTL; optimal discrimination between therapy success or failure (AUC:1.000; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The deep-learning based model shows high accuracy i n 3D- quantification of NELM and HTL in Gd-EOB-MRI. The m odel's measurements correlated well with the evaluation of therapeutic response of an expert MCC. Limitations: The 3D assessment approach needs to be further eval uated in direct comparison to 2D measurements and its impact on clinical endpoints in larger cohorts. The ground truth of accuracy is bas ed on manual segmentation of liver metastasis. Due to the sometimes pronounced, even small foci of liver metastases, manual segmentation is not perfect.

Park*, S. S. Lee, Y. S. Sung, J. S. Yoon, H-I. Suk, H. J. Kim, S. H. Choi; Seoul/KR Purpose: To devise construct graft volume-to-weight conversi on formula and to evaluate efficiency and accuracy of DLA-assisted CT volumetry in right lobe (RL) graft in a large cohort of LDLT. Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled 581 RL donors and divided them into development and validation groups . The CT was analysed using DLA-assisted software. The graft volume-to-weight conversion formula was derived from the development group by linear regression. The agreement between estimated and measured graft weights and inter-reader agreement were assessed using CCC and 95% Bland-Altman LOA in the validation group. To assess factors influencing estimation error, mul tivariable linear regression was performed in the validation group. Results or Findings: Segmentation correction was required in 28.6% cases with short correction time (mean, 12.8\u00b133.6 seconds ) and small change in volume (95% LOA, -3.0% to 3.0%). The total process time ranged from 1.3 to 8.0 minutes (mean, 1.8\u00b10.6 minutes). The conversion formula was as follows: estimated graft weight (g)=206.3+0.653 x CT-measured graft volume (ml) (r=0.878, p<.001). Between estimated and measured graft weights, CCC was 0.834 and 95% LOA was -1.7%\u00b117.1% (P=.002). Of the 0.998 and 95% and BMI (coef ficient;-0.58) have a significant independent association with estimation error, while age, hepatosteatosis, CT interval and graft type did not . Conclusion: We proposed a graft volume-to-weight conversion for mula that would be useful in preoperative graft weight estimation. The DLA-assisted CT volumetry is a highly efficient method for preoperative graft weight estimation. The error margin of RL graft weight is within approximately 17% of graft weight. Limitations: First, it was retrospective. Second, we evaluated only RL graft donors. Third, development and validation groups we re enrolled in the same institution.

Ghelichoghli*\u00b9, S. M. Purpose: In this study, we have proposed and validated a ful ly automatic approach for the quantification of fatty liver dise ase using ultrasound images based on hepato-renal-index (HRI) calculation. The procedure includes segmentation of kidney and liver, detection of an R OI in the renal parenchyma region and liver at the same depth, and HRI calcula tion. Methods or Background: We proposed a highly accurate and fast convolutional neural network, named Fast-Unet, for the segmentation of kidneys and liver. The main superiority of Fast-Unet model is low response time, which is appropriate in ultrasound image anal ysis that needs on-site measurement by radiologists. We used a superpixel algorithm to find the lowest variance region in parenchyma as the renal R OI. At the next step, all pixels with the same depth as renal ROI centrum wer e found using the intersection of two borders of the convex probe sec tor. This step is conducted because if the renal and liver ROIs were not in the same depth resulting HRI is not accurate due to the ultrasound depth attenuation effect. Finally, an ROI in the liver with the same depth was found and HRI was calculated. Results or Findings: The train-test dataset contained 752 ultrasound images. The Dice and Jaccard coefficients were used to eval uate the segmentation step, and 94% and 89% for the kidney and 97% and 91% for the liver were achieved respectively. The predicted HRI values wer e also validated with a radiologist's report using the root-mean-square-err or (RMSE) metric and 0.04 was achieved. Conclusion: Automation of HRI calculation speeds up the fatty l iver diagnosis and helps novice radiologists to interpret ultrasou nd images more accurately.

Methods or Background: 500 patients were retrospectively enrolled from two hospitals. Model DL were built using delay phase MR images to assess fibrosis stages. In addition, different models of model DL c ombined with non-image information including biomarkers (APRI and FIB-4), virus status (hepatitis B and C virus tests), and MR information (manufactures and static magnetic field).The AUROCs were compared between different m odels using Delong test, the sensitivity and specificity of both model DL and model Full (model DL combined with all non-image information) were compared with experienced radiologists and biomarkers using McNemar's test. Results or Findings: In the test set, the AUROC (with 95% confidence intervals) values of model Full for fibr osis stages on diagnosing F0-4 and F1-4.Compared with the radiologists, model Full showed better specificity for fibrosis stage F0-4, better sensitivity for the other four classification tasks. While compared with biom arkers, both model DL and model Full showed significantly higher specificity in staging F3-4 and F4. Conclusion: DL using MR images with or without non-image data p rovides a promising non-invasive assessment tool for the staging liver fibrosis, and for distinguishing liver fibrosis patients from normal people, with a performance superior to experienced radiologists and biomarkers . Limitations: The sample among fibrosis stage was unbalanced.

Taghavi, F. C. Staal, M. H. Beets-Ta n, *S. H. Benson*; Amsterdam/NL Purpose: For solitary small (< 3 cm) tumors, ablation of liv er metastases is now part of international guidelines. However, a si gnificant number of patients experience regrowth due to insufficient treatment o r inadequate ablation of tumour margins. Local tumour is a threat to ov erall survival. The aim of this study was to create a deep learning model using CT images obtained at baseline and directly after treatment in order to predict which patients would later experience regrowth. Methods or Background: For this study, we retrospectively included 79 patients (120 lesions) with colorectal liver metast asis (CRLM) who were treated by thermal either radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or microwave ablation (MWA) for liver metastases (LM). Exclusion criteria were based on the ESMO guidelines. The pre- and post-tre atment scans were used Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 53 as input to a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The manual lesion delineation was used to identify a 3D region of interest (RoI) around each lesion. We employed transfer learning in order to train a deep learning model for the dataset in question. A 19-layer CNN f rom the Visual Geometry Group (VGG-19) was found to perform best. Results or Findings: The area under the receiver operating characteristi c curve (AUC) was found to be 0.72, 95% confidence interval: (0.64, 0.79). Conclusion: We have demonstrated that it is possible to use tra nsfer learning together with CNN models in order to predict tumour progression and also demonstrated that it is possible to employ state-of -the-art methods to avoid overfitting. Limitations: Small cohort size of 79 patients, therefore impacti ng the size of the AUC confidence interval.

To investigate if multi-phase radiomics model or the combination of r adiomics with clinical data improves response prediction. Methods or Background: A predictive CT-based radiomics signature was developed in 57 patients included in the TALENT phase II prospective trial of lenvatinib in advanced GEP-NET from October 2015 to August 2020. Radiomics features were extracted from all liver lesions at pre-treatment CT. Features were selected using minimum redundancy max imum relevance (mRMR) and combined in a logistic regression for pr edicting clinical benefit (progression free survival[PFS]>15 months). A multi phase model including arterial and portal acquisitions was developed. Mod els were validated internally and tested in an external cohort of 26 patients tre ated with the VEGFR1-3 inhibitor sunitinib. A regression model was used to combine radiomics and clinical variables. Model interpretability plots were also developed. Results or Findings: In the training and validation set, the model assoc iated with response (area under the curve [AUC] 0.76 and 0.69, respectively). In the test set the model associated with response (AUC = 0.68). The multi-phase didn't improve the prediction capacity (AUC = 0.59) . The model combining radiomics and clinical variables slightly improved the capacity for predicting response in the three cohorts (AUC = 0.78, 0.75 and 0.67, respectively). Interpretability plots showed that patients with hi gh radiomics-score presented more spherical and hypervascularised lesions. Conclusion: Single-phase radiomics associates with response anti- based the quantification of hypervas cularisation and tumour shape. Limitations: Further testing populations are needed to validate the prediction capacity of the model. Ethics committee approval: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a new compressed sensing free-breathing cine sequence (CS -FB) with motion correction (MOCO) can address such limitations. Methods or Background: Forty-eight patients referred for cardiac MRI rate) with fully automated MOCO. Short-axis stacks were acquired for each pati ent with matched parameters. Acquisition and reconstruction times, i mage quality (Likert scale from 1 to 4), left ventricular (LV) and right ventr icular (RV) volumes, LV, and RV ejection fractions (EF) and LV mass were assessed for each sequence. Results or Findings: CS-FB cine's scan time was shorter (2.2\u00b10.6 min for BH-SSFP, p<0.0001), although recons truction times were longer for min vs 0 min for BH-SSFP, p<0.0001). CS-FB achieved higher image quality (3.9\u00b10.3) than BH-SSF P (3.6\u00b10.6, respectively, p=0.0001), especially for patients with arrhythmia or difficulties holding breath Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 54 (n=19; 3.9\u00b10.2 vs 3.3\u00b10.7, p=0.002). Regardless of cardiac rhythm, LVEF, LV stroke volumes and mass were similar between both s equences. There was difference in RVEF (CS-FB: 49.9\u00b111.2%; astolic volumes. Conclusion: Free-breathing CS acquisition with MOCO can be reli ably performed in a clinical setting to evaluate LV parameters, with better image quality and shorter scan time than conventional cin e, especially for patients with arrhythmia or shortness of breath. Limitations: CS-FB sequence required longer reconstruction times than the reference BH-SSFP cine. However, the robustness of the CS-FB sequence against arrhytmia and respiratory motion avoid the repetition of cine acquisitions.

K. M\u00fcllerleile, D. S\u00e4ring, K. Lund, G. Adam, E. Tahir; Hamburg/DE (hang.chen@stud.uke.uni-hamburg.de) Purpose: Cardiac adaptation in endurance athletes is a well- known phenomenon, but the acute impact of strenuous exerc ise is fairly unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyse the alterations in biventricular and biatrial function in triathletes after an endurance race using novel feature- tracking cardiac magnetic resonance (FT-CMR). Methods or Background: Fifty consecutive triathletes (45\u00b110 years; 80% men) and were prospectively r ecruited. All underwent 1.5T CMR examination. The time interval between rac e completion and CMR was 2.3\u00b11.1 hours (range 1-5 hours). Biventricular left ejection fraction (LVEF), FT-CMR analys is and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging were performed. Global sy stolic longitudinal strain (GLS), circumferential strain (GCS) and radi al strain (GRS) were assessed. CMR was performed at baseline and followi ng an endurance race.

Liu*\u00b9, J. Li\u00b9, H. Pu\u00b9, \u00b2Shanghai/CN (dr_liujing@126.com) Purpose: Obesity increases the risk of heart failure and car diovascular mortality. However, the specific effects of obesity on cardiac structure and function have not been clarified. This study aimed to evaluate the left ventricular (LV) geometric and functional changes using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in uncomplicated obese adults. Methods or Background: A total of 48 obese participants and 25 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. The LV geomet ry, global systolic functions, and strains were assessed using CMR. Body composition was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results or Findings: Compared with healthy controls, the obese patients had greater LV size, mass, myocardial thickness, and im paired myocardial contractility with lower LV global radial, circumfe rential, and longitudinal peak strains (PS) and LV global circumferential and longitudinal peak diastolic strain rates (PDSR) (all p<0.05). Multivariable linear reg ression showed that the body mass index (BMI) was independently associated with LV average myocardial thickness (LVAMT), maximum tissue (VAT) was associated with LV global longitudinal PS and LV longitudinal and observed in obese adults with preserved LV ejection fraction. Instead of BMI, VAT is found to be a sensitive predictor for subcli nical LV dysfunction. Limitations: A cross-sectional study.

Wu*, X-Y. Q. Jiang; Shanghai/CN Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of cardiac DWI using conventional spin-echo (SE) EPI. Methods or Background: Seven female and five healthy male subjects (mean age, 39.2 \u00b1 13.0 years; heart rate, 69.8 \u00b1 7.8 bpm) without any contraindication to MR scanning underwent cardiac DWI, which was per formed on a 3 Tesla MR scanner (Elition X, Philips Healthcare, Best, th e Netherlands, Max G 45 mT/m, Max SR 200 T/m/s) with a a Diffusion-weighted SE-EPI respiratory navigation, volume shim, and fat suppression (both SPIR and gradient r eversal) was then performed with the following parameters: voxel size = 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 320 \u00d7 320 mm2, slice number 1, half scan factor 0.6 , SENSE factor 2.0, NSA 10, TR 1 heartbeat, 5 b values (200, 300, 500, 800, 1000 s/mm2) were acquired separately with b0, corresponding TEs are 35, 38, 42, 47, 50 ms. Scan time ~1min6s for each b value scan considering navigation efficiency of 60%. Results or Findings: Image quality degraded, and distortion became more severe, with higher b values. When b value > 500 s/ mm2, the overall mean image quality score was lower than 2.5.A significan t difference was also found between segments (SNR: F=4.59, P=0.001; CNR: F=4.60, P=0.001). interventricular septum, es pecially in the infero-septal part, compared with other segments. Conclusion: Using a clinical 3T scanner, SE-EPI DWI could be successfully performed with careful choice of navigator placement and cardiac trigger delay. Medium b values are recommended to obtain good image quality. Limitations: Only healthy volunteers were involved in this study . Patients should be included to investigate the diagnostic value of cardiac DWI in future studies. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

However, for imaging biomarkers such as strain, CS-derived measurements are significantly altered. Novel prototype rapid strain parameters (junction s train (JS) and long axis strain (RS)) are evaluated for their potential to overcome that bias. Methods or Background: 15 prospectively enrolled healthy volunteers (HV) underwent CMR including a stack of short-axis slices and two orthogonal left ventricular long-axis slices. Acquisitions were bas ed precession Cine (bSSFP) and CS-sequences. Excl usion criteria were any history of cardiac disease and abnormal volumes as characterised by CMR. Dedicated post-processing software (cvi42 Circle) w as used to compute JS, RS and global longitudinal strain (GLS). Results or Findings: GLS correlated moderately between bSSFP and RS correlated strongly between acquisitions (r= 0.70/0.69, respectively). Correlation between novel parameters and GLS was moderate in bSSFP (JS/GLS r=0.56; RS/GLS RS/GLS r= 0.31). Bland-Altman analysis showed a significant bias for CS- derived GLS with a mean difference of -3.9% and lim its of agreement (LoA) from -6.9 to -1.0%. There was no significant bias f or both JS and RS (mean differences -1.1/-1.0%; LoA -3.8 to 1.7/-3.8 to 1.8%). Conclusion: Novel rapid strain parameters correlate strongly between bSSFP and CS acquisitions and with established GLS. Howev er, they differ from GLS as there is no significant systematic bias between acquisition types. Limitations: Rapid post-processing strains are still under evalu ation, larger studies including patient populations are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these preliminary results.

A. Rainford; Dublin/IE B. M. Verbist; Leiden/NL RPS 2314-3 Referral justification and the role of pher L. Bowden, *L. Barreira*, S. Hoare; Dublin/IE Purpose: Recently in Ireland, the role of the radiographer has been revised to include a 'practitioner status', as amended into st atutory legislation S.I. 256. In effect, this means that radiographers have the qual ification and professional judgment to accept, reject or amend a referral according to the clinical information, prior imaging and presentation status of a patient. This ensures that no exam is performed without being justified i n advance by the radiographer and documented accordingly. A justific ation audit was devised in a Tertiary Paediatric Hospital to evaluate at what rate radiographers cancel or modify referrals received, the results of which are presented here. Methods or Background: Any referrals that had been cancelled or modified by radiographers at the time of examination were collected. The reasons for cancellation/modification were coded according to 13 different categories. The origin of the referrals was also recorded allowing the data to establish trends with relation to the clinics/departments where most modified/cancelled referrals originate from. Results or Findings: The majority of referrals that were modified or cancelled had originated from the emergency department (ED) ( 42%) and from the out- patient department (35%). The audits further demons trated that the majority of the reasons for cancelling/changing an exam are due to, 'incorrect exam selected according to clinical indication', 'unnecessary additional 'wrong body part', 'exam not justified by the referrer'. Conclusion: This audit shows that the role of the radiographer as a practitioner is both established and of fundamental importance to positive patient outcomes. Radiographers are not only profes sionally trained to act as practitioners but also are effective gate-keepers t o potential errors in the referral process. Outcomes and learnings from the a udit are disseminated among referrers where possible. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

S. Hussain*, I. Garba; Kano/NG (shussainreal@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate how the f ailure or inadequacy in filling of radiology request forms leads to an increase in patient radiation exposure resulting from repeat investigat ions. Methods or Background: A total of 158 patient request cards for convention al X-ray examination were randomly evaluated. Scoring criteria: filled; inadequately filled, and unfilled were used to scor e each item based on the following: patient demographic information; patient referral details and referring physician details. Repeat examinations due to inade quate filling or lack of filling of the request card were evaluated. Data was analys ed based on descriptive statistics using SPSS statistical software. Results or Findings: Patient names were adequately filled on all the request cards (100%). Demographic information related to gender and hospital number was provided in 94.9% and 93.7% of the request form s, respectively. Information related to patient referral details suc h as previous X-ray examination, blood pressure (BP), and last menstrual period (LMP) were inadequately filled with 4.4%, 2.5%, and 19.7% completion, respectively. Of the 158 request forms assessed, 33 (20.9%) led to repeat due to inadequate information provided. Inadequate information relate d to clinical history and requested examination had the highest and accounted for 45.5% and 24.2% of the causes of repeat, respectively. Conclusion: Study findings have shown that information related to patient referral details is the most inadequately provided information. Besides, clinical history and the requested examination are the commo nest causes of a repeat which is associated with an increase in patient exp osure and also in patients' waiting time all of which has medico-legal implicat ions and impact on the overall quality of service rendered. Limitations: The sample size is small considering the large number of requests received on the daily basis. Ethics committee approval: Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional research and ethics board. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Gon\u00e7alves, A. F. C. L. Abrantes, L. P. V. Rib eiro, S. I. Rodrigues, *O. Lesyuk*, J. Pinheiro, P . Almeida; Faro/PT Purpose: Clinical information is an important tool to perfor m correctly imaging studies. Immobilisation devices may difficult the i dentification of the region of study, therefore, proper communication before an ex amination to adjust the study to a patient's condition is important. The pr esent study aims to evaluate the existence or absence of clinical information in the examination requests forms in a radiology department. Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 56 Methods or Background: A retrospective study was carried out with a total of 600 examination requests from two hospitals (300 fr om the emergency department and 300 from routine procedures), which were analysed in order to assess the presence or absence of clinical informat ion. The instruments used were a checklist of existence or absence of clinical information in the examination request, and software for examination a nd visualisation of the exam request forms called RADIO from Global Intelli gent Technologies (Glintt). In the second phase, a questionnaire \"Relevance of prescription/clinical information in the Orto-traumatology services\" by V asconcelos was applied to a total of 34 radiographers. Results or Findings: In this study, we verified that only 44.6% of the examination requests in the context of emergency tr auma presented clinical information and 55.3% of them do not present any relevant information. 100% of the radiographers affirm that the requests for e xamination do not contain enough clinical information or correct anatomic region identification to perform the examinations and correct diagnosis. So, questio ning the patient or the physicians is necessary to perform the study, decreasing the workflow in radiology departments. Conclusion: Better communication to ensure a multidisciplinary approach is necessary in order to provide the patient with the best possible care and avoid an inadequate exposure. Limitations: No limitations. Ethics committee approval: No ethics conflicts were identified in this study. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Lysdahl; Drammen /NO Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the benefits of quality referral information and involve radiographers in assessing referrals for appropriate imaging, as perceived by radiographers. Methods or Background: An online survey was distributed to radiographers i n clinical and non-clinical/academic settings via the International Society of Radiographers and Radiological Technologists (ISRRT ) networks. The questionnaire consisted of 5-point Likert scale questions on radiographers' usefulness of referral information (12 reasons list ed) and benefits of radiographers assessing referrals (8 benefits suggested). Results or Findings: A total 279 responses were received. Clinical radiographers reported making use of the referral i nformation frequently for a number of reasons, with the highest rank for 'patient identification', 'ensuring imaging of the (83%, 79%, 66% very frequently responses). Non-clinical/academ ic radiographers the same reasons high for usefulness (74%, 63%, 52% strongly agreed as useful responses). Benefits of radiographers' invol vement in referral assessment ranked high (strongly agree responses) w ere the items 'promotes radiographers' professional responsibility' (72%) ' perceive referral information as usef ul for many purposes in their clinical practice, all vital for ensuring patient safety and quality radiology services. Radiology departments can benef it from involving radiographers in assessing referrals, through profe ssional development, inter- professional collaboration, and efficiency of servi ces. Limitations: The number of responses is low. Larger sample size could also have been of benefit to capture views of a wider range of radiographers. The study is subject to selection bias as only particip ants who had information from ISRRT organisation networks were able to view and r espond to the survey.

Vella\u00b9, *K. (CXRs) are frequently per formed before surgeries. The aim of this study was to investigate adult clinical referral criteria for a preoperative CXR and to determine if referral s adhered to local protocols, international and European guidelines. The associat ion between clinical indications and the result of the preoperative CXR was investigated. Methods or Background: The research design was a prospective, cross- sectional study performed in a state general hospit al in Malta. 271 adult participants undergoing elective surgery were recruited, using convenience sampling. The research tools comprised of a close-e nded questionnaire in which clinical and medical information was obtained. The questionnaire was complimented by a data sheet completed by intermedi aries. Results or Findings: Out of 271 participants, 72 (26.6%) participants were healthy asymptomatic patients, having an American S ociety of Anaesthesiology (ASA) score I. ASA II was the most common score obtained (45.7%). 44 (16.2%) participants had an abnormal CX R result, with cardiomegaly being the most common abnormality detected. Abnormalities were significantly low in all ASA scores but were s een to increase with an increasing ASA score. Only 11.4% (n=5) of abnormali ties were unexpected. A statistically significant association (p=0.007) was found between increasing age and abnormal CXR results. No statistically significant association was found between cardiac or respiratory conditions and CXR abnormalities. Conclusion: 64.2% of CXRs were not requested in accordance with protocols implemented locally on preoperative testing. Whereas, if the international and European guidelines were applied, 70.1% of CXRs wer e not requested according to guidelines. Limitations: Referring physicians may have had cogent reasons for requesting the preoperative CXR but due to time con straints were unable to provide them in detail.

Robertson*\u00b9, \u00b2Keele/UK Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the evidence of occupational stressors in diagnostic radiographers, and whether they are at risk of developing compassion fatigue. Methods or Background: Compassion is an essential concept in healthcare, however, repeated exposure to challenging or traumatic situations can lead to compassion fatigue (CF). A review protocol was developed and registered on PROSPERO. Database and grey literature searches wer e carried out. No meta-analysis was possible therefore data has been presented as a narrative. Results or Findings: Fifteen studies were selected for review published between 1982 and 2020. Evidence demonstrates that r adiographers suffer from high levels of occupational stress. Stress is perceived rather than defined. Common causes of occupational stress were identified as poor patient interactions, and a lack of time to spend with pati ents. There is a lack of evidence to show how this stress affects radiograph ers' health or their ability to provide compassionate care. Conclusion: Radiographers are prone to suffering from symptoms that can be attributed to CF. This has been present for an extended period of time, and the main changes have been a decrease in job satisfacti on and accomplishment. Patient interaction was identified as a cause, but it is unclear if this affects staff ability to be compassionate. Further work is requir ed to find ways to mitigate these effects and prevent the issue from getting wo rse. Limitations: It was difficult to find consistency in the range of studies identified in this review, and direct comparisons of the data have not been possible. The wide range of definitions used to cover this topic means that some studies may not have been identified. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Piao*, X. Luo, Y. Bao, B. Hu, Y. Zhu, L. Yang, D. Geng, Y. Li; Shanghai/CN (piaosirong@fudan.edu.cn) Purpose: Preoperative differentiation of autoimmune encephal itis from low grade diffuse astrocytoma is important to guide cli nical decision-making. We aim to develop quantitative models integrating both radiomics and spatial distribution features of brain lesions from non-contrast MRI for discrimination of autoimmune encephalitis from low grade diffuse astr ocytoma. Methods or Background: The study included patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE, n=59) and WHO grade II diffuse as trocytoma (AS, n=89) into training and test sets with a ratio of 3:1. Another 22 AE patients and 28 AS patients were allocated as the external set. Hyperi ntensity T2-FLAIR lesions were segmented manually. 42 radiomics and 11 spatial distribution features were extracted via LASSO, and joint models were con structed using logistic regression algorithms for two diseases differentiat ions. The discrimination performance of the joint model was compared with neuroradiologists. Results or Findings: The radiomics and spatial distribution feature joint model achieved AUC=0.998/0.974 (training/test set) and pr ominently outperformed the radiomics model (AUC=0.993/0.971) and the spati al distribution model (AUC=0.989/0.965). The senior and junior neuroradiologists achieved the AUC of 0.951/0.870 and 0.689/0.641, respectively. The diagnostic ability of the joint model suppressed the junior neuroradiologist. Conclusion: The radiomics and spatial distribution joint model could effectively differentiate AE from AS and achieved the diagnosti c performance as senior neuroradiologist in the discrimination between the two diseases, with a clear path that is easy to follow in further practice. Limitations: AE mediated by different auto-antibodies was not st rictly distinct due to the retrospective nature of the study. Addit ionally, the results need to be further validated via a multi-centre study with mor e participants.

Some previous DTI/DWI studies indirectly indicate the demyelination processes caused by neurotoxicity. Th us, the study's main aim was to directly measure myeline content after the f irst chemotherapy course. Methods or Background: 6 paediatric patients (mean age-13.7\u00b12.4) with leukaemia and osteosarcoma were enrolled in the stu dy. MRI examination included 2 scanning sessions: 1 week before and aft er chemotherapy. Each scanning includes the acquisition of the following pulse sequences: (1) macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) - gradient echo (GE) with FA=3\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 as well as additional MT-weighted GE with Gauss ian saturated prepulse, and (2) water myeline fraction (WMF) - Turbo Spin E cho with TE from 10 to 210ms. MPF, WMF and T2 values were measured in whit e matter (WM) of parietal, temporal, occipital, frontal lobes, cerebellum and thalamus. Results or increase in WM occipital lobes and thalamus. WMF shows increased v alues for the cerebellum as well as decreased values in WM parietal lobes. Conclusion: Previously, both MPF and WMF have been shown to ref lect myeline concentration. Moreover, some previous studies revealed the influence of region oedema associated with the T2 i ncrease on the MPF. In our study, we have the same effect. Therefore, MPF seem s to be ineffective in this case. Reduced WMF indicates a demyelination process in white matter of the parietal lobe. The increase in WMF in the cerebellum may indicate the accumulation of \"myelin refuse\". Myelin residues ar e located at the site of degeneration until the complete cleansing by macrop hages. Limitations: The main limitation of the study is the small patie nt cohort. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Methods or Background: 45 patients (25 female, mean age: 60.2 years) with metastases treated with first SRS treatment (03/17 to 10/19) and pCASL sequence at the first follow-up (mean: 6.35 weeks). pCASL perfusion weighted image classified: positive (n=16) or negative (n=29) (ASL+/-). Signal intensity (SI) from the lesion and perilesional area were manually defined on PACS. Ratios of SI were calculated (mean \u00b1 standard error); radiological progression as per RANO criter ia and 6-month mortality were documented. Results or Findings: The ratio of mean SI in the lesion to perilesional area (contrast to noise ratio) was higher in ASL+ (1.94 \u00b1 0.15) vs ASL- (0.77 \u00b1 0.05) (P<0.05) and similarly in ratios of [ASL + (1.81 \u00b1 0.22), ASL- (0.95 \u00b1 limited follow-up available at 6 months (n=29), a higher proportion i n the ASL- group had progressive disease at 6 months: n=10, (50%) vs ASL+, n=2 post-SRS for metastases, pCASL can stratify patients at 6 months. Visual assessment of pCASL PWI allows accurate classification of perfusion in metastases indicatin g the feasibility of use clinically. The association between ASL signal post -treatment and disease non-progression may be due to treatment-related inc vascularity, or that vascular metastases are more radio-sensitive. Limitations: As a preliminary retrospective, small sample study, findings are limited. Assessment of interobserver variability wo uld add robustness to our conclusions and better evaluate utility in clinical practice. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: In this randomised controlled trial, consecutive participants referred for CTC were randomly assigne d to receive LV-RBP (52.5 g of PMF104 in 500 mL of water) or FV-RBP (105 g of PMF104 in 1000 mL of water). Images were independently reviewed by five readers who rated the quality of bowel preparation from 0 (best score) to 3 (worst score). The primary outcome was the non-inferiority of LV-RBP to FV-RBP in the proportion of colonic segments scored 0 for cleansing quality, wi th a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The volume of residual fluids, colonic distens ion, lesions and polyps detection rates and patient tolerability were secon dary outcomes. Results or Findings: 110 participants (mean age 65 years\u00b114 SD) were allocated to LV-RBP (n=55) or FV-RBP (n=55) arms. T here was 92% segment scored 0 in colon cleansing quality in LV-RBP and 9 4% in FV-RBP for prone scans, and 94% vs 92% for supine scans. The risk di fference was -2.1 (95% CI 5.9 to 1.7) and 1.5 (95%CI 2.4 to 5.4) for prone and supine positions, respectively. Residual fuids and colonic distension were also non-inferior in LV- RBP. LV-RBP was associated with a lower of during preparation (7\u00b15 vs 10\u00b16, p=0.002). Conclusion: The LV-RBP demonstrated the non-inferior quality of colon cleansing with improved gastrointestinal tolerabili ty compared to the FV-RBP regimen. Limitations: The number of participants enrolled was relatively small. Second, we were not able to evaluate CTC diagnostic accurac y for polyps detection. Third, the quality of colon cleansing was assessed exclusively by subjective analysis. Ethics committee approval: Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the Sapienza University of Rome.

Testa*, G. Di Guardia, ea, V. Verna; Verduno/IT (ftesta@aslcn2.it) Purpose: The oral contrast medium does not seem mandatory in defecography procedures; however, to demonstrate an enterocele (critical information for the surgeon), it is necessary to op acify the small bowel. A decade of case studies to illustrate the opportunit y of oral contrast in all patients who undergo the procedure. Methods or Background: Our series of 353 defecographies conducted on patients with various degrees of evacuation disorders were reviewed in detail. For each procedure, we considered the enterocele and its extension. In all of our procedures, contrast medium (barium sulphate or iodate) was administered orally between 40 and 60 minutes before the examina tion. Results or Findings: 353 defecographs in 333 females and 20 males (mean age 60.3, median age 62) showed a total of 132 cases of enterocele (37.4%), classified in 75 cases of mild enterocele (56.8%, n on-interfering with the evacuation dynamics) and 57 of severe enterocele (43.2%), interfering with the evacuation dynamics. No significant differences wer e recognised in the use of barium sulphate or iodate oral contrast medium. Conclusion: The prevalence of enterocele suggests the use of or al contrast medium in all patients undergoing defecography, wit h an advantageous cost- benefit balance. The choice between barium and iodate contrast can be made on the basis of the constipation tendency, which tends to be aggravated by barium-based compounds.

With the rising incidence of colorectal diseases and due to limitations of conve ntional flexible fiberoptic colonoscopy (gold standard tool), imaging plays a s ignificant role in the evaluation of these patients. Recent developments i n magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coupled with its advantages of noninv asive and radiation-free nature, it has recently become a screening tool in colorectal diseases. Methods or Background: Forty-four patients with signs and symptoms of the colorectal disease were evaluated by 1.5T MRI follo wed by conventional, flexible, fiberoptic colonoscopy on the same day. B owel preparation was done using polyethene glycol. Data from MRI and colonosc opy were recorded and compared with the final diagnosis. Results or Findings: The majority of patients in the study were in the 21-40yrs age group with male predominance. Altered bowel habits followed by bleeding per rectum were the commonest presentations. Both MRI and colonoscopy overdiagnosed the lesions as malignant with higher errors by MRI. MRI was very effective in the detection of growth, strictur es, diverticulosis, mucosal thickening/oedema and extracolonic manifestation bu t failed in detecting small polyps and ulcers.

Pedersen; Vej le/DK (soeren.rafael.rafaelsen@rsyd.dk) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the se nsitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) com pared to CT scan. Methods or Background: Patients underwent a standard CT scan. For the MRI scan, a 3 Tesla unit was used, including diffus ion-weighted imaging (DWI), with an average scan time of 25 minutes. No intrave nous, oral or rectal contrast medium was administered. Prior to the study both the CT and MRI radiologist had received feedback from the pathologist at a weekly colorectal MDT meeting five years prior to inclusion of the fi rst patient. McNemar's test was used to compare the two modalities. Results or Findings: From 2018 to 2021, 134 patients had CT and MRI scans. CT failed to detect 16/134 (12%) colon tumou rs, half of which were pT3 tumours. whereas MRI detected all tumours. For disc riminating between stage T3ab and T3cd the sensitivity of CT was 51.1% and of MRI 80.0% (p = 0.02). CT and MRI had a sensitivity of 21.4% and 46.4% in detecting pT4 tumours and a specificity of 79.0% and 85.0%, respectively. For the evaluation of extravascular involvement, the sensitivity and spec ificity of CT was 35.0% and 82.0%, whereas MRI had higher values of 50.0% and 8 1.8%, respectively. Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 59 Conclusion: MRI detected colonic tumours more often than CT. Compared to CT the sensitivity of MRI was statistically signifi cantly higher in detecting advanced T3cd and T4 tumours. MRI has the potential to be used in the treatment planning of colon cancer.

Milan/IT Purpose: The objective of this study was to optimise the dos e of iodinated contrast media for CT imaging of venous colic vessels for preoperative evaluation before a complete mesocolic excision (CME) technique to treat right colon cancer. Methods or Background: 150 patients with an abdominal venous phase CT scan February-April 2021 Iohexol (370mg/ml), 50 with administration of Iohexol (350mg/ml). Enhancement v alues of the superior mesenteric vein, of the right colic vein, and of th e ileocolic vein were evaluated with ROIs. Results or Findings: We did not find any significant difference between the groups, in terms of weight of the patients (p=0.504 ), administered contrast dose (p=0.504), dose of iodine per kilogram (p=0.228), a dose of contrast medium per kilogram (p=0.786). The upper quartile enhancement thresholds (>75%) for each vein were: superior mesenteric vein (170 HU), ileocolic vein (134 HU), right colic vein (102 HU). The average dose (iodium/kg) for upper quartile enhancement thresholds (>75%) of the three (564, 557 and 549 mg/kg for superior mesenteric, ileocolic and right colic veins, respectively) proved to be higher than the average dose for the l ower percentile (<25%) enhancement thresholds (p<0.001). Conclusion: In order to get the highest enhancement values, a c ontrast media dose of 1.48 cc/kg of Ioheol 370, and 1.57 cc/kg of Iobitridol 350 and Iohexol 350, should be administered to enable us to outline a protocol of CT image acquisition in order to improve the visualisation of the right colic vein vascular map, before CME.

Chami*, modality for assessing coronary artery disease (CAD). Its role for prognosis assessment is still limited. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) might improve this process by using plaque c haracteristics that are currently not used. Methods or Background: The Consecutive CCTAs from patients with suspected CAD examined between October 2004 and January 2018 were analyzed. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction and late revascularization. T he training endpoint additionally included early revascularization. The clinical risk was assessed by Morise score; for conventional CCTA assessment, ext ent of CAD (eoCAD) and segment involvement score (SIS) were used. Semiautomatic post-processing was performed for vessel delineation and annotation of calcified and non- calcified plaque training of a dens enet-121 CNN was done: The full network was trained using the training endpoint, then the feature layer was trained using the primary endpoint. Five times cross-validation was performed to ensure that each CNN was evaluated on an unseen set of data. Results or Findings: The study population comprised 5468 patients. Durin g the follow-up of 7.2 years, 334 patients reached the primary endpoint; in addition, 405 early revascularizations occurred. The outcome correlation of CNN showed an AUC of 0.720\u00b10.010 and 0.631\u00b10.015 for training endpoint resp. Combining CNN with conve ntional CT parameters improvement of AUC (p<0.0001) and eoCAD and SIS resp.

Methods or Background: 100 consecutive patients were randomly divided into two groups to perform CCTA scans in the bolus tracking method; group A Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 60 with a fixed trigger delay time of 5 seconds and gr oup B with an automatic patient-specific trigger delay time estimated from monitored CT values. All CT scanning and contrast media injection protocol parameters were kept identical. CT value of aorta root (AO), coronary segments and superior vena cava (SVC) were measured for the objective image quality evalu ation. Subjective evaluation of the image quality was performed by tw o independent blinded reviewers using a 5-point scale (5 = excellent, 1 = poor). Independent sample t-test and the Wilcox-Mann-Whitney test were used t o compare quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Results or Findings: The trigger delay time in group B ranged from 4-8 seconds (mean, 6.6\u00b11.4 seconds). Group B had higher mean enhancement in AO and coronary (407\u00b161Hu vs 360\u00b148Hu for pRCA, 423\u00b158Hu 408\u00b155Hu vs 351\u00b156Hu for pLCX, all p 0.05) than group A. The opacification of the SVC was significantly lower in group B than in group A (147Hu vs 261Hu; p<0.05). Subjective image quality was higher in group B than in group A (4.5 vs 4.1; p<0.05). Conclusion: Compared with a fixed delay time, a patient-specifi c trigger delay bolus tracking estimation provided significantly hi gher attenuation and improved the image quality for coronary CT angiogra phy.

Huang, J. Lian, K. S. NG, *V. Vardhanabhuti*; Ho ng Kong/HK Purpose: The purpose of this study is to utilize a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to predict the coronary artery diseas e reporting and data system (CAD-RADS) based on coronary CT angiography (CCTA) using the quantitative vascular biomarkers derived from fundus images of the same subjects. Methods or Background: This prospective single-centre study included 145 subjects who had received both CCTA and fundoscopy examinations on the same day in our local imaging centre in 2019. The C CTA scans were stratified by CAD-RADS scores by expert readers, which were th en binarized into two classes (i.e. 0 (normal), 1 (minimal) and 2 (mild) were in class 0, and 3 (moderate), 4 (severe) and 5 (occluded) were in cla ss 1). The vascular biomarkers were extracted from their eye images usi ng a retinal health information and notification system. A graph was constructed, where each graph nodes represented a fundus image, and the nod e features were the vascular biomarkers relevant to blood vessel width and curvature. The graph edges were determined by the similarity of age and gender of paired subjects. A GCN model was employed on the graph to predict th e binarized CAD-RADS score for each node. The image data of 115 subjects (80%) were used for training and 30 subjects (20%) for testing. We also trained multiple traditional machine learning models for comparison. Results or Findings: The GCN model showed a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve of 75%, 81.03%, 7 9.27% and 0.864, respectively. The performance outperforms the same evaluation metrics obtained from the traditional machine learning models (p<0.01). Conclusion: The changes in fundus vasculature had potential predictive value for CAD-RADS scores and significant coronary artery diseases. Limitations: Small sample size. Proof of concept study.

Nonetheless, its proper application deserves some caution and a prel iminary assessment of possible radiomic feature dependence on various fac tors, since each step of the radiomic workflow could influence feature estim ation. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate, for the f irst time, the effect of image preprocessing and filtering on radiomic feature est imation from quantitative CMR T1 and T2 mapping. Methods or Background: Specifically, T1/T2 maps of 26 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) were used to esti mate 98 myocardial radiomic features for 7 different resampling voxel sizes (at fixed bin width), 9 different bin widths (at fixed resampling voxel siz e), and 7 different spatial filters (at fixed resampling voxel size/bin width). Results or Findings: While we found a remarkable dependence of myocardial radiomic features from T1/T2 mapping on image filters, many radiomic features showed a limited sensitivity to resampling voxel si ze/bin width in terms of (>0.75) and coef ficient of variation (<30%). The estimate of several textural radiomic features showed a linear significant (p<0.05) correlation with voxel size/bin width. Conclusion: Overall, radiomic features from T2 maps have proven to be less sensitive to image preprocessing than those from T1 maps, especially when varying bin width. Our results might corroborate th e potential of radiomics from T1/T2 mapping in HCM and hopefully in other myocardial diseases. Limitations: This was a single-centre study of a relatively smal l cohort of HCM patients.

Methods or Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, including two-dimensional LGE imaging, was performed in 191 p atients on a 1.5 T clinical scanner 12 months after ST-elevation myocardial infarction. LGE images were presented to a trained CNN for automated determination of left ventricular myocardium and consequently LGE volume. Manual LGE segmentation according to the +5-SD method was used as the reference standard. Image quality was assessed according to a 3-point Likert scale (2 = perfect image quality, 1 = some artefacts without i mpaired LGE delineation, 0 = strong artefacts with impaired LGE delineation). Regression and Bland-Altman analyses were performed. Results or Findings: In 191 included patients (182 male, mean age 57 yea rs), the LGE volume was 9.7 [IQR 3.6 to 16.2] cm3 according to manual segmentation and 8.3 [3.2 to 17.6] cm3 according to CNN segmentation. The Bland-Altman analysis showed little average difference (-0.5 cm3, p=0.257), however, the limits of agreement ranged from -18.4 cm3 to 17.5 cm3. The linear correlation was fair (0.57, p<0.001). The subgroup analysis according to the image quality showed comparable performance of CNN segmentation in all three groups. Conclusion: Our fully automated LGE segmentation based on a CNN in two- dimensional data sets provides measurements with li ttle average difference compared to very time-consuming manual segmentations. However, dispersion is substantially and limits the current application of this approach on a per- patient basis. Image quality does not affect CNN performance. Limitations: Manual segmentation according to the +5-SD method i s dependent on investigator experience and is limited in circumferential myocardial LGE.

We aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) model base d on detector- based spectral dual-energy angiography CT (DE-CTPA) data, yielding predictions of low-keV acquisitions to improve automatic pulmonary embolism (PE) detection in conventional single-energy CT scans. Methods or Background: We used two data sets: our institutional DE-CTPA data set D1 comprising standard arterial series and the corresponding virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at low-energy levels (40 keV) with 7,892 image pairs, and a 10% subset of the RSNA Pulmonary Embol ism Detection Challenge (2020) data set D2, which consists of 161,253 polyenergetic images with dichotomous k to generate VMI predictions D1, which are then fed into a ResN et50 network for the PE classification task on single-energy CT scans from D2. We evaluated our VMI reconstruction results in terms of Peak-Signal-to-N oise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). For PE identification, we performed a binary classification on slice level and reported the area under the curve (AUC). Results or Findings: The quantitative results on the reconstruction abil ity of the DL model revealed high-quality visual VMI ctions AUC of 0.84 for our framework, which improves PE classification compared to other na\u00efve PE classific ation approaches with AUCs up to 0.81. results demonstrate that the prediction of synt hetic VMI from polyenergetic CT scans can improve the automated de tection of PE. This could help rescue CTPA studies with suboptimal opacificat ion of the pulmonary arteries from single-energy CT scanners. Limitations: Class imbalance per subset could bias the results.

Sobotka*, A. J. Herold, M. Perkonigg, L. Beer, Sablatnig, A. Ba-Ssalamah, G. Langs; Vienna/AT Purpose: Liver vessel segmentation in MR imaging is crucial for the computational analysis of vascular remodelling. Exi sting techniques rely on contrast-enhanced MR (MRce), which are not uniforml y acquired. Non-contrast images are acquired more frequently, but vessels ar e hard to distinguish from other structures due to lack of opacification. Here, we propose a convolutional neural network to segment liver vessels on non-cont rast images with the help of auxiliary contrast-enhanced data available only during training. The approach improves segmentation accuracy on non-cont rast images and reduces the need for annotated examples. Methods or Background: A multi-task learning approach trains a Y-net style convolutional neural network for liver vessel segme ntation on MR imaging data. During training, MR with and without contrast together with vessel annotations on a sub-set of the data are available. The auxiliary MRce provides variability to the encoder training of the model. This improves the vessel segmentation accuracy, even if no MRce is av ailable during application. We investigate overall- and vessel thickness specif ic segmentation accuracy. Results or Findings: Using auxiliary contrast-enhanced sequences improves the Dice score for vessel segmentation on non-contr ast MR by 0.10 from 0.45 to 0.55. For small vessels (0-10 mm), the score inc reases by 0.03, for bigger vessels (>10mm) by 0.13. Conclusion: Highly-informative contrast-enhanced sequences impr ove vessel segmentation models for non-contrast imaging data. It allows for a reduction of the number of annotated examples necessary for vess el segmentation model training. Limitations: Number of vessel annotations used in evaluating the proposed framework.

Su\u00b9, J. Hofmeijer\u00b2, T. van Walsum\u00b9, G. Lycklama\u00b3, A. van stroke can be complicated by vessel perforation. In this work we study the incidence of this specific complication in clinical practice and its effects on functional outcome, including the relation with the location of a vessel perforation. Methods or Background: All patients in the MR CLEAN Registry who underwent EVT were analysed for the presence of ves sel perforation. DSA imaging of cases mentioned by interventionalist or corelab were studied. Additionally, DSAs of SAH cases were reassessed for potential vessel perforations. In cases where an interventionalist m entioned a perforation, but corelab did not find any, perforation was assumed. Functional outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 9 0 days. The association between vessel perforation and outcome was analysed with ordinal logistic regression models adjusted for confounding parameters, such as NIHSS at baseline, reperfusion and collaterals. Results were described as unadjusted common (cOR) and adjusted common odds ratio (acOR). Results or Findings: Vessel perforation occurred in 74 (2,7%) of 2794 patients who underwent EVT. The proportion of vessel perforations in females was higher compared to non-perforation cases. (63.5% vs 47.5% p=0.009). Anatomical location (6.3%) and missing in 14.9% of cases. Functional outcome (mRS) was worse in patients with vessel per forations (cOR 0.31, 95%CI 0.20-0.49, acOR 0.50, to patients without a vessel perforation. No association was observed w ith anatomical location proximal perforation during EVT is low, but has severe clinical consequences, regardless of the anatomical location of the vessel perforation.

Methods or Background: A retrospective observational study was carried out . A database was made with 39 interventions in 32 pat ients with indirect carotid- cavernous fistulae treated in our centre from 2006 to 2020. A collection of epidemiological, clinical, intervention-related, and postoperative variables was made for subsequent statistical analysis. Results or Findings: In 28 (72%) of the interventions, complete closure of the fistula was achieved, with 26 patients (81.3%) bein g achieved in the initial intervention. The fistula was closed with stable tr eatment in 92% of the cases at 6 months. The access route was also analysed, th e most frequent being the venous route through the inferior petrosal sinus (71.9%). Coils were the preferably used material (84.6%). Regarding the imp rovement of symptoms at 6 months after the intervention, 29 patients (74.3% ) had a complete remission of symptoms. Complications were associated barely t o 7.7% of the interventions. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of indirect carotid-cavernous fistulae is effective and stable in the long term. The most use d and effective access route in our centre is the venous one through the inferio r petrosal sinus. The most widely used and effective material for closing indi rect carotid-cavernous fistulae are coils. Most of the patients had symptomatic improvement immediately after the intervention and nearly all had no symptoms 6 m onths after the procedure. Endovascular treatment is a technique that has few perioperative complications and does not usually require reoperat ion. Limitations: This study has a small sample size.

Pertici*, F. Sgalambro, V. F. thalamotomy the treatment of tremor in E T and PD is usually perceived as a simple procedure by patients , who fail to consider it as an ablative procedure with some risks, that, theref ore, requires strong compliance from patients. We evaluated the influenc e of interactive video- assisted vs standard informed consent on patients' treatment perception, understanding and satisfaction. Methods or Background: We prospectively evaluated 58 patients eligible for MRgFUS thalamotomy. Before treatment, patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group A (28 patients, 15 males, mean ag e 65 y/o, ET/PD 18/10) received the standard written informed consent and group B (30 patients, 16 males, mean age 64 y/o, ET/PD 19/11) the video-assi sted consent. Two questionnaires were then given to all study partici pants: the first one at the end of the consent process (5 items, score 0-4, total s core 20), assessing patients' understanding of the procedure, the second one at t he end of the treatment (2 items, score 0-4, total score 8), assessing patient s' perception and satisfaction based on the expectations they had after the consent information received. Results or Findings: In ET patients, mean total understanding and satisfaction scores were 25.2 and 27.6 in groups B and A respectively (p=.234). In PD patients, scores were 23 and 28 in groups B and A. In younger patients (28-75 y/o) scores were 21 (A) and 28 (B), while in the older patients' group (>75yo) 25 and 22. Conclusion: Video-assisted integrated informed consent increase s understanding of the procedure and its risks, as well as satisfaction regarding the treatment, especially in younger patients.

Tanyildizi*, S. Krost-Reuhl, A. Heimann, O. Kem R. Kloeckner, M. A. Brockmann; Mainz/DE Purpose: This prototype catheter is a newly-developed distal access catheter featuring a self-expanding, flexible, funnel-shaped tip. The purpose of its design is to reduce the risk of thrombus fragmentat ion during mechanical thrombectomy and improve first pass recanalisation (TICI 3). In this experimental setup, we preclinically evaluated the effectiveness and navigability of the new catheter. Methods or Background: A vessel model was filled with a blood-like-viscous medium, and the image was projected with the corres ponding vessel area by camera transmission to corresponding to the conditi ons in an angiography. Thrombi from porcine blood were placed into the art eria carotis interna of the vascular model and subsequently mechanically thrombectomised with a stent retriever. In the first part, the prototype was com pared to a standard distal- access-catheter without using an external catheter. (N=20 for each catheter). In the second part, the prototype was inserted through a guiding catheter (n=11) to determine the navigability performance. Results or Findings: In the first experimental series, mechanical thrombectomy was successful 19 out of 20 times (95% success rate) for the prototype catheter versus 15 out of 20 times (75% s uccess rate) for the standard distal-access catheter. In the second experimental series, the prototype catheter achieved first-pass recanalisati on 10 out of 11 times (91% success rate) and 1 out of 11 times at second pass (9%). Conclusion: This series of experiments demonstrated higher firs t-pass recanalisation rates for the newly-developed funnel -shaped prototype featuring a self-expanding tip in comparison to a cylindrical standard distal-access- catheter. Limitations: This study is limited by (1) no in vivo testing and (2) the limited number of thrombectomies.

Images were prospectively reviewed and independently compared to the standard 7:30 min: sec protocol by two experienced neuroradiologists. Six items (ov erall image quality, grey- white basal ganglia delineation, sulci, motion, and susceptibility artefacts) were assessed on each gen erated contrast using a 4- point Likert scale. Inter-observer concordance was assessed using col allowed a 73% reduction of acquisition time and showed good to excellent overall image quality (mean score 3). Inter-observer concordance was good to excellent (Gwet AC1: 0.52 to 1.0). Motion and su sceptibility artefacts were mostly rated as absent or minor with no adverse eff ect on diagnostic use, but with more heterogeneous inter-observer image quality with a 73% reductio n in acquisition time. Further studies evaluating diagnostic performance i n time-sensitive clinical applications should be planned. Limitations: This study is monocentric and has a small sample si ze.

CT values at MCA were assessed by ROI measurements. Image J software was used to generate the profile curves. To assess the capability for improvement of spatial resolution with UHR-CT and DLR, full width at half maximum (FWHM), the width o f the edge rise distance (ERD) and the edge rise slope (ERS) were measured at each vessel. For qualitative assessment, overall image quality, artefact, aneurysm, and vascular depiction levels were assessed by 5-point scales by two board-certified radiologists. CT values, ERS and all qualitative in dexes were compared by Tukey's HSD test. Inter-observer agreements of each method were evaluated by kappa statistics with 2 test. Results or Findings: CT values and ERS of model-based IR and DLR were significantly higher than those of hybrid-type IR at MCA (p<0.05). Inter- observer agreement of each index by all methods was determined as moderate, substantial or excellent (0.51 0.92, p<0.001). In addition, overall image quality and artefact of DLR were significantl y improved as compared with others (p<0.05). Aneurysm and vascular depicti on levels had no significant difference among all methods (p>0.05). Conclusion: DLR has a potential for image quality improvements than hybrid- type and model-based IR on brain CE-CTA for UHR-CT. Limitations: Not applicable.

Shim, S. J. Kim; Seoul/KR (closea@naver.com) Purpose: To volumetry (DLABV) sonian syndromes using 3D T1-weighted brain MR images. Methods or Background: A DLABV was trained using a dataset of 3D T1- weighted brain MR images. 2D U-Net model was used f or model architecture. The training dataset which contains 300 cognitively normal subjects (CN, 129 men) was labelled with FreeSurfer 6.0 brainstem sub structure module. The test dataset consists of 207 CN, 52 progressive supranuc lear palsy (PSP) patients, 65 multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients, and 189 Parkinson disease (PD) patients. The volume of the midbrain, pons, medulla, SCP, the midbrain-pons area ratio (MP) and the midbrain-pons volume ratio (MP_vol) were measured for differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes. Norm alised volume using intracranial volume (ICV) was also used. To distinguish between each group, the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and classification accuracy was meas ured by support vector machine (SVM). Results or Findings: Compared with simple volumetry, volumetry using ICV normalisation showed more accurate performance in t he differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes. The AUC in PSP vs PD volume was 0.89. In addition, the AUC in MSA vs PD using normalised pons volume was 0.97. MP_vol in MSA patients were signif icantly larger than in PSP patients and AUC was 0.98. Using normalised volume and MP showed highest classification accuracy. Conclusion: The DLABV using ICV normalisation allowed an accurate differentiation of parkinsonian syndromes using 3D T1-weighted brain MR images. Limitations: It is unclear whether the early parkinsonian syndromes can be differentiated using brain volumetry since our study did not target early parkinsonian syndrome patients.

Author Disclosures: Jin Kyeong Sung: Author: Corresponding Abstract-based Programme A B 64 RPS 2511-7 Patient-specific vs normative brain connectivity: a symptom-specific Regensburg/ DE Purpose: Structural connectivity based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is gaining importance in research and clinical use in fields like deep brain stimulation. Individual DWI is often unavailable. Therefore, normative connectomes based on averaged whole-brain tractography are a practical alternative. Compariso ns of these concepts are sparse. Here, we compared patient-specific and norm ative approaches by their ability to predict the effects of deep brain stimul ation using a symptom-specific, machine learning-based approach. Methods or Background: Twenty-one patients who received bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease were included. For every electrode contact (168 in total), we computed tractography patterns based on individual DWI and two normative connectom es (32 healthy individuals, 90 Parkinson's patients). Connectivity strength to 36 brain structures was calculated for every electrode contact, resulting in a dataset of 168 observations (electrode contacts) with 36 attri butes (connectivity strength) for each connectome. Stimulation-associated symptom mitigation and side effects were assessed for every contact. We tested the prediction of stimulation outcomes based on connectivity strength using several supervised learning algorithms. Results or Findings: Support vector machines yielded overall the best results. Averaged across all clinical classes (symptoms, sid e effects), the individual connectome achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC; .81) compared to the normative healthy (.76) and disease-matched connectomes (.74). By clinical class, there were significant differences for paresthesia and autonom ous side effects in favour of the individual connectome. Results differed considerably between clinical classes, from a mean AUC-ROC of 0.68 for paraesthes ia to 0.91 for hyperkinesia. Conclusion: Clinical effects may be mediated by different netwo rks, as revealed by tractography methods based on DWI. Indi vidual connectomes may be superior in predicting stimulation effectiveness . Limitations: This study is done with single-centre data and has a limited sample size.

G. van Leeuwen*\u00b9, S. Van Ginneken\u00b9, M. J. \u00b9Nij (StrokeViewer v2, Nicolab) supports the diagnostic process of stroke by detect ing large vessel occlusions (LVO) on CTA. We prospectively evaluated this tool in our department to monitor safety and impact. Methods or Background: We implemented the software with the goal to improve the diagnosis of LVO and elevate the diagnostic confidence of the radiologist (resident). We used quantitative measur es (data from clinical systems, vendor log files) and qualitative measures (user survey) to analyse diagnostic performance, number of users, login attempts, radiologists' diagnostic confidence, and user experience. Results or Findings: In total, 226 CTAs with a clinical indication of st roke between January-June 2021 were prospectively evaluated. Thirteen cases of posterior circulation and distal vessel occlusions were excluded as they were outside the intended use of the AI tool. The AI tool missed 12 of the 36 occlusions in the middle cerebral or intracranial i nternal carotid artery (M1=1, M2=10, ICA=1) resulting in an accuracy of 86.4%. Ir respective of location, the sensitivity was 77.8% and specificity 90.4%. The number of monthly unique users varied between 8 and 24 radiologists/resident s. Log in attempts dropped after the initial month (which included training) t o a monthly average of 44 attempts. The diagnostic confidence did not increas e during the use of the tool. The likelihood that users would recommend StrokeViewer to colleagues was rated 4.5/10. Conclusion: Over six months, the use of StrokeViewer dropped an d users did not sense improvement of diagnostic confidence. Measures have been taken to stimulate adoption for the latter six months of the trial period. Limitations: Because of the prospective character, no comparison could be made between radiologists supported by AI vs radiol ogists without AI. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

The purpose of this study was to determ ine the efficacy, safety and advantages of US-guided biopsy of pleural and peripheral lung lesions abutting pleura and to compare it with CT guidance. Methods or Background: Among 1960 image-guided thoracic biopsies obtained at our hospital between January 2001 and D ecember 2020, 363 were US-guided biopsies for pleural and peripheral lung lesions (278-male, 85- female). Out of these, 343 were performed using US only; the other 20 had initial CT localization. There were 27 pleural lesi ons and 336 pulmonary lesions with pleural contact. After reviewing the patient, CT scan and coagulation profile, a biopsy was performed using the freehand US technique under real- time visualization. Lesion size, pleural lesion contact, biopsy type, number of passes, procedure time, sample adequacy and complic ations were recorded. Results or Findings: Among 1960 biopsies, (18.5% ) were US-guided and 1597 (81.5%) were CT-guided procedures. The procedure time was significantly less in the US-guided than under the CT-guided procedures. The post-procedure pneumothorax was significantly less in the US-guided group as observed on 2 out of 363 US-guided procedures (0.55%) and 43 out of 1597 CT-guided procedures (2.7%). Intraparenchymal haemo rrhage of 363 US-guided biopsies ( 0.55%) and 17 out of 1597 under CT guidance (1.1%). Conclusion: US guidance allows significantly less procedure tim e and post- procedural complications without the use of ionizing radiation. US guidance can be used as an alternative to CT guidance for th e biopsy of thoracic lesions abutting pleura. Limitations: Single-centre retrospective study. The patients wer e not randomized between the US and CT guidance which may result in selection bias. Ethics committee approval: The ethics committee approval was obtained.

Castagnoli, F. Landolfi, R. G. H. Beets-Tan, S. (PP) are morphological of long-term asbestos exposure. The relationship between PP and lung function is not well- understood. The time-consuming nature of PP delineation to obtain volume impedes research. To automate this, we aimed to dev elop automatic Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven segmentation of PP. Moreov er, we want to explore the relationship between the pleural plaque volume in C T scans and pulmonary function tests (PFT). Methods or Background: Radiologists thoracic CT scans (n=61 363 images) of patients with occupational exposure to asbestos, which were used to develop th e AI model. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was used for the correl ation between PP volume and PFT metrics. When recorded, these were VC, FVC, DLC O, and KCO. Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 65 Results or Findings: We trained the AI system on subjects in the training set (n=322). On the independent test set (n=100), the c orrelation between the predicted volume and the ground truth was r=0.89, t he median overlap was 0.70 Dice Similarity Coefficient. We found weak to no significant differences were found (p>0.05). Significant differences were found for VC (p=0.02) and FVC (p=0.006). Conclusion: We successfully developed an AI algorithm to automatically segment PP in CT images to enable fast volume extraction. The PP volume is associated with loss in VC and FVC. We envision that the AI model could be used to non-invasively gain insight into lung morphology and lung function, which could make PP volume investigation more acces sible to other researchers. Limitations: We could not correct for confounders in the correla tion between the lung function parameters and the volume, like s moking.

Xiaojie*\u00b9, D. Han\u00b9, and validate a combinin g the clinical factors and unenhanced CT-based radiomic signature for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Methods or Background: A total of 164 patients with MPM were enrolled in this multi-centre study from 2007 to 2020 and divided into training (n = 82) and test (n = 82) sets according to the admission time. A clinical model was constructed based on the clinicopathological and CT morphological features. The correlation of the overall survival (OS) with r adiomic features, which were extracted from the region of interest (ROI) manuall y segmented on the three- dimensional CT images were analyzed. The Cox propor tional risk model was conducted by combining the radiomic signature with clinical factors to establish a nomogram for prognostic prediction and risk strat ification. Harrell's Concordance Index (C-Index) and calibration curve w ere used to evaluate the model's discrimination and consistency, respectivel y. Results or Findings: Based on the clinical factors, Cox multivariate analysis showed that albumin reduction (hazard ratio[HR]=1.5 84), clinical stage IV (HR=3.075) and chemotherapy (HR=0.477) were indepen dent factors for OS prediction. The predictive performance of the clini c-radiomic combined nomogram was superior to the clinical model alone i n training (C-index: 0.709 & 0.662) and test (C-index: 0.664 & 0.613) sets. The patients in the training (P<0.001) and test (P=0.007) sets can be successful ly stratified into low and high-risk groups with the combined nomogram. Conclusion: The nomogram combined with clinical and CT-based ra diomic signature is a new and favourable tool to predict t he prognosis for MPM patients, which may provide valuable information for clinical decision making.

J. Henkel*, B. Stieltjes, A. W. Sauter; Basel/C H Purpose: Competitions are a potential approach in data science to solve real- world problems. It offers organizers the opportunit y to get external expertise and participants a great learning opportunity. In t his study, we show how this approach can be used to create labelled data for th e training of deep learning (DL) algorithms. Methods or Background: A platform to create competitions in diagnostic imaging has been developed. Ten radiology residents competed on the platform in detecting pneumothorax on 1161 chest x- rays. Using this data, multiple DL algorithms for detecting pneumothorax w ere developed. Classification and localization performance of the models were tested on an internal and NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Results or Findings: The AI models F1 scores on the internal and the NIH dataset were 0.87 and 0.44, respectively. Sensitivi ty was 0.85 and 0.80 classification and specificity 0.96 and 0.48 for cl assification. F1 0.66, sensitivity 0.72 and 0.72. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that competition derived a nnotations are a valuable data source for DL algorithm development. Further work is needed to include additional parameters such as user performance, consensus of diagnosis, and quality control in the development pipeline. Limitations: The training data is based on data from a single institution. The \"ground truth\" in this study is based on the consen sus opinion of the residents performing the annotation of the images; no expert review other than the approved report has taken place to confirm the diagnoses. Finally, this is a retrospective study; the model's performance has no t yet been prospectively evaluated in a clinical environment.

Huang\u00b9, Z. but is not well characterized clinically or radiographically. Here, we described the largest cohort of patients to date who developed IRAE peric ardial effusion and analyzed their clinical course and radiologic correlates. Methods or Background: We identified patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and who developed pericardi al effusion during the same time period. We analyzed chronicity to assess if pericardial effusions developed after initiation of therapy; cardiac func tion on echocardiogram was also assessed to rule out cardiac dysfunction as a cause of pericardial effusion. We analyzed clinical information and seri al CT exams for concomitant findings. We performed statistical analysis to eval uate which features were characteristic of or associated with IRAE pericardi al effusion. Results or Findings: The majority of IRAE-pericardial effusions were small and not clinically significant, and most commonly f ollowed anti-PD-1 inhibitor therapy; a significant number were seen in patients previously treated with carboplatin. Approximately half were treated with s teroids or resolved spontaneously. Approximately half of the patients w ith IRAE- pericardial effusion had mediastinal adenopathy and/or pleural effusions, however these were not significantly different in the control pat ients. Conclusion: Contrary to prior case reports and series, our data suggest that IRAE-pericardial effusions are rarely clinically si gnificant and analysis of the risk/benefit ratio does not warrant discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Limitations: Limitations of this study were the relatively small sample size and the retrospective design of the study given that patients may have gone on to have significant developments in their clinical cou rse after the end of the study period.

Yang*; To assess the alterations in the topological proper ties of the white matter brain network in carotid vulnerable plaque group and carotid hard plaque group based on magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging(DTI). Methods or Background: One hundred and nineteen volunteers were included and performed DTI examination, among who, 58 volunteers had carotid vulnerable plaques, 23 volunteers had carot id hard plaques. The differences in the topological properties among the three groups were explored at both the global and local levels using one-way A NOVA and Bonferroni t-test (p<0.05). Then network-based statistic (NBS) method was employed to assess the alterations of the interregional connections am ong three groups (NBS corrected, p<0.001 at voxel level, p<0.05 at cluster level, permutated for 5000 times). Results or Findings: Compared with the control group and vulnerable plaque group, the hard plaque group demonstrated significantly increased betweenness centrality in the left supramarginal gy rus region. Compared with the control group and hard plaque group, the vulner able plaque group demonstrated significantly decreased nodal clusteri ng coefficiency in the left putamen region. The vulnerable-plaque group present ed a significantly decreased subnetwork component and two significantl y increased subnetwork components in the NBS analysis results. Conclusion: The topological organisation of white matter networ ks in carotid hard plaque group is different from vulnerable plaque group, which tends to increase the local efficiency of network communicat ion to compensate. Furthermore, the carotid vulnerable plaque group showed more disorder of topological properties. Limitations: First, we were limited by the cross-sectional design and small sample size of this study. Second, we only analysed the anatomical connectivity of white matter. The combination of st ructural and functional network analysis might provide a more comprehensive perspective for the disorder of topological properties in patients with carotid vulnerable plaques.

RPS 2611-5 The impact of acceleration factors of compressed se nsing on the image quality of 3D-TOF-MRA for cervical vessels *Q. Song*; Dalian/CN Purpose: Explore the impact of acceleration factors of CS on the image quality of 3D-TOF-MRA for cervical vessels. Methods or Background: 22 healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent the 3D-TOF MRA scan of neck vessels on a 3.0 T MR scanner. Four groups with different acceleration schemes wer e set up in our study, group A with a routine clinical setup of SENSE acceleration factor 3, and groups B, C, and D with CS factors of 4, 6, and 8. Regions of interest were placed manually at both sides of the carotid artery and nearby sternocleidomastoid muscle by experienced radiologi sts for the measurement of SNR and CNR. The two observers used a four-point scoring method to evaluate the quality of the four groups of images. The Kappa statistics were calculated for determining the interobserver agreem ent. The assessment of intermethod agreement was based on the evaluation o f the senior physicians. Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to assess the diff erence of SNR, CNR and image scores between the 4 groups. Mann-Whitney U t est was used to make a pairwise comparison. Results or Findings: There were no statistically significant differences in SNR, CNR between the four groups. However, if CS ac celeration factor of 8 was used, the subjective scores decreased obviously (p < 0.05, Table. 3). And no significant differences in image quality were detected between conventional SENSE acceleration with a factor of 3 and CS acceleration with factors of 4 and 6. Conclusion: CS acceleration factor of 6 is recommended for clinical 3D-TOF carotid MRA to achieve an optimal balance between i maging time and image quality.

Methods or Background: A 3 T scanner and a 32-channel head coil were used for all the PC-MRI measurements. An in vitro f low model consisting of a plastic tube (2.3 mm inner diameter) passing through an agar gel was constructed to provide a continuous flow. The flow rate was controlled using a reservoir with a scale and timer and used as the st andard reference. A PC-MRI sequence was performed with varying voxel size (0.6 x 0.8 x 5 mm, 1 x 1 x 5 mm, 1.2 x 1.2 x 5 mm), NEX (1, 2, 3) and VENC (200, 300, 400 cm/s). Measurements were repeated 9 times for each setting. Mean flow and peak velocity were calculated for each combination of settings and the least detectable difference (LDD) was computed. Results or Findings: All PC-MRI mean flow measurements were higher than our standard reference (mean values ranging from 7. 3 to 9.5 ml/s compared with 6.5 ml/s). Decreasing voxel size improved the accuracy of mean flow measurements, with measured values changing from 9. 5 to 7.3 ml/s. LDD for mean flow decreased with increasing voxel size and NEX (p<0.05). LDD for peak velocity decreased with increasing voxel size (p<0.05). No change in LDD was observed with different VENC settings. Conclusion: Accuracy in PC-MRI flow measurements in a small ves sel phantom is low, with higher measured values than co ntrol. Improved accuracy is obtained with increased spatial resolution. Impr oved precision is obtained with decreased spatial resolution and increased NEX . Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Eighty-five patients who underwent CEA between May 2015 and July 2021 were included (mean age 65.3\u00b17.1 years, 76.5% male). Cerebral hyperperfusion was defined as an increase in cerebral blood flow >100% compared with preoperative values. Preop erative ASL images were scored based on the presence of arterial trans it artefacts (ATAs) in 10 regions of interest corresponding to ASPECTS method ology as follows: 0, no or minimal ASL signal; 1, low/moderate ASL signal w ith ATA; 2, high ASL signal with ATA; and 3, normal perfusion without AT A. The degree of stenosis, primary and secondary collaterals were evaluated on conventional CTA, MRA and T2 FLAIR images. Results or Findings: Cerebral hyperperfusion was presented in 16 (18.8%) patients. Preoperative ASL score was an independent predictor of cerebral hyperperfusion (OR=0.47, 95% CI [0.32-0.71], p<0.00 1).

Giyab*, T\u00f3th; P\u00e9cs/HU (ogiyab@gmail.com) Purpose: Our aim was to prove our hypothesis according to which cerebral fat embolism commonly presents with a characteristic mi crobleed pattern on MRI. Methods or Background: We searched the literature and the database of our home institution for cases of cerebral fat embolism (CFE). The hypothesized CFE characteristic microbleed pattern (diffuse pres of round microbleeds of monotonous size in the subcortical white matter involving but not limited to the U-fibers, internal capsule and the corpus callosum, mostly sparing the corona radiata and the non-subcortical centrum semi ovale on T2* GRE or SWI images), the starfield pattern as described by Pari zel et al (scattered bright spots on a dark background in DWI with diffusion restriction), and confluent diffusion restriction in the corpus callosum were s tatistically compared. Temporal characteristics of the imaging features were also analysed. Results or Findings: 141 patients with cerebral fat embolism were includ ed. The characteristic \"walnut kernel microbleed patter n\" was found in 89.74%. Diffusion abnormality in general was seen in 97.64% . definitive starfield pattern was ascertained in 68.5%. Confluent restric ted diffusion was seen in the corpus callosum in 77.27%. The walnut kernel mi crobleed pattern had a more consistent presence among time periods compared to the starfield pattern. Conclusion: Microbleeds in CFE are very common and mainly occur in a characteristic pattern in SWI or T2*, which along w ith the starfield pattern and corpus callosum diffusion restriction in DWI/ADC appear to be the most important imaging markers of CFE and may aid the di fferential diagnosis in clinically equivocal cases.

They issued Likert-scale ratings (1 = worst, 5 = best) for pulsation artefac t severity and counted the difference of lesions visible at b = 800 s/mm\u00b2 separately for small and large FLLs (i.e., < 1 cm or > 1 cm) and separately for left and right liver lobe. Differences between the two diffusion encodings wer e assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results or Findings: Forty participants were included in the study. Both readers found a reduction in pulsation artefact in the liver with FloCo encoding (left liver lobe: p < 0.001; ratings 4: reader 1, 9 of 40 cases for monopolar vs 35 of 40 for FloCo; reader 2, 11 of 40 for monopola r vs 37 of 40 for FloCo ). More small lesions were detected with FloCo diffusi on encoding in both liver lobes (left lobe: reader 1, six additional lesions; reader 2, seven additional lesions; p = 0.063 for both readers). Both readers found one additional large lesion in the left liver lobe. Conclusion: FloCo is more effective than MP diffusion encoding for the detection of FLLs.

Microvascular invasion (MVI) prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after an operation. However, predicting MVI in patients with HCC is a clinical c hallenge as MVI is a histopathological diagnosis. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE- MRI) for predicting MVI in small solitary HCC (ssHCC). Methods or Background: A total of 63 patients with pathologically confirme d ssHCC ( 3cm) underwent A dual-input two-compartment exchange mo del (2CXM) was used to calculate the values of quantitative permeability and perfusion parameters. The differences in parameters between different MVI sta tus groups were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to build the combined prediction Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 68 model for MVI prediction with the statistically sig nificant parameters. The predictive performance was evaluated using ROC anal ysis. Results or Findings: Among the 63 patients with ssHCC, 22 (34.9%) exhibited MVI positive. The MVI positive group had higher volume transfer constant (Ktrans), reverse reflux rate constant (kep), portal vein blood flow (BFpv), and lower extracellular e fraction (ve), BFpv independently associated with MVI with OR values of 4.36, 2.53 and 3.74 (P<0.05) through multivariate logistic regression. ROC analysis show ed that the AUC, sensitivity, specificity in predicting MVI by combined Ktrans, k and 87.6%, 95.4%, respectively. Conclusion: Quantitative DCE-MRI derived parameters showed potential value in the prediction MVI in ssHCC. Limitations: The sample size was relatively small.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of radiomics analysis of contrast-enhanced computed tomography images (CECT) in estimating the histologic tumour grade before surgery in patients with HCC. Methods or Background: The 36 patients with HCC and preoperative liver CECT who had undergone surgical resection were retr ospectively enrolled in the study (25 patients with the tumour Grade 1+Grade2, and 11 patients - with Grade 3). The LIFEx application software (version v 7.1.0, www.lifexsoft.org) was used to obtain texture features. 3D ROI that co vered the whole tumour was delineated in the images for each patient. Radi omic features were extracted from four phases (native, arterial, portal, and delay). A total of 497 radiomic features were extracted from each CECT phase. Findings: Tree radiomic features: CONVENTIONAL_HUKurtosis, DISCRETIZED_HUExcessKurtosis and GLZLM_SZE derived from native and arterial phases showed significant positive associations with the histologic grade (p<0,05) and were selected after multiple linear regression analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of radiomics-based model in detecting poor- differentiated HCC from well- the CECT radiomics-based model reflects a better evaluating performance in the prediction of HCC gra de, which may contribute to personalised treatment.

Schmidt*, C. Hamm, H. Xu, V. H. Broukal, L. is a imaging biomarkers indicative of the presence of microvascular invasio n. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of RVI regarding r esponse and survival of patients with HCC receiving LRT. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 95 patients with unresectable HCC, who received ablation using CT-guided high dose-rate (TACE, n=47) between 01/2016-12/2 017. Patients were stratified according to positive or negative RVI as sessed on baseline contrast-enhanced MRI using two decision-tree-models: RVI (art) and RVI (ven) based on the presence of internal vessels in the arterial or portal-venous phase, respectively, and the absence of both a hypointense halo and a sharp tumour- liver-transition in native T1-weighted images. Prim ary endpoints were overall (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to progression (TTP). Statistics included Fisher's exact test and Kaplan-Meier analy sis. Results or Findings: Regarding brachytherapy alone, stratification accor ding to RVI (art) achieved significant separation of OS (p=<0.001) and PFS (p=0.029) but not TTP (p=0.142), revealing poorer o utcomes for RVI positive patients. RVI (ven) was predictive of TTP (p=0.032) and PFS (p=0.004) but not OS (p=0.078). On the contrary, both RVI types achie ved no significant stratification for any endpoint following TACE/brac hytherapy. In patients receiving brachytherapy alone, median OS, PFS, and TTP were shorter for RVI (ven) positive compared to negative patients (12.4 vs 40.4, 5.9 vs 13.2, 6.4 vs 11.8 months). In contrast, no difference could be o bserved for patients receiving TACE/brachytherapy. Conclusion: While decisions for LRT are currently based on visual assessments of tumour enhancement on baseline MRI, the findings underscore the potential of RVI to identify HCC pat ients who would benefit from TACE before brachytherapy.

Methods or Background: Thirty men with histologically confirmed PCA were included in this prospectively enrolled single-cent re cohort study. All patients received multiparametric MRI (T2, DWI, DCE) at 3T w ith additional ASL of the PCA lesion. The primary endpoint was the differenti ability of PCA versus normal prostate tissue in ASL in comparison to DCE. Secondary objectives were differences in signal intensities (SI), contrast ratios (CR), and differences in the attenuation pattern of peripheral (PZ) and t ransition zone (TZ) PCA. Results or Findings: In both ASL and DCE, the average SI of PCA areas differed significantly from SI in reference areas i n the TZ and PZ (p<0,01, respectively). ASL had significantly higher CR disc erning PCA and benign tissue in PZ and TZ (PZ=5.2; TZ=6.5) compared to DC E (PZ=1.6; TZ=1.4) (p<0.01, respectively). In subjective evaluation, A SL could visualise PCA in 28 patients, compared to 29 in DCE. Conclusion: ASL had significantly higher contrast-ratios discer ning PCA and benign tissue in PZ and TZ compared to DCE and visu al discrimination of PCA does not differ significantly between the two seque nces. As perfusion gadolinium-based contrast media is seen more critic al in the last few years, ASL seems to be a promising alternative to DCE in P CA detection. Limitations: Single-centre design.

Methods or Background: This retrospective study included patients who underwent DCE-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. C ES was defined as an area of asymmetrical early hyperenhancement on DCE- MRI that was adjacent to a peripheral zone tumour, matched or exceeded the tumour circumferential diameter, and persisted beyond the washout of contr ast within the adjacent tumour. Two expert uro-radiologists evaluated the p resence of CES on DCE- MRI, independently and then in consensus, with the interobserver agreement calculated using a bias-adjusted and prevalence-adj usted kappa (PABAK). CES diagnostic performance for prediction of ECE was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results or Findings: The study included 146 patients, of whom 91/146 (62%) harboured ECE on final surgical pathology. Followin g the initial review of the images, Reader 1 called 12/146 (8%) CES-positive cases, while Reader 2 reported 14/146 (10%) CES-positive cases, and a tot al of 15/146 (10%) lesions were subsequently identified as CES-positive follow ing a consensus read. PABAK for CES between the two readers was high at 0.90. All consensus determined CES-positive lesions represented pathological T3a disease, with the overall prevalence of CES among tumours with co nfirmed ECE being 15/91 (17%). Hence, whilst showing 100% specificity and P PV for ECE detection, CES had sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy of 16.5%, 41.29%, and 47.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The presence of CES on DCE-MRI is highly predictive for the presence of ECE and may improve local staging in th e small but significant percentage of patients in whom it is demonstrated.

Methods or Background: A total of 88 patients (mean age: 68.6 years, range: 47-82 years) who had been diagnosed with PCa by radical prostatectomy and undergone pre-operative 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonanc e imaging (3T-MRI) including DWI (b values, 0, 100, 1000, 2000 s/mm2) were included in this study. cDWI b2000 was made from aDWI b0, 100 and 1000 under a mono- exponential decay model. Two independent reviewers performed a 4-week- interval review of aDWI b2000 images and then cDWI b2000 in random order for each session. T2-weighted images were presented for both sessions. A region of interest was drawn for an index tumour on each dataset, and a PIRADS score based on PIRADS v2.1 was recorded. Top ographic maps served as the reference standard. The McNemar test was performed to compare the sensitivities for tumour detection, and kappa statistics were used to evaluate the inter-observer agreement on the PIR ADS score on each dataset. Results or Findings: The study population consisted of Gleason score 9 ients. reviewers, the sensitivities of cDWI b2000 and aDWI b2000 for detection of PCa showed no significant difference (for reviewer 1, both 94% (83/88); for reviewer 2, both 90% (79/88), P = 1.000, respectively). The kappa values of cDWI b2000 and aDWI showed comparable diagnostic performance and sustained moderate inter-observer agreement with aD WI b2000 for detection of PCa.

M. H\u00f6tker*\u00b9, U. J. M\u00fchlematter\u00b9, S. Skawran\u00b9, S \u00b2Baden/CH Purpose: To predict the presence of PET-positive pelvic lymph nodes in prostate cancer using quantitative parameters of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and clinical information. Methods or Background: This study included 35 patients with high suspicion for prostate cancer undergoing multiparametric pros tate MRI and PSMA- PET/CT prior to MRI-guided biopsy. All MRI examinat ions were assessed by a radiologist, and the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC, mean and volume), capsular contact length, volume and maximal diamete r on T2-weighted sequences and parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanc ed MRI (iAUC, kep, Ktrans, ve) were calculated for the index lesion. C linical data was extracted from the hospital information system to calculate t he Briganti 2018 nomogram scores. PET examinations were evaluated by two boar d-certified nuclear medicine physicians and served as the standard of r eference. Results or Findings: Quantitative imaging parameters of mpMRI mostly demonstrated mediocre to good performance in 2018 nomogram (including maximum diameter of the index of 0.78 (95%-CI: 0.61-0.95). Quantit ative parameter did not provide added value to the Briganti 2018 model alone. Conclusion: The Briganti 2018 model, which includes clinical/pathological data and the maximal tumour length of the index les ion on prostate MRI, performed well in predicting PET-positive lymph nodes and may serve as a tool to stratify patients for primary staging using PSMA -PET.

Methods or Background: Prebioptic multiparametric (T2-weighted, DWI transrectal ultrasound- guided MRI-fusion and systematic prostate biopsy were included. Two radiologists independently assigned a PI-QUAL score to each patient. PI- RADS categories were assigned in a lesion-based approach, dividing the prostate into six regions (left and right: base/midglandular/apex). Additionally, the diagnostic quality of each sequence was evaluat ed independently. Inter- reader agreement was calculated by using Cohen's kappa and diagnostic performance was compared by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Sunday Abstract-based Programme A B 70 Results or Findings: In a total of 274 diagnostic areas, the malignancy rate was 62.2% (22.7% clinically significant prostate cancer ISUP 2). Inter-reader agreement for the diagnostic quality was only slight for T2w (kappa 0.19) and fair for DWI and DCE (kappa 0.23 and 0.29). For PI- QUAL as such, the inter- reader agreement was moderate (kappa 0.51). For PI- RADS category assignments, the inter-reader agreement was almost perfect (kappa 0.86). Overall diagnostic performance was significantly better in studies with a PI- QUAL score > 3 compared to a score 3 (P=0.03; AUC 0.805 and 0.839). Conclusion: In conclusion, the diagnostic performance of mpMRI for the detection of prostate cancer does depend on MRI ima ge quality. Though there is room for improvement regarding inter-reader repr oducibility, PI-QUAL is a tool that provides value by predicting the accuracy of diagnostic mpMRI results. Limitations: As all patients underwent MRI-US fusion biopsy due to suspicious mpMRI findings, the rate of malignancy is higher compared to routine clinical practice which may bias the outcomes in non-selecte d patients.

Engel*, B. A. of transi tion zone (TZ) lesions can be downgraded based on mean apparent di ffusion coefficients (mADC) without risking false-negative results. Methods or Background: This retrospective cohort study consists of consecutive patients with TZ lesions in multiparametric prostate MRI and subsequent MRI-ultrasound-fusion-biopsy between 05/ 2017-04/2020. Patients with known prostate cancer (PCa) are excluded. All lesions are scored by two blinded radiologists according to PI-RADSv2.1 guidelines. To determine mADC, lesions are manually segmented. Regression and ROC analyses are performed to determine the diagnostic performance of PI-RADSv2.1 categories and mADC. Results or Findings: Among 85 patients with 98 TZ lesions, 33 (33.7%) ar e PCa and 65 (66.3%) are benign. 24 (72.7%) of the 33 PCa lesions are clinically significant (csPCa, ISUP-grade>1). mADC for PCa are significantly lower than for benign lesions (894 vs 1.091\u00b5m2/s, p<0.001). AU C values from ROC analysis with csPCa as outcome variable are 0.916 f or PI-RADSv2.1 and 0.806 for mADC. Compared to PI-RADSv2.1 alone, a combinat ion with an mADC cut- off of 950\u00b5m2/s for TZ lesions PI-RADS 3 improves the negative predictive value (0.95 vs 1.00). Among 58 TZ lesions PI-RADS 3, only 8 (13.8%) have mADC below 950\u00b5m2/s, 3 (37.5%) PCa and 1 (12.5%) cs PCa. Conclusion: The key question after a prostate MRI is whether a biopsy is indicated: cancer detection rates for PI-RADS 1+2 are very low while being too high for PI-RADS 3 to abandon biopsies completely. Thus, further parameters which allow avoiding unnecessary biopsies are desir able. Our data indicate that by applying an mADC cut-off for TZ lesions PI-RADS 3 most biopsies could be avoided without overlooking prostate cance r. Limitations: mADC can differ between vendors/algorithms. Externa l validation of our findings is warranted before clinical use. Ethics committee approval: The ethics committee approval was obtained.

F. Donati; Zurich/CH Purpose: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm to decide on the necessity of dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences (DCE) in prostate MRI. Methods or Background: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was developed on 300 prostate MRI examinations. The consensus of two expert readers on the necessity of DCE acted as the reference standard. The CNN was validated in a separate cohort of 100 prostate MRI examinations from the same vendor and 31 examinations from a different ve ndor. Sensitivity/specificity were calculated using ROC c urve analysis and results were compared to decisions made by a radiology tech nician. Results or Findings: The CNN reached a sensitivity of 94.4% and specific ity of 68.8% (AUC: 0.88) for the necessity of DCE, corr ectly assigning 44%/34% of patients to a biparametric/multiparametric protocol. In 2% of all patients, the CNN incorrectly decided on omitting DCE. With a tec hnician reaching a sensitivity of 63.9% and specificity of 89.1%, the use of the CNN would allow for an increase in sensitivity of 30.5%. The CNN ac hieved an AUC of 0.73 in a set of examinations from a different vendor. Conclusion: The CNN would have correctly assigned 78% of patients to a biparametric or multiparametric protocol, with only 2% of all patients requiring re-examination to add DCE sequences. Integrating this CNN in clinical routine could render the requirement for on-table monitoring obsolete by performing contrast-enhanced MRI only when needed. Limitations: The decision rendered by the neural network was dic hotomous. The performance of the AI could be improved by defi ning a range of probability values in which it's unsure and prompt the technici an to call a radiologist for this particular examination.

Alqahtani*, ey; Exeter/UK (salbeshri@hotmail.com) Purpose: High and varied radiation doses when imaging obese patients are reported in the literature. This is of concern, especially with the high prevalence of obesity. This study reports new exposure factor prediction models that can be implemented in digital radiography. Methods or Background: Dose optimisation experiments were conducted using a multi-factorial design method. 5 bespoke phantoms with different sizes were used along with a Multix Fusion Max Siemens unit. Image quality was assessed physically and visually, and the DAP used as the dose measure. A mAs prediction model was produced based on the exposure factors (kVp, SID, and filtration) of images with the highest FOM. The data was analysed using Minitab software. Results or Findings: Fixed kVp (75) with 125 cm of SID and 0.3 mm filtra tion of Cu were observed to produce the best image quali ty with the lowest dose across all phantoms. The mAs best prediction model was created based on fixed kVp, SID, and filtration with r2=98. Conclusion: The results of the current study prove a promising future for image quality improvement in obese patients. A mAs prediction model can be used as a preliminary guide to optimising image quality and minimising radiation dose in obese patients. More studies need to be conducted using other CR and DR systems. Limitations: Identified limitations of this study were that a si ngle digital radiography system was used, and that this was a phantom study only.

Shelly, R. Young, *M. F. F. McEntee*; Cork/IE (mark.mcentee@ucc.ie) Purpose: Children with congenital heart disease are exposed to repeated medical imaging throughout their lifetime. Although the imaging contributes to their care and treatment, exposure to ionising radi ation is known to increase one's lifetime attributable risk of cancer. Quantif ying and tracking the radiation dose that these patients receive is important in or der to minimise the lifetime dose. Methods or Background: A systematic search was performed of Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus and Embase with relevant fil ters applied. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to all relevant papers and 7 papers were deemed to be acceptable for quality assessment and risk of bias assessment. Data extraction was performed on all 7 papers and data analysis was carried out using descriptive analysis. Results or Findings: It was found that cumulative effective dose (CED) v aried widely across the patient cohorts, ranging from 0.9 6mSv to 53.5mSv. It was however evident across many of the included studies that a significant number of patients were exposed to a CED of >20mSv, which is the current occupational exposure limit. Many factors affected the dose which patients received including age and clinical demographics. T he imaging modality which contributed the most radiation dose to patients was cardiology interventional procedures. Conclusion: Paediatric patients with congenital heart disease are at an increased risk of receiving a cumulative radiation dose across their lifetime, with a proportion of patients in this review receiv ing up to 53.5mSv from medical imaging procedures. Further research should focus on identifying risk factors for receiving higher radiation doses, keepi ng track of dose and minimising the use of medical imaging where possibl e. Limitations: Meta-analysis could not be carried out due to the nature of the data that was extracted. Ethics committee approval: None needed for a systematic literature review.

Gj\u00f8vik/ NO (eivind.r.andersen@ntnu.no) Purpose: To examine which measures service providers conside r appropriate for reducing the use of low-value radiology. Methods or Background: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among radiographers, radiologists, general practitioners, in-hospital referrers, radiological department leaders, and health governm ent representatives. The interview guide covered four broad areas: experienc e with low-value services, facilitators for reducing low-value services, barri ers for reducing low-value radiology and measures deemed to be appropriate for reducing low-value radiology. Data were analysed in line with qualitat ive framework analysis. Results or Findings: 27 participants were included in the final analysis . The use of electronic decision support was considered t o be the most prominent measure to reduce low-value services. Altering the financial system was suggested as an effective measure but assessed as difficult to implement in the Norwegian setting. Other measures included guideline revision, better communication between professionals, altering patient expectations, and making clinicians prioritize their patients within limited time slots. In general, appropriate measures should be well-founded at several levels, easy to use, and should not influence the daily practice in term s of delay or increased workload. Conclusion: All participants acknowledged the use of low-value radiology as a problem. Few had specific suggestions on how to reduce this use in their own practice, or how the health care system could be changed to face this challenge without unintended consequences. A multiperspective approach is necessary to achieve effective and long-lasting cha nges in the use of radiology. While many measures for reducing low-val ue radiology are available, it is essential that they are well adapt ed to the context. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Mifsud, Purpose: To of higher kVp and additional co pper (Cu) filtration to optimise four digital planar radiographic projections: AP abdomen, AP knee, AP and lateral lumbar spine. Methods or Background: In phase 1, an anthropomorphic phantom was exposed using different combinations of kVp and Cu filtration thicknesses. Apart from exposing the phantom using the standard local protocol, additional exposures were performed using +10kVp and +20kVp as well as 0.1mm or 0.2mm Cu. The dose-area product (DAP), milliampere- second (mAs) and exposure time (s) were recorded after each exposure was terminated by automatic exposure control (AEC). During phase 2, i mage quality analysis was performed. Objective image quality was measured usi ng contrast-noise ratio (CNR) calculations, while subjective image quality was determined using a sample of radiographers and radiologists who perfor med visual grading analysis (VGA). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 74 Results or Findings: Optimised exposure parameters were established as follows: AP abdomen, and 0.2mm Cu; 110kVp 62.50%, 64.51% and 71.85% reduction in DAP and cur ve (AUC) of 0.883, 0.664, 0.708 and 0.516 respectively. The optimised AP abdomen protocol had a significantly better image quality than the standard protocol (p<0.05). CNR values decreased linearly as both kVp and Cu filtration thickness increased for all the projections. Conclusion: The results support using beam hardening techniques when imaging the AP abdomen, AP knee, AP and lateral lum bar spine. A significant reduction in DAP was recorded whilst an acceptable or improved level of image quality was maintained.

O'Driscoll, Moore, *M. F. McEntee*; Cork/IE (mark.mcentee@ucc.ie) Purpose: Optimisation is imperative in radiography given the potential risk associated with exposure to ionising radiation. In radiography, diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) are utilised to optimise th e medical radiation exposure of patients. It is a legislative and regulatory requirement to establish and audit DRLs in hospital sites in the Republic of Ireland. This work aimed to explore radiographers' experiences in establishment and implementation of DRLs. Methods or Background: This study employed a semi-structured interview as the method of data collection. The work included th e radiological protection officer and radiological safety officer of clinical sites from four public hospitals. Thus, purposive non-probability sampling was employ ed. Written, informed consent was obtained. The interviews were recorded transcribed verbatim by the researcher. The transcribed data was then uploa ded to data analysis software NVivo and codes were assigned to the appro priate data. Results or Findings: Resources was the prominent theme that emerged from the data. Availability of resources such as time, m anpower, dose tracking software, equipment and raw data were all described as important facilitators in establishing and auditing of DRLs. The concept of i mage quality and its relationship with DRLs was also identified. Partici pants discussed the relationship between DRLs and low dose radiation, q uality assurance and radiologist input. The following themes were identi fied: resources, relevant national authority guidance, image quality and educ ation. Conclusion: Implementation of DRLs requires resources that are often lacking. The factors that assist implementation inc lude guidelines and education. Staff knowledge of DRLs is a barrier in the implementation and auditing of DRLs in a department. Limitations: This work focussed on government-run hospitals, dri vers may be different in a privately run institution Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the ethics committee of the UCC School of clinical therapies.

S. \u00b9Porto/PT, \u00b2Coimbra/PT (aspimenta@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study is to characterise radiation protection (RP) measures used on Portuguese interventional radiology (IR) departments taking into account the European and national recommendati ons. Methods or Background: A national survey was created and piloted online in order to characterise the fluoroscopy technology, a nalyse the frequency of fluoroscopy guided intervention procedures (FGIP), the staff education/training and the RP measures used daily. Results or Findings: The majority of the fluoroscopy equipment in FGIP i n Portugal used a single flat panel detector. The most frequent FGIP performed in Portugal are few members of the staf f reported having postgraduate education in RP. The majority of nurses participating in this study reported no RP training. A lack of harmonisation was found for some RP measures. More than 50% of IR departments do not de fine patient follow-up based on examination dose values. Conclusion: This study characterises the technological evolution in IR, however it reveals a lack RP education and training in staff members. Some centres need to update RP measures according to the recommendations. Limitations: The response rate from the private institutions was an identified limitation of this study. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was obtained from the University and Hospital Committees. Funding for this study: No funding was obtained for this study.

The purpose of this study was to establish the normal viscosity value of the parotid gland (PG) and submandibular gland (SMG) in a group of healthy subjects, using the novel Viscosity Plane-wave UltraSound (ViPLUS) technique, and to assess its potential dependence on gender and age. Methods or Background: The study group included a total of 49 healthy volunteers (median age 31, 65% females) prospectively examined. The viscosity of both PG and SMG was measured using the new Aixplorer MACH 30 ultrasound system (SuperSonic Imagine, Aix-en-Pr ovence, France) equipped with a curvilinear C6-1X transducer. The m ean value of three valid measurements was considered (quantified in Pa.s). Results or Findings: The mean viscosity value for the PG was 2.13\u00b10.23 Pa.s, significantly lower than the mean viscosity v alue of the SMG 2.44\u00b10.35 Pa.s (p A negative low correlation betwe en SMG viscosity and age was found (rho = -0.38, p = 0.006). Viscosity values of the SMG were significantly lower in the age group between 35-77 years (2.12\u00b10.35 Pa.s) than in the age (2.52\u00b10.36 Pa.s), and 20-24 years (2.53\u00b10.24 Pa.s), respectively (p < 0.05). Viscosity values of both salivary glands did not differ significantly between gender groups. Conclusion: SuperSonic ViPLUS represents an innovative and usef ul non- invasive method to assess the viscosity of the parotid and submandibular glands. Age is a potential confounding factor in th e evaluation of normal SMG viscosity. Limitations: (1) The small size sample. (2) The curvilinear transducer was used because the ViPLUS module was only available o n this transducer. However, the focus of this preliminary study was to obtain quantitative data regarding viscosity, and not to assess parenchymal structural changes, where higher frequency transducers are mandatory.

S\u00e1 Silva*, V. S. M. M. Pinto, J. P. Filipe; Porto/PT Purpose: To understand the anatomy of the craniovertebral junction and to learn objective methods of evaluation of this anatomical segment in different imaging techniques. Methods or Background: The craniovertebral junction (CVJ) is an important anatomic landmark and a region where disease can pr esent in multiple ways, be it congenital or acquired. Knowing its normal anatomical appearance and how to assess it should be part of a radiologist's faculties. Results or Findings: Evaluation of the CVJ requires knowledge of some anatomical landmarks, normal measurements and topographic relationships that enable us to perform CVJ craniometry. The basi on, opisthion, posterior margin of the hard palate, anterior and posterior arches of atlas, lateral atlas masses, odontoid process, body of axis, jugular tubercles and occipital condyles are the craniometric points used as osseous anatomical landmarks. With these landmarks we can apply radiographic lines and angles to evaluate normal morphology relationships: the Wackenheim's c livus canal line, the Chamberlain's line, the McRae line, the bimastoid and digastric lines, the clivus-canal angle, the basal angle, the anterior a tlanto-dens interval and the atlanto-occipital joint axis angle. Anomalies of the normal relationship characteristics may raise the suspicion of disease, and certain patterns of anomalies may indicate certain diagnosis. Most of t hese evaluations are made in a sagittal plane. Computed tomography (CT) and m agnetic resonance (MR) are best for their evaluation, since conventional r adiography may have superimposition artifacts precluding correct measur ing. Also, assessment of bone anatomy is better accomplished by CT, whereas the evaluation of spinal soft tissues, ligaments and neural structures is better with MR. Conclusion: By routinely using these craniometric measures in t he CVJ, we can objectively evaluate this region and report its normality or, if present, the abnormalities that may indict certain diagnosis. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Jo\u00e3o Tarrio: Nothing to disclose Jo\u00e3o Pedro Filipe: S\u00e1 Silva: Nothing disclose Eduarda Maria to disclose Vasco \u00b2Padua/IT Purpose: The brainstem is a complex anatomical structure containing several nuclei and connecting fibre bundles not visible in- vivo at high magnetic field strengths. In ultra-high field, instead, the higher resolution and increased tissue contrast can improve their visibility. Here, we exp lored the performance of high- resolution 7T-MRI in representing the normal in-viv o anatomy of the brainstem. Methods or Background: One adult volunteer was imaged at 7T to obtain T2*-weighted images, phase images and quantitative susceptibility maps of the brainstem (0.33x0.33x1.2mm3). An ex-vivo formalin-f ixed brainstem was scanned with MR system, obtaining 3D T2*-w eighted and 2D PD- weighted images medulla oblongata 0.16x0.16x1mm3, respectively). The sectioned and stained for myelin (Weigert-Pal) and iron (Perls). Using histological sections as reference, in-vivo and ex- vivo MR images were assessed to identify brainstem nuclei and white mat ter tracts. Results or Findings: The in-vivo imaging depicted the detailed anatomy of many brainstem structures such as the red nucleus, with the distinction between magnocellular and parvocellular portion, and the substantia nigra, with the identification of the nigrosome 1. Other n uclei and many white matter tracts were also detectable in-vivo, such as the medial and lateral geniculate body, the abducens nucleus, the fibres of the facial nerve, the medial and lateral lemniscus, the spinothalamic tract, the nuclei cuneatus a nd the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Conclusion: 7T-MRI allows an impressive representation of the normal radiological anatomy of many brainstem structures t hat are not visible in detail at conventional field strength. Limitations: The limitation is the evaluation of only one volunt eer and one ex- vivo sample. Ethics committee approval: The local ethics committees approved this study.

Hence, we evaluated c hanges in carotid plaque calcification over two years in a sample of symptom atic patients with carotid artery disease. Methods or Background: From the PARISK-study, a prospective cohort study with TIA/minor stroke patients with ipsilateral mil d-to-moderate carotid artery stenosis(<70%), we included 79 patients (25% women, mean age 66 years) who underwent CT imaging with a two-year interval. We assessed extra- and intracranial carotid artery calcification (ECAC, IC AC). And calculated the difference in ECAC and ICAC volume, using logistic regression analyses to investigate associations of cardiovascular determinants. Results or Findings: We found an increase in ECAC volume in 46% of patients (median: 23.0 mm3[IQR=3.9;40.1]) 45% in ICAC volume (median:12.9 mm3[IQR=7.2;27.5]). Larger ECAC volume at baseline was associated with less increase in ECAC over two year s (odds ratio (OR):0.72 [95%CI=0.58;0.90]). No statistically significant as sociations were found for increase in ICAC. Additionally, we observed decreas es in ECAC and ICAC in 34% and 25% of the arteries. More ECAC at baseline was related to a decrease in ECAC (OR:2.24 [95%CI=1.60;3.13]. More I CAC at baseline was associated with a decrease in ICAC (OR:2.17 [95%CI= 1.48;3.16]). Conclusion: We provide important novel insights the dynami cs of carotid plaque calcification in TIA/minor stroke patients. Limitations: The limitations are a threshold of 600 HU and a cut -off value of 10%, to define both increase and decrease of the calcification volume.

Manzella*, M. Silva, R. Gon\u00e7alves dos Santos, I. d. S. C. Oliveira, A. Alcoforado, Seabra, J. Brito, G. Andrade, B. Mota; Recife/BR Purpose: First, to discuss and illustrate the most common in tracranial vascular malformations. Second, to identify the imaging feat ures that help differentiate brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) from other vascular brain lesions. Third, to discuss the imaging findings that should be included in radiology reports in patients with brain AVMs. Methods or Background: Cerebrovascular malformations are the most common symptomatic vascular malformations. They are predominantly solitary and supratentorial. Their origin remains uncertain, although they are considered multifactorial and often related to cong enital factors. They can be classified according to the of arteriovenous shunt absence of shunt (venous development anomaly, sinus cavernous malformation and capillary telangiectasia). Results or Findings: The authors will review the anatomy of the superfic ial and deep venous system, as well as the eloquent areas of the brain parenchyma, which are essential to categorise these malformations according to the Spetzler-Martin classification. The imaging findings will be illustrated using a multimodality approach. Each malformation w ill be discussed separately. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 76 Conclusion: Radiologists must be able to detect the presence of a cerebrovascular malformation. Mimics of brain AVMs need to be identified as such to help guide diagnosis and therapy. In additi on, when a brain AVM is found, specific details about the natural risk posed by a brain AVM and the risks related to treatment need to be reported.

Rotariu*, I. Sava, D. Negru; Iasi/RO Purpose: This educational exhibit aims to bring to attention the cranial neurovascular compression syndromes by illustrating a comprehensive MRI gallery of neurovascular conflicts involving cranial nerves III, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XII in order for the radiologist to: (1) review the anatomy of the cranial nerves in the cisternal segment and the physiopathology of this syndrome; (2) differentiate between neurovascular contact and conflict and therefore to know when to report such a finding. Methods or Background: Neurovascular conflicts represent abnormal contacts between the cisternal segment of a cranial nerve and a vessel (usually a redundant artery), causing nerve irritat ion. Clinically, this translates to oculomotor nerve A neurovascular contact may be an incidental finding on MRI, but there are some useful signs to determine whether it will become clinically relevant and therefore if it should be reported in asymptomatic patients. Attention should be paid to the arteries, which are more expected to pr oduce a significant conflict than veins, and to the effects produced on the nerv e (deviation, indentation, atrophy). Results or Findings: A combination of three MRI sequences is considered the standard to visualise the complex neurovascular anatomy in the cisternal the relati between the cranial nerves and vasculature around them. Conclusion: Familiarity with the anatomy of cranial nerves and vessels within the cisternal space and awareness of the elements t hat differentiate a normal neurovascular contact from a conflict are key to make specific and confident diagnoses regarding neurovascular compression syndr omes. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable. Author Disclosures: Gabriela Rotariu: Nothing to disclose Dragos Negru: Sava: Nothing to disclose PP 1-8 NOWinBRAIN: a large, systematic, comprehensive and bridging neuroradiology, neurology are re ported to be the most difficult in medical education. To facilit ate coping with this problem I have created NOWinBRAIN, a large, systematic, compr ehensive, beautiful and freely available repository of three-dimensional im ages of the human brain extended to head and neck bridging neuroradiology, neuroanatomy, neuroscience, neuroeducation (from students to pati ents) and art. Methods or Background: NOWinBRAIN is derived from a 3D electronic brain atlas (Nowinski WL et al, \"The Human Brain, Head an d Neck in 2953 Pieces\", Thieme, New York, 2015) constructed from multiple 3 /7 Tesla MR and high- resolution CT scans of a living brain. This interac tive repository contains 8 galleries (denoted G1-G8). Galleries G1-G6 were created earlier; G1-G5 comprise surface anatomy fully parcellated by colour and labelled, and organised into image (appearance and context) sequences, and G6 contains correlated surface and planar anatomy placed in a s tereotactic coordinate system. For ECR2022 two new galleries are created, dissection gallery (G7) and functional gallery (G8). G7 provides relationships between the dissected brain and its inner structures, white matter tracts , cranial nerve nuclei, and intracranial vasculature. G8 contains surface anatomy with its functional description, also suitable for patients. Results or Findings: The NOWinBRAIN repository is implemented and contains about 7,500 3D images. It is web-based running on low-cost computers and mobile devices, freely available at w ww.nowinbrain.org and requires no password/registration. Because of its accessibility and ease of use, the majority of the current visitors are from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Conclusion: This bridge-building repository is useful for a spectrum of users: clinicians, educators, medical students, and patients. It also serves users from less privileged countries. Limitations: No 3D models, which are suitable e.g. for 3D printi ng, are available. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: None. This is my labour of love.

We aimed to assess the relationship between FVH and futile recanalisation in acute ischaemic (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion treated by mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Methods or Background: HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort includes AIS patients treated by MT after baseline MRI. FVH were assessed using a previously published four-scale classification and were consid ered poor when grade < 3 (no FVH in frontoparietal sulci). We defined futile recanalisation as a 3-month mRS > 2 despite successful reperfusion (TICI 2B - 3 ). We performed single and multiple variables logistic regressions to assess predictive factors of futile recanalisation Results or Findings: 128 patients were included. Of them 108 (84.38%) experienced successful recanalisation. Recanalisati on was futile in 39 subjects (36.11%). Bivariate analyses indicated that poorly extended FVH (FVH grade < 3) was associated with futile recanalisation (odds ratio (OR) 3.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.38; 7.31], p=0.008) as well as age, hypertension and diabetes, baseline NIHSS score, pre-stroke mRS, lack of intravenous thrombolysis, cerebral microangiopathy and microble eds. Multivariable analysis confirmed that poor FVH status was independently as sociated with futile recanalisation (OR 5.32; CI 95% [1.91; 16.79]) 5.79, 95% CI [2.13; 17.66]), basel Poorly extended FVH (Grade <3) at baseline MRI is an independent predictor of futile recanalisation.

Trimeche\u00b9, tensor imaging (DTI) markers clinically v alidated and activable in clinical situations. Since signal-dropout is a comm on artifact in DTI, limiting the use of these markers, the objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the removal of artifacted directions on provided marker s. Methods or Background: 18 patients from the MRI-coma trial (NCT00577954), surviving after cardiac arrest (CA), were examined with 3T MRI scanner including 3DT1 and DTI (50 directions) sequences. For each patient, we have generated eight altered DTI scans by randomly removing up to 40 directions (step of 5). These altered scans h ave been analysed with the brainQuant software to extract the resulting whole- brain white matter fractional anisotropy (WWM-FA) used for prediction of neurological outcome in CA survivors (Velly et al., Lancet, 2018). Percent root mean square errors (%RMSE) have been calculated between modified and r eference scans. Results or Findings: Up to 15 removed directions, our simulations show t hat %RMSE remains less than 1% between WWM-FA in reference and altered data. Up to 35 removed directions, the %RMSE grows to 5%. For 40 removed directions (among the 50 directions initially present in the reference scans), the %RMSE increases to 10.5%. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 77 Conclusion: In case of signal dropout, these results suggest th at we can accept a loss of up to 15 directions without signif icant effects on the robustness of the DTI markers evaluation. This opens the door to a larger use of DTI- derived markers, even in the presence of dropout ar tifacts. Limitations: The study has been realised on a small number of patients and only one DTI protocol was used. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Revi ewing the most- used applications of this MRI technique, focusing o n the diagnosis and monitoring of CNS tumours. Illustrating those main uses throughout images of patients in our institution. Methods or Background: Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a relatively recent MRI technique that has consolidated until being part of our hospital's protocols, especially in the monitoring of CNS tumoural lesions. Nevertheless, we can easily feel uncertainty when f acing the interpretation of this sequence, not knowing what it could provide us , or even whether it does. This poster is focused on reviewing those potential applications and helping us familiarise ourselves with this new acquaintance th at has come to stay. Results or Findings: APTw imaging is a molecular MRI technique that generates images based on the amide groups in mobil e cellular proteins and peptides and does not require exogenous contrast ag ent injection. Currently, the most-used application of APTw MRI is for the st udy of brain tumours, where sometimes standard MRI sequences (such as T2w , FLAIR and Gd-T1w) are not sufficiently tissue-specific and suffer fro m several limitations. Some of the principal uses are: in the initial diagnosis of tumours, helping us in the differential diagnosis with other intracranial non- tumoural pathologies (Fig. 1); providing us information about the grading of tumoural lesions (Fig. 2, 3, 4); as a tool to distinguish the cases of recurrent tumour s from treatment effects (Fig. 5); as an essential instrument in the evaluation of patients with impaired kidney function. Conclusion: APTw imaging is a valuable tool we can use as an ad ditional technique in the evaluation of CNS tumoural patholo gy, both in the initial diagnosis and in the monitoring.

Xu; Qingdao/CN (jnzx_gj@qq.com) Purpose: To probe the potential of several non-invasive parameters extracted from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffus ion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in evaluating the early response to radiotherapy for V X2 malignant bone tumors in rabbits. Methods or Background: 47 models which underwent IVIM and DKI before and after radiotherapy were prospectively enrolled. They were grouped into pre-treatment, good responders (GRs) and poor respo [MD] and mean kurtosis [MK]) were calculated for each subject. Correspondi ng changes of MRI parameters before and after radiotherapy in each gr oup were studied with one- way analysis of variance. The most sensitive MRI pa rameters were screened by using binary logistic regression and using recei ver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis for evaluating the diagnostic performance. Results or Findings: Dt, fp and MD increased significantly and MK decreased significantly after radiotherapy (p<0.05). The diff erences in Dt, fp and and PRs groups were statistically signi ficant (p<0.05). The combination of Dt, fp and MK had the best diagnosti c performance in identifying GRs from PRs (AUC=0.972, p<0.001). Conclusion: The combination of IVIM- and DKI-based parameters h old great potential for assessing the early response to radio therapy in rabbit VX2 malignant bone tumors. Limitations: Only treatment changes after 3 days of radiotherapy were studied, and future studies will monitor the long-t erm dynamic changes. Furthermore, ROI was outlined in single layer, and we will outline the whole tumor in the future to explore the impact on the as sessment results.

Gitto*, V. Milan/IT (sal.gitto@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate 2D and 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics-based machine learning prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in Ewing sarcoma. Methods or Background: Thirty patients were retrospectively included at tw o tertiary bone sarcoma centres. Inclusion criteria w ere: (i) biopsy-proven Ewing sarcoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy befor e surgery; (ii) preoperative MRI available; (iii) therapy response evaluated after surgery based on pathological findings. Seven patients were poor responders and 23 were good responders. On T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, manual segmentations were performed by drawing both 2D regions of interest (ROIs) along tumour borders on the slice showing the largest diameter and 3D ROIs including the whole volume. A total of 1702 3D and 958 2D features were extracted. Feature stability was assessed through s mall geometrical transformations of the ROIs mimicking multiple manu al delineations, and intraclass correlation defined fe ature stability. Feature selection included collinearity and significance analysis. Three machine learning classifiers were considered, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). To evaluate the unbiased Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 78 performance of the classifiers, a cross-validation approach was used with a hold-out partition of 80-20 (80% for training and 2 0% for test, repeated 100 times). Class balancing was performed to oversample the minority (poor responders) class in the training cohort. Results or Findings: A total of 1303 3D and 620 2D radiomic features wer e stable to geometrical transformation of the ROI. Four 2D and four 3D features were selected during dimensionality reduction. LR built upon 3D features achieved the best performance with 85% sensitivity, 87% specificity and 85% accuracy (AUC=0.9) in predicting response to chemot herapy. Conclusion: Machine learning showed very good performance in pr edicting Ewing sarcoma response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using MRI radiomic features. Limitations: Small sample size.

Jung*, A. Runkel, T. Diallo, B ronsert, P. to identify imaging parameters refle cting radiotherapy response of STS. Methods or Background: In selected patients with STS, mpMRI is performed before, during, and after completion specimen is embedded in 6.5% agarose after initial fixation in formalin. To ensure an identical alignment of histopathological sectioning and in-vivo imaging, an ex- vivo MRI is fused to the last in-vivo mpMRI. The deviating angulation of the specimen to the in-vivo location of the tumour is d etermined. The agarose- block is trimmed accordingly. A second ex-vivo MRI in a dedicated localiser is performed, which is matched to a custom-built secti oning machine. Sections are stained with hematoxylin. Immunohistochemical s taining is performed with ALDH1A1 as a radioresistance and MIB1 as a prolifer ation marker. Fusion digitised (immuno-) histopathological sections to the in-vivo mpMRI is accomplished via intermediate registration of the histopathological sections to the ex-vivo MRI. Slice-by-slice correlation of mpMR I-parameters with (immuno-) histopathology is performed. Results or Findings: Initial analyses show a strong morphological correl ation of sectioning mpMRI after neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Preliminary analyses in post- therapeutic specimens revealed increased values in the Ktrans-map in vital tumour parts, characterised by MIB1- and ALDH1A1-positive cells, compared with necrotic tumour parts. Conclusion: Our initial results show a promising approach to ob tain accurate co-registration between histopathology and MRI for STS. In a larger cohort of patients, the method established here will enable t he prospective identification and validation of in-vivo imaging-biomarkers for radiotherapy response monitoring of STS via precise molecular and cellular correlation.

Dominguez; Barcelona/ES (n.ochoa.sambrizzi@gmail.com) Purpose: We present a retrospective study in which all CT-guided bone biopsies performed at our centre in a span of 3 yea rs were reviewed in order to determine the success rate of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core biopsy techniques as individual procedures in addition to their combined diagnostic accuracy. Methods or Background: A total of 172 biopsies were performed from March 2016 to March 2019, with only 121 of the procedures meeting inclusion criteria. Clinical history, imaging studies as well as pathol ogical reports were reviewed in order to determine associated factors affecting the success rate of such techniques. The main outcome of this study was determined as a statistically significant difference between diagnostic rates of both individual procedures and their combined accuracy. As secondary outcomes, we compared diagnostic rates considering the most likely diagnosis reported on the last imaging study, as well as the composition of the lesion (lytic, mixt, or osteoblastic). Results or Findings: FNA extracted enough samples for cytological study in 96 out of the 120 procedures (success rate of 80% [ 0.73-0.87]) and core biopsy in 112 (success rate of 93% [0.88-0.97]). However, when combined, enough material was successfully obtained in 100% of patients for diagnosis either by cytology or histology. The sensitivity of FNA was 0.95 [0.91-0.99] and the specificity 0.83 [0.75-0.9]. As for biopsy, the sensitivity was 0.98 [0.95-1] and the specificity was 1. Conclusion: Associated performance of FNA and core biopsy, when approaching the diagnosis of a bone tumour, not onl y notoriously increases the success rate of the procedure and lowers the risk o f repetitive interventions, but also improves sample viability and technique sensitivity. Limitations: Incomplete patients records and pathology reports. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was recieved.

Urbanik*\u00b9, \u00b9Krak\u00f3w/PL, \u00b2Rzesz\u00f3w/PL Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess changes in magne tic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head of soldiers and to compar e the level of 1HMRS (proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) metabolites in frontal and occipital lobes between soldiers and a healthy age-matched control group. Methods or Background: Overall, 54 professional soldiers who served at least ten years and participated in international m issions were included in the study group. Mean age of the study group was 41.4\u00b14.0 years and all soldiers were male. All examinations were performed using a 1.5 Tesla MRI system. Acquired MR sequences were T1-weighted, T2-weighted and PRESS. 1HMRS volumes of interest were located symmetrically in t he right and left frontal and occipital lobes. Relative values of lipids (Lip), l actates (Lac), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and myoinositol (mI) concentrations were calculated in relation to the creatine (Cr) concentration. The me an relative concentrations of metabolites were compared between the study and the control group, separately for frontal and occipital lobes. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 79 Results or Findings: The most frequent findings in the head MRI of the soldiers were: sinusitis (38.9%), paranasal (11.1%). Brain were observed in 5.6% of soldiers. Frontal lobe mI/Cr ratio was significantly higher (p=0.005), while NAA/Cr ratio was markedly lower (p=0.001) in soldiers, in comparison to the control group. In occipital lobes , NAA/Cr ratio was statistically significantly lower (p=0.005) in military personnel than in the control group. Statistically significant differences were n ot detected for other metabolites. Conclusion: Brain MR spectroscopy of soldiers revealed neuronal loss (reduced NAA/Cr ratio in comparison to controls) and glial proliferation (increased mI/Cr ratio compared to controls). The f requency of brain ischaemic lesions was moderate. Limitations: An identified limitation was the small group size.

Methods or Background: We prospectively evaluated 45 patients suffering from unilateral lumbar radiculopathy due to L5-S1 discoradicular conflict. All patients were submitted to MRI examinations usi ng a standard spine protocol and additional DWI, DTI, and T2 mapping sequences. Relative metrics of ADC, FA, and T2 relaxation times were recorded placing ROIs at the preforaminal, intraforaminal, and post-foraminal le vel, either at the affected side and the contralateral side, used as control. A ll patients were also submitted to EMG testing, recording the spontaneous activity, voluntary activity, F-wave amplitude and latency, motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude and latency, either at the level of the t ibialis anterior and the gastrocnemius muscles. Clinical features (disease duration, pain, sensitivity, strength, osteotendinous reflexes) were also recorded. Results or Findings: Among clinical features, we found positive correlat ion of pain intensity with ADC values of the lumbar nerve roots. The presence of spontaneous activity correlated with lower ADC values of the affected lumbar nerve root. F-wave and MEP latency correlated with decreased FA values at the foraminal level and increased values at the pos t-foraminal level. The same neurophysiological measures correlated positively w ith pre-foraminal T2 mapping values and negatively with post-foraminal T 2 mapping values. Increased T2 mapping values at the foraminal level correlated with disease duration. Conclusion: Evaluation of lumbar nerve roots using advanced MRI sequences may provide useful clinical information in patients with lumbar radiculopathy, potentially indicating active axonal damage/cronicity (DWI). Limitations: An identified limitation was the limited study sample. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by Institutional IRB.

Methods or Background: In this exploratory observational study, 20 patient s with extracranial carotid artery stenosis eligible for CEA, and 20 voluntary HS matched for age and sex were prospectively included . Within one week before the CEA procedure and 12 months after the CEA procedure, all patients underwent an MRI examination for rs-fcMRI analysis. A single MRI examination for the same purpose was performed on t he control population study. A region-of-interest (ROI) based functional connectivity approach was used for analysing the differences in connectivity between patients and healthy controls, before and following CEA respectively. Parametric multivariate statistics (cluster level inferences) were adopted for analysing the differences of the global connectivity by exploiting a cluster- level p-value corrected for false discovery rate <0.05 as cluster threshold, an d p-uncorrected value <0.05 as connection threshold. Results or Findings: The ROI based functional analysis revealed that pat ients with ECAS before CEA showed two clusters of reduced interhemispheric connectivity between temporal, frontal, and parietal cerebral areas when compared to HS. No statistical significant differen ces in connectivity were found in the comparison between the study populatio n following CEA procedure and the HS. Conclusion: CEA is associated with restoration of brain network ing, particularly interhemispheric connectivity. Limitations: The exploratory nature of the study and the intrins ic huge variability in rs-fcMRI analytical approaches. Ethics committee approval: The institutional review board approved this study.

Moderator P. Asbach; imaging and clinicopatholo gical features of a rare potentially malignant epithelioid variant of r enal lpAML (E-lpAML) through comparison with other lpAML tumours. Methods or Background: A total of 20 patients with E-lpAML (Group 1) and 43 patients with lpAML (Group 2) were retrospectively included in this study. Computed tomography (CT) imaging features and clini copathological findings were recorded. Independent predictors for E-lpAML w ere identified using multivariate logistic regression and were used to c onstruct a diagnostic score for differentiation of E-lpAML from other lpAML. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 80 Results or Findings: The E-lpAML group consisted of 6 men and 14 women (median \u00b1SD: 39.45\u00b115.70 years of age, range: 16.0- 68.0 years). E-lpAML usually appeared as hyperdense mass lesions located at renal sinus (n=8, 40%) or at renal cortex regression analysis showed that the independent predictors for diagnosing E- lpAML were cystic degeneration on CT imaging and CT Hounsfield value in corticomedullary phase of enhancement. A predictive model was built with the two predictors, achieving an AUC of 93.5% (95% a specificity of 83.72% (95%CI: 69.3-93.2%). Conclusion: We identified some specific CT imaging features that could contribute to the correct diagnosis of E-lpAML, whi ch may require nephron- sparing surgery from other lpAML tumours which are benign requiring no intervention. Limitations: Firstly, this was a retrospective study and selecti ve bias was unavoidable. Secondly, the underlying pathological basis was not clear. Lastly, other imaging modality such as MRI should be consid ered. Ethics committee approval: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Rainer*, N. Garstka, N. P. A. Baltzer; Vienna/AT Purpose: To compare the diagnostic performance and kappa agr eement of the Bosniak classification with its 2019 update and the Renal cyst index (RCI) proposed by Yaohui Li in 2018 for the diagnosis of renal cystic lesions. Methods or Background: This IRB-approved retrospective study included 73 patients with cystic renal masses (cystic component >70%) who were undergoing CT of the abdomen 6 months prior to surg ery (nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy or marsupialisation). Two different rea ders (R1, R2) scored the CT studies according to the Bosniak classification and its 2019 update and the RCI. Inter-reader agreement was assessed by kappa s tatistics. Diagnostic measures (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, AUC) were compared for all cases. Results or Findings: Inter-reader agreement for the investigated classif ication systems did not differ significantly (P>0.05). The 2019 Bosniak update and the RCI present with hi gh diagnostic accuracy and inter-reader agreement. The y are thus equally applicable in clinical practice. Limitations: Retrospective study design; Patients with Bosniak I II and IV cystic lesions underwent surgery more often than patients with Bosniak I and II lesions which may bias the outcome. However, patien ts with Bosniak I and II lesions which did not undergo surgery were included if they had no progression in follow-up CT. Ethics committee approval: The study is IRB approved (ethics committee number: 2057/2017). Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Pascal A.T.

Martino*\u00b9, \u00b2Trieste/IT Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in characterising between maligna nt and benign renal lesions confirmed by the histological examination. Methods or Background: 110 patients, for a total of 118 renal masses previously identified at CT and MRI underwent CEUS. An expert radiologist evaluated morphological, qualitative and quantitati ve parameters. Results or Findings: Histological results of 118 renal masses showed 88 (75%) malignant lesions and 30 (25%) benign lesions . Among morphological features, echogenicity was the best predictor of malignancy depicting a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of 76%, 76%, 88%, and 57%, respectively. Among qualitative parameters, the most reliable parameter was the pseudo-capsule. Here, sensitivity, specificity, positive PPV, NPV were 85 %, 86%, 94% and 71%, respectively. Among quantitative parameters, the mo st reliable parameters were peak intensity (PI) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV The best combination o btained to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions was restricted to CEUS parameters (PI and AUC). Here, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV accuracy 93%, respectively. Conclusion: CEUS increases the US accuracy to discriminate betw een benign and malignant renal lesions. Limitations: The small sample size, and small percentage of beni gn tumours: only 25% of our sample. We enrolled patients with a n indication for surgery, excluding patients undergoing active surveillance. All cases were evaluated by a single reader with long experience in ultrasound. So our results may overestimate the diagnostic accuracy of this techni que.

Arita*\u00b9, (yarita@rad.med.keio.ac.jp) the utility of combined use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (CT+MRI) for evaluat ing cystic renal masses using the Bosniak classification 2019 (BC2019). Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 103 cystic renal masses from 83 consecutive patients assessed with both CT and MRI. Six readers in two groups (three radiologists and three urologists) reviewed the CT, MRI, and CT+MRI images using the BC2019. The in terobserver agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa values. The overall Bosniak category was determined by consensus in each group of readers, with Bosniak categories III/IV considered malignant. The utility of each or combination of modalities in detecting malignancy was evaluated us ing weighted generalised score statistics. Radical or partial nephrectomy was used as a reference standard. Results or Findings: The interobserver agreement for CT+MRI was substantial for both reader groups (radiologists: 0.78; urologists: 0.61), whereas that for CT alone was for radiologists, but moderate for urologists (0.77 and 0.58, respectively). The sensi tivity for detecting malignancy was significantly higher for CT+MRI than for CT alone among urologists (76.9% vs. 57.6%, p=0.03), while it did not significantly differ between CT+MRI and CT alone among radiologists (84. 0% vs. 80.0%, Conclusion: CT+MRI may be useful for diagnosing malignant cysti c renal masses using the BC2019 for non-expert readers, whereas radiologists may be able to equally accurately determine the Bosniak category using CT alone. Limitations: Firstly, according to the standard work-up of cysti c renal masses in our hospital, both CT and MRI were performed for baseline evaluation. Secondly, the study sample size was relatively smal l. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Ursprung*\u00b9, N. Priest\u00b2, F. Zaccagna\u00b2, Warren\u00b2, S. J. tt\u00b2; Purpose: The spectrum of therapeutics available for metastat ic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is expanding rapidly. Besides immune checkpoint inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) continue to play a major role. Early treatment response assessment may guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. The prospective, phase II NeoSun trial (EudraCtNo: 2005- 004602-82) aimed to detect early response to the TK I sunitinib in mRCC. Methods or Background: Patients with treatment-na\u00efve mRCC eligible for surgery underwent multi-parametric MRI before and after 12 days of preoperative sunitinib. The MRI protocol included diffusion-weighted, blood- oxygen dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Following nephrectomy, recommenced sunitinib until disease progression determined by contrast-enhanced CT. Changes in imaging parameters were assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and eff ects on survival with the log-rank test. Results or Findings: 22 patients were screened and 12 fulfilled the incl usion criteria. Following pre-surgical sunitinib, the vol ume reduced more in less necrotic tumours (-28% in solid and -17% in necroti c areas, p=0.02). However, this was not correlated with progression-f ree (PFS). The reduction in diffusivity of solid tumour (median from 1.30x1 0-3 to 1.20x10-3mm2/s, p=0.03) was significantly associated with PFS a better RECIST response in the post-surgical follow-up (p=0,031 and 0,018 r Furthermore, an increase in R2* (19 to 28s-1, p=0.001), a decrease in 0.19, p<0.001) were measured following 12 days of anti-angiogenic treatment with sunitinib. Conclusion: Physiological imaging confirmed the efficacy of the anti- angiogenic agent 12 days after initiating therapy and correlated with long-term response and PFS. Limitations: Larger studies are required to confirm the findings of this phase II clinical trial. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by UK national research ethics committee ref: 2005-004502-82. Funding for this study: Pfizer provided the study drug sunitinib.

Methods or Background: Relevant stricture (RS) in PSC patients has significant clinical and prognostic impact. However , RS definition and diagnosis remain controversial, relying upon morphology on T2-MRCP, which has a high inter-observer variability. We introduce a function-based RS definition on T1- weighted hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images of gadoxetic acid (GA)-enhanced MR cholangiography (T1-HBP-MRC). Six independent readers blinded to patient data reviewed 130 MRIs, diagnosing RS on T2 -MRCP using several guidelines. On T1-HBP-MRC images, RS was diagnosed if no GA excretion was seen in the common bile duct or the distal righ t or left hepatic duct. If liver cirrhosis was additionally present, HD was diagnosed. The three diagnostic groups from T1-HBP-MRC (non-RS=86; RS=32; HD=12) we re correlated with clinical scores, labs, splenic volume, and outcomes . Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier curves, decision-tree, and Co x regression. Results or Findings: Inter-observer agreement was excellent for non- RS/RS/HD diagnosis on ( =0.82), but poor to fair for T2-MRCP (=0.13 - 0.31). Laboratory tests and clinical scores were significantly worse in RS and HD versus non-RS patients (p<0.001). There w ere more clinical events in RS or HD than in non-RS patients (p<0.05). Non-R S/RS/HD based not (p>0.05). Multivari ate analysis found T1- HBP-MRC-derived diagnosis was an independent risk f actor for morbidity and mortality. Conclusion: T1-HBP-MRC stratifies PSC patients into non-RS/RS/H D, which Conventional T2-MRCP meas urement-based criteria cannot. Limitations: Retrospectiv; IRB-approved, (EK 2249/2016).

Fedders*, R-T. Hoffmann, R. Winzer; Dresden/DE (dieter.fedders@gmail.com) Purpose: To validate the adrenal-to-spleen ratio determined in a pilot study in portal venous CT for short-term mortality prediction in ICU patients. Methods or Background: Three hundred and seventy-one portal-venous CT scans of 203 ICU patients (127 men, age: 68.1 \u00b1 14. 4 years) were included in the retrospective analysis. ROI-based Hounsfield units of adrenal glands and spleen and their density ratio were evaluated. Matt hews correlation coefficient (MCC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) a nalysis were performed to establish a threshold for the adrenal-to-spleen rat io in relation to 72-hour mortality to classify patients as survivors or deceased. In addition, the cohort was classified using the threshold determined in a pilot study (>1.41) and the results were compared. The precision-recall curve ( PRC) was used to test the impact of adding patients at low vital risk on ROC. Statistical measures for binary classification tests as well as relative cha nce and relative risk were determined. Results or Findings: The discriminatory power of the adrenal-to-spleen r atio threshold (>1.37), determined using the current cohort yields a high degree of correct predictions regarding the threshold determined in the pilot study deviate onl y slightly. Conclusion: The adrenal-to-spleen ratio on portal-venous CT high predictive power as a reproducible image-based prog nostic marker for short- term ICU mortality. Despite different cohorts, the adrenal-to-spleen ratio varies only slightly. Therefore, it is suitable as a stabl e indicator for an extraordinarily high risk of dying within three days after imaging. Limitations: Retrospective study design.

The present study aimed to evaluate imaging features of ITPN in computed tomography (CT) and ma gnetic resonance (MR). Methods or Background: We performed monocentric retrospective analysis of 14 patients with histopathologically verified IT PN. Images were analysed independently by two radiologists, blinded to repor ts. Imaging features were compared to a matched control group consisting of 43 patients with PDAC (sex and age). Results or Findings: Histopathologic analysis showed invasive carcinoma component in all ITPN patients. CT-attenuation values of ITPN were significantly higher in arterial and venous phases (62.3\u00b114.6 HU and 68\u00b115.6 HU) than in unenhanced phase (39.2\u00b17.9 HU), compati ble with solid lesion enhancement. to PDAC, ITPN lesions had sig nificantly HU- (arterial and phases, (4.1\u00b12.0cm ITPN lesions were significant ly better circumscribed (p<0.001). Employing a multiple logistic regression analysis with forward stepwise method, HU density in the venous phase was found to be significant predictor of the histological entity of the lesions (p<0.02). Conclusion: Our study identified key imaging features for diffe rentiation of ITPN and PDAC. Isodensity or moderate hypodensity margins favor the diagnosis of ITPN over PDAC. Bein g familiar with CT- features of these rare pancreatic tumors is essenti al for radiologists to accelerate the diagnosis and narrow the differentials. Limitations: The major limitation is lack of standardisation of CT/MRI protocols due to the retrospective study design. Another limi tation is the relatively small sample size of ITPN lesions, which is comparable to previous studies on ITPN and can be explained by their rarity.

Palermo*, A. G. g. Musumeci, S. Palmucci, C. Po mara, A. Basile; Catania/IT (monica.palermo91@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the role of Post -Mortem Computed Tomography (PMCT) and different imaging post-proces sing techniques in fatal gunshot wounds. Methods or Background: Among the PMCT scans that we performed between December 2018 and September 2021 in our ins titution, we selected the cases of fatal gunshot wounds (n=15). Fourteen of them were found dead, while in one case the patient died on the operating table immediately after admission in the surgical emergency department. For each case, after the PMCT, we performed multiplanar reformations (MPR) and 3D reconstructions; we then detected entrance and exit wounds, position of bullet or bullet fragments within the body, and depicted the bullet track(s). These data were then compared to forensic autoptic findings. Results or Findings: In all cases, the radiology findings were confirmed on the autoptic study. Entrance and exit wounds were c orrectly recognised, and the bullet tracks were accurately depicted as well. Detailed images of PMCT, MPR, 3D reconstructions and autopsy are provided. Conclusion: PMCT imaging correctly established entrance/exit wo unds, positions of retained bullets and bullets trajector y prior to the forensic autopsy and provided a guide for the physical autopsy. Know ing the bullet's location before physical autopsy reduced the procedure time. Moreover, ballistic trajectory detection was of supreme significance when reconstructing the crime scene. Limitations: In all cases, the corpses were refrigerated to dela y decomposition, so that the bodies' conditions were optimal for the tomography study. In case of important post-mortem changes, it could be challenging to recognise the correct bullet track and to determine the nature of superficial wounds. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

S. Kim*, K. W. Kim, D. W. Kim; Seoul/KR (truth0508@nate.com) Purpose: To investigate whether the diagnostic performance of CTA could be improved by modifying the conventional criterion to diagnose hepatic artery occlusion (HAO) after liver transplantation (LT) in suspected patients with Doppler ultrasound (US) abnormalities. Methods or Background: One hundred thirty-four adult LT recipients with suspected HAO on Doppler US (40 HAO and 94 non-HAO according to the reference standards) were included. We evaluated abnormalities in the HA anastomosis, categorized as a cut-off of 50% stenos is at the anastomotic site and abnormalities in the distal run-off including i nvisibility or irregular, faint, and discontinuous enhancement. The sensitivity, specifi city, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the conventional (considering anastomosis site abnormal ities alone) and modified CTA criteria (requiring abnormalities in both the anastomosis site and distal run-off) for the diagnosis of HAO were calculated a nd compared using the McNemar test. Results or Findings: By using the conventional criterion to diagnose HAO , the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, modified criterion for diagnosing HAO showed signif icantly increased specificity (93.6%, 88/94) and accuracy (93.3%, ed with the criterion (p=0.001/0.002, respectively ), although the sensitivity (92.5%, 37/40) decreased slightly without statistic al significance (p=0.250). Conclusion: The modified criterion considering abnormalities in both the anastomosis site and distal run-off improved the di agnostic performance of CTA for HAO in suspected patients with Doppler US abnormalities, particularly by increasing the specificity. Limitations: Firstly, this study is a retrospective design. Seco ndly, we included only patients who showed an abnormality on Doppler US.

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust method for automated lung vessel s egmentation and morphology analysis and apply it to a large chest C T dataset. Methods or Background: In total, 509 non-enhanced chest CTs (NECTs) and 563 CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) were included. Sub-groups were patients with healthy lungs n=634) and (group_COV, n=279). Wednesday Abstract-based B 83 A lung vessel segmentation algorithm (LVSA) based o n traditional image processing was developed, validated with a point-of -interest approach, and applied to a large clinical dataset. Total blood vessel volume in lung (TBV) and the blood vessel volume percentage (BV%) of three blood vessel size types were calculated and compared between groups: small (BV5%, cross-sectional area <5mm2), medium (BV5-10%, 5-10mm2) and large (B V10%, >10mm2). I n viral pneumonia, besides an increased TBV, the main finding was a si gnificantly decreased BV5% in group_COV p<0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19 and Influenza, the blood vessel volume is redistributed from small to large vessels in the lung. Automated LSVA allows researchers and clinicians to derive imaging parameters for large amounts of CTs. This can enhance the understanding of vascular changes, particularly in infectious lung diseases. Limitations: The LVSA does not distinguish between arteries and veins and its performance in the central zone was not as good as in the middle and peripheral zone.

S. Martin*, C. ca; Frankfurt/DE (simartin@outlook.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate CT signs and patterns of patients during the course of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease (non- MAC-NTM) using a modified CT scoring system. Methods or Background: A total of 40 patients (28 men and 12 women; mean age 60 years) with non-MAC-NTM were retrospectively included in this study. We used a modified CT scoring system for pulmonary non-MAC-NTM infections to assess the disease extent and severit y during the course of disease. Additionally, the radiographic findings of immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients were compared. Results or Findings: Twelve patients (30%) received anti-NTM therapy according to ATS criteria. CT scores in patients wi th therapy showed significantly higher values (22.8 vs. 15.5; p=0.043 ). Additionally, CT scores were significantly higher in the immunocompromised patients compared to the immunocompetent ones (22.2 vs. 15.1; p=0.045). In t he subgroup of patients with NTM-therapy, CT-scores showed no significant c hanges before and after treatment (p=0.715). Conclusion: The modified CT scoring system for pulmonary non-MA C-NTM disease allows to reliably assess the disease sever ity and extent in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Limitations: Small patient population. MAC-NTM images were not investigated. Ethics committee approval: The IRB of our university hospital approved this study with a waiver for informed consent.

Ya basan Tarhan, Istanbul/TR (aysenurbuz@gmail.com) Purpose: To avoid radiation exposure in the pediatric age gr oup with suspected pneumonia, we preferred to evaluate lung parenchyma using ultrasound (US) images with the help of a larger ac oustic window than adults. Methods or Background: 60 subjects were assigned to study between March 2019 and July 2021, ten of them were removed consequently, after confirming upper respiratory tract infection or bronchiolitis. The inclusion criteria were defined as being younger than 18 years old, clinically diagnosed with pneumonia, having a chest X-ray within 24 hours, si gning an informed consent form. Unstable patients who require mechanical vent ilation were excluded. Spearman's correlation tests were used for non-parametric categorical variables. ROC curves are performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of transthoracic US and chest X-ray. Results or Findings: A total number of 50 children have participated in our study, there was a slight female predominance with a female/male ratio of 1.17. Participants' ages ranged from 2 months to 17 years and 8 months with the median age of 70.5 months (Q1: 28 & Q3: 96.75 m onths). 37 (74%) of 50 patients had consolidations on US scan and mean consolidation depth was 2.41\u00b11.21 cm (min: 0.3 cm & max: 6 cm). Air bronchogram was present in 30 of 50 cases. There was a great correlation between consolidation depth and air bronchogram sign (CC: 0.730, p: 0.000). The area un der the curve was calculated 0.928 for X-ray and 0.951 for the US. Me an shear-wave elastography values in pneumonia cases was 4.32 \u00b1 3.06 kPa. Conclusion: Chest ultrasound can be used as a beneficial tool t o diagnose and follow up of the pediatric pneumonia. Limitations: The major limitation of the study is the small samp le size.

Kiarashi, A. Adibi, C. N. De Cecco; Atlanta, GA/ US Purpose: To evaluate the inter- and intra-reader variability among experienced and in-training radiologists for the severity class ification of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-rays (CXR). Methods or Background: CXRs from patients with positive COVID-19 PCR tests were retrospectively collected from 1 January 2020 to 1 May 2020. Four degrees of severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) were defined based on consolidation and extent of lung involvement. Th e entire dataset was labeled by 6 radiologists and 2 residents, blinded to patients' clinical information. Inter-reader variability was evaluated comparing the labels of the readers among themselves and with the median of radiologists. Intra-reader variability was also evaluated. Kendal rank correlation coefficient (KRCC) was used and confusion matrices over different test-set s were calculated. Results or Findings: A total of 1208 CXR from 396 patients were included. The KRCC among readers varied between 0.66 and 0.78 , with residents showing less agreement. Comparing each radiologist to the median of the 5 other radiologists, the KRCC varies between 0.73 an d 0.79 for radiologists outside the median and 0.79 to 0.89 for those withi n the median. Among the assessment by all 6 radiologists, only 18% (220) of the CXRs were classified concordantly, and there was a maximum 1, 2 and 3 cl ass-difference for 59% (707), 21% (259), and 2% (22) CXRs, respectively. F or the 2 residents, 62% (750) CXRs were labeled concordantly. For intra-rea der variability, the KRCC between the two readings was 0.77; 883 (69%) CXRs w ere labeled with no class difference. Conclusion: Our study proved the existence of high variability among experts and in-training radiologists in assessing severity of COVID-19 based on CXRs, highlighting the importance of multi-reader dataset s for the development of AI algorithms for medical imaging.

Jamjoom; Purpose: The scientific objective of this study is to gain n ovel insight into the specific pathological mechanism observed in the vas cular system supplying the heart of COVID-19 patients as an adverse conseq uence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, i.e. the development of micro-thrombi wi thin myocardial microvascular capillary beds. A precise mechanistic understanding of the process by which this viral infection induces endot helial dysfunction, leading to inflammation, clotting and remodeling of blood vess els is still needed. To this end, we propose to use synchrotron X-ray phase-cont rast CT (X-PCI-CT) to assess the micro- to nanometer scale 3D morphology of heart tissue pathology in COVID-19 patients. Methods or Background: X-PCI-CT is an emerging technique for non- destructive 3D multiscale virtual histology, which is density-based, label-free and multiscale. 10 human autoptic tissue specimens (1 cm^3) from heart (myocardial tissue) of COVID-19 patients, fixed in formalin & embedded in paraffin, were imaged using several synchrotron X-P CI-CT imaging collect to 0.05-micron voxel-size 3D CT datasets. Results or Findings: This approach allowed the 3D visualisation of COVID - 19-driven tissue damage to myocardium (ischaemia) and the 3D localisation and characterisation of micro-thrombi within local micro-vasculature. At the highest resolutions, the individual cellular components of the interface between endothelium and micro-thrombus (endothelial cells, thrombotic cally, characterised morphologically and quantified. Conclusion: The acquired data represent unprecedented 3D charac terisations of the cellular architecture around COVID-19-driven micro-thrombi within cardiac micro-vasculature. Limitations: The obtained ultra-high resolution CTs are post-mor tem acquisitions of dissected specimens. Myocardial tis sue negative controls were not included in the study protocol. Ethics committee approval: All human samples were collected following ethical committee approval and all institutional and national regulations.

Yar*, S. Vaara, S. Holmstr\u00f6m, previously hospitalised coronavirus (COVID-19) pati ents by examining findings of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and sur veying prolonged cardiac symptoms. Methods or Background: We studied a cohort of critically ill and non-criti cally ill patients hospitalised with COVID-19 between Mar ch and December 2020 in Helsinki University Hospital. Eligible patients wer e recruited for follow-up after discharge. A control group with no history of COVID -19 was recruited for comparison. Participants were subject to symptoms q uestionnaire, clinical tests and CMR evaluation. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 st andard deviation or median (interquartile range). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results or Findings: Altogether 95 COVID-19 patients and 43 control subjects were included (males 48% vs. 56%, p=0.42). Dyspnea was alised vs. 7% in control group, p<0.01). Median time from hospitalisation to CMR acquisition was 9 months (7-10). Myocarditis-pattern scarring was equally frequent in both critical and non-critical patient groups (29% vs. 41%, p=0.2 3, compared to 12% in control group, p=0.01). When comparing patients wit h or without scarring, we found no difference in occurrence of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF,<50%), (6% vs % vs 60%, p=0.21). Conclusion: infection was frequently associated with m yocardial scarring. LV dysfunction was, however, rare and sca rring was unrelated to symptom burden. Limitations: Myocardial injury may precede COVID-19 infection an d influence the results of CMR screening.

Galea*, G. Cundari, F. Catapano, Catalano; Rome/IT (nicogale2000@yahoo.it) Purpose: To evaluate outcome in patients with acute myocardi tis and pericarditis after Sars-Cov-2 vaccine with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Methods or Background: Eleven consecutive patients (mean age 45.9+/- 17.1; 2/11 F) with clinical or bioptic diagnosis of acute myocarditis or pericarditis were prospectively enrolled, within 15 days from Sars-Cov-2 vaccination associated to serum Troponine-T-hs incr ease and acute chest pain. All patients underwent CMR within 14 days from the onset of symptoms and clinical follow-up for > 3 months; 7/11 patient s were also studied with CMR from 4 to 6 months after clinical onset. CMR protoc ol included short tau inversion recovery (STIR), late gadolinium enhancem ent (LGE), cine steady state free precession, modified locker inversi on recovery (MOLLI) and sequences. Results pericarditis, 5/11 with acute myocarditis, 1/11 wit h peri-myocarditis according to revised Lake Louise criteria. One patient was negat ive at CMR. Six/11 presented with subepicardial or mesocardial LGE, am ong them 4/11 also showed myocardial edema at STIR. Eight/11 demonstrated native T2 mapping increase. Left ventricular func tion was preserved in 9/11 patients (ejection fraction 57.3%+/-7.67%). At clinical follow-up all patients (11/11) did not show any major cardiovascular event and normal Troponine-T levels. At follow-up CMR 7/7 patients have preserve d ejection fraction (60.9%+/-5.9%) and resolution of myocardial edema or pericarditis signs. LGE was present in 6/7 and T1 mapping alterati ons in 5/7. Conclusion: CMR has an important role in the identification of myocarditis and pericarditis after Sars-CoV2 vaccination, which appeared to have a benign clinical course in short-term follow-up. Limitations: The limitations of this study are the small sample size but very rare condition, histological confirmation in only 2 patients (ethical issues), vaccine-induced causal mechanism cannot be demonstr ated but only inferred from temporal proximity.

Methods or Background: In our prospective study, we enrolled 35 patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile/ familial hypercholesterolemia. A baseline coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) wit h CT-FFRML was performed at the time of introduction of PCSK-9 inhibitor therapy. After one year a follow-up CCTA with CT-FFRML was performed and the changes in coronary hemodynamics in terms of CT-FFRML were analysed. All CCTA were performed with a 3rd generation dual source CT (Siemens, SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Results or In the baseline CCTA no hemodynamic significant stenosis (CT-FFRML<0.8) was detected. During the on e-year course of PCSK- 9 therapy with adequate decrease in serum LDL level s, no significant changes in CT-FFRML of the coronary vessels were observed. This finding could be demonstrated for proximal vessel segments (LAD; LCX ; RCA) (LCX: vs 0.81 p=0.557). Conclusion: PCSK-9 therapy does not seem to influence CT-FFRML in a patient cohort with familial hypercholesterolemia a nd/ statin thera py.

Yang*, Y. Wang, M. Lu; Beijing/CN (wenjingyang96@163.com) Purpose: (NS) is an autosomal dominant disor der characterised by distinctive facial dysmorphology, short stature and a wide spectrum of cardiac abnormalities. Our study aimed to evaluate detailed cardiac features of NS by magnetic resonance imagin g (MRI). Methods or Background: From September 2020 to August 2021, ten small children with cardiac MRI and genetically confirmed with NS were enrolled. All patients were comprehensively evaluated by MRI incl uding late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1mapping and myocardial strain. Results or Findings: Of the 10 children, 70% were females and the median age is 2.9 years ranging from 0.3-6years. PTPN11 mu tation was confirmed in seven patients followed by RAF1 and LZTR1. Pulmonar y stenosis presented in 5 patients, and affected individuals in our cohort had a high prevalence of biventricular hypertrophy and obstruction to the outflow of both ventricles with LV outflow tract obstruction identified in 80% of p atients and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 70% of patients. Chara cteristic LGE pattern, subendocardial LGE in the anterior and anterolateral wall, and elevated native T1 and extracellular volume (1287.8ms and 31.1%, re spectively) were detected by cardiac MRI. The global peak systolic r adial, circumferential, longitudinal strain (mean, 24.39%; -14.43%; -7.80%, respectively) and peak early systolic and diastolic strain rates of LV wer e all impaired in NS. Conclusion: Comprehensive evaluation of NS associated cardiac abnormalities defined a vital role of MRI in NS. Ch aracteristic LGE pattern, together with functional and morphological imaging showing PS and biventricular hypertrophy, are helpful to diagnose NS. Interstitial fibrosis confirmed by evaluated ECV and impaired myocardial deformation were also identified in NS, which may contribute to risk stra tification and prognosis in NS.

Frikha, S. Boukriba, D. CMR tool for non-invasive diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Mapping techniques have become essenti al criteria for the detection of myocardial injury through quantitative measurement of myocardial relaxation values. Our study aimed to evaluate the value of mapping techniques in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Methods or Background: Our study included 30 patients who presented clinical and biological arguments of acute myocardi tis. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis was made according to the 2018 Lake Louise criteria. MRI protocol included dynamic sequences SSFP, T2 and T1 mapping sequences realised \"MOLLI\" with synchronisation ECG in t hree short axis slices (basal, midventricular and apical), as well as late enhancement sequences and T1 post gadolinium sequences. Images were acquired on an artist general electric 1.5 Tesla MRI machine. The post-processing software used was \"Circle 42 cvi 42\". Results or Findings: Mean age was 32\u00b117 years (range 10-58), male (73 %) . All the patients showed high values of T1 and T2 above the reference values established in our centre (1110 ms for T1 and 60 ms for T2). In our study, the diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on mapping techniques in 13% of cases (4 patients), in the absence of late enhancem ent. The use of parametric maps increased the MRI sensitivity in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Conclusion: Mapping techniques increased the sensitivity of MRI in the detection of acute myocarditis. Limitations: The confirmation of our findings requires larger, l ongitudinal studies. Ethics committee approval: Our study had the approval of the ethics committee.

Eya, S. Si determine the visibility of extr acranial facial nerve and its anatomical variants in 3D spin echo T 2 sequence on a 1.5 Tesla MRI. Methods or Background: It was a descriptive cross-sectional monocentric study between October 2020 and September 2021, that included 60 patients. All patients were imaged with a \u00ab3D T2 Cube\u00bb sequence. Two radiologists independently segmented the 100 facial nerves using the 3D slicer programme and their segmentations were compared. Results or Findings: The main trunk was visible in all the patients, whi le the temporo facial branch was visible in 88% and the cervicofacial branch in 92% of the patients with a reasonable inter-observer va riability. The mean length of the segmentations was respectively 19.7mm for the m ain trunk, 11mm for the Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 86 temporo facial branch and 13.9mm for the cervicofac ial branch. In patients presenting a parotid tumour the facial branches inf erring with the tumour and the facial nerve proximal to it were visualised in all cases. The study of anatomical variants showed a trifurcation in 5% of cases, a bifurcation in 83% of the cases and a single main trunk for all the patients. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the extracranial facial ne rve and its temporofacial and cervicofacial trunks can be routi nely identified with a 3D T2 cube imaging protocol even in the presence of a par otid tumour. Extracranial facial nerve imaging with 3D T2 sequences may be of use in the pre-operative evaluation for exofacial parotidectomy to reduce the risk of facial nerve injury.

Methods or Background: A hundred and four ears with no evident otologic pathologies were recruited. The tympanic and anteromal leal portions. Four points of interest (the beginning and end of the posteromalleal and anteromalleal portions) were selected to perform distance measurements relative to the tip of the malleus manubrium. The differences in the lengt hs and distances were compared in terms of ear laterality and sex. Results or Findings: The length of the periannular portion was 2.16 mm. The beginning of the posteromalleal portion on the right side was located more laterally than on the left side (4.09 mm vs. 3.92 m m, P = 0.015), and similar for the beginning of the anteromalleal portion (2.59 mm vs. 2.45 mm, P = 0.030). The end of the posteromalleal portion and the begin ning of the anteromalleal portion were both more posteriorly located in men t han in women (0.04 mm vs. 0.35 mm, P = 0.005; 2.04 mm vs. 2.32 mm, P = 0.024) . Conclusion: The course of visualised by ultra-high-resolution CT. Right-sided ears and m ale sex are more vulnerable to iatrogenic injury during middle ear surgery. Limitations: This was a pilot study of normal ears, and no anatomical correlation was acquired as a reference. And identi fication of the tympanic segment in normal ears does not necessarily guarant ee the exact same visualisation in patients with middle ear diseases.

Waldeck*, L. S. Alizadeh, M. M\u00fcller, B. V. Beck er, K. Nestler, S. Schmidt, D. P. Overhoff; Koblenz/DE (stephanwaldeck@bundeswehr.org) Purpose: Cochlear implants (CIs) are the primary treatment m ethod in patients with profound sensorineural hearing loss. Interpret ation of postoperative imaging with conventional energy-integrating detect or computed tomography (EID-CT) following CI surgery remains challenging due to metal artifacts, but photon-counting detector (PCD-CT) is a new emerging technology with the potential to eliminate these problems. Methods or Background: This study evaluated the performance of Virtual Monoenergetic (VME) EID-CT images versus PCD-CT in CI imaging. In this cadaveric study, two temporal bone specimens with i mplanted CIs were scanned with EID-CT and PCD-CT. The images were ass essed according to visibility of interelectrode wire, size of electrod e contact and diameter of halo artifacts. Results or Findings: The visibility of interelectrode wire sections was significantly higher when reviewing PCD-CT images ( p < 0.001). The difference in diameter measurements for electrode contacts bet ween the two CT scanner modalities showed that the PCD-CT technology lead t o significantly larger diameter readings in general (p < 0.001). The large r measurements were closer to the manufacturer's specifications for the CI electrode. The size of halo artifacts surrounding the electrode contacts did not differ significantly between the two imaging modalities (p = 0.931). Conclusion: PCD-CT imaging is a promising technology for CI imaging with improved spatial resolution and better visibility o f small structures than conventional EID-CT. Limitations: The limitation is that the study is an ex- vivo stu dy. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Srinivasan*, R. Obholzer, S. Connor; London/UK Purpose: To determine the clinical presentation, location an d MRI features of spontaneous lateral temporal bone cephaloceles. Methods or Background: Spontaneous cephaloceles of the lateral temporal bone are an important and emerging clinical phenome non. Diagnosis is often challenging due to the non-specific symptoms including hearing loss and middle ear fullness. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential as patients are at risk of meningitis. Imaging can have a crucial r ole in its diagnosis. A retrospective cohort study analysed all adult pat ients with imaging or surgically confirmed spontaneous temporal bone cephaloceles 01/01/2006 to 09/02/2022. Non-spontaneous cephaloceles and were excluded. All patients with 3D T2W MR imaging of the temporal bones were included for final analysis. Data collection included demographic information, presenting signs and sympt oms, surgical history. Two head and neck radiologists analysed MRI predefi ned features. Results or Findings: Twenty-nine patients were included (M=14, F=15; mean age 57.9, age range 31-88 years). Five patients (17.2%) had bilateral defects and the cohort included a total of 34 lateral temporal bone cephaloceles. Twenty patients (58.9%) underwent surgical repair. Hearing loss (65.6%) was the most common symptom and 4 patients (13.7%) had meningitis. Nine patients (37.5%) had MRI imaging features suggestiv e of intracranial hypertension. High T2W mastoid signal was found in 30 (88%) cases. A high T2W CSF cleft, either traversing or pointing towards the defect, was identified in 31 (91.1%) cases. Conclusion: The principle clinical and MRI features of spontaneous lateral temporal bone cephaloceles are described with a view to aiding their identification. A high T2W CSF cleft related to the defect is a potentially useful diagnostic feature. Limitations: Data recording was not entirely incomplete due to t he retrospective nature of the study.

Furthermore, the goal of the study is to understand whether intralabyrinthine hemorrhage can be a cause of sudden hearing loss, w hat type of hearing loss it causes and whether its presence could be a predi ctor of hearing outcomes and response to therapy. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 87 Methods or Background: Twenty patients with sudden hearing loss were included in the study. Patients were divided according to the audiometric curve into four groups: rising, falling, pantonal and anacusis pattern. All patients underwent MRI of the ear within fifteen days from t he onset of symptoms and were treated with intratympanic corticosteroid ther apy. They underwent tonal audiometry in headphones before and after treatment . Audiological results were evaluated according to the Sigel and Furuhashi criteria. The presence or absence of intralabyrinthine hemorrhage on MRI was correlated with the type of curve and with the response to intratympanic cor ticosteroid treatment. Results or Findings: In 25% of cases intralabyrinthine hemorrhage was present at MRI, with all of the patients showing anacusis at the audiometric exam. Patients with intralabyrinthine hemorrhage have shown no audiological benefit from intratympanic corticosteroid therapy. In 80% of cases patients without hemorrhage had a complete recovery of the audiological condition. Conclusion: Intralabyrinthine hemorrhage can be considered a cause of sudden deafness, especially in severe forms present ing with anacusis and vertigo. This condition appears to be a negative pr ognostic factor for auditory recovery after intratympanic corticosteroid therapy . Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: 33 tinnitus patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at baseline and after 24 weeks of sound therapy. 26 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) individuals al so underwent two scans over a 24-week interval. For all participants, 3.0- T MRI and high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structural images were acqui red. Structural image data preprocessing was performed using the DPABISurf toolbox. Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scores were used to assess the severity of tinnitus before and after treatment. Two-way mixed-model analysis of va riance (ANOVA) and Pearson's correlation analysis were used in the statistical analysis. Student- Newman-Keuls (SNK) tests were used in the post hoc analysis. Results or Findings: Compared to HCs, patients in the tinnitus group at baseline had significantly lower sulcal depth in the left medial temporal cortex (MTC) and right somatosensory and motor cortex (SMC ). After 24 weeks of sound therapy, the tinnitus patients demonstrated s ignificantly increased sulcal depth in the left MTC and right SMC. There were no significant differences in sulcal depth between the tinnitus patients after tr eatment and the HCs. Conclusion: The remodeling of sulcal depth after sound therapy is an indicator of effective sound therapy. These brain r egions may provide meaningful neuroimaging targets for effective treat ment of tinnitus. Limitations: This study only explores the change of sulcal depth after sound therapy of tinnitus patients. We will continue to e xplore several other indicators such as cortical area, curvature in the follow-up s tudy.

H. P. Pooch*, R. G. Amsterdam/NL (e.pais.pooch@nki.nl) Purpose: Delineating prostates in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and identifying regions of interest (ROIs) is a rec urring task when planning the treatment of prostate cancer patients. ROIs are especially useful for biopsy planning to properly stratify patients. However, ma nual delineation is a very time-consuming task. We evaluate the performance of two deep learning- based segmentation methods, their generalisation to out-of-domain (OOD) data, and their performance delineating ROIs. Methods or Background: The training dataset contains 772 MRI scans of 650 patients. We also use 112 scans from five different centres for OOD validation. We compare two state-of-the-art models, nnUnet, bas ed on convolutional architectures, and nnFormer, based on the transform er architecture. We use high-scoring ROIs (UCLA score > 2) to train high-risk region segmentation models and assess their overlap with high-grading biopsy results. Results or Findings: The nnUnet and nnFormer models achieve a Dice similarity coefficient of 91.93% and 91.90% respect ively for on OOD datasets, 85.32% and 86.06% . The Dice for the ROI segmentation was 27.76% and 28.23%, respectively. W hen analysing the overlap abnormal biopsy cores ( Gleason >= 3+3) and the ROIs, the percentage of positive cores included in the ROIs was 84.85% for human-delineated, 78.86% for nnUnet, and 79.82% for nnFormer regions. Conclusion: Both models perform well for prostate segmentation, with the transformer architecture showing a slight advantage in generalisation and ROI segmentation. The Dice scores for the ROI segmentat ion were low, but considering the average sensitivity for high-scorin g ROIs to abnormal biopsies, the model-predicted ROIs are close to the human del ineation. Limitations: The publicly-released dataset only includes T2-weig hted MRI sequences, which might not provide enough informati on for ROI delineation. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Ro h\u00e9; Villepinte/FR Purpose: MRI suffers from several artifacts which often yiel d images that are of non-diagnostic quality. It can then fool automat ic diagnostic algorithms to produce wrong results. This study aims to evaluate a deep neural network designed to automatically detect and reject these i mages thereby preventing potential mistakes. Methods or Background: Studies from clinical routine were collected across different centres and continents. We used apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map as a proxy measure of diffusion MRI quality. Sl ices were individually annotated and classified as either 'GOOD' or 'BAD' whether it was of diagnostic quality or not. 1510 studies were includ ed in the training dataset and 54 studies were included in an independent test set . In the training (resp. testing) 1177 (resp. 46) had all slices of 'GOOD' quality, 255 (resp. 5) all slices of 'BAD' quality, and 78 (resp. 3) had both slices with 'GOOD' and 'BAD' quality. The network is trained on 2D slices and ou tputs a probability map for each slice. A threshold is applied to keep ('GOOD') or discard ('BAD') the slice Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 88 and ADC map is rejected if there is a certain number of consecutively low- quality slices. We evaluate the model using false p ositive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates on both the slice and the study level. Results or Findings: On the testing dataset, it demonstrated at the slic e level a balanced accuracy of 91.3% (FP rate=0.3%, FN rate=17.0%) with an AUC of 0.92. At the study level, it demonstrated a balanced accuracy of 98.9% (FP rate=2.2%, FN rate=0.0%). Conclusion: This method demonstrated high-performance detection on the unseen test dataset and could be used to automatically reject inadequate ADC maps to prevent mistakes of automatic models on non-diagnostic quality studies.

Funding for this study: Comparing radiologists, radiomics and deep learning for the assessment of renal masses on computed tomograp hy *S. Uhlig, J. Uhlig; G\u00f6ttingen/DE Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of radiologist s, radiomics and deep learning approaches for discrimination of beni gn and malignant renal masses on computed tomography (CT). Methods or Background: Patients with renal masses imaged with nephrogenic phase CT at more than 20 radiological i nstitutes were included with histopathological assessment as reference standard. Malignancy assessment of renal masses was performed with 1) radiologists: two blinded independent radiologists rated malignancy probabili ty on a 10-point scale; 2) radiomics: 159 radiomics were derived from manually segmented renal masses and used for prediction of malignancy implementing machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation (CV); 3) deep learning: a convolutional neural network (CNN library with Tensorflow b ackend) was trained on CT-slices to predict malignancy with 10-fold CV. Di agnostic performance was calculated on out-of-bag CV samples using AUC and c ompared using the Delong method. Results or Findings: A total of n=292 patients were included (median age 56.2yrs; 36.6% female) with n=234 malignant renal m asses (80.1%; median diameter 3.5cm). The diagnostic performance for dis crimination of malignant and benign renal masses was significantly higher for radiomics (AUC=0.72) and deep learning (AUC=0.79) when compared to the r adiologist (AUC=0.60; p<0.001, each). The diagnostic performance of the d eep learning approach was also significantly higher when compared to the radiomics approach (AUC=0.79 vs AUC=0.72, p<0.001). Conclusion: A deep learning approach is suitable for assessment of renal masses on CT studies acquired in a clinical routine setting, outperforming experienced radiologists and radiomics approaches. This method, therefore, has the potential to reduce overtreatment of benign renal masses identified by CT. Limitations: Limitations include the small number of benign renal masses and missing external validation dataset.

Mlynarski*, A. Marcoux, L. A. Feydy; Paris/FR (pawel.mlynarski@guerbet.com) Purpose: Bone metastases are frequent for several types of c ancers (prostate, breast, lung, kidney, thyroid) and can often be obs erved in CT scans of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (TAP). Accurate detection of suspicious bone lesions by radiologists is challenging due to the l arge size of CT TAP, read in a limited amount of time. We evaluate a deep learning model for automatic detection of several types of bone lesions. The pro blem is particularly challenging because of the variability of lesion appearances and locations. Methods or Background: A multi-centre database of 949 CT TAP from oncology departments was annotated by trained radiologists, localising all types of bone lesions except common degenerative fi ndings. On average, 11 lesions were found per scan. The database was used to train a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks. The m odel was evaluated on a set of 100 scans annotated independently by 3 radiologists. We measured the model performance on three sets of ground truth les ions: those found by all three radiologists (GT3, 185 lesions), by at least two (GT2, 341 lesions) and finally by at least one radiologist (GT1, 713 lesions). Results or Findings: The average sensitivity of the model compared to GT 3, GT2 and GT1 was respectively 87.6%, 80.3% and 65.3% . The model produced 5 false positives per scan on average. The model wa s able to detect various types of lesions (metastasis, bone island, hemangioma) located in all bones visible in CT TAP. Conclusion: The model reaches a high sensitivity, especially for lesions for which there is a high inter-reader agreement (GT3). These results suggest the interest in using deep learning to help radiologist s in detecting bone lesions in CT TAP in clinical routine. Limitations: The limitation is that no histopathology data is av ailable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Data included 3 scanner models, different acquisition protocols and 1.5 Tes la and 3.0 Tesla field strengths. The data was split into 177 patients for training, 55 patients for development-validation, 59 patients for held-out-test. Results or Findings: For biopsy assessment, the system identified patients with Gleason TATEx and PAIR-1 development-validation and held-out-test sets (114 patients). Performance on the held-out-test set (59 patients) was similar. For biopsy targeting, the system identified lesions containing csPCa in the combined PROSTATEx and PAIR-1 validation and test set (176 biparametric MRI (bpMRI) model performed similarly on the same data compared to mpMRI model. Performance compares well with radiology studies and AI literature. Conclusion: The proposed AI model shows promising preliminary r esults with open source and real-world retrospective data, at b oth 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla, suggesting it could help improve prostate cancer detection. Limitations: Initial results are based upon limited data. Future work will add more sites, scanner manufacturers, models and protocols.

Alis*, A. Arslan, Karaarslan; Istanbul/TR (drdenizalis@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate whether a commercially available deep learning (DL) software improves the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI- RADS) scoring of less-experienced radiologists using the experienced radiologist as the ground truth. Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled consecutive men who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI at 3T scanner due to suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa). Three radiologists, a radiol ogy resident and radiologists with >3 and >20 years of experience, evaluated the bi-parametric MRI scans with and without the DL. The inter-rater agreement amongst the observers was investigated and compared using the kappa statistic s. The inter-rater agreement between the standalone DL software and the experienced radiologist was also explored. Results or Findings: In all, 151 men with a mean age of 63.59 years (range, 53-80) were enrolled in the study. There was a fair agreement between the experienced radiologist and the DL software, with a kappa of 0.33. The kappa score amongst the radiologists significantly increased to 0.54 from 0.48 with the DL software (P=0.006). The pair-wise analysis r evealed no improvement between the less-experienced and experienced radiol ogists, while the PI- RADS scoring of the radiology resident with the DL software became significantly more consistent with the others. Conclusion: The commercially available DL software significantl y improves the PI-RADS scoring agreement amongst radiologists with varying levels of expertise, primarily improving the consistency of t he radiology resident compared with the less experienced and experienced radiologist. Limitations: The limitations were that the sample size was relat ively small, covering prostate MRI scans obtained with the 3T sc anner from a single tertiary center, and that we used bi-parametric MRI since the DL software used in this study does not use dynamic contrast-enhanced images.

Del G. Guido, N. Ubaldi, D. Valanzuolo , D. Pugliese, (antonella.delgaudio@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To perform a comprehensive interindividual objectiv e and subjective image quality evaluation of abdominal computed tomography (CT) images reconstructed with deep learning image reconstructi on (DLIR) and hybrid iterative reconstruction (ASiR-V). Methods or Background: Consecutive patients undergoing abdominal contrast-enhanced CT were prospectively enrolled fr om August to September 2021. Exclusion criteria were: contraindication to CT and severe motion artifacts. Thirteen datasets were reconstructed for each patient: DLIR at three and contrast-to- noise ratio (CNR) were calculated to assess object image quality. Subjective image quality was assessed with a 5-point Likert sc ale by two independent readers. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were used for statistical comparison, inter-reader agreement was calculated by means of k-statistics. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were adjusted for mul tiple comparisons by the Bonferroni correction. Results or Findings: Fifty patients were enrolled (39 male, mean age 67\u00b1 13 years). DLIR algorithm did not impact vascular attenuation compared with ASiR-V (P > 0.05). DLIR_H showed the lowest noise, comparable with ASiR-V 100% (P = 1) and significantly lower than every oth er reconstruction (P < 0.05). DLIR_H achieved the highest objective image quality , with SNR and CNR comparable with ASiR-V 100% (P < 0.05). DLIR_H also achieved the highest median overall subjective image quality (score 5; I QR: 4-5) with excellent inter- reader agreement (k = 0.81), comparable with DLIR_M and significantly higher than every ASIR-V dataset. Conclusion: DLIR significantly improves abdominal CT image qual ity compared to ASiR-V, potentially improving image rec onstructions in routine clinical practice.

Li, D. Marcus, *A. Sheeka*, J. Russell, L. Ellis , E. S. Ghaem-Maghami, A. G. Rockall; London/UK Purpose: To identify imaging signatures that predict surviva l in endometrial cancer using baseline T2 weighted MR images and to develop a clinically useful nomogram to provide a more personalised and accurate estimation of survival time. Methods or Background: 413 internal and 82 independent external retrospective patients were included. All patients underwent preoperative MRI and had final histopathology. The internal dataset had at least 3-year survival data. Imaging features were extracted and delineate d to predict survival time. A group least absolute shrinkage and selection oper ator logistic regression (LASSO) was used to select radiomics features. Stratified 10-fold cross- validation was used to calculate accuracy and deter mine the optimal model. A Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model was used to st udy the relationship between predictor variables and survival time. Internal and external validation were conducted to evaluate the integrated model for survival time prediction. Results or Findings: In total 958 radiomic and 3 clinical features were extracted from T2 sequences. After applying a bi-level LASSO method, 3 radiomic features and two clinical variables were s elected as predictors in the CPH model. Using the internal dataset, the concordance index was 0.797 for the model with age and clinical cancer grade and 0. 818 for the integrated model which includes age, cancer grade and 3 radiom ic features. Likelihood ratio test showed significant difference (P<0.05) between the two models. Based on external data, these models were still significantly different using likelihood ratio test; the concordance index was 0. 792 for the model with age and clinical cancer grade, and 0.882 for the integr ated model. Conclusion: The developed radiomic signature is a powerful predictor of survival time, outperforming current clinical cance r grade models. The integrated radiomics nomogram facilitates individualised prediction of survival. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Makowski\u00b9, *K. K. Bressem*\u00b2, S. C. Adams\u00b2; \u00b9Munich/DE, \u00b2Berlin/DE Purpose: The aims of this study were to discriminate among p rostate cancers (PCas) with Gleason scores 6, 7, and 8 on biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) of the prostate using radiomics and to evaluate the added value of image augmentation and quantitative T1 mapping. Methods or Background: 85 patients with subsequently histologically proven PCa underwent bpMRI at 3T. The PCa lesions as well as the peripheral and transition zones were segmented pixel by pixel in m ultiple slices of the 3D MRI data sets (T2w, ADC, T1 maps). To increase the size of the data set, images were augmented for contrast, brightness, noise, and perspective multiple times, effectively increasing the sample size 10-fold. Four different machine learning algorithms, including a random forest (RF) , stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), support vector machine (SVM), and k -nearest neighbour, were trained with and without features from T1 maps to differentiate among 3 different Gleason groups. Results or Findings: SVM showed the highest accuracy of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.00) for classifyin in an increase accuracy between 0.08 (SGB) and 0.48 (SVM). Removing T1 mapping features led to a decline in ac curacy for RF (-0.16) and SGB (-0.25) and a higher generalisation error. Conclusion: When data are limited, image augmentations and feat ures from quantitative T1 mapping sequences might help to achieve higher accuracy and lower generalisation error for classification among different Gleason groups in bpMRI by using radiomics. Limitations: There are several more limitations to the present w ork, the foremost being the limited number of evaluated PCa patients and lesions (n = 85) and the retrospective study design.

Fedchenko\u00b9, B. predi cting radical prostatectomy pathological features that provide a worse prognosis to prostate cancer patients, such as an unfavourable grade group (UGG) (Gleason grade 3). Methods or Background: We retrospectively identified 65 prostate cancer patients that performed radical prostatectomy in ou r centre during 2019. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and pathology data was collected, with subsequent descriptive and interferential analysis, followed by the creation of a binary logistic regression model for the prediction of UGG. To evaluate the discriminatory capacity of the model, we created a ROC curve and identified the best cut-off point. Results or Findings: Of the included patients, 53.8% had un UGG on prostatectomy. Among the patients with favourable ( FGG) and unfavourable grade group, we found statistically significant dif ferences in the imaging parameters PI-RADS category (p = .006), diameter of the highest index lesion (p = .002), restricted diffusion (p = .042), ADC va lues (p = .002), contrast enhancement (p = .008), capsular invasion (p = .036 ) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (p = .007). On regression analysi s the variables diameter of the highest index lesion, ADC value and BPH were selected as the best predictors of UGG. Our constructed model had a good discriminatory capacity (AUC = 0.86, p < 0.001), with a 90.9% sensitivity, 73.1% specificity and 82.0% accuracy for a cut-off point of 0.45. Conclusion: The combination of the highest index lesion diameter, the ADC value and the presence/absence of BPH could differe ntiate UGG from FGG with high sensitivity and accuracy. Limitations: The limitations are the population size and retrospective data collection. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval for this study was obtained.

H. Kim*, H. Park; Busan/KR (radiresi@gmail.com) Purpose: To compare the diagnostic between diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameters and mono-exponential appar ent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for determination of clinically significant c ancer (CSC, Gleason score (GS) 7) in patients with histologically proven prostate cancer (PCa). Methods or Background: 92 patients (mean age: 71.5 years, range: 47-89 years) who had been diagnosed as PCa and undergone 3T-MRI including DWI (b values, 0, 100, 1000, 2000 s/mm2) were included in this study. The DKI parameters, namely apparent diffusion for non-Gauss ian distribution (Dapp) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp), were ulated by software using mono-exponential and diffusion kurtosis models for quantitation. The measurement was performed for a whole tumour af ter segmentation, and pathologic topographic maps or systemic biopsy results served as the reference standard for segmentation. To compare the diagnostic performance of each parameter for determination of CSC, pair-wi se comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was performed. Results or Findings: The study population consisted of GS 6 0.798) for discriminating C SC from non-CSC was not significantly different from those of mono-exponent ial (0.725, Diagnostic predictive values of Kapp were estimated to a maxim um accuracy of 78%, a sensitivity of 86%, and a specificity of 47%, while those of mono-exponential ADC were 75, 81, and 53%, respectively. Conclusion: The DKI parameters showed a diagnostic performance comparable to mono-exponential ADC for determinatio n of CSC in patients with PCa. Limitations: Half of the references for tumour segmentation were based on systemic biopsy.

Raghavan*, R. H. Arafath, D. A. M. K. Logudoss; Chennai/IN (drbagyam@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of the study is to compare the sensitiv ity and specificity of 68 GA PSMA and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging in staging of high-risk prostate cancer. Methods or Background: 63 patients who have been recently diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer were included in the stud y. Inclusion criteria included biopsy-proven prostate cancer with PSA of more than 20ng/ml and Gleason score of more than seven. After obtaining informed consent all the patients underwent Ga PSMA or FDG PRT and whole-body diffusi on-weighted imaging week duration. Results or Findings: Regional nodal metastases were detected by 68 GA PSMA in 48 patients and by DWI in 45 patients. Non- regional nodal metastases were detected in 18 patients by 68GA PSMA and in 17 patients in DWI. Skeletal metastases were detected in 24 patien patient. Additionally, 68GA PSMA detected pulmonary metastasis in one patient, which was missed by DWI. Conclusion: This study suggests that whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging has sensitivity and specificity almost equal to 68G A PSMA in the detection of nodal and distant metastases in high-risk prostate cancer and can be used with multiparametric imaging of the prostate for complet e TNM staging of prostate cancers.

Yang*, Y. Yin; Nantong/CN Purpose: To develop a clinical model for predicting the numb er of axillary lymph node metastases in early breast cancer by usi ng ultrasonography (US) and pathology to avoid unnecessary axillary lymph n ode dissection. Methods or Background: From December 2011 to December 2016, 233 patients who underwent breast-wide local excision a nd axillary node dissection were included. According to the number of SLN metas tasis based on pathology, the patients were divided into two groups: limited nodal burden (0-2 metastatic LNs) and heavy nodal burden (3 metastati c LNs). Univariate logistic regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis of the US results and clinical-pathologic variables were cond ucted to find the most valuable variables for predicting the number of axi llary lymph node metastases. A nomogram was created based on these variables. Results or Findings: We found that cortical thickness ( 3 mm), suspicious ALNs and hilum status are indicators of HNB. Coeffi cient of determination (R2) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were shown good calibration and discrimination of the model. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the model ac cording to the variables of US and pathology can help select patie nts with limited nodal burden, for whom axillary lymph node dissection is unnecessary. Limitations: First, it was a single-centre retrospective study. Second, the model was only confirmed in a small sample cohort ( n= 233).

Galluzzo; Rome/IT RPS 112-2 Congenital lung abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging: the CLAM study B. Elders, C. Kersten, S. Hermelijn, P. Wielopolski Rotterdam/NL (p.ciet@erasmusmc.nl) Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop a non-contrast chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) protocol to image lung structure and function in paediatric Congenital Lung Abnormalities (CLA). A f urther aim was to compare MRI at school-age in a cohort of CLA patients to post-natal Computed Tomography (CT). Methods or Background: CT is currently the standard modality for radiological diagnosis and follow up of CLA. This t echnique is limited by the exposure to ionising-radiation and need for intravenous contrast to visualise vessels. MRI could be a safe alternative with the p otential to image lung structure and function in a single examination without the contrast enhancement. Therefore, in this study twenty-one patients with a history of CLA and a mean age of 12.8 (range 9.4-15.9) years u nderwent spirometry and chest MRI. MRI findings were compared to post-natal CT using in-house developed software that expresses lung abnormalitie s in percentage of total lung volume. A structured report for CLA was compar ed between MRI and CT. Results or Findings: MRI successfully visualised all CLA related lung abnormalities, including vascularisation, without c ontrast enhancement. On school age MRI, compared to post-natal CT, size of the CLA decreased in 41% (n=7), remained stable in 47% (n=8) and increased i n 12% (n=2). Associated lung abnormalities, such as atelectasis and disappeared in 41% stable in 24% (n=4) and increased in 6%(n=1). In 7 patients (41%), diagnoses of the CLA changed between post-natal CT and school-age MRI. The best lesion visualisation was achieved on ZTE scan, while PROPELLER and 3D MR angiography resulted in the best vessel visualisation. Conclusion: Non-contrast enhanced MRI is a feasible and safe im aging method for the long-term follow up of paediatric CLA patients. Limitations: A limitation of the study is that there was no CT c omparison at school-age. Ethics committee approval: This study was IRB approved.

Elders, H. A. W. M. (p.ciet@erasmusmc.nl) Purpose: Our aim was to develop and test a fast MRI protocol to image lung structure and function of preterm born children wit h and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at school-age, and compare MRI findings to spirometry. Methods or Background: The most common respiratory complication of extreme prematurity is BPD, but also patients born extremely preterm without BPD may show structural lung changes and impaired r espiratory outcomes, which can lead to life-long morbidity. To assess severity of disease and future risks, there is need for a safe imaging modality fo r preterm born children (with) BPD. In this study nine healthy volunteers (age 11. 6, range 8.8-12.8 years), eleven children with BPD (11.0, range 7.2-15.6) and nine preterm born children without BPD (11.1, range 10.7-12.6) underwent MRI. In-house developed software was used to score images on hypo- and hype rintense abnormalities and bronchopathy expressed as percentage total lung volume and architectural distortion, and correlated to spirometry. Fourier D ecomposition defects . Results or Findings: Children with BPD showed significantly lower spirom etry outcomes compared to premature children without BPD and healthy volunteers (all p0.01). On MRI, children with BPD had a higher percentage diseased lung (9.1, IQR 5.9-11.6%) compared to premature children without BPD (3.4, p<0.001) and healthy volunteers (0.4, IQR 0.1-0.8%, p<0.001). Percentage of diseased lung correlated and perfusion defects corresponding to hypointense regions on expiratory MRI. Conclusion: MRI is a feasible method to identify structural and functional lung damage at school-age in preterm born children with and without BPD, showing good correlation with spirometry. Therefore, MRI could play a role for safe long-term follow up of preterm and BPD children. Limitations: The following limitations were identified: single c entre study, no CT comparison.

O. Gruber, D . Prayer, G. Kasprian; Vienna/AT Purpose: To assess the feasibility of three-dimensional visualization of foetal large vessels based on multivein MR technique in combination with super- resolution post-processing in normal foetuses, and foetuses with large vessel anomalies. Methods or Background: Foetal MRI data of fifteen normal cases (mean 29+5 gestation weeks), and fifteen cases with anomalies of the large vessels (mean 28+1 GW) were included. Foetal MRI scans were performed on one 1.5 Tesla scanner (Philips Ingenia). Anomalies of the l planes using radial k-space sampling multivein technique. Super-resolut ion post-processing was performed to obtain iso-voxel data sets. Manual segmentation of large vessel structures including aorta, pulmonary arteries, lar ge veins, ductus venosus, and ductus arteriosus was performed to generate thr ee-dimensional models. Multivein images were reviewed alone and in combination with three- dimensional models for large vessel anomalies by one foetal imaging expert. Results or Findings: Super-resolution aided three-dimensional visualisat ion of foetal large vessels based on foetal MRI scans was feasible in all thirty cases. Review of orthogonal T2-weighted multivein sequences alone correctly identified 13 of 15, and, if reviewed alongside thr ee-dimensional models, 15 of 15 vessel anomalies. No vessel anomaly was found in the normal group. Conclusion: Foetal MRI-based three-dimensional visualisation of large vessels including large vessel anomalies using mult ivein and super-resolution post-processing technique is feasible. Limitations: Foetal motion artefacts may limit the applicability of super- resolution post-processing. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the IRB.

Methods or Background: 56 children between 0 and 6 months having undergone an ECG-triggered cardiac-CT over a 5-year period were included. Images were acquired at 80 kVp, 100-545 mAs using a utomatic tube current modulation, 0.28 sec tube rotation after injection of iodinated contrast medium with bolus tracking. Images were reconstructed using ASiR-V 50% (0.625mm slice thickness). Sedation was performed in children older than 3 months. Radiation doses were analysed and compared to previ ous studies. Quantitative analyses were done calculating CNR and SNR in the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. Subjective analyses were done assessing the image quality of various vascular structures. Detec tability analyses were done on a phantom with iterative and deep learning reconstructions. Results or Findings: CTDIvol and effective dose were 2.35\u00b10.54 mGy and 0.85\u00b10.22 mSv (range 0.39-1.66) respectively. CNR f aorta 36.96\u00b12.18 32.50\u00b12.02 resp ectively. SNR and 37.81\u00b12.04 respectively. Image quality was subjectively very good even for small structures. Detectability analysis provided a 30% optimisation potential thanks to deep learning image reconstructions (AUC=0.995). Conclusion: Our analysis shows a slightly higher radiation doses compared to the literature. Our current practice provides high quality images with acceptable radiation doses. There is a potential to optimise our protocol by reducing radiation doses and contrast media while maintaining a diagnostic image quality. Limitations: It is a unicentric study and our patients had subop timal arms positioning. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study has been approved by the Vaud Ethics Committee (Ref CER-VD 2021-00827). Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Rodrigues\u00b2, L. P. V. Ribeiro\u00b2, B. Vicente\u00b2, R. P. P. Almeida\u00b2; \u00b9Olh\u00e3o/PT, \u00b2Faro/PT Purpose: Over the last 20 years, there have been significant technological and technical advances in radiotherapy for breast cancer. However acute radiation- induced skin toxicity remains a side effect impacti ng the quality of life in breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to verif y if there is a relationship between the dose-surface that reaches the skin and the location of acute radio toxicity. Methods or Background: In this study we evaluated 49 patients scheduled to undergo conventional three-dimensional conformal RT after surgery (including breast conserving surgery and mastectomy with breas t reconstruction) at a private radiotherapy department. The data collectio n for this study consisted of two parts: a patient survey and data from the dosim etric planning system. First, the patients were surveyed to describe the toxicity , its symptoms, its location and the week of treatment. Then, the values of the doses of the mapped skin from each patient who was selected in the first par t were collected. Subsequently, the location was related to the doses collected from the skin in the dosimetric planning system. Results or Findings: It was found that the location of side effects in t he breast quadrants was not correlated with the mean and maxi mum dose values, and with the values of V30 and V40. There was a weak correlation of 0.200 (p<0.05) with V50. Side effects located in the fold zones were not correlated with dose and V30, V40 and V50 values. Conclusion: In this study, a relationship between the dose received by the risk organ, the skin, and the development of acute toxic ity was not observed. Limitations: Identified limitation were the sample size and the fact that only one setting was studied. Ethics committee approval: An ethics committee approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from the part icipants. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Anemoni*, I. E. Mascayano, E. Orlandi, L. S. Tampell ini; Pavia/IT Purpose: The study aimed to detect, through the processing o f data obtained from imaging techniques of diffusion weighted imagi ng (DWI-MRI) and intravoxel incoherent motion technique (IVIM-MRI), early changes in diffusion, pseudo-diffusion and perfusion properties of normal tissue in patients affected by meningioma treated with proton therapy. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 93 Methods or Background: Datasets were analysed before the start of proton therapy and at follow-up at 3, 6 and 9 months after the end of treatment. Multiparametric maps (ADC, D, D* and f) were created, and for each patient the total number of white matter voxels, the total volume included in the contours (mm3) and the average intensity of voxels with the relative standard deviation (SD, ) was calculated. Results or Findings: The results obtained concerning the mean intensity values (mm2/s) of ADC, D, D* and f show a homogeneous has a value similar to ADC, but is larger as it takes into account as a loss contribution to the signal not only perfusion but also the effect of diffusion; D* as a result of micro-perfusion in capillaries is shown to be greater than D.D* as well as f, due to the inability to acquire images at low b-values (0-50 s/mm2), where micro-perfusion makes a greater contribution to signal loss than DWI. Conclusion: In conclusion, it was observed that the ADC value obtained from DWI sequences is (0.79 x 10-3 mm2/s) in line with the expected values in the literature of neuro-oncological studies (0.319-1.05\u00d710-3 mm2/s). DWI-MRI and IVIM-MRI techniques will contribute diagnostic improvement, both in the field of research and clinics. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

M. Mets\u00e4l\u00e4*\u00b9, S. Kivistik\u00b2, L. Marmy\u00b3, J. (eija.metsala@metropolia.fi) Purpose: The purpose is to describe women's positive and less positive experiences of mammography and radiotherapy services during their breast cancer care pathway. Methods or Background: Data was collected by using open-ended online questionnaires via the websites and social media of national breast cancer patient organisations in four countries. The announcement was targeted at patients having finished their breast cancer treatments a maximum of six months before responding. Data comprising 14 women's responses was analysed by deductive thematic analysis. Results or Findings: Reported positive and less positive aspects of mammography services were associated with how painful or unpleasant women perceived the examination, patient-staff relationships and in addition as a positive aspect, having scheduled the appointment quickly. In relation to radiotherapy, both positive and negative experiences focused on the way treatment was organised and delivered and how staff treated and encountered women. In addition, as a positive aspect easy-going treatment was mentioned, and as a less positive aspect, side-effects of radiotherapy were brought up. Conclusion: Though many of the positive and less positive experiences women had in mammography and radiotherapy were the same, there were also differences. Targeted interventions at each patient contact point in the process should be planned, to improve the quality of breast cancer care. Limitations: Limitations associated with patient-reported data apply to this study. Patient reported experience data should be interpreted with caution, as reported positive experiences might neither reflect high quality care nor satisfied patients.

L. McFadden*, C. Hughes, T. Flood, A. O Neill, P. McClure; Belfast/UK (s.mcfadden@ulster.ac.uk) Purpose: Variation in training and education of therapeutic radiographers (TRs) across Europe leads to differences in roles and staff autonomy in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to gain insight into patients' perceptions of the skills and competencies of TRs to help inform undergraduate curricula across Europe. Methods or Background: Ethical permission was sought and obtained from Ulster University, Belfast, UK. An electronic survey was performed using Qualtrics\u00ae and a hard copy questionnaire was distribution to radiotherapy patients across the UK, Portugal, Malta, and Poland. Patients >18 years currently receiving, or who had received radiotherapy within the last 24 months, were included. Data analysis was performed with the aid of SPSS version 27. Results or Findings: Data collection was ongoing until December 2021. Preliminary results from the UK and Portugal show that 331 survey responses have been collected from patients who have received radiotherapy both pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority of patients felt TRs had the required competencies to listen, understand and communicate compassionately. Conflicting opinions arose over whether patients wanted staff to ask them about their life and be more aware of them 'as a person'. Conclusion: Patients perceive the TR more in terms of their personal attributes rather than their professional competencies. While they may not always remember specific details of what the TRs do with/to them, they tend to remember and focus on how TRs made them feel. Limitations: Not all European countries were involved in this study, hence, the findings may not represent the breadth of patient experiences throughout Europe. Further research could be conducted internationally.

Gullien*, A. Oslo/NO Purpose: To investigate whether reduced image quality (PGMI) or compression force (CF) might have contributed to false negative interpretations of screening-detected (SDC) and interval (IC) cancers. Methods or Background: Oslo Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (OTST) included four independent arms comparing double-reading 2D versus DBT. Exams with prospectively true positive (TP) score in all four arms were excluded (n=100). 130 women with screen-detected cancers (SDC) had at least one false-negative score. 51 women were diagnosed with interval cancer (IC). Four radiologists retrospectively classified the 2D screening mammograms of these 181 women as true negative (TN, cancer not visible), non-specific minimal sign (ns-m.s.), significant minimal sign (s-m.s.), and false negative (FN). 2D mammograms with negative score at double reading, but retrospectively classified as s-m.s. and FN were included for analysis. In a retrospective consensus-meeting three radiographers PGMI assessed image quality of CC+MLO images separately using (CF) between 10-18N, usually between 12-15N. CF was registered for all images. Results or Findings: Final material included 2D mammography for 108 women of which 23 had concordant TP, 52 had discordant scores, and 33 FN after excluding TN and ns-m.s. for DBT-only 7% with mean CF 12.5N. Conclusion: Our study did not show any significant difference in PGMI scores between concordant or discordant positives and false negatives. The overall lower PGMI scores did not obviously influence cancer detection. Compression- force for all examinations was within recommendations. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Duvnjak; Odense/DK RPS 215-3 Artificial intelligence in the evaluation of periph eral arterial disease in \u00b2Pune /IN (sudhanshutonpe@gmail.com) study evaluates the potential of deep learning algorithm for evaluation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in lower limbs with convolutional neural network (CNN). Methods or Background: Colour doppler with spectral tracing scans of lower - limbs were conducted at a tertiary hospital between May 2017 and December 2019 with equivocal findings excluded, resulting in 190 studies. A test set of 45 images was randomly selected from the initial sampl e (27 abnormal,18 normal) and was not used in the training process. A further 37 abnormal scans were randomly excluded resulting in a training set of 54 normal and 54 abnormal studies. Equal numbers were required in each group for optimal network training and these were converted to JPEG-image for mat. The initial sample was amplified 26-fold using a combination of horizontal flip, size alteration and rotation. Pre-trained Inception-v3 network was then retrained using amplified images. Training data was randomly split with 80% f or training, 10% for validation & 10% for final testing. The model was t rained over 2000 iterations with a learning rate of 0.01. The area under receiv er-operator-curve (ROC) was calculated using a web-based analysis tool. Results or Findings: Area under ROC for this CNN was 0.87, demonstrating high levels of diagnostic test accuracy. Output from CNN produces a continuous score of between 0 (abnormal) and 1 (nor mal). Setting the output score threshold to 0.395 results in a test sensitiv ity of 96.3%, specificity of 66.7%, positive and negat ive predictive-value of 92.3%. Conclusion: This proof of concept study demonstrates that high diagnostic test accuracy can be achieved in an automated analy sis of triplex images. Results obtained from this study may help vascular surgeons and radiologists to objectively evaluate patients with PAD and can be adopted across many different forms of imaging. Limitations: In this study, CNN could never outperform the radiologist since the radiologist's opinion was ground truth. Future studies could attempt to use superior ground truth by using a consensus of many experts and clinicopathological data. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Forty-six patients undergoing lower extremity arter y CTA with low dose scheme were collected. Images wer e reconstructed using ASIR-V with blending factors of 0% (AV-0), 50% (AV- 50) and 100% CT number, standard of the abdominal aorta and left popl iteal artery were measured. The degrees of quantum mottle and blurring and over all image quality were assessed using a 5-grade method. The stenosis rates were measured on the 5 reconstruction types, and their mean square errors (MSE) against that of DSA were calculated. Results or Findings: The higher the blending factor in ASIR-V or the str ength in DLIR, the lower the noise, and the higher the SN R and CNR. The SNR and CNR values of the aorta in DLIR images were signifi cantly higher than those of AV-0 and AV-50 images but lower than those of AV-10 0 images (all p<0.001). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DLIR had much better overall image quality than that of ASIR-V (p<0.001). For the stenosis measurement, the results of DLIR algorithms were closer to that of D SA (p<0.001), with DL-H having the lowest MSE compared to DSA. Conclusion: Compared with AV-50, DLIR algorithms significantly reduce image noise in low-dose lower extremity CTA, and DL-H provides the best overall image quality and highest accuracy in diagn osing arterial stenosis. Limitations: All our evaluation results were based on low-radiat ion dose scanning, and the relevant comparison in conventional dose scanning conditions requires further investigation.

Author Disclosures: Ting Ting Qu: Nothing to disclose RPS 215-6 Wang; Shanghai/CN (76384620@qq.com) Purpose: To evaluate the clinical benefit of fusion for in-situ fenestrated TEVAR. Methods or Background: with in-situ fenestration has shown potential for LSA revascularisation in recent years. Accurate localisation of perforation is the key to the procedure. 3D fusion image guidance could provide fusion of pre-procedural CTA and fluoroscopy for real-time vi sualisation of target vessel ostia and facilitate more accurate vessel localisat ion for non-complex TEVAR procedures. Thirty-four patients who underwent in-situ fenestrated TEVAR were divided into the fusion group (n=16) and control group (n=18) for this comparative study. 3D fusion of CTA and fluoroscopic image for real-time 3D guidance was used in the fusion group, while regular fluoroscopic images for guidance were used in the control group. Contrast medium volume, overall procedure time, radiation dose and fluoroscopy time were compared between the fusion group and case controls. Results or Findings: 3D fusion imaging guidance was successfully implemented in all patients in the fusion group. Ha nd-injected contrast medium volume and overall procedure time were significantl y lower in the fusion group than in the control group (p=.028 and p=.011). In addition, the fusion group showed significant reduction in time and radiation dose (DAP) for fluoroscopy compared to the control group (p=.010 and p=.004). No significant differences in total radiation dose (DAP) and total contrast medium volume were observed (p=.079 and p=.443). Conclusion: The utilisation of 3D image fusion for in-situ fene strated TEVAR was associated with a significant reduction in cont rast medium, time and radiation exposure for fluoroscopy and overall proc edure time. Limitations: The small cohort was an identified limitation of this study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the hospital.

Binder\u00b9, A. \u00b2Garching/DE (felix.hofmann@tum.de) Purpose: sparsely sampled computed tomography (CT) and U-net-based deep learning approach (U-DL) for ultra-low-dose CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods or Background: 49 CT chest scans (31 patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia; 18 controls) were employed to c alculate sparse sampling simulations with 25%, 12.5%, 6.3%, 3.1% and 1.6% of the regular dose. Streak artifacts were then removed with a U-D L using separate training (7471 slices from n = 24 patients), validation (121 3 from n = 4) and test (5712 from n = 21) datasets. To include only one slice pe r subject in the reader study a comparatively large test set was chosen. These sl ices were evaluated by four blinded, experienced radiologists regarding CO VID-19 imaging features. Image quality and diagnostic confidence was ranked using 5-point scales (5, excellent; 1, poor). Results or Findings: Readers were able to diagnose COVID-19 imaging features with high accuracy and high confidence (sc ores > 4) in sparsely sampled images with U-DL correction down to 12.5% d ose level. Image quality was consistently rated higher in U-DL images compar ed to sparsely sampled images without U-DL processing. Conclusion: The radiation dose of CT scans for detection and severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia in clinical routine can be reduced using sparse sampling CT and subsequent artifact reduction using U-DL. U-DL can be used to reliably reduce streak artifacts in ches t CT scans. Limitations: In the present study, sparsely sampled image acquis ition was simulated. Furthermore, our data set was comparativ ely small for the U-DL training. Ethics committee approval: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained prior to this study.

Methods or Background: Symptoms and findings, past medical history, laboratory, and computed tomography of 268 RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients hospitalised consecutively in inpatient fl oor between March 2020 and March 2021 were evaluated. Parenchymal lesions were segmented by using a U-Net model, a convolutional neural network architecture depending on the ResNet-34 backbone. Inflamed pulmonary volume, 18 f irst-order, 74 second-order radiomics features were calculated from obtai ned parameters: (1) by interpolation, (2) fixed bin-width of 25, (3) voxel array shift of 1024, (4) distance of 1 voxel and 13-isotropic displacement vectors at angles of 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees for second order matrices. Clinical (symptoms, history, laboratory), radiologic (volumetric, radiomics) and combined (al l parameters) logit fit models were built by Bayesian Information Criterion. Results or Findings: The final study population of 191 patients was randomly divided into the Training and Cross-validation set (n = 152, 79.6%) and the Test set (n = 39, 20.4%). Using Training and Cross- validation set, models were calibrated with 10-fold cross validation and evalua ted for overfitting. The Test set was evaluated with the final clinical, radiological and combined models and AUC was 0.736, 0.708, 0.62 and 0.76, respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients who would need ICU were best predicted with a model consisting of a combination of clinical fea tures with radiologic parameters based on automated segmentation.

Methods or Background: Proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, namely AIppo, has been tested retrospectively on a single-centre set of 542 CXRs, collected and evaluated by radiologist s for COVID-19. Positive dataset (n = 234) has been collected between March and April 2020 and is defined by RT-PCR test in the 24h, negative dataset (n = 308) has been collected before the pandemic, in 2019. For each im age, the proposed method computes COVID-19 risk indicator used for the prior itisation of the cases and the identification of urgent ones. The resulting pr ioritisation and identification have been evaluated in terms of Mean Average Precis ion (MAP) and sensitivity, estimated by cross-validation, and com pared with random prioritisation and radiologist's diagnosis performance. After installing the software into hospital RIS, preliminary comparison between local daily COVID- 19 cases and daily average of risk indicator on 291 8 CXRs in the same period was performed. Results or Findings: Significant improvements obtained for both prioriti sation and identification using the proposed method. MAP i ncreased (Mann-Whitney test p-value<;1.21e-21) from 43.79% (40%-48%) with random sorting 71.75% (63%-81%) with our method. Sensitivity of 78.23% (65%-92%) was obtained, higher than 61.1% (55%-67%) from radiologists; specificity of 64.20% (63%-66%) was observed. In the real-world setting, COVID-19 incidence curve and risk indicator decreased concur rently during the evaluation period, with a significant correlation of 0.873. Conclusion: Proposed CNN-based system effectively prioritises C XRs according to COVID-19 risk in an experimental setti ng; preliminary \"real-world\" results revealed high concordance with local pandem ic incidence. Limitations: The number of available CXR is limited (only 542 samples) and the data collection involved only one centre. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the IRB.

A. Montemezzi; Verona/IT (nicolo.cardobi@gmail.com) Purpose: To identify COVID-19 cases among different interstitial pneumonias using lung CT radiomic features. Methods or Background: CT data of 115 patients with respiratory symptoms suspected for COVID-19 disease were retrospectively analysed. Based on the results of nasopharyngeal swab, patients with interstitial pneumonias were divided in three groups: COVID-19 positive (C+), COVID-19 negative (C-) and COVID-19-like (CL). CL patients were negative to the swab test but turned out to be COVID-19 positive in a second time, hence due to a false-negative result. A fully automatic procedure, involving automatic lung contouring (convolutional neural network), radiomic features extraction (pyradiomics) and machine learning (LASSO regression) was used. A 2000-times repeated random test- train splitting and an internal cross-validation guaranteed model stability and performance reliability. Results or Findings: Using a classifier trained on C+ vs C-, the model performed with an AUC of 0.83 (ROC analysis). With this model, the median predicted probability of being COVID-positive for CL cases (0.80) was more similar to C+ (0.92) compared to C- (0.17), indicating that the CL radiomic footprint is compatible with C+. A new model, trained with the inclusion of CL into C+, showed a good performance (AUC = 0.81) on the test set. Conclusion: Whole lung CT radiomics can identify COVID-19 positive patients when based on radiological data only. The model demonstrated its capability of identifying COVID-19 positive patients in case of uncertain results from a swab test. Limitations: Although the study was performed using a 2000-times repeated random test-train splitting, the data were collected from a single institution.

Tessarin*, M. Zandehshahvar, M. van Assen, E. Muscogiuri, N. De A. Adibi; Atlanta, Purpose: To develop a two-stage transfer learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest x-rays (CXRs). Methods or Background: The dataset consists of 1208 CXRs from 396 PCR- confirmed COVID-19 patients. All images were labeled in 4 severity classes (normal, mild, moderate and severe) by 6 radiologists and 2 residents, based on extension of lung consolidations and opacifications. A two-stage transfer- learning method was used to train a VGG-16CNN. First, the CNN was trained on the RNSA pneumonia dataset (25,684 CXRs). Then, fully connected layers were added, trained on our dataset. The median of 5 radiologists was used as the ground truth. Bootstrap sampling was used to create 20 iterations of training and testing, comparing with the 6th radiologist and the 2 residents. In each trial, 800 CXRs were used for training, 100 for validation, and 308 for testing. A pruning approach was used to visualise the most important features extracted by the AI algorithm. Results or Findings: The CNN outperformed the readers in all classes, showing less variation in predictions over different test sets, compared to residents. The sensitivities of the model were 0.77, 0.75, 0.60, and 0.87, for the normal, mild, moderate, and severe classes, respectively. The miss- classification over non-adjacent classes was 0. The 6th radiologist had a sensitivity of 0.97, 0.64, 0.49, 0.61 for the 4 classes, respectively. Only in the normal class, the 6th radiologist reached a higher sensitivity, but with a higher false positive rate than the algorithm (0.33 versus 0.09). Conclusion: The study proved that a two-stage transfer-learning CNN can outperform human readers in classifying severity of COVID-19 in different patients based on CXRs. Limitations: Retrospective collection of data. Ethics committee approval: Study was approved by ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding received.

Statsenko\u00b9, *S. the effectiveness of radiomics and machine learning in predicting the pathophysiologic changes in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Methods or Background: Background: Machine learning allows for prognostication of the clinical severity of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia by combining personal risk factors, laboratory findings and medical imaging data. Methods: We enrolled a total number of 605 cases admitted to a governmental hospital from 24 February to 1 July 2020. The patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: age 18 years; inpatient admission; PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung CT available PACS. We categorised cases into 4 classes: mild 25% of pulmonary parenchymal involvement, moderate 25-50%, severe 50-75%, and critical over 75%. We used three distinct kernels (B30f, B60f, B80f) for the reconstruction of the images from which we retrieved the radiomical data. After removing redundant features, we built regression models predicting the oxygenation level, respiratory and cardiovascular functioning (SpO2, HCO3, breath and heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, anion gap, serum potassium). Results or Findings: The average accuracy (MAE/range, %) of the models based on radiomics is: 7.069\u00b14.17, on the clinical features (e.g. demographics, laboratory findings, etc.) - 6.593\u00b13.654, and in their combination - 6.454\u00b13.715. The information gain of radiomics is considerably higher in the model predicting SpO2. The least accurate prediction is observed once the images are acquired with B60f kernel, the most accurate - with B30f kernel. However, the accuracy varies insignificantly among disparate reconstruction kernels. Conclusion: Radiomics is reliable in reflecting the pathophysiological changes, depicted by the oxygenation level, and respiratory and cardiovascular functioning, in COVID-19 patients. The settings of the CT reconstruction kernels influence the predictive accuracy of the machine learning algorithms insignificantly. Limitations: Not applicable.

Petraikin*, A. Zakharov, M. Belyaev, N. Morozov; Moscow/RU (alexeypetraikin@gmail.com) Purpose: To present initial results related to the opportunistic screening for osteoporosis based on chest CT images performed by an artificial intelligence algorithm (AI). Methods or Background: The Genant-IRA, a convolutional neural network- based AI algorithm, successfully passed a qualification testing and integrated into the \"Experiment on the use of innovative technologies in the field of computer vision in the healthcare system of Moscow\". Test dataset consisted of anonymised chest CT images of 100 patients, where 50% of patients had osteoporosis vertebral fracturies (OVF). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 97 Results or Findings: Based on the test dataset, the accuracy of the AI model was ROC AUC = 0.98 at the patient level for OVF detection. The HU-based assignment of a patient to categories with or without fracture showed ROC AU = 0.877 for expert and 0.870 for the AI algorithm. HU values were converted to bone mineral density (BMD) by asynchronous calibrating with a K2HPO4 solution phantom. We analysed a set of 2.600 chest CT studies as opportunistic AI screening. AI-derived results demonstrate: 30.49% female and 19.66% male patients over 50 years old had osteoporosis, i.e. reduced BMD of less than 80 mg/ml (ACR criteria); 7.6% (male+female) had deformities of vertebrae than 25% and BMD less 80 mg/ml. Conclusion: The study presents a rationale for the use of AI algorithms in automated opportunistic screening for osteoporosis using chest CT images obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings can be used to determine the treatment and prevent possible pathological fractures. Limitations: Some limitations for separating different type of compression deformities by the AI algorithm.

S. Ahn*\u00b9, J. \u00b3Incheon/KR (johnahn92@lunit.io) Purpose: To develop and validate a COVID-19 prognosis and intervention prediction model using a multimodal approach, in a 9 multicentre cohort. Methods or Background: 1409 COVID-19 patients' initial clinical findings and CXRs were retrospectively collected from 9 centres in South Korea, between July 2020 and January 2021. The prognosis outcomes collected were ICU admission and mortality. The intervention outcomes collected were the use of oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation. A deep-learning algorithm detecting 10 common CXR abnormalities (DLAD-10) were used to inference the CXR. Using the DLAD-10 output and clinical findings, we trained and created random forest models to predict the binary outcome of prognosis and interventions, using data from 799 patients from 5 centres. The models were externally validated by 610 patients from 4 other centres. Results or Findings: For the prediction of prognostic and interventional events in the external validation set, the AUROC of the model using clinical findings and using DLAD-10 output were 0.812 (95% C.I. 0.695-0.902) and 0.751 (0.704-0.904), respectively. The AUROC of the combined model, using both clinical findings and DLAD-10 output, was significantly higher at 0.863 (0.824-0.897), than both models (p < 0.001, DeLong's test). The AUROCs for predicting O2 supplementation, mechanical ventilation, ECMO, ICU admission and mortality of the combined model were 0.825, 0.851, 0.775, 0.832 and 0.870, respectively. The most predictive DLAD-10 feature was consolidation and the order of important variables for prediction was age, dyspnoea, consolidation and fever. Conclusion: The use of both the clinical findings and AI CXR output improves the performance of a prediction model for COVID-19 patients. Limitations: We utilised data solely from Korea and similar diagnostic performance with other populations is not guaranteed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Author Disclosures: Jeonghoon Lee: Employee: Kim: detection on unsegmented chest CT scans *L. M. Florescu*, M. S. erbnescu, C. T. Streba, D. N. Florescu, R. V. Teica, R. E. Nica, I. A. Gheonea; Craiova/RO Purpose: This paper aims to combine the data from two distinct databases (a private one and a public one) in order to detect COVID-19 on unsegmented chest CT scans using deep learning and two convolutional neural networks (AlexNet and GoogLeNet). Methods or Background: Both private and public databases consisted of axial chest CT images (lung window) that illustrated COVID-19, non-COVID-19 lung infections, lung cancer, and normal lung aspect. The public dataset included 243 images from free online databases like Radiopaedia and Radiology Assistant while the private dataset included 389 images selected from the internal PACS of the Medical Imaging Department of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Craiova. Results or Findings: After training and testing each network on the same database that they were trained on, the mean accuracy and standard deviation (SD) when using AlexNet was 95.87\u00b1 0.39 on the public dataset and 94.35\u00b10.81 on the private dataset. When using GoogLeNet, the values were somewhat similar (96.12\u00b10.72 on the public database and 91.57\u00b11.64 on the private database). When using cross validation, the highest mean\u00b1SD accuracy was obtained when training AlexNet on the private dataset and testing it on the public one (79.81\u00b11.47). Conclusion: Our approach is represented by a completely independent software that is able to greatly decrease the infection rate among medical personnel and boost the daily testing capacity by rapidly providing a test result. Limitations: The size of both private and public databases is the main limiting factor of our study.

Bucher\u00b2, segmentation can quantify COVID-19 lung affection. Yet predictive deep learning models fail silently in out-of-distribution data (OOD), limiting the robustness for large scale use. We propose a novel method for OOD-detection that exploits the Mahalanobis-distance in the feature space. Methods or Background: We trained a patch-based nnU-Net for segmentation of COVID-19 lung lesions on a subset of the challenge-dataset (n = 199; training: 160; validation: 4; test-cases: 35) and evaluated on an in- house dataset (n = 50) and two further public datasets (Mosmed, Radiopedia; n = 70). All cases had known COVID-19 lung affection. For OOD-detection we (a) estimate the Gaussian distribution from training features (b) extract uncertainty masks for test images and (c) calculate subject-level uncertainty scores. We compared our approach to 6 state-of-the-art techniques which assess uncertainty by performing inference on a trained model (SOTA). Expected Segmentation Calibration Error (ESCE) was calculated as an uncertainty metric. Results or Findings: Unlike SOTA, our method did not fail silently by assigning low uncertainties to low-Dice samples. Within the uncertainty boundary defined as 95% true positive rate on the in-distribution validation set, our method displays the lowest false-positive rate 0.598). Our method distinguished all OOD-samples below the uncertainty boundary with Dice-scores less than 0.6. ESCE indicates the prediction quality without requiring manual annotations (our-method: 0.125; SOTA: 0.408-0.215).Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 98 Conclusion: Calculating the Mahalanobis-distance to features in a low- dimensional subspace is a lightweight and flexible way to signal when a model prediction should not be trusted. Our OOD-detection approach can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines without changes in model architecture or training procedure. Limitations: Future work should explore better identification of high-quality predictions. Ethics committee approval: IRB approval was obtained.

E. Van Beers; Clichy/FR RPS 201-2 Imaging features in patients with porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) - radiological evaluation guiding diagnosis Semmler, Simbrunner, a recently defined vascular liver disease resulting in portal hypertension (PH). Diagnosis is challenging and PSVD patients are often misdiagnosed as having cirrhosis. We evaluated whether radiological features can be used to distinguish between PSVD and cirrhosis. Methods or Background: Demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters of 54 patients with PSVD and 115 patients with cirrhosis with available CT/MRI scans were retrospectively evaluated. The following imaging features were analyzed: Portal tract abnormalities, splanchnic vein thrombosis, spleen size, collaterals, ascites, FNH-like lesions, changes in liver morphology and liver surface nodularity. Results or Findings: Clinical signs of PH were comparable between PSVD and cirrhosis patients, while PSVD patients were younger, had lower HVPG and liver stiffness, as well as lower MELD. Intrahepatic portal tract abnormalities (52% were significantly more common in PSVD Hypertrophy of segment I (43% vs. liver surface (19% vs. 85%; p<0.001) were more commonly observed in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with available gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (PSVD: n=25, cirrhosis: n=75), we identified a new imaging feature in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) that was very specific for patients with PSVD (termed periportal hyperintensity: 52% in patients with cirrhosis; p<0.001). Conclusion: Diagnosis of PSVD should be considered in younger patients presenting with clinical features of portal hypertension and portal tract abnormalities, splanchnic vein thrombosis and FNH-like lesions on CT/MRI. Periportal hyperintensity on HBP seems to be a very specific radiological feature of PSVD patients. Limitations: Retrospective analysis.

However, it is invasive and no varices are detected in the majority of cirrhotic patients undergoing oesophagoscopy. Hepatic elastic modulus and index (HDLI), indirectly measure hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension, may non-invasively predict presence and grade of varices. Methods or Background: Our cross-sectional study consisted of 60 consecutive consenting cirrhotic patients (diagnosed by clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic features), who underwent shear wave elastography and portal Doppler for measurement of hepatic elastic modulus and Doppler HDLI (portal vein diameter / mean velocity) respectively. Within three days of ultrasound, all subjects underwent oesophagoscopy for assessment of presence and grade (I-III) of varices. The data was statistically analysed. Results or Findings: Mean elastic modulus of subjects with varices was significantly higher (28.9 vs 12.6kPa, p<0.0001) and progressively increased with variceal grade, being highest in grade-III (51.1kPa). Likewise, mean HDLI was higher in cases with varices (0.72 vs 0.59, p<0.0001) and progressively increased with grade (grade-III 0.77). For predicting the presence of varices, maximum accuracy of shear modulus was at cut-off of and HDLI at 0.66 (66.0% and 92.3%). These parameters combined in parallel gave maximum accuracy (94.3% and 78.1%). Good interrater agreement was present of hepatic elastic modulus and Doppler HDLI is an excellent non-invasive screening modality for predicting presence and grade of oesophageal varices and may obviate the need for routine endoscopic screening in cirrhotic patients. Limitations: Limited sample box depth (8cm) and fixed small dimensions (1.5x0.5cm) led to exclusion of subjects with gross ascites, obesity and small liver size. Subjects unable to hold breath were excluded. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

H. N. Nguyen*, K. V. Le, T-B. Nguyen, T. Pham, H. Duong, L. Van Phuoc; Ho Chi Minh/VN (drtuaninr@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of endovascular intervention in the treatment of nonportal hypertension related gastrointestinal bleeding at a Vietnamese institution. Methods or Background: Case series study of patients diagnosed with nonportal hypertension related gastrointestinal bleeding and treated by endovascular intervention at a Vietnamese hospital from January 2017 to May 2020. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 99 Results or Findings: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. The mean age was 54.5 years old, the male/female ratio was 5/1. The rate of upper GI bleeding was more common than lower GI bleeding, in which up to 50% of cases the cause of GI bleeding cannot be found. Abdominal CT scan with contrast media identified the bleeding site, accounting for 73.7%. On digital subtraction angiography (DSA), pseudoaneurysms accounted for the majority with the rate of 66.7%, the most common lesion site was the gastroduodenal artery. The endovascular intervention method for haemostasis achieved good results: complete occlusion of the lesion site accounted for 91.7%. There was one (4.2%) case of partial occlusion and only one case of failure (4.2%) due to vasospasm of tortuous and tiny artery. Embolic agents were commonly coils and Histoacryl glue (NBCA). Clinical symptoms of patients improved well in most cases, accounting for 91.7%; there were only 2 (8.3%) cases of severe clinical progression due to underlying comorbidities. Conclusion: Endovascular intervention appeared to be a safe and effective method for haemostasis of patients with nonportal hypertension related gastrointestinal bleeding who had failed endoscopic therapy or who had contraindications to endoscopy. Limitations: This is a case series study in an institution with a small sample size. Only nonportal hypertension related gastrointestinal bleeding cases were studied.

Methods or Background: The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 70 consecutive patients who underwent cTACE. Laboratory parameters were assessed daily after cTACE and compared to pre-treatment values. Post-treatment radiological response was assessed using mRECIST at one month from cTACE and factors associated with treatment response (complete and objective response) were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results or Findings: The optimal cut-off points in predicting the complete response of target lesions were a 52% ALT and a 46% AST increase after cTACE compared to the pre-treatment values. By multivariate analyses, >46% AST and >52% ALT increase respectively to the pre-treatment value, significantly correlated with the objective response (p=0.03 and p=0.04, respectively) and the complete response (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively). No patients experienced liver function deterioration after cTACE, and no specific treatment was required. Conclusion: This study shows that post-treatment transient hypertransaminasaemia is an accurate predictor of complete response to superselective cTACE in clinical practice, representing a simple tool to guide the treatment strategy of HCC patients in a tailored approach. Limitations: This is a small series of patients treated with cTACE and the overall survival was not assessed.

M\u00fcller, F. indicate splenic volume as a relevant prognostic factor for patients with HCC undergoing TACE. However, manual splenic volume assessment is time-consuming and labour-intensive and therefore not feasible in clinical routine. This study implemented fully automated splenic volume assessment in CT scans using deep learning to investigate splenic volume as a risk factor for HCC patients undergoing TACE. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 327 treatment- na\u00efve patients that received initial TACE treatment at our tertiary care centre between January 2010 and November 2020. A 3D U-Net (convolutional neural network for segmentation) was trained and validated on the first 100 consecutive cases. Subsequently, the spleen was automatically segmented for the remaining 227 patients, the quality of the segmentation visually assessed by two radiologists and splenic volume correlated with various clinical and image-derived risk factors as well as with overall survival. Results or Findings: The S\u00f8rensen-Dice-Score yielded excellent values of 0.96 for training and 0.96 for validation in preliminary results. In the remaining 227 patients, the segmentation was visually approved in 221 out of 227 patients; in 6 patients (3%) the segmentation failed and had to be manually corrected. Regarding survival, compared to axial and craniocaudal splenic size, only a significant cut-off for splenic volume could be derived: patients with a splenic volume >384ml had significantly impaired survival (10.8 months vs 18.8 months, p=0.023). Conclusion: Automated splenic volume assessment is feasible in HCC patients undergoing TACE. Compared to two-dimensional estimates of splenic size, actual splenic volume is superior in survival prediction. Thus, it could function as an additional risk factor available without extra work with every diagnostic CT during initial and follow-up imaging.

Milan/IT To evaluate correlation between hepatic and splenic volumes and portal venous pressure in cirrhotic patients, and the use of these volumes to predict portal venous pressure increase. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, cirrhotic patients who underwent TIPS (2014-2019) were included. Hepatic and splenic volumes were calculated by CT images. Weight, height, presence of ascites, and direct portal venous pressure (dPVP), registered via catheterisation during TIPS, were assessed. Theoretical hepatic volume was determined ((1267,28*weight*height/3600) - 794,41); +3.8 of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (eHVPG). dPVP was compared to hepatic volume, splenic volume, real/theoretical liver volume rate, and the eHVPG. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t-test and mixed two-way ICC for absolute agreement. Results or Findings: 81 patients were included. Mean dPVP \u00b1 standard deviation was 18.2 \u00b1 5.2 mmHg, mean liver volume 1374 \u00b1 446 26,6 \u00b1 3.2 mmHg; mean real/theoretical liver volume rate was 88 \u00b1 25%. No statistically significant linear correlation was found between dPVP and hepatic volume (p=0.570); dPVP showed a positive linear correlation with splenic volume (p=0.05), real/theoretical liver volume rate (p=0.027), and eHVPG (p=0.009), although with extreme variability not explained by the model (R2=0.061, R2=0.096, and R2=0.078, respectively), the latter with a poor reliability by absolute agreement (ICC=0.382, p=0.09). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 100 Conclusion: Although portal venous pressure showed a direct correlation with splenic volume, real/theoretical liver volume rate and estimated HVPG calculated from hepatosplenic volumes, these measures appeared poorly reliable as a non-invasive surrogate index of portal pressure in cirrhotic patients candidate to TIPS. Limitations: Likelihood of publication bias was identified as a limiting factor. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee.

Teerasamit*; Bangkok/TH (Mojiamp@gmail.com) Purpose: To create simplified criteria for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk liver using contrast-enhanced MRI liver. Methods or Background: The retrospective study was performed between January 2008 and December 2020. A total of 182 hepatic lesions (HCCs or non-HCCs) were included, which had pathological confirmation (114 lesions) or stable size of benign lesions for 2 years (68 lesions). Nine MRI parameters (including arterial phase hyperenhancement [APHE], washout, enhancing capsule, mild-moderate T2W hyperintensity, non-targetoid appearance and fat in lesion) were reviewed by two abdominal radiologists. All parameters were analysed by logistic regression for predictors of HCC. The statistically significant parameters were summarised and backward stepwise likelihood ratio analysis was applied for creating the simplified HCC-MRI score. The cut-point score was calculated. ROC curve analyses were used for assessment of diagnostic performance of this score for diagnosis of HCC. The interreader agreement was assessed. Results or Findings: Of the 182 hepatic lesions, 92 lesions (50.5%) were HCC and 90 lesions (49.5%) were non-HCC. The four parameters including APHE, enhancing capsule, transitional phase hypointensity and mild-moderate T2W hyperintensity, were significant predictors of HCC on multivariate analyses. The final simplified HCC-MRI score was described as 1.5 points for APHE, 1 point for enhancing capsule, 2 points for transitional phase hypointensity and 1.5 points for T2W hyperintensity. The cut-point score was 4 (suggested HCC, if more than 4). Overall sensitivity of this MRI-HCC score was 84.71%, specificity 91.0%, PPV (0.909). Conclusion: A HCC-MRI score including four parameters with weighting factor and cut-point score offers a simplified method, with good diagnostic performance, for the diagnosis of HCC in high-risk liver. Limitations: The small sample size was an identified limitation. Ethics committee approval: An ethics committee approved this study. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Zerunian, A. Laghi; Rome/IT Purpose: To evaluate the reliability of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with NASH. Methods or Background: From March to September 2021 twenty patients who met diagnostic criteria for NASH and twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled and underwent quantitative 1.5T MRI examination of the liver. Acquisition protocol comprised magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Image post-processing was performed with a dedicated workstation. Quantitative image analysis was performed by a radiologist with 15 years of experience in abdominal MRI; liver stiffness (kPa) and grade of steatosis (%) were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using a dedicated software and a p value <0.05 was considered significant. Results or Findings: Liver stiffness was higher in patients with NASH than in healthy volunteers (10.8\u00b16.42 kPa vs 4.75\u00b11.44 kPa; p=0.0002). PDFF was higher in patients with NASH than in healthy volunteers (2.52\u00b10.56% vs 1.87\u00b10.26%; p=0.0020). Steatosis was present in 100% of patients in the NASH group (15% in healthy volunteers); NASH group showed elevated liver stiffness in 80% of patients (0% in healthy volunteers). Quantitative MRI performance for liver stiffness and PDFF detection showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.915 (sensitivity 100%; specificity 75%) and 0.843 (sensitivity 60%; specificity 90%), respectively. The whole time examination was 72 seconds (55 seconds for MRE and 17 seconds for PDFF). Conclusion: Quantitative MRI techniques are reliable in the study of NASH. Furthermore, being very fast and risk-free protocols, these technique could also be used as a screening method in populations at risk of developing diffuse liver disease. Limitations: The small population sample and lack of multivariate clinical- radiological analysis were identified limitations.

Methods or Background: HCC patients who underwent tumour two- dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) examination before resection from February 2019 to January 2020 were enrolled in this prospective study. The presence of stiff rim sign and quantitative stiffness measurements were reviewed. Interobserver and intraobserver variability of stiff rim sign was assessed. The correlation between the stiff rim sign and pathological characteristics was analysed. Multivariate analysis was performed to examine clinical and radiological factors influencing the appearance of stiff rim sign. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the relationship between progression-free survival (PFS) and quantitative/qualitative characteristics of the stiff rim sign. Results or Findings: The stiff rim sign on 2D-SWE was present in 44.7% of HCC lesions with Emax of the stiff rim of 66.5 (53.8-84.8) kPa. Interobserver agreement and intraobserver agreement for the stiff rim sign were substantial (=0.772) and almost perfect ( =0.895), respectively. Pathologically, the stiff rim sign was associated with capsule status, capsule integrity, capsule thickness, proportion of peritumoral fibrous tissue and peritumoral fibrous arrangement. Multivariate analysis showed that tumour size was an independent clinical predictor for the appearance of stiff rim sign (OR 1.213, p=0.012). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed PFS was significantly poorer in the high stiff rim Emax group than in the low stiff rim Emax group (p=0.025). Conclusion: The stiff rim sign in HCC was mainly correlated with peritumoral fibrous tissue status. The Emax of the stiff rim is a prognostic indicator for HCC. Limitations: Multi-centre validation is needed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the ethics committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University.

Wan*, X. Zhang, B. Song; Chengdu/CN Purpose: We aimed assess whether quantitative computed tomography (CT)-derived parameters can noninvasively predict the severity (EV) and the risk of oesophageal variceal bleeding (EVB). Methods or Background: A total of 136 endoscopically confirmed EV patients were included in this retrospective study and were divided into a conspicuous (mild-to-moderate EV, n=30) and a non-conspicuous EV volume (SV), splenic vein (SNV), portal vein (PV), diameter of left gastric vein (DLGV), and the opening type of LGV were measured Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 101 independently using 3D-slicer. Univariate and multi variate logistic analyses were used to determine the independent factors and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were produced to evalua te the diagnostic performance. Results or Findings: The difference in EVG, EVD, grou ps was statistically significant (p<0.05), corresponding area under the curves (AUCs) for predicting severe EV were 0.72, 0.772, 0.704, 0.768, 0. 95%CI 1.008-1.050) were found to be independent predictive factors. However, there was no significant difference of the included indices betw een the bleeding and non- bleeding group (p>0.05). Conclusion: CT can be used as a noninvasive method to predict t he severity of EV, which may reduce the invasive screening of e ndoscopy. Limitations: First, some interobserver disagreements may exist due to the subjective nature of endoscopic grading systems. Ad ditionally, given the retrospective nature of the study, some interval pr ogression of the disease cannot be managed.

Al-Bourini, A. Uhlig, J. Balz, L. Heitz, L. Troj Uhlig*; Purpose: To assess the role of MRI T1 mapping of the prostat e to distinguish normal prostatic tissues and prostatic cancer (PCA) . Methods or Background: Patients with suspected PCA were prospectively enrolled between 10/2021-02/2022. Patients received standardised mpMRI on a 3T using sin gle-shot recovery fast low-angle shot MRI with radial unders ampling and iterative reconstruction. Segmentations were performed on T1 maps for prostate lesions and representative areas of the prostatic p eripheral zone (PZ), transitional zone (TZ) and benign prostate hyperplasia nodules (BPN). Results or Findings: A total of n=71 patients were included (median age 67.5y). T1 mapping was successfully performed without artefacts at an average time of 2 min in all patients. PIRADS 3+ le sions were identified in n=44 patients, of which n=28 received subsequent ul trasound-MRI prostate biopsy at time of this preliminary analysis (n=14 P CA histology). Among histologically assessed patients, the median rel was 1586ms(BPH), 1730ms(PZ), 1487ms(TZ) overall difference p<0.001). T1 relaxation time correlat ed with the Gleason score of the histologically assessed prostatic lesion, with shorter median relaxation time in Gleason 7b (1250ms) and Gleason 7a PCA (1401ms) versus Gleason ology (1470ms). Conclusion: The presented MRI T1 mapping technique robustly per forms at a short examination time, demonstrating variable T1 r elaxation times depending on prostatic zones. T1 relaxation was shortened in radiologically suspicious lesions and correlated with PCA Gleason score. T1 m apping could therefore aid in the discrimination of clinically significant vs. non-significant PCA. Limitations: The small patient cohort and short follow-up time l imit the findings of this preliminary analysis.

The PRECISE criteria for serial MRI of the prostate during acti ve surveillance recommend the use of a dedicated scoring system (PRECISE score) t o assess the likelihood of significant radiological change. We report the effect of an interactive teaching course on prostate MRI during active surveillance i n assessing radiological change on serial imaging. Methods or Background: Eleven radiology fellows and registrars with different experience in prostate MRI reading partic ipated in a dedicated teaching course where they initially evaluated radi ological change (based on their previous training in prostate MRI reading) in dependently in fifteen patients on active surveillance (baseline and follow-up scan ), and then attended a lecture on the PRECISE score. The initial scans wer e reviewed for teaching purposes and afterwards the participants re-assessed the degree of radiological change on a new set of images (from fi fteen different patients) applying the PRECISE score. ROC analysis was perfor med. Confirmatory biopsies and PRECISE scores given in consensus by t wo radiologists (involved in the original draft of the PRECISE scor e) were the reference standard. Results or Findings: There was a significant improvement in the average area under the curve (AUC) for the assessment of ra diological change from baseline 0.84]). This was an improvement of 0.1 7 (p = 0.004). Conclusion: A dedicated teaching course on the use of the PRECI SE score improves the accuracy in the assessment of radiological change on serial prostate MRI. Limitations: Small population.

A. of time-series radiomi cs (TSR) for the analysis of longitudinal MRI-derived radiological c hanges in prostate cancer (PCa) patients with and without histopathological p rogression on active surveillance (AS) and compare its diagnostic perfor mance against conventional baseline (BR) and delta-radiomics (DR) models. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 102 Methods or Background: This study included AS patients with biopsy-proven PCa with a minimum follow-up of 2 years and at leas t one repeat targeted biopsy. Histopathological progression was defined as grade-group progression from diagnostic biopsy. The control group included patients with both radiologically and histopathologically stable disease. T2WI- and ADC-derived radiomic features were computed using all available MRI scans performed on the same 3T system using the same protocol. Predict ive modelling was performed using the k-nearest neighbours for BR, parenclitic networks for DR, and recurrent neural networks for TSR. Areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) for differentiating between progressors and non-progres sors were calculated and compared using DeLong's test. Results or Findings: The study included 76 patients (29 progressors and 47 non-progressors) with a median follow-up of 42 mont hs. 31, 25, 16, and 4 patients had three, four, five, and six consecutive MRI scans available for TSR analysis, respectively. The AUC for TSR (0.86) was significantly higher than AUCs of 0.62 and 0.75 for BR and DR, respectively ( p < 0.001 and 0.046, respectively). Conclusion: TSR presents a novel approach to analysing longitudinal MRI- derived radiomics data, showing superior performanc e to conventional radiomic techniques for predicting PCa progression on AS. These preliminary results will be supplemented by time-series analysi s of PSA density that may further improve TSR performance. Limitations: Small sample size; preliminary findings.

Methods or Background: Between May 2017 and April 2020, a total of 385 patients undergoing target cognitive or image-fusion biopsy of PI-RADS 3-5 index lesions and radical prostatectomies (RP) were 2:1 matched with a propensity score using multiple variables and divided into 1-4 core (n=242) and 5-6 core (n=143) groups, which were obtained with m ultiple logistic regression with restricted cubic spline curve. Target cores of 1-3 and 4-6 were sampled from central and peripheral areas, respectively. Pa thologic outcomes and target cores were retrospectively assessed to analy se the GS difference or changes between biopsy and RP with Wilcoxon signed- rank test. Results or Findings: The median of target cores was 3 and 6 in the 1-4 c ore and 5-6 core groups, respectively (p<0.001). Restri cted cubic spline curve showed that GS upgrade was significantly reduced fr om the 5th core and that there was no difference between 5th and 6th cores. Among the matched patients, 35.4% (136/385; 95% confidence interval, 0.305-0.403) had a GS upgrade after RP. The GS upgrades in the 1-4 core and 5-6 core groups was no stati stical difference between the matched groups in terms of RP GS (p=0.092), the 5-6 core group had significantly higher biopsy GS (p=0.006) and lower GS change from biopsy to RP (p=0.027). Conclusion: Five or more target cores sampled from both the per iphery and centre of an index tumour contribute to reducing GS upgrade. Limitations: Retrospective design.

Author Disclosures: Byung Kwan Park: Nothing to disclose RPS 207-6 Vector prostate biopsy: a novel electro-magnetic bi opsy technique for mpMRI/US fusion transperineal prostate biopsies und er local anaesthesia \u00b2Rome/IT Purpose: Prostate MRI performed early in the assessment for suspected prostate cancer is well accepted, and MRI-based tar geting has revolutionised prostate biopsies. MRI/US fusion transperineal pros tate biopsy (TPB) with template grid needle guidance using the BiopSee\u00ae sy stem achieves high detection rates but requires general anaesthesia. T his study introduces a novel technique, utilising EM needle tracking to replace the template grid to perform MRI/US fusion TPB under local anaesthesia (LA). It maintains optimal image fusion by minimal prostate deformation and alignment of the trajectory of the biopsy needle with the target through two perineal access points. Methods or Background: Using BiopSee\u00ae fusion software (Medcom, Germany), electro-magnetic (EM) tracking technology (Vtrax, Civco) and transrectal US (Fujifilm, Japan), 39 patients with MRI lesions and various indications for prostate biopsy underwent the proce dure. The stepper-mounted rectal US probe obtained prostate images which were fused with the MRI. Local anaesthetic was applied into two defined peri neal tracks, and a needle sheath (BARD) with EM sensor was inserted. Through the sheath, the biopsy needle is directed precisely to the pre-contoured l esion. Targeted and systematic biopsies were taken. Cancer detection (all; grade group GG=>2), side-effects and patient experience measures were r ecorded. Results or Findings: Of 26 returned questionnaires, 21 reported no or minimal discomfort and no episodes of retention or significant infection have been reported. Detection in PI-RADS 3 lesions is 66.7% ( GG2 67.6%). Conclusion: novel vector technique optimises the use of MRI /US fusion to achieve high targeting accuracy. It provides a feas ible and tolerable procedure for fusion TPB under LA and has demonstrated negligible retention and infection rates. Limitations: Single-centre analysis with a limited patient number. Ethics committee approval: Service evaluation registered with GenesisCare UK Medical director.

Methods or Background: This retrospective study describes a comparative analysis of treatment plans of 40 patients with ear ly-stage prostate cancer treated with ionising radiation. 22 patients were t reated with pencil-beam scanning proton therapy and 18 patients were treate d with robotic SBRT. In each treatment plan, the following organs at risk w ere assessed: the urinary bladder wall, penile bulb, rectum and femoral heads . All patients were treated with 35 - 40 Gy in 5 fractions. All patients who re ceived proton therapy had their target volume immobilised with endorectal bal loon. Results or Findings: The greatest differences were in D66%, which for th e rectum was 1.22 Gy and 12.9 Gy (p<0.01) for proton and photon irradiation, respectively, and 0.24 Gy and 7.77 Gy (p<0.01) for the bladder. Rectal V20Gy volume was significantly vs 25.81 \u00b110.69 cc (p<0.01), due to the proximity of the rec tal intestinal wall to the prostate because of the rectal balloon. The maximum doses for the rectum, penile bulb and bladder wall did not differ signifi cantly (p>0.05). Conclusion: Although there is no significant difference in maxi mum doses in organs at risk, we found that using proton therapy reduces the volume of healthy tissue covered by low and intermediate doses, which may be important in terms of the favorable prognosis for this category of patients.

Methods or Background: The compared using a PI- RADS score of 4 as the positive threshold and prostate biopsy as the reference standards. Results or Findings: A total of 425 PCa cases were included in the study , including 203 cases in the tzPCa group and 222 in t he non-tzPCa group, 146 in the csPCa group and 279 in the non-csPCa group. The AUCs of T2WI DWI in diagnosing tzPCa and csPCa were y greater than those of T2WIDCE and T2WI DWIDCE (all P < 0.05), had similar AUCs in tzPCa (all > 0.05). T2WI DWIDCE in diagnosing tzPCa and csPCa were significantly greater than that of T2WI DWI, while the converse were true of its specificity (all P < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of T2WI DCE and T2WIDWIDCE in diagnosing tzPCa and csPCa had no significant differences (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: T2WIDWI is the preferred scoring sequence of PI-RADS v2.1 for prostate transitional-zone lesion. The added in formation gained by DCE may have a meaningful impact on tzPCa and csPCa det ection and surveillance.

Jeon; S eoul/KR (chankyokim@skku.edu) shear -wave elastography (2D-SWE) in detecting prostate cancer (PCa). Methods or Background: In this prospective study, all 38 patients with suspected PCa underwent 2D-SWE, followed by a standard systemic 12-core biopsy with and without a targeted biopsy. Tissue s tiffness (kPa) on SWE was measured in the targeted lesion and 12 regions of s ystemic 12-core biopsy. For predicting PCa, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed. The associations between tumour stif fness and clinical parameters were evaluated. For measuring tissue sti ffness, interobserver reliability was evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results or Findings: PCa was found in 77 regions of 17 patients. In regi on- based and patient-based analyses, the mean tissue s tiffness of tumours were 47.39 kPa and 68.97 kPa, respectively and were significantly higher than those of benign prostate tissue (29.71 kPa and 30.95 kPa) (P< 0.001). For predicting PCa, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of tissue s tiffness was 0.703 in analysis, the AUC of tissue stiffness was 0.840, followed by PSA density (AUC = 0.717). Tumour tissue stiffness demo nstrated significantly weak positive correlation with the Gleason score (c orrelation coefficient = 0.297, P = 0.009). ICC in reproducible tool, 2D-SWE appears to be useful for the prediction of PCa. A larger further study awaits th e validation.

Selected fellows have the opportunity to deliver lectures and conduct interactive workshops at universities of their choice. The prostate imaging quality (PI-QUAL) score is a new m etric to evaluate the diagnostic quality of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate. We report the results of a prostate MRI q uality training course (under the umbrella of the Nicholas Gourtsoyiannis Teaching Fellowship) on the participant's ability to apply PI-QUAL. Methods or Background: Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists, physicists, and computer scientists) of varying exp erience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI, all assessed the image quality of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then, they att ended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop on MRI quality assessment using the PI- QUAL score. Five scans assessed by the participants were evaluated in the workshop using the PI-QUAL score for teaching purposes. After the course, the same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten scans applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The reference standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by one of the developers of PI-QUAL. Results or Findings: There was a significant improvement in average area under the curve for the evaluation of image quality from baseline (0.59 [confidence intervals: (p < 0.001). Conclusion: A teaching course (dedicated lecture + hands-on wor kshop) on PI-QUAL significantly improved the application of this scoring system to assess the quality of prostate MRI examinations. Limitations: The limitation is the small number of participants and MR examinations. Ethics committee approval: An approval by an ethics committee is not required.

We demonstrate that this energy-resolving capability helps to accomplish not just spectral cl inical imaging tasks but also helps to reduce beam-hardening artefacts for general imaging. Methods or Background: We imaged a challenging beam-hardening phantom consisting of aluminium rods embedded in a water-equivalent background that mimics a human head. The phantom was additionally i maged using a commercial CT system with an energy-integrating det ector (EID) in both kV (DECT) modes. Scan sett ings ensured dose- equivalent acquisitions for all modes. Monoenergeti c images were reconstructed from 70-140keV. A derived artefact in dex (AIdx) metric quantified beam-hardening suppression, defined as t he absolute difference in Hounsfield unit (HU) measured in regions of interes t (ROIs) located inside the artefact-affected regions and three ROIs located in adjacent artefact-free background material. An AIdx approaching zero indic ates improved beam- hardening suppression via increased similarity in C T number between artefact- affected and artefact-free regions. Results or Findings: Beam-hardening in Si-PCCT reconstructed images at 70keV is 80% lower than that of equivalent EID-DECT images (AIdx of 1.7HU vs. 8.0HU), while the AIdx of EID-120kVp images is 24.2HU, indicating a 5- and 16-fold improvement in artefact suppression for Si-PCCT relative to EID- DECT and EID-120kVp, respectively. Across all monoenergetic images, AIdx for Si-PCCT is between 55-80% of the equivalent AIdx for today's state-of-the- art EID-DECT, particularly at lower energies. Recon structed images visually attest to comparatively improved beam-hardening suppression. Conclusion: By leveraging its energy resolution capabilities, a prototype edge- on Si-PCCT system natively enhances suppression of beam-hardening artefacts, potentially illuminating previously occl uded pathologies and structures and leading to improved diagnostic confi dence and tissue quantification.

PCDs offer improved tiss ue contrast and lower noise, which make them the prime candidate for low-dose applications such as low- dose lung cancer screening. We assessed non-spectral image quality by assessing PCD-CT images created from all detected photons with energies above 25 keV. Methods or Background: We scanned a lung phantom (COPDGENE2) with seven calibrated inserts to simulate healthy lung t issue, ground-glass opacifications and emphysema. The PCD-CT scan tube voltage, with three tube current-time values at 50, 100, and 200 mAs; 32x0.6 collimation; and 1-second rotation time. Images were reconstructed with filtered-back projection algorithm with body and sharp kernels. We scanned the same phantom on a commercial energy-int egrating detector (EID) CT scanner for comparison. The scan and reconstruct ion parameters of the EID-CT were closely matched to those of the PCD-CT. We compared CT number stability, contrast and contrast-to-noise ra tio (CNR) of the two CT systems. Results or Findings: The PCD-CT images showed more robust CT numbers for all simulated types of lung tissue, with maximum deviation of 0.8 vs 2.5 HU for PCD and EID images, respectively. Contrast and CNR for detection of ground-glass opacifications and emphysema was higher for PCD images compared to the clinical EID measurements. Conclusion: Our initial assessment of the new PCD-CT prototype showed improved performance in CT number stability and CNR , specifically in low-dose lung CT scans. Further studies are warranted to ass ess the clinical performance of the prototype scanner. Limitations: This was a limited pilot study with 3 phantoms. Mor e experiments with direct comparison to EID are warranted. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Sponsored research agreement with Canon Medical Research USA.

Sch\u00fcle*\u00b9, M. Hackenbroch\u00b2; in high-contrast computed tomography (CT) examinations is increasing due to lower radiation exposure while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our aim was to compare the applied dose ((TLD measurements (thermoluminescence dosimeter)) of CT protocols with and without tin filtration (Sn) at the same CTDIvol (co mputed tomography dose index). Methods or Background: TLD measurements were performed in triplicates, centered in a water phantom (diameter: 32cm) on a 3rd-generation dual-source CT scanner. Five different scan protocols (Sn 150 k V, 150 kV, 120 kV, 100 kV and Sn 100 kV) with six (CTDIvol: 29 mGy, 23.3 mGy, 17.4 mGy, 8.5 mGy, 6.3 mGy) dose settings were used. TLD measu rement results and the slope of the linear regression of the different protocols were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA or K ruskal-Wallis test. Results or Findings: Sn protocols resulted in higher applied doses at al l dose settings according to TLD measurements (dose differ ence: 16% +/- 4%) compared to non-tin filter scan protocols (p 0.01). Exceptions were the comparison between the Sn 150 kV and 150 kV protocols and between the Sn 150 kV/Sn 100 kV and 120 kV protocols at a CTDIvol of 29 mGy and 6.3 mGy, respectively (p 0.055). An increased slope of the linear regression was shown for the Sn 150 kV protocol compared to all remaining protocols (p<0.05). Conclusion: Compared to conventional protocols, the applied dos e of Sn protocols is underestimated based on CTDIvol data f rom the scanner. With Sn protocols, patients are thus exposed to a higher dose compared to conventional CT protocols at the same CTDIvol. For radiation protection reasons, this should be considered when using the S n technique. Limitations: The water phantom used is comparable but not identi cal to a patient's body.

Long-range correlations introduced by iterative reconstruction algorithms may narrow the applicability of Fourier techniques. Differences in the implementation of reconstruction algorithms bet ween manufacturers add further complexity. The present work set out to qua ntify the errors entailed by the use of Fourier methods, which can lead to design decisions that do not correlate with detectability. Methods or Background: The noise properties and the detectability index of the ideal linear observer were evaluated using the spatial approach and the Fourier-based approach. For this purpose, a homogeneous phantom was imaged on two scanners: the Revolution CT (GE Healt hcare) the Somatom Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthcare) at diff erent exposure levels. Images were reconstructed using different strength levels of IR algorithms available on the systems considered: ASIR-V and SAF IRE. Results or Findings: Our findings highlight that the spatial domain esti mate of the detectability index is higher than the Fourier domain estimate. This trend is found to be dependent on the specific regularisatio n used by IR algorithms as well as the signal to be detected. The eigenanalysi s of the noise covariance matrix and of its circulant approximation yields ex planation about the evoked trends. Conclusion: The applicability of Fourier techniques is dependent on the specific regularisation used by IR algorithms. Thes e results argue for verifying the assumptions made when using Fourier methods since the Fourier task- based detectability index does not always correlate with signal detectability.

Methods or Background: Acquisitions on phantoms were performed at 5 dose levels (CTDIvol: 13/11/9/6/1.8mGy). Raw data w ere reconstructed using Level 4 of iDose4 (i4) and 3 levels of AI-DLR taskbased detectability index detection of a liver metastasis (LM) and hepatocellular carcinoma at por tal (HCCp) and arterial (HCCa) phases. Image quality was subjectively asses sed on an anthropomorphic phantom by 2 radiologists Results or Findings: From standard to smoother levels, noise magnitude a nd average NPS spatial frequency decreased and the det ectability (d') of all simulated lesions increased. For both inserts, TTF values were similar for all three AI-DLR levels from 13 to 6 mGy but decreased from standard to smoother levels at 1.8 mGy. Compared to the i4 used in clinical practice, d' values were higher using smoother and smooth levels and close for the standard level. For all dose levels, except for 1.8 mGy, radiologists considered images satisfactory for clinical use for the 3 levels of AI-DLR but rated images too smooth using the smoother level. Conclusion: Using the smooth and smoother levels of AI-DLR reduces image noise, improves detectability of lesions and spatial resolution for standard and low-dose levels. Using the smooth level is apparent ly the best compromise between the lowest dose level and adequate image qu ality.

Author Disclosures: Joel Greffier: Nothing to disclose RPS 213-7 Radiation dose and image quality in middle and inne r ear CT imaging: comparison between multidetector CT and Purpose: Middle and inner ear imaging requires high spatial resolution images to assess fine anatomical details. The aim of this study was to compare a 256 multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) and 3D fl at-panel rotational acquisitions (3DRA) in terms of radiation dose and image quality, using two different phantoms. Methods or Background: To assess image quality, MDCT and 3D RA were performed on a CT Catphan phantom and a head anthro pomorphic phantom. MDCT standard acquisition was acquired with 120 kV, 60 mAs, pitch 0.3 and slice thickness 0.6 mm. 3DRA standard acquisition w as acquired with 80 kV, 258 mAs and 30 frame per second. Image quality was assessed evaluating high contrast spatial resolution on Catphan phantom and by a subjective evaluation of a neuroradiologist on the anthropomor phic phantom, evaluating anatomical details detectability, noise and contour sharpness. To perform dosimetric evaluations CTDI, DLP, DAP were collected while effective doses were calculated, using two different Monte Carlo sy stems. Results or Findings: 3D RA images showed a better high-contrast spatial resolution in comparison with MDCT, with values of 15 lp/cm and 12 lp/cm respectively. The subjective visual assessment perf ormed by a neuroradiologist on anthropomorphic phantom images resulted in higher image quality for 3D RA. Effective doses calculated with Monte Carlo systems on the head-CTDI phantom standard acquisition were 0.63 mS v for 3D RA and 0.5 mSv for MDCT. The dose measured with pencil-type CT chamber were 367 mGycm for 3D RA, and 292.7 mGycm for MDCT. Conclusion: 3D RA provides higher image quality compared to MDC T in terms of high-contrast resolution and the neuroradi ologist's subjective visual assessment in middle and inner hear imaging on phan tom models with a comparable radiation dose.

However, it is difficult for doctors who make a diagnosis in actual clinical practice to understand the effect on clinical CT images from MTF results. In a ctual clinical practice, it is known that the improvement of spatial resolution im proves the CT value of small blood vessels, but MTF cannot express this phenomenon. We have devised a new evaluation method for spatial resolut ion, focusing on the improvement of spatial resolution and the increase in CT value of small objects. Methods or Background: We performed a scan using a phantom with a metal wire spirally wound around a cylindrical acrylic pi pe. The CT value profile of the wire and the peak CT value of the wire were measured. Results or Findings: The MTF results and the CT value profile and CT val ue of the spiral wire were highly correlated. When the MTF was high, the CT value profile of the spiral wire was sharp and the peak C T value was high. Conclusion: Improving the spatial resolution of the CT device n ot only sharpens the image but also increases the CT value of the small blood vessels. This is a phenomenon of partial volume eff ect in CT. MTF is a physically excellent evaluation method for CT equipment. However, there are some CT phenomena that cannot be evaluated by MTF alone. The method we propose is a clinically-based CT image evaluation m ethod. Limitations: This report is based on the phantom experiment. We are planning to conduct research using human body data.

Ivanova, B Sofia/BG conventional is accept ed standard\" imaging modality for diagnosing computed tomography angiography as a fast non-invasive method has increased its applicat ion for imaging of anatomical and structural details of the vascular s ystem. It allows 3D- reconstruction and post-processing methods for prec ise treatment planning. The purpose of this survey was to compare patient exposure and routine MDCTA protocols used for patients with peripheral artery disease in different medical imaging departments in Bulgaria. Methods or Background: Nine MDCT units (named A-I) were included in the study. Optimisation of routine CT protocols was per formed for 5 of them in the period 2015-2022. The image quality was assessed by radiologists according to the visibility of the contrast in the pedal vess els. Results or Findings: Patients were scanned from celiac artery (mid diaphragm) to toes with median scan length in the r ange (1048 mm-1371 mm). 12 times difference was observed between the CTDIvol values (1.74 mGy(E)- 20.3 mGy(D)) and 2640.04 mGy.cm) between the protocols. Optimised pr otocols reduced patient exposure by a factor of 1.6 (A), 1.4 (D), 2.2 (E) a nd 5.4 (G), with lowest values when iterative reconstruction methods (B, C, E, G) were used, except for D. Compared to the standard 120 kV acquisition, the va scular enhancement of the same volume of iodinated contrast materia was i ncreased by 82%(G) dose reduction. Conclusion: The non-invasive MDCTA has replaced most diagnostic applications of CA. MDCTA can provide anatomic and functional assessment of most intravascular pathologies, which is comparable to CA applications as diagnostic modality. Limitations: Not all of the departments have an optimisation program in process. Ethics committee approval: No ethical approval required for the survey.

Our goal was to compare the molecular biological response in peripheral blood cells after X-irradiation with and without tin filtration (Sn). Methods or Background: Human peripheral blood was irradiated in vitro (six donors, aged 28-48 years) on a 3rd-generation dual source CT-scanner. Sn 150 kV, 150 kV and 120 kV scan protocols with 20 mG y (full dose, FD) and a Sn 150 kV scan protocol with 16 mGy (low dose, LD) were used. The Sn 150 kV LD and the 120 kV FD protocol showed comparable image noise. Radiation-induced molecular changes were examined by gene expression (GE) measurements of FDXR, DDB2, BAX, (DNA double-strand breaks) relative to unexposed samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the t- test or Mann-Whitney U test, where applicable. Results or Findings: All investigated genes (except APOBEC3H) showed a protocol-independent radiation-induced upregulation of GE and an number of double-strand breaks (1.5 to 7-fold, p<0. 05). There was no significant difference between the 150 kV FD protoc ol \u00b1 Sn (p>0.19) nor between the FD and Sn 150 kV LD protocol (p> 0.14). The highest differential gene expression was observed in GE measurements of EDA2R. Conclusion: X-irradiation with tin filtration resulted in simil ar molecular biological responses compared to conventional CT pr otocols. Tin filtering allows a dose reduction while maintaining high diagnostic image quality, directly reduces radiation exposure and is therefor e preferable to other protocols. Furthermore, EDA2R is particularly suitable for detecting low radiation doses, while APOBEC3H is not. Limitations: In-vitro experiments generally need to be validated in further studies.

Methods or Background: Literature shows that junior doctors' knowledge of ionising radiation and its effects are limited. Radiation awareness is inadequately covered by the UK undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. Referrers must be aware of iRefer guidelines and their legal responsibilities to ensure appropriate use of NHS resources. Using iRef er guidelines improves imaging appropriateness and reduces unnecessary inv estigations by approximately 20%. This is particularly important as there is a shortage of UK radiologists. Though risks associated with diagnost ic imaging radiation doses are acceptable, stochastic effects can be minimised by increasing awareness. Results or Findings: Data was collected from junior doctors before (n=45) and after intervention (n=30), using a 15-point questionnaire. The initial audit showed poor radiation awareness amongst junior doct ors: 75% had no formal teaching on radiation doses or associated risks and 64% were not formally taught how to make an imaging referral. A teaching session was delivered on IRMER 2017 and a recording emailed to junior doctor s. The accuracy of the contents was verified by radiation protection staff . A re-audit was completed to evaluate teaching effectiveness. This showed increased knowledge in all areas: radiation doses (42% to 87%); lifetime risk of radiation induced cancer (23% to 93%); heritable defects from radiation exposure to pregnant patients (20% to 80%); concept of legal responsibilities (15.9% to 100%). Conclusion: Radiation awareness amongst junior doctors can be i mproved using focused teaching based on IRMER 2017. This wi ll ensure appropriate use of NHS resources and promote radiation safety.

F. F. Yardmc; Ist anbul/TR (aftrad333@gmail.com) Purpose: Researchers have always been interested in finding new and effective materials for protection against radiation. This experimental study aimed to design and fabricate new types of nanomaterial- and micromaterial - based shields against the ionising effect of comput ed tomography (CBCT), diagnostic radiography and digital substraction angiography X-rays. Methods or Background: Our study aims to produce PVA nanofibers containing ZrO2 ceramic nanoparticles and measure t heir X-ray shielding abilities. First, polyvinyl alcohol is mixed with 2 0 ml of distilled water at 70\u00b0C for 2 hours in a magnetic stirrer. The mixing process c ontinues at room temperature until PVA forms a viscous and homogeneous solution in pure water. Then 0.45 g ZrO2 nanoparticles are added to the PVA solution and Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 107 mixing is continued for 1 hour. The final solution was stabilized at room temperature for 12 hours to increase homogeneity. T he mixed solution was loaded into a 10 ml syringe with a 0.5 mm inner diameter stainless steel needle. Electrospinning under 20 kV potential volta ge was carried out by covering the collector rotating at 500 rpm with aluminum foil. ZrO2 reinforced PVA nanofibers produced with this method were collected and used to produce X- and gamma-ray shielding vests. Results or Findings: To measure the half-value layers (HVL) and the line ar attenuation coefficient (\u00b5), we sent the fabricating prototype to the Turkish Energy, Nuclear and Mineral Research Agency. Conclusion: Preliminary results have shown us the ZrO2-reinforc ed PVA nanofiber vest radiation attenuation is better than traditional lead vests. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Methods or Background: From 03.04.2020 to 12.02.2021, DECT from biometrically matching patients with COVID-19, pneumonitis, and inconspicuous findings were selected from our clini cal routine. Three blinded readers independently scored each pulmonary lobe an alogous to CO-RADS. Interrater agreement was determined with an intracl ass-correlation-coefficient (ICC). Averaged perfusion metrics per lobe (iodine uptake in mg, volume without vessels in ml, iodine concentration in mg/m l) were extracted using manual segmentation and an AI DECT prototype. A gen eralised linear mixed model was used to investigate metric validity and p otential distinctions at equal CO-RADS scores. Multinomial regression measured the contribution of \"Reader\", \"CO-RADS score\", and \"perfusion metrics\" to diagnosis. Time to diagnosis was measured for manual vs AI segmentatio n. Results or Findings: We included 105 patients (62 \u00b1 13 years, mean BMI 2 7 \u00b1 2). There were no significant differences between manually and AI-extracted perfusion metrics (p=0.999). Regardless of CO-RADS score, iodine uptake and concentration per lobe were significantly higher in COVID-19 than in pneumonitis (p<0.001). In regression, iodine uptake had a greater contribution to diagnosis than CO-RADS scoring (Odds Ratio [OR]= 1.82 [95%CI 1.10-2.99] vs OR=0.20 0.14-0.29]). The AI prototype ext the relevant perfusion metrics significantly faster than radiologists (10\u00b11 vs 15\u00b12 minutes, p<0.001). Conclusion: The investigated AI prototype positively impacts de cision-making and workflows by extracting perfusion metrics that differentiate COVID-19 from visually similar pneumonitis significantly faster t han radiologists. Limitations: This study was retrospective with 35 matched patients per group. Iodine metrics extracted from a portal venous phase may be phase-specific. We used a high-end 3rd generation dual-source scanner, so generalisability may be limited. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the IRB.

Our aim was to use it to describe the relationship between Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcome and the CALIPER-detected pulmonary vascular-related structures (PVRS). Methods or Background: We performed a multicentric retrospective study enrolling 570 COVID-19 patients who undergone a che st CT in the emergency settings in two different institutions. Fifty-three age and sex matched healthy controls were also identified. Chest CTs were analy sed with CALIPER identifying the percentage of PVRS over the total l ung parenchyma. Patients were followed for up to 72 days recording mortality and required intensity of care. Results or Findings: There was a statistically significant difference in PVRS between COVID-19 positive patients and the controls (median [iqr] 4.05 [3.74] and 1.57 [0.40] respectively, P = 0.0001). PVRS sho wed an increasing trend with the severity of care, P < 0.0001. The univaria te Cox regression model showed that PVRS increase is a risk factor for mort ality (HR 1.17, P < 0.0001). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that PVRS is an explanatory factor of mortality along with age (HR 1.13, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our study suggests that PVRS increases with the required intensity of care, and it is an explanatory factor for mortality. Limitations: Restrospective study.

Hosein Yazdi, *S. Esmaeilian*, A. Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, researche rs have been trying to find risk factors for severe infection an d vulnerable health conditions. Pregnancy is one of these conditions with lots of c ontroversies. Also, there is no adequate information regarding features of lung CT scan imaging in these patients. Methods or Background: In this cross-sectional study, we retrospectively assessed pregnant patients with positive results of PCR for COVID-19, between April and July 2020. Data on CT scan charac teristics, demographic features and laboratory factors were collected in a pre-designed checklist. Results or Findings: We analysed 23 pregnant women with a mean age of 32.34\u00b18.06 years. Mean O2 saturation was 93.52\u00b14.59% and patients were hospitalised for a mean duration of 6.13\u00b14.07 days. Only one patient was expired. Dyspnoea was the most (65.2%) and generali sed pain was the least (8.7%) common symptom. Consolidation was the most c ommon (39.1%) lung CT scan finding followed by ground glass opacity (3 4.7%). There was no significant difference between presence or location of GGO (p = 0.348) or consolidation (p = 0.391) and patients' outcome. Following the same manner, there was also no significant difference between pr esence of Halo sign (p = 0.053), nodule (p = 0.087), fibrotic band (p = 0.87 0), sub-pleural spare (p = 0.13) or atoll sign (p = 0.087) and the final outcome.

Chan\u00b9, K. for silent clinical deterioration, \"silent hypoxia\" [2, 3]. The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with pulmonary embolism (PE) and the features of pulmonary vascular angiopathy in COVID-19 patients. Methods or Background: A cross sectional cohort study of 100 hospitalised consecutive COVID positive patients who underwent p ulmonary angiography from January 2021 to April 2021. CTPA features were evaluated for presence, localisation of PE, vascular angiopathy (i tree-in-bud sign, target sign, dandelion sign) and CT severity score. Clinical, demographic and laborator y parameters at time of imaging were collected Results or Findings: 18 patients were positive for PE of which 94.4% (16/18) were at segmental pulmonary artery level and 66.7% (12/18) at lower lobe. All patients had vascular tree in bud pattern. A statis tically significant correlation was found between presence of PE and those with premorbid diabetes mellitus (p = 0.025), intubated at time of imaging (p = 0.023) and pulmonary vascular tree-in-bud sign (p=0.002). A significant differenc e in CTSS score (p = 0.003) was noted between the two groups, those with PE and without PE. A highly significant correlation was found between patients with vascular tree-in-bud sign and rising our study population pulmonary embolism predomin antly affected segmental arteries at lower lobes and was more prevalent in those intubated. Suspicion of PE is raised in those with higher CTSS and vascular tree-in-bud pattern. Therefore, it is a potential i ndirect indicator of vascular angiopathy in COVID-19 patients.

Methods or Background: In this IRB-approved cross-sectional study eleven healthy volunteers and nine patients 3 months (\u00b1 7 days) after recovery from COVID-19 infection with pneumonia involving >50% of lung parenchyma were included. All patients underwent a lung MR protocol including the post-contrast time-resolved 3D gradient-echo time-resolved pulse sequence in TE/TR: 1.6/3.5 ms, flip angle 40\u00b0, time resolution 0.6s, 22 series) at 1.5T MRI scanner. A quantitative perfusion analy sis was performed based on indicator dilution theory at dedicated software. To evaluate perfusion parameters chest radiologist generated ROIs on ever y slice of the calculated PBF, PBV, MTT maps. The ROIs measured 10mm in diame ter and located in the peripheral regions in the upper, middle, and lower areas of the lung. The mean values of PBF, PBV, MTT, and standard deviations were calculated for upper, middle, and lower areas, compared between gr oups by one-way ANOVA. Results or Findings: The one-way ANOVA revealed the difference between levels of mean PBF in healthy individuals and post- COVID-19 pneumonia patients in upper, middle, and lower pulmonary area s (p < 0.05). The differences in the mean PBV and MTT values were present in lower pulmonary areas (p < 0.05), but were not confirmed in upper a nd middle areas (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that in patients recovered from CO VID-19 infection with extensive pulmonary involvement the perfusion pattern 3 months after the disease is characterised by lower PBF val ues compared to the group of healthy individuals. Limitations: The main limitations in our study are the unavoidable selection bias and small sample size.

Morozov; Moscow/RU Purpose: To reveal the correlation between pulmonary artery (PA) diameter and the severity of COVID-19 course in patients of different ages. Methods or Background: This work is a retrospective cohort study performed on a group of patients (n = 511, 267 men, median ag e 59 years, IQR 49.0- 65.0, range 31 to 84 years) treated at the COVID-19 temporary field hospital. Non-contrast CT scans of the chest organs were perf ormed on a mobile CT scanner. Anonymised CT images were independently ev aluated by two radiologists with 3 and 9 years of experience. An \" empirical\" visual scale was used to assess the volume of lung damage (CT0 - 0% pulmonary Diameters of the main pulmonary artery (PA), aorta (Ao), their ratio (LA/Ao) were measured. Results or Findings: During the study the following statistically signif icant regularities were obtained: pulmonary artery (PA) dilation and LA/Ao ratio were associated with increasing degree of pulmonary lesi ons in COVID-19; aortic dilation (Ao) was significantly associated with inc reasing age of patients. A significantly higher number of patients with signs of pulmonary hypertension (LA>29 mm) was shown for all age groups. Conclusion: Pulmonary artery dilation and increased LA/Ao ratio are associated with increased severity of lung damage i n COVID-19 in all patients age groups. Limitations: This study does not answer the question whether pul monary hypertension, marked as pulmonary artery dilation, is an initial condition or develops against the background of the course of CO VID-19. In this study, there is no control group of patients with diagnose d COVID-19 without lung damage.

E. B\u00fcy\u00fcktoka*, Z. H. Purpose: We evaluated the effect of body composition and lab oratory parameters on clinical outcomes in hospital present ation of COVID-19 patients. We investigated whether the fat/muscle area ratio ( FMR), Skeletal-Muscle- Index (SMI), and muscle HU/splenic HU ratio could p redict severe progression of COVID-19 during the follow-up period. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 109 Methods or Background: This single-centre retrospective study was conducted in patients with possible symptoms and positive RT-PCR for SARS- CoV-2 who admitted to our hospital between March-July 2020 and underwent chest CT scan. Radiological measurements (Paraspinous Muscle Area [PMA], Muscle HU, Subcutaneous Fat Tissue Area, Spleen Density) were made by the radiologist using Horos-Software-v3.3.5 (www.horosproject.org). CT-severity index was measured by two radiologists and the clinical outcome was evaluated by applying the proposed method by Kottlors et al. The standard scale from 1 to 5 for each patient with higher numbers corresponding more severe clinical outcomes or complications. Results or Findings: A total of 231 patients were included in the study, of which 121 were female and 110 were male. The median age of the patients was 47.12 (18-96). There was a significant correlat ion between muscle HU, muscle HU to spleen HU, paraspinous muscle area wit h exitus (p < 0.05). Mechanical ventilation was required in 20 of the patients. There was a significant correlation between FMR, muscle HU, PMA with mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05). A significant correlation w as found between patient's age and CT-severity score with length of hospitalisatio n. Conclusion: The prognostic importance of obesity and body composition is known as a prognostic factor for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. As a potential surrogate for body composition and obesit y, FMR represents prognostic information in COVID-19 patients. Clinic al outcome and prognosis of patients may be an additional correlation factor in FMR prediction. Limitations: Retrospective design of the study.

Monelli*\u00b9, G. Besutti\u00b9, E. aims were to describe changes in body compositi on parameters in severe COVID-19 survivors on CT scans collected at diagnosis, 2/3- and 6/7-months follow-up, and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 inflammatory burden on these changes. Methods or Background: Baseline (t0), 2/3- (t1) and 6/7-months (t2) follow -up CT scan of severe COVID-19 pneumonia survivors were retrospectively reviewed to measure pectoralis muscle area (PMA) and density (PMD), liver- and total, visceral, and int adipose tissue areas (TAT, VAT and IMAT) at T7-T8 vertebrae. COVID -19 inflammatory burden was estimated through the daily C-reactive protein (CRP) measures during hospitalisation summarised as integral of the curve. Its impact on body composition changes was evaluated in multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, and baseline TAT (index of general adiposity). Results or Findings: At follow-up a decrease in mean PMA and in all mean body fat areas was registered, faster from t0 to t1 , and slower from t1 to t2, with the exception of PMD, which increased (i.e. intramuscular fat decreased) only from t1 to t2. Mean VAT decrease was more cons picuous than mean TAT decrease. In adjusted models, increasing CRP integr al was significantly associated with larger PMA reduction and smaller PM D increase, larger LSR increase (i.e. stronger steatosis decrease), and la rger VAT decrease, but not with TAT decrease. These associations were stronger in patients with baseline higher VAT and lower LSR. Conclusion: Muscle and fat loss in sever COVID-19 survivors is faster in the first months, but slowly continues till 6-7 months. Fat loss is more apparent in visceral compartments. Inflammatory burden is assoc iated with the degree of muscle and visceral/liver fat loss. Limitations: Selection of severe cases, body composition assessed at thoracic level.

Mashar*, E. Allan, S. Patel, M. Taylor, A. Ahme d, A. Procter, J. Jacob, M. Duncan, A. Nair; London/UK (meghavi@hotmail.co.uk) Purpose: To assess if relative lung enhancement on subtracti on CT pulmonary angiography (sCTPA) is more heterogeneous in COVID-19 patients versus non-COVID-19 patients, as a potential biomar ker of microvascular alterations. Methods or Background: Consecutive COVID-19 patients undergoing sCTPA due to persistent dyspnoea were compared with contemporaneous non- COVID-19 patients (patients with acute/chronic thromboembolism, malignancy, any parenchymal abnormalities were excluded). Lung enhancement (Lung_Enh) was measured on the subtraction map dataset of the sCTPA, using 30 regions of interest at five levels. Main ( mPA) and lobar (lobPA) pulmonary arterial enhancement were also measured. We calculated the mPA:Lung_Enh, and the lobPA:Lung_Enh (markers of pulmonary vascular resistance) and compared their average values and v ariance, expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR). Results or Findings: 80 patients (age 52 \u00b1 17 years, 57 [71%] female) we re analysed. Between the COVID-19 (n = 29) and non-COV ID-19 (n = 51) cohorts, there was no statistically significant dif ference in the average mPA:Lung_Enh (9.7 [4.8, 18.0] HU versus 11.7 [8.2, 22.8] = 0.115), or average lobPA:Lung_Enh (8.0 [4.4, 17.8] HU versus 20.8] 3747.9] HU respect ively, p = 0.519) was wide for both cohorts, but not statistically different. Conclusion: Manually-measured lung enhancement heterogeneity on subtraction CTPA is not sufficiently different betw een symptomatic recovering COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients, indicating that there are either no persistent perfusion alterations, or that this t echnique is not sufficiently sensitive. Limitations: Manual measurements, only five levels assessed, cor roboration with other imaging unavailable as performed during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK.

P. A. 18F-FDG PET/MRI may improve the accuracy of DCE-MRI for breast cancer (BC) diagnosis. Methods or Background: 133 patients with 169 breast lesions (35 benign, 134 malignant) were prospectively enrolled and underwent simultaneous breast 18F-FDG PET/MRI. The accuracy of six BC diagnostic methods was explored, the first based on individual PET/MRI images: (1) DCE-MRI trough BI-RADS assessment; (2) quantitative an ADC cut-off value of 1.25 \u00d7103 mm2/s; (3) qualitative PET assessment of lesion uptake. Combinations of 2 and 3 parameters were also explored as follows: (4) DCE-MRI + DWI evaluation and (5) DCE-MRI + PET, where DWI and PET findings were used to up/downgrade BI-RADS categories; (6) DCE-MRI + DWI+ PET, considered as positive if at least two resulted suggestive for malignancy. AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of each method were calculated. Results or Findings: DCE-MRI alone showed AUC, sensitivity and specificity for BC diagnosis of 0.886, 100% and 77.1%, respectively. The combination of DCE-MRI + DWI used to up/downgrade BI-RADS categories resulted as the most accurate with AUC, sensitivity, specificity of 0.953, 99.3%, 91.4%, respectively. Methods including PET evaluation were all affected by a low specificity, the lowest using PET images alone (65.7%), and the highest when PET images were used to up/downgrade BI-RADS 4 categories (85.7%). Conclusion: The combination of DCE-MRI + DWI is the most accurate for BC diagnosis, while the addition of 18F-FDG PET is of limited value. Further research with advanced targeted tracers is necessary to elucidate the full potentials of PET/MRI of the breast. Limitations: Single-institution; limited sample size.

Weissinger*, J. la Foug\u00e8re, H. Ditttmann; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: Previous studies have demonstrated limited sensitivity of 18F-FDG- PET/MRI for preoperative detection of lymph node metastases (LNM) in early stage cervical carcinoma. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to optimise LNM detection by multiparametric evaluation of PET/MRI data. Methods mMR\u00ae, surgical staging or SLN-guided biopsy. Multiparametric analysis was performed using a logistic regression- based malignity score (MS). Results or Findings: In total, 245 LN were evaluated prospectively as consensus of nuclear medicine and radiology experts, quantified multiparametric and correlated to histology one Prevalence was (G1:0/19, G3:24/120). histologic grade, dual-timepoint SUV kinetic\" showed a synergy and were implemented in the MS. Grading of the primary tumour (G2/G3) revealed a significant impact on visual sensitivity (sens: 8.3%/31%) as well as and multiparametric (AUC: 0.769/0.877) detection rate. MS lowered combined false positive and false negative rate (FPR+FNR) from 65.5% to 44.5% in G2 tumours and reduced confidence intervals significantly. Compared to the expert consensus, application of MS tremendously increased the overall sensitivity from 31.0% to 79.3% (Youden optimum) with an acceptable decrease in specificity from 98.3% to 75.6%. Conclusion: Histologic grade of cervical carcinoma has a crucial impact on LNM detection rate in FDG-PET/MRI, which shows high accuracy in G3 tumours. Multiparametric evaluation of PET/MRI seems to be necessary to reduce both false-positive and false-negative findings in G2 tumours. Thus, a solely visual evaluation of FDG-PET/MRI in Figo I/II G2 cervical carcinoma fails to use its full potential. Limitations: Medium sample size.

Variable water proportion in different glioma grades is non-negligible and may introduce a systematic bias. In low-concentration metabolites, including 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), the impact could be more protuberant. Thus, referencing a 2HG concentration estimate with a more stable internal metabolite appears plausible to partially overcome this issue. Our study compared 2HG concentration estimates and 2HG/Cr ratios regarding their diagnostic performance in the same patient cohort. Methods or Background: Eighteen patients with suspect glioma were performed with jMRUI and LCModel. Creatine concentration was estimated from an off-spectrum. 2HG concentration estimates and 2HG/Cr ratios were compared using diagnostic performance parameters and areas under the ROC curves. Immunohistochemistry and genomic analysis were used as a ground truth. Results or Findings: 2HG concentration estimates with 1mM threshold for test positivity in sensitivity 75% (95% CI 0.34-0.97), specificity (95% CI 0.58- 0.96). The 2HG/Cr ratio with the cutoff value 0.085 improved sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy (87.5%, 95% CI and 88.89%, 95% CI 0.65-0.98], respectively). Conclusion: Using creatine as a stable internal reference in central glioma MRS has superior diagnostic performance than water-referenced 2HG concentration estimates.

Kall ur, G. R. Prashanth, M. Ashok Kumar, I. Desai, S. Sampa ngi; Bangalore/IN (niyarahalemao99@ymail.com) Purpose: (1) To evaluate the performance between the two tra cers by identifying the SUV max associated with stomach can cer subtypes on each scan. (2) To demonstrate the prognostic significanc e of FAPI and FDG-PET in calculating total glycolysis (TLG), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and maximum standardised uptake value (SUV max). Methods or Background: A retrospective study with a convenient sample of 30 patients at HCG Cancer Hospital who had undergone Ga 68 FAPI and 18 F FDG PET study and further underwent a histopathological analysis to determine the subtype of max, TLG and MTV was obtained o n both the scans. Tumour size, lymph nodal and distant metastasis for each histological subtype and location of primary tumour was noted. Independe nt t test was used for statistical analysis. Results or Findings: A sample size of 30 was selected for data collection. Tumour SUVmax, MTV and TLG was more for the adenocarcinoma group on FAPI PET scan in comparison to FDG PET scan (p < 0. 005). On FDG PET scan, lymphoma had higher SUV max. Neuroendocrine t umours showed less SUV max on both scans.Also, higher SUV values on both scans represented poorer prognosis with higher T stage of the primary tumour, lymph nodal and solid organ metastasis. Conclusion: In the present study, it was found that baseline hi gh SUVmax was associated with significantly worse prognosis of patients. Adenocarcinomas, lymphomas and neuroendocrine tumours showed significant differences in SUVmax, MTV and TLG parameters on each scan. Limitations: (1) Case selection bias. (2) Other PET parameters w ere not considered. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Fumarate is hydrated in a reaction catalysed by the enzyme fumarase to produce malate. Loss of plasma m embrane integrity during cell necrosis results in fumarate rapidly gaining access to the enzyme and an increased rate of malate production. Previously this has been assessed in vivo by using 13C-MRSI. Results or Findings: Surface-coil localised 2H MR spectroscopy and imaging conversion of [2,3-2H2] fumarate to [2,3-2H2] malate in orthotopically implanted tum ours following an injection of labelled fumarate (1g/kg) into tumour-bearing mice. Within 1 week of chemo- radiation (20 Gy in total with 4 Gy/fraction, temoz (100 mg/kg) the malate/fumarate ratio increased, from 0.051 \u00b1 0.03 to 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 (p = 0.04, n = 3), a ~4.3x increase, in patient-derived tumours (A 11) and from 0.017 to 0.42 \u00b1 0.05 (p = 0.006, n = 3), a ~6x increase i n a cell line model (U87). Conclusion: Tumour malate production increased significantly wi thin seven days of targeted radio-chemotherapy, demonstrating the potential of 2H- labeled fumarate for assessing GB tumour cell death and the early response to treatment. Limitations: The main limitation is the narrow frequency range of 2H MR, which requires the use of relatively high magnetic field strengths, at least 7T.

Vargas \u00b9, determine whether ComBat harmonisation improves radiomics- based tissue discrimination in pooled 18F-FDG-PET d ata from PET/CT and PET/MR scanners and to determine the effects of Com Bat on different radiomic feature classes. Methods or Background: 18F-FDG-PET data of 200 patients who had undergone PET/CT (two scanners/vendors; 50 patients each) or PET/MR (2 scanners/vendors; 50 patients each) for clinical purposes were retrospectively included. Fixed-size 2.5-cm\u00b3 spherical volumes of i nterest were placed in the disease-free liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and ra diomic features of the following classes were neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrix (NGTDM). For each feature class independently, and for a multi-class radiomic signature, tissue classification was performed on both ComBat harmonised and unharmo nised pooled data, using a network. Results or Findings: ComBat-harmonised PET radiomic features were superior to unharmonised features in terms of separ ation of liver, spleen and bone marrow. Median accuracies may based tissue classification for all radiomic featur e classes, even when PET data from PET/CT and PET/MR data are pooled.

Ekert*\u00b9, A. K. Nikolaou\u00b2, S. Gatidis\u00b2 ; \u00b9Ulm/DE, \u00b2T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: To apply and evaluate a deep learning framework for automated analysis of FDG positive lymphoma lesions in their corresponding region to result in a fully automated Ann Arbor staging. Methods or Background: 100 primary Hodgkin patients (mean age, 40.16 \u00b116.91 years; range, 11.0 to 85.5 years; 51 females and 49 males) between 02/2013-02/2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Onl y patients with histologically newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma pri or to therapy and complete whole-body CT as well as corrected PET scan were included. Whole body correct PET-scan in addition to contrasting enhanced whole-body CT were supplied to the algorithm resulting in automat ic segmentation of FDG positive lesions in their corresponding body compar tment and classified as physiological or pathological. Automatically, a pri mary Ann Arbor stage was classified. A secondary Ann Arbor stage was calculated with obvious misclassified extra nodal involvement removed (i.e. fat and muscle). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 112 Results or Findings: Automatically calculated Ann Arbor stage algorithm without any modification resulted in 35 correctly c lassified stages, 31 with one degree deviation, 28 with two degrees of deviation and 6 with four degrees of deviation. Sensitivity, PPV was 59.3/40.7%. Seconda ry calculated Ann Arbor stage, obvious misclassified extranodal involvement removed, resulted 36 correctly classified stages, 35 with one degree dev iation, 25 with two degrees of deviation and 4 with four degrees of deviation. Sensitivity, PPV was 52.7/53.3%. Conclusion: Automated staging of primary Hodgkin lymphoma using a deep learning approach is feasible, however more fine tuning is needed to result in a fully automated Ann Arbor staging.

Methods or Background: pSTS who underwent PET/MR for staging in our tertiary centre were retrospectively examined. One radiologist with four years of experience in oncological imaging segmented each pr imary tumour and extracted 33 radiomic features using an open source software (3D Slicer, www.slicer.org). Factor analysis was applied to sel ect highly correlating features; their prognostic value was investigated b y logistic regression analysis. The Student's t-test was used to evaluate if differences in radiomic, metabolic, and laboratory variables occurred according to STS grade (subdivided as low and high grade) and histotype (r habdomyosarcomas vs non-rhabdomyosarcomas); if a significant difference occurred then the diagnostic value of the variable was computed. The applied level of significance was 0.05 for all analyses. Results or Findings: Eighteen patients (11 female; mean age 7.8\u00b14.6 year s old; 12 with rhabdomyosarcoma; nine with high grade STS; four deceased) were examined. The following features were selected using factor analysis: minimum, lmc1, cluster shade, long run length emphasis, and variance. None of the radiomic features predicted the outcome (p > 0.05, each). Lmc1 was significantly higher in low grade STS (-0.17\u00b10.05 v s -0.13\u00b10.02, p = 0.045) and showed 70.4% accuracy in classifying high grade STS (the value -0.14 showed 77.8% Se and 66.7% Sp). Variance was significantly lower in rhabdomyosarcomas (23588\u00b123325 vs 68144\u00b139009, p = 0.008) and showed 83.3% accuracy in classifying rhabdomyosarcomas (the value 52314 showed 83% Se and 99% The radiomic features lmc1 and variance are biomark ers of STS grade and histotype, respectively.

The peritumoral and intratumoral ADC values were evalua ted on diffusion-weighted images, and the intratumoral SUV values were measur ed on fusion PET/MRI images. Both the peritumoral and whole-tumour ADC v alues were measured using ImageJ, an opensource software supported by t he National Institutes of Health. Univariate and multivariate logistic regres sion analyses were performed to determine the most effective factor pr edicting MVI. Results or Findings: Univariate analysis showed that (PTband ADCmean), ADC mean), and maximum SUV (SUVmax) correlated with MVI (p < 0.05) . On multivariate analysis, the SUVmax was the only independent risk factor for the MVI of HCC. Combining the IT ADCmean and SUVmax further improved differentiation between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs, and the area under the curve was 0.935 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.864-1.0 0), yielding a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 81%. The ICC values were 0.9 5-0.99, a nearly perfect level of agreement. Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET/MRI is a useful noninvasive imaging tool for the prediction of the MVI of HCC.

Dormagen; Oslo/NO RPS 217-3 Who gets what imaged: exploring patient age and num ber of body regions imaged by CT in emergency room patients (jan.vosshenrich@usb.ch) Purpose: To investigate the relationship between patient age and body regions imaged with CT in emergency room patients. Methods or Background: 27,962 CT examinations ordered from 01/2019- 02/2021 by the emergency department in our tertiary care hospital for patients aged 20-99 years were retrospectively analysed. Exams were divided into three groups based on the number of body regions im aged: 1-region separ ately aggregated both per year of patient age, and in 5-year or 10-year a ge groups (e.g. 50-59 years) and visualised using scatter plots and trending line graphs. Relationships between patient age and average number of body regi ons imaged were analysed using linear correlation and Welch-ANOVA. Results or Findings: There was a clear trend towards more body regions being imaged with increasing patient age (r=0.96 [9 5% CI: imaged with CT i ncreased from 1.2 (age: 20 years) to 1.6 (age: 99 years). Similar results w ere observed with patients in 5-year significant differences between most age groups. Ex cept with directly adjacent age groups (e.g. 30-39 years vs. 40-49 years [mean: 1.25 vs. 1.29; p=.17]), the average number of body regions imaged was different to all other age groups, both when aggregated in 5-year and 10-year age grou ps (all p<.01). Conclusion: There is a positive linear correlation between pati ent age and number of body regions imaged with CT in emergency room patients. Further investigation of the causes (e.g. more critically i ll patients vs. emergency department workflow optimisation), and potential im plications for radiologists' workload and radiation exposure is needed.

Hamid; Sharjah/A E (mabdelfatah@sharjah.ac.ae) Purpose: This study aims to estimate effective and organ dos es and cancer risk associated with whole-body computed tomography (CT) scanning for polytrauma patients. Methods investigations were obtained from a 64- multidetector unit. CT doses were measured in CT dose index (CTDI) and dose length product (DLP). Effective doses were calculat ed based on figures from publication 103 of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. According to the National Academies' Biological Eff ects of Ionizing Radiation VII Report, the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence was estimated and organ dose estimated using NCICT dosi metry software. Results or Findings: Among 76 eligible patients, 84.2% were male and 15. 7% were female (mean age=35\u00b112.5 years; height=177\u00b18.5 cm; weight 81.5\u00b112.7 kg). All patients had multiple traumas, with 88% du e to road traffic accidents and the rest due to a fall from height. The proposed dose for CTDIvol (mGy) and DLP (mGy cm) is 62 and 2873.4, respectively. Th e mean effective dose was 31.4 mSv, and the organ doses ranged from 10.2- 63.7 mGy. Conclusion: Although WBCT results in fast and accurate diagnosi s, it led to the increment of radiation dose >20 mSv, increasing cancer risk regardless of patient age, injury severity and evaluation result. Radiation dose justification and optimisation can positively influence dose reduction. Staff engagement in training and education will improve the practice an d increase the awareness of radiation protection. Limitations: The number of patients was an identified limitation.

Staudacher; resuscitation needs to include CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients after return of spontaneous circulation (R OSC). Methods or Background: Over a period of 12 months all consecutive patients treated in the cardiac arrest centre of a maximum c are hospital after resuscitation with ROSC were retrospectively included in this study. was retrospectively analysed by a board-cer tified radiologist specialised in emergency imaging. Clinical data was retrospectively retrieved from the clinical information system. Results or Findings: 78 patients (74.4% men, 65.02\u00b115.23 years) with contrast enhanced CT imaging of the thorax performe d the day of resuscitation were included in this study. Thoracic CT imaging was performed as dual-rule- out embolism (PE) was detected in 5 patients (6.4%), level of vessel involvement was categorised as central in 2, lobar in 1 and segmental in 2 patients. PE was detected in dual-rule-out CTA in 3 cases, in CTPA and venous phase CT in 1 case, respectively. PE exclusi on was limited to central and lobar pulmonary arteries in only 4 (5.13%) and 11 cases (14.10%), respectively. Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries were evaluable in the vast majority of cases (80.77%). Conclusion: PE is a serious but rare resuscitation cause in pat ients with ROSC. PE exclusion seems not to be limited to CTPA but to be feasible up to segmental level in the majority of cases with contr ast enhanced thoracic imaging after resuscitation. Limitations: The results from this single centre study need to be confirmed in a larger, preferably multi centre, study cohort.

Mijovi *, D. Vasin, S. Milenkovic, D. Maulovi ; Belgrade/RS (mijovicksenija@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study is to draw attention to the f requency of spontaneous muscle haematomas in patients who are h ospitalised for COVID- 19 viral infection and to describe their radiologic al characteristics. These patients are at an increased risk due to protocolar y anticoagulant medication administration, given the well-established risk for developing a hypercoagulable state and subsequent thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in COVID-19. Methods or Background: We searched the reports of abdominal and pelvic CT examinations in Covid hospital \"Batajnica\" with the keyword \"haematoma\" for a period of 9 months (December 11, 2020 - September 28, 2021), additionally evaluating the characteristics of the haematomas: contrast agent extravasation, localisation and propagation into ex tramuscular adipose tissue, and the largest diameter of the extramuscular component. Additionally, we searched for eventual surgical treatment data. Results or Findings: Out of a total 394 CT examinations of the abdomen a nd pelvis in 346 patients aged 23-98, 66 (19%), with an average age of 75, were diagnosed with 78 spontaneous muscular haematomas of different regions, with 11 patients (17%) having haematomas in more than one region. The most common locations were abdominis rectus and iliopsoas muscles. CT signs of active contrast agent extravasation were seen in 34 patients (51%), 13 of which required surgical treatment (19% of patients) . Conclusion: Spontaneous muscle haematomas are a common complica tion in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 viral infection, with at least a fifth of the cases requiring surgical treatment. Hereby we under line the necessity for careful surveillance of possible active haemorrhage in these patients, especially in certain muscle compartments. CT exami nation can reliably determine the distribution and propagation of haema tomas and detect active bleeding. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: SARS-Cov 2 infection mainly affects the lungs but many extrapulmonary manifestations have been commonly reported, which may present alone or with respiratory symptoms. Gas trointestinal tract (GI) is the most common extrapulmonary site of involvement; coronavirus has proven to directly infect enterocytes of both the small an d large intestine due to their ACE-2 receptor surface expression. GI involvement i n SARS-Cov 2 infection has a broad spectrum of clinical severity, it is as sociated with higher serum lactate levels, higher risk of invasive ventilation and a worse prognosis. Results or Findings: We retrospectively selected six SARS-Cov 2 infected patients who presented to our emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms. In all cases abdominal CT was performed a nd findings consistent with ischaemic bowel disease where reported and confirmed at surgical/pathological examination. The most common imaging finding was pneumatosis intestinalis; other findings included bowel wall thickening, bowel dilatation, and pneumoperitoneum. At histopathologi cal evaluation pneumatosis (n=5) was confirmed in all cases but one along with ischaemic necrosis; all patients had inflammatory infiltratio n with a submucosal/perivascular pattern or with full thickness distribution. Fibrin thrombi in the small vessels and ischaemic changes were present in all cases. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 114 Conclusion: Pathogenesis of intestinal damage in SARS-Cov 2 inf ection is not fully understood yet, although a combination of fac tors is hypothesised. On the one hand there would be a direct viral cytolytic ef fect on enterocytes and on the other, there would be a local inflammatory acti vation leading to inflammatory infiltration, increased vascular permeability, microvascular damage and thrombosis. Increased intraluminal press ure may also contribute. Radiologists should be familiar with CT findings as sociated with bowel ischaemia to warrant an appropriate diagnosis and p rompt treatment. Limitations: The small number of patients was an identified limi tation. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was not required for this study. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

However, this evaluation includes many parameters. Periappendicul ar fat density (PFD) is a numerical value that can be easily measured in CT examination. To our knowledge, there is no study examining the relationship between PFD value and CRASI score. Aim: to investigate the relationship between the CRASI and the PFD value. Methods or Background: CT images of 47 adult patients with surgically confirmed acute appendicitis and 40 adult patients in the control group without clinical and radiological appendicitis were analyse d retrospectively. For each patient, CRASI was calculated. Periappendicular, mesenteric, and subcutaneous fat density were measured in CT. The r atio of PFD to other locations (mesenteric region and umbilical region s ubcutaneous fat) was calculated. Results or Findings: PFD value was significantly higher in patients with acute appendicitis than in the control group (p=0.045). S ignificant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of PFD/mes enteric fat density and PFD/umbilical region subcutaneous fat density ratio (p 0.001, p=0.034, respectively). A close correlation was found betwee n CRASI and PFD/mesenteric fat density and PFD/umbilical region Conclusion: There is a strong close relationship between the increase in the CRASI, which is an indicator of the tendency to com plications, and the density of periappendicular fat in appendicitis cases. PFD value/mesentery fat density ratio is more decisive in this relationship. Limitations: The main limitation is the small number of patients . Significant differences can be detected in different parameters in higher sample groups.

Author 217-10 Observation and repetitive ultrasound: a successful tool to reduce unnecessary CT scans in diagnostics of acute append icitis *R. using conditional computed tomography (CT) strategy, which may result in up to 50% unnecessary CT scans for patients revealing no acut e pathology. Our purpose is to present our prospective trial results analysi ng the value of observation and repetitive abdominal ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis for low- risk patients. Methods or Background: Single-centre prospective study included patients with suspected acute appendicitis who, after initial clinical evaluation, laboratory tests and ultrasound results, did not ac hieve a final conclusive diagnosis. All patients went through an 8-12 hour p eriod of observation, later clinical examination, laboratory tests, and abdominal ultrasound were repeated. Results or Findings: The study included 97 patients: 37 male and 60 female. The average age was 31.4 years (SD 13.55), the aver age duration of symptoms was 13.5 hours (SD 11.24), Alvarado and appendicitis inflammation response score averages were 4.3 (SD 1.87) and 3.8 (SD 1.60) respectively. After repetitive abdominal ultrasound primary, inconclusive diagnosis (probable appendicitis) changed to conclusive results for 70% of cases, primary nonvisualised appendix result changed to visualised or other confirmed acute pathology for 42.4% patients (p<0.005). Finally, a CT scan was avoided for patients in 75% of cases. A negative appendectomy r ate was 1.0%, and 2.0% of complicated cases were revealed. Conclusion: Observation and repetitive abdominal ultrasound str ategy is a safe tool to increase the rate of final conclusive diagnosis without ionising radiation for low-risk patients and does not increase rates of negative appendectomies and complicated cases.

Masselli*, D. Cozzi, E. Guiducci, Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the utility of pelvic MRI following inconclusive pelvic ultrasound in girls with acute pelvic pain. Methods or Background: All MRI examinations of patients who were referred for examination because of acute pelvic pain, after inconclusive ultrasound between June 2018 and September 2021 at one institution, were included our study (n=49). Multi-planar multi-sequence MR images of the pelvis were obtained in each patient. MR images were reviewed at the time of acquisition by an experienced radiologist to determine whether a diagnosis could be made without the administration of IV gadolinium. In 35 of 49 examinations gadolinium was not administered. The prospective cl inical MRI interpretations were retrospectively compared with follow-up medical, surgical, and obstetric records to determine the correctness of the interpr etation. Results or Findings: Correlation of prospective clinical MRI interpretat ions with follow-up medical records showed correct ident ification of disease entities in all 49 patients. The following disease processes were correctly identified using MRI: appendicitis (n=5), ulcerative colitis torsion (n=1). 21 of the 49 patients had norm al findings on MRI examinations and also had unremarkable follow-up. Conclusion: The intrinsic safety of MRI and its ability to accu rately establish the cause of acute pelvic pain in girls, make it hi ghly useful in the evaluation of the subset of young female patients without a definitive initial diagnosis on sonography, and in directing medical and surgical t reatment. Limitations: Identified limitation were as follows: the relative ly limited cohort of patients; longer term follow-up data was not availa ble. Ethics committee approval: The local ethical committee approved this retrospective study. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Son*, G-S. Hong; Seoul/KR (ayeon1230@gmail.com) Purpose: Investigate diagnostic errors in imaging and their impact when requesting patients to revisit the emergency room Methods or Background: In our hospital, if the resident or clinician's diagnosis in imaging is made incorrectly in the emergency room (ER) patient, if it is a critical finding we use an automatic text m essage transmission system or call the clinician to notify the diagnostic error. We extracted data from text messages or phone call histories related to diagnos tic errors on CT or MR in ER from January 2013 to January 2021, and conducted a descriptive cross- sectional study based on the extracted data. Results or Findings: There were 686 confirmed cases. The main types of diagnostic errors were missed findings (70.4%) and faulty reasoning (19%). The majority of imaging was abdominal imaging (47.8%), followed by neuroimaging (31.3%). Errors were most common durin g night shifts when a resident worked alone as a radiologist (54.8% on 10pm~8am). Critical findings (related to patient symptoms or a change of treatment options) were 95% and incidental findings were 5%. Of the 686 patients, 1 49 (21.7%) were hospitalised for errors related to findings or pre- existing underlying diseases. Of these, a total of 6 patients died within 30 days : 5 died from progression of the pre-existing disease, and 1 died from pneumonia after surgery. Conclusion: There were no cases of patient death due to diagnos tic errors, but most cases were critical findings, which may af fect treatment and prognosis and cause unnecessary further visits to the emergency room. There is a need for a way to reduce diagnostic errors. Limitations: An identified limitation was that patients with a l oss of follow-up could not be evaluated.

R. RPS 305-2 The rise of artificial intelligence solutions in ra diology departments in the Netherlands *K. G. van Leeuwen*\u00b9, M. De Rooij\u00b9, S. There are 180 CE-marked artificial intelligenc e (AI) products for radiology commercially available in Europe, but lit tle is known about the current clinical use. We investigated the clinical use of c ommercial AI software in radiology departments in the Netherlands over a two-year period. Methods or Background: We consulted the radiology department of all hospital organisations in the Netherlands (n = 69) in February-March 2020 (44 respondents) and February-March 2021 (37 respondent s). A representative of the department was asked to fill in a questionnaire about the (planned) clinical use of CE marked AI products for radiology, the available funding for AI, and biggest obstacles for implementation. Results or Findings: From 2020 to 2021 the percentage of respondents that desired the adoption of AI tools in radiology increased from 63% to 86%. In 2020, 14 responding organisations used AI in clinic al practice, which increased to 23 (33% of all organisations) in 2021. The total number of AI implementations in clinical practice expanded by 15 7%, from 19 to 49 implementations. Also, the diversity increased from 8 to 32 unique products. In 2021, 35% of respondents had budgets allocated for AI implementations either on the departmental level or on the institutional l evel, which was 26% in 2020. The major obstacles for AI adoption shifted from di fficulties with the technical integration (2020) to the lack of budgets and an unclear business case (2021). Technical integration remained the second most ofte n listed obstacle. Conclusion: AI adoption is gradually increasing in clinical radiology in the Netherlands. The number of radiology departments us ing AI has increased to at least a third of all organisations. Also, the number and diversity of AI applications per department grew substantially.

Along with the developments in deep learning, questions arise concerning the security of this technology. In particular, adversarial attacks are gaining interest. We aimed to review the literature on adversarial attac ks in radiology. Methods or Background: We searched for studies on adversarial attacks in radiology published up-to September 2021. MEDLINE and Google Scholar were used as search databases. Results or Findings: Fourteen studies were published from 2018 to 2021. Attacks were applied to image classification as wel l as natural language processing (NLP) algorithms. The efficacy of attack s was high. Some attacks reduced the accuracy of formerly well-performing de ep learning algorithms to 0% with 100% confidence. Several protective strategies were examined. The most common is training algorithms with adversarial examples. Conclusion: Machine learning models are at risk of adversarial attacks, particularly in radiology. There are numerous potential incentives for cyber- attacks on healthcare frameworks. Thus, the occurre nce of these attacks in practice is of concern. Radiologists and policymakers should be aware of adversarial attacks. It is important to prepare for such attacks and influence the formulation of ethical and legal guidelines to ensu re the safe use of deep learning technology. Limitations: Not applicable.

Wu*, J. Dong, F. Fangfang, Y. Bai, Y. Lin, M. W ang; Zhengzhou/CN Purpose: The small data size is the major challenge of artif icial intelligence for medical imaging. This study aims to use adversarial networks to generate structurally consistent medical images and corresponding regions of interest. Methods or Background: Based on cycleGAN's two-stage cycle consistency, the priori characteristics of the region of interes t were added to construct the artificial intelligence model. This method improves the tissue contrast of ROI and achieves the paired generation of high-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its corresponding ROI. During the model training, the MRI image with ROI was taken as the input, and the corr esponding mask image was taken as the target. The circular consistency f unction of the network was used to ensure the structural consistency between t he synthesis image and the input image, and the quality of the synthesis image was improved through GAN network. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 116 Results or Findings: The validation experiment in BRATS 2017 shows that the proposed method can effectively generate pairwi se training data for the training of machine learning models. The DICE coeff icient of the generated image is 0.9810.11 and the Hausdorff distance is 4. 212.84. Compared with cycleGAN model, the image synthesised by this method improved the classification accuracy of the model by 4%. Conclusion: Using GAN to synthesise medical images can generate image data consistent with the distribution of real image data. By combining the quality of paired images, it can effectively increase the training data and improve the performance of machine learning model.

Methods or Background: Due to longitudinal undersampling spiral CT scans may suffer from windmill artifacts in the reconstru cted images. To fulfill the sampling condition and achieve double sampling in z -direction, some CT scanners use the z-flying focal spot (zFFS) techniq ue, a hardware-based solution that effectively doubles the number of det ector rows. To obtain a software-based solution we developed a convolutional neural network that is trained in a supervised manner by defining projecti ons containing all (upsampled) rows as the desired output, while every other row of the corresponding projections is used for network input . Patient CT raw data containing various anatomical regions are used for training. Evaluation was performed in image domain by comparing to reconstructions of projections both with zFFS enabled and zFFS disabled. Results or Findings: Interpolation of projection data with the neural network leads overall to slightly better reconstruction res ults in the image domain compared to disabling the zFFS (up to 10% improveme nt in RMSE). In areas where little structural change occurs, i.e. homogen eous structures, the network achieved less favorable results. Qualitatively, it was observed that windmill artifacts were less pronounced when projection data were interpolated by the trained network than when zFFS was avoided. Conclusion: The application of a neural network can partially m eet the requirements of increasing the sampling of spiral C T projection data and may have a positive effect on avoiding windmill artifac ts in the corresponding reconstructions. It cannot, however, outperform the zFFS. Limitations: The zFFS-generated rows were manually removed from projection data. It remains to be investigated how the results of the interpolation look like with real projections acqui red without zFFS. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Using a single model for Universal Lesion Segmentation has the potential for faster inference times compared to multimodel approaches and allows for internal representation of lesion type features. Methods or Background: We compiled eight public datasets with segmentation masks for various lesion types in CT t horax-abdomen scans. Scans were resampled to 1mm isotropic voxel spacing and regions of interest were cropped centered on each lesion. A nnUnet was trained with 3213 lesions from 1481 studies and used to predict 3D segmentati on masks for the circa 32,000 partially annotated lesions from the DeepLes ion dataset. Masks were further refined by applying the GrabCut algorithm i n three orthogonal directions based on the provided long and short-axis diameter measurements. We fine- tuned the nnUnet using the resulting masks and eval uated on a test set with full annotations. We experimented with epoch number s and learning rate decay. All models were trained using 5-fold cross v alidation. Results or Findings: Fine-tuning the model using the DeepLesion masks improved segmentation performance from 0.71 to 0.73 Dice compared to the baseline nnUnet. Segmentation performance ranged fr om 0.53, 0.61, 0.66, 0.77, 0.79 to 0.9 Dice for colon, pancreas, lymph n ode, lung, liver and kidney lesions. Conclusion: 3D universal lesion segmentation using large, aggregated datasets shows promise as an alternative to lesion specific models. By incorporating partially annotated data in a semi-su pervised manner we can further increase data volume and model performance with minimal annotation effort. Limitations: This study used a small number of scans in the test set and did not evaluate model performance on out-of-distributi on lesion types. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

J. Pruis*, S. Neggers, (i.pruis@erasmusmc.nl) Purpose: Pituitary adenoma can disabling symptoms resulting from hormonal dysregulation. In 40% of patients, di agnostic MRI is inconclusive as microadenoma by definition are <10m m and not always sufficiently contrasting. We here introduce a novel method for detection of microadenoma by O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) PET/MRI. Methods or Background: Patients with suspected microadenoma underwent PET/MR-imaging at 20 minutes post-injection of 200 (median, range 50-207) MBq [18F]FET. A positive scan was defined as focal uptake exceeding local background (i.e., normal pituitary tissue). Outcomes were compared with results of selective inferior petrosus sinus sampli ng (IPSS), postoperative pathology reports, and clinical follow-up. Results or Findings: Nineteen patients, 73.7% female, median age 56 (11- 68), with Cushing's disease (n=12; 63.2%) or acrome galy (36.8%) but included. Fifteen pa tients (78.9%; 10 Cushing, 5 acromegaly) showed positive focal [18F]FET PET/MR I uptake. Four patients underwent surgery upon which pathology confirmed pr esence of an adenoma. Nine out of eleven Cushing patients also had positi ve IPSS, however, in five IPSS could not differentiate between left/right, an d in two the designated side by IPSS did not correlate with imaging. In the pati ents with a negative [18F]FET PET/MRI, one proved true-negative after su rgery, one was diagnosed with a Rathke's cleft/non-metabolic cysti c adenoma instead, one appeared to have minimal symptoms that not required therapy, and one had a later confirmed microadenoma that was possibly not detected by [18F]FET PET/MRI because of ACTH normalising medication at t he time of the scan. Conclusion: [18F]FET PET/MR-imaging shows high accuracy for loc alising microadenoma in patients with hormonal dysregulatio n. The diagnostic yield of this hybrid imaging technique showed to exceed that of MRI alone and IPSS. This novel approach herewith provides an important addition for planning of selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Derks*, L. S. Ho, K. de Joode, A. Joosse, M. de Jonge, M. Smits, M. van den Bent, A. van der Veldt; Rotterdam/NL Purpose: Melanoma has a high propensity to metastasize to the brain, especially in patients with extracranial metastases (stage IV). We assessed the number of patients with asymptomatic brain metastas es (BMs) at screening in stage III melanoma, after resection of loco-regional disease (resected stage III). With this, we aimed to determine the clinical value of MRI screening in these patients. Methods or Background: In this retrospective cohort analysis, we included all patients with resected stage III melanoma who under went screening MRI of the brain between 1st August, 2018, and 1st January, 20 21. From our hospital's electronic health record system, we collected repor ted American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) stage at initial referral, diagnosis of extracranial disease on screening CT or PET/CT; diagnosis of BMs on screening MRI (neuro-radiologists' reports) and treatment plan pr ior to and after MRI. Results or Findings: We identified 208 patients: 27 were initially refer red with stage IIIA, 74 with stage IIIB, 99 with stage IIIC, and 8 with stage III of unknown primary (MUP). Brain metastases were discov ered at MRI screening in 5 patients: 4 in stage IIIC and 1 in MUP. The number of BMs ranged from 1 to 10 and all lesions were small (diameter range 3. 5-18.0mm). Two out of these 5 patients had simultaneous extracranial disease discovered at screening, which was the main factor that resulted in a changed treatment plan. Therefore, in only 3 out of 208 (1.4%) patients with resected stage III melanoma, screening MRI of the brain changed the tr eatment plan (dual immune checkpoint inhibition, ipilimumab/nivolumab, instead of monotherapy). Conclusion: The clinical value of MRI screening for BMs in pati ents with resected stage III melanoma is low. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Dynamic contrast (DSC) MR perfusion in patients with brain tumours is invaluable thus improving methods for analysing this sequence is crucial. In this study, two parameters characterising MR perfusion imaging were investigated: the peak height (PH) and the percentage of signal recovery (PSR) to determine whether they could be a tool in differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Identifying such characteristics in MR imaging can help diagnose patients more accurately without the need for an unnecessary neur osurgical procedure. Methods or Background: 34 patients were included in this study and analysed retrospectively. The key condition for all participants was to undergo teleradiotherapy followed by MR examination with DS C imaging in which a contrast-enhancing lesion was present. For patients with recurrent GBM, confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathology was necessary while for patients with radiation necrosis, certain radiologi cal features of the lesion in subsequent MR examinations were crucial to establis h a definitive diagnosis. To obtain signal intensivity-time curves, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually around the contrast-enhancing parts of the lesions. Based on those curves both PH and PSR were calculated and normalis ed to the contralateral normal appearing white matter. Results or Findings: Mean, maximum, and minimum relative PH (rPH) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in GBM recidivans group than in radiation necrosis group, whereas maximum relative PSR (rPSR) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in radiation necrosis group than in GBM recidivans group. The following cut-off points were distinguished for : mean rPH 1.44 Selected DSC parameters could helpful in differentiating radiation necrosis from GBM recurrence.

Taha; Cairo/EG (manar.ashour@gmail.com) Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop MRI NI-RADS cr iteria by combining diffusion characteristics and T2 signal i ntensity with the present ACR NI-RADS template. Methods or Background: 69 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma underwent post treatment imaging surveill ance with CE-MRI neck were included in this retrospective study. Scans were interpreted by two neuroradiologists, assessment and scoring of the pr imary tumour site was done using the current ACR NI-RADS lexicon, and res coring was then performed based on our proposed criteria incorporat ing T2 signal and diffusion features with the ACR NI-RADS system. The gold stan dard was a set of criteria including clinical and imaging follow-up, and pathologic assessment. Results or Findings: In post-treatment surveillance for HNSCC the usage of T2 SI and diffusion features as modifying rules to the current ACR NI-RADS showed higher specificity, sensitivity, positive pr edictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy (92.3%, 90.7%, 85.7% 95.1%, and 91.3%, respectively) (84.6%, 81.4%, 73.3%, 82.6%, respectively). Conclusion: Incorporating diffusion features and T2 signal within the American College of Radiology NI-RADS criteria for the prima ry tumour site as modifying rules enhanced the diagnostic performance of the AC R NI-RADS system.

Methods or Background: Single centre, the post-processing images of 111 patients with 215 lesions were reviewed retrospecti vely, separately and blindly, generated from DECT acquisition as non-overl ay blood-subtracted- calcium images [blood overlay in rainbow and greyscale color [blood (calcium) overlay], and combined sSECT and blood (calcium) images, by three neuroradiologi sts. Reference standards were established by consensus diagnosis correlated with relevant prior and/or following CT or MRI, and clinical information. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were accessed and compared. Results or Findings: Blood (calcium) overlay images increased accuracy (99.6%), sensitivity (99.5%) and specificity (100%) in diagnosis of ICH on non- contrast brain CT and increased observer confident (94.06% certain diagnosis) as compared to sSECT images (p-value < 0.05). Combi nation of non-overlay blood (calcium) and sSECT images also got higher ac curacy (92.8%), sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (100%) than sSE CT images alone (p-value < 0.05). They were very good interrater reliability, while sSECT images were poor. Conclusion: Material decomposition DECT as blood (calcium) over lay images or combination of non-overlay blood (calcium) and c onventional images had high diagnostic ability of ICH on non-contrast brai n CT scan and benefit especially in emergency setting.

T. Winkelmann*, M. Bongers; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of dual energy CT (DECT) virtual-unenhanced imaging (VNC) and iodi ne maps (CM) for differentiation between intraperitoneal haematomas and bowel structures. Methods or Background: 30 patients with intraperitoneal haematomas having received clinically indicated DECT. Quantitative pa rameters such as VNC (iodine removed), iodine maps (IM) and CT-mixed (equivalent to single energy- CT) values were collected in intraperitoneal haemat omas and adjacent bowel structures. Follow-up imaging and operative reports were used as a reference. Mean values of VNC, IM and CT-mixed in DECT images were compared using non-parametric tests. Diagnostic accuracy was asses sed by calculating receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Results are given as median with interquartile ranges. Results or Findings: CM values in DECT showed significant differences between intraperitoneal haematomas (3.6 HU [-2.4, 1 0]) and physiological (36.2 HU [22.6, 52.5])(p 0.0001). Analysis of revealed significant differences between haematomas (53.8 HU [32.1, 69.1]) and bowel structures (26.5 HU [-1, 47.9])(p 0.0001). No significant differences between haematomas (60 HU [34.9, 73.6]) and bowel structures (64.5 HU [26.3, 77.4]) were detected for CT-mixed.

P. Giandola\u00b9, C. Tal exam ination using model-based reconstruction algorithms (MBIR) can help reducing radiation dose exposure and improving image quality when comp ared to standard hybrid iterative algorithms (HIR). Methods or Background: 7000 CT scans in several anatomical districts (brain, thorax, abdomen, and whole body) in patient s referred to our department for medical emergencies were retrospecti vely evaluated. Two radiologists evaluated all CTs with a Likert scale (1 to 4), while signal-to-noise- ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) were used the dose-l ength-product (DLP) were analysed for each exam and compared on the basis of the acquisition and reconstruction data. Results or Findings: Mean CTDI values were lower with MBIR compared with HIR in different districts: brain (-29%), 36%), abdomen were lower in MBIR higher in MBIR in comparison with FBP : brain 16.2 vs 8.6, thorax 61.6 vs 18.73, abdomen 10.72 vs 6.58, whole- body 13.43 vs 6.58. CNR was higher in MBIR when compared with HIR: brain 3. 9 vs 2.2, thorax 58.9 vs 9.19, abdomen 4.64 vs 3.25, whole-body 4.84 vs 3.06. Images quality demonstrated a better quality of MBIR scans in comparison to HIR: brain 3 vs 2, thorax 3 vs 2, abdomen 3 vs 2, and whole-body 3 vs 1 (all p < 0.05).

Wassipaul*, D. Prosch, M. Scharitze r, H. Domanovits, K. Janata-Schwatczek, Weber, C. J. J. Herold, H. Ringl; Vienna/AT Purpose: Detection rate and positive-predictive-value of and ULDCT in non-traumatic emergency patients. Methods or Background: 294 consecutive non-traumatic emergency patients with a clinically indicated CXR were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were age >18years, informed consent and negative \u00df- HCG testing for women <55years. All participants received both examinatio ns, CXR and ULDCT, and were randomised into two arms with inverse reportin g order. ULDCT examinations were performed at 50 ref.mAs, 100 kV, tin-filtration and activated tube-current-modulation on a 3rd-generation 256-row MD-DSCT scanner. Findings from radiological reports and emergency physicians' diagnoses were reviewed by an expert radiologist and expert emergency physician to build a compound reference standard. Results or Findings: Mean total DLP of ULDCT scans was 12.7 mGy*cm corresponding to a mean effective dose (ED) of 0.21 mSv and relating to twice the mean ED of a CXR in two views of 0.1 mSv in the USA and the EU. ULDCT detected significantly more findings and diag noses than CXR as first imaging modality with 574 vs. 257 (p < 0.001) at a of 95.1% vs. 74.7%. As second imaging modality ULDCT added 365 findings to a prior CXR vs. 32 added by CXR to a prior ULDCT report (p < 0.001) at a PPV of 97.0% vs. 53.1%. Conclusion: ULDCT detected significantly more findings and diag noses than CXR in both study arms at only twice the mean radiation dose of a CXR in two views in the USA and the EU and might therefore bec ome an alternative primary imaging modality in non-traumatic emergency patients. Limitations: Higher ED of ULDCT than CXR. Subjective image quali ty wasn't evaluated. Limited number of patients per disease due to elaborate study design.

Reichel, D. G. radiation exposure, the whole-body CT is firmly established to exclude injuries of polytraumatised patients. Nevertheless, the indication for polytrauma CT in mild or moderately injured patients should be critical. The purpose was to investigate the accura cy of a \"fast\" whole-body MRI protocol in mildly or moderately injured patients as an alternative to CT with the aim to avoid radiation exposure. Methods or Background: In a prospective approach, 35 polytrauma-patients (74% men, 26% women, 47\u00b119,2 years) with an AIS score <3 and a trauma CT according to the guidelines, were included on a voluntary basis. Within a maximum of 5 days after the trauma, a whole-body MR I was performed with a fast protocol (scan time: 25 minutes). Two radiologists independently evaluated injuries using MRI in 7 body regions (cerebral, thoracic, abdominal, skeleton, extremities, vascular, lower extremity/soft tissue mantle). Both radiologists were unaware of the CT findings. The results of the MRI were compared with CT as standard of reference. Results or Findings: On whole-body MRI reading, both readers had substantial agreement (Cohen's k: 0.68, 95% CI: 56. 4-80.4). In MRI, 162 true negative, 31 true positive, 10 false negative, and 7 false positive findings were documented. Thus, MRI achieved a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96%, and an accuracy of (95% to whole-body MRI w ith a \"fast\" protocol is an alternative approach, especially for young patients with mild or moderate injuries. A further evaluation is required in order to determine for which injury patterns the sensitivity of the rapid MRI is limited. Limitations: Small number of patients.

Dietzel*\u00b9, P. Clauser\u00b2, H. Bickel\u00b2, \u00b2Vienna/AT In challenging (CCs), assessment of non- mass or subcentimetre lesions, breast-MRI diagnosis may be difficult. Clinical- Decision-Rules (CDR) provide evidence-based decision-support and could be of value in CCs. We investigated the diagnostic-per formance of two CDR in typical CCs. Methods or Background: Consecutive patients receiving MRI for non- screening indications at our institutions were retr ospectively included (506 patients, mean-age: 51.8 years). MRI was re-evaluat ed by an experienced blinded breast-radiologist. He assigned the empiric al G\u00f6ttingen-score (GS) derived Kaiser-score lesion 24.9%; significant background enhancement, and invasive-lobular cancer. Performance of GS and KS was compared within each C C (area under the receiver-operating characteristics-curve: AUC, Delong-test). Likewise, potential to avoid unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions bas ed on established high- sensitivity thresholds was compared (KS>4/GS standard- deviation = False 5, DCIS = 1) was similar within CCs (P: 0 .13 to 1.0). However, specificity of the KS (median= 78.5%, range 74.7%-8 4.5%) was superior to CCs, (median=40.4%, range 17.8%-56.7; all CCs: P<0.0001). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 120 Conclusion: In CCs, CDR provide accurate decision support to di stinguish benign from malignant breast-MRI lesions. Most of all, CDR showed promising potential to substantially reduce the number of unn ecessary biopsies in CCs.

Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of 282 breast MRI exams performed in 166 female patients (from January 2011 to June 2021), examined with FDP (full diagnostic protocol) on 1.5T unit at least twice: before the 1st cycle of NACT (pretreatment MRI) and for the early response assessment (after the 2nd cycle of NACT) and/or in the middle of the treatment (after the 4th cycle of NACT) and/or following the completion of NACT. The nature of the lesions was confirmed either by biopsy (US-CNB), following surgery or after the 2-yr-follow-up period. Results or Findings: There were 21 (7.45%) new lesions categorised as MR I- BI-RADS 4: 4 masses (19.05%; cm), 12 cm) and 5 foci (23.81%). The majority the lesions occurred in pre-menopausal patients (15/21, 71.43%). US-CNB was performed in 10 patients (47.62%), surgi cal removal of the lesion(s) with index tumours (mastectomy) was perfo rmed in 8 patients (38.09%) and the lesion regression was detected dur ing the 2-yr-follow-up in 3 patients (14.28%). Radiological-pathological correl ation was available for 18 lesions (85.71%). All of the lesions belong to B2 c 11.11%). Conclusion: The new detected lesions during the assessment of t umour response to NACT occur in 7.45%, predominantly as N ME lesions, pathologically confirmed as benign (B2). The new lesions developing during NACT are likely to be benign. Limitations: Relatively small number of patients in a single-centre retrospective study.

Allajbeu*, N. Payne, V. Papalouka, N. Healy, P. L. K. Morris, F. J. Gilbert; Cambridge/UK Purpose: To quantify the enhancement intensity and pattern o f different breast lesions with contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) and to investigate the correlation with enhancement types in breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods or Background: Using the CESM studies from the CONTEND and BRAID trials, three experienced breast radiologists calculated contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for each lesion identified in the tempo rally earlier (CC view, CNR1) and later (MLO view, CNR2) where CNR=Sa-Sb/Sb (Sa=m aximum pixel value in breast lesion, Sb=mean pixel value of background ). Relative signal difference (RSD) was calculated as (CNR2-CNR1)/(CNR 1)x100% and the enhancement patterns were classified as no enhancem ent, progressive (RSD>10%), plateau (-10% RSD 10%), or wash-out (RSD<-10%). Similarly, MRI enhancement patterns were recorded for 38 lesions that had a clinical breast MRI at the same episode. Results or Findings: From 75 research CESM studies, 70 lesions (3-110 mm ) were included in the study, from which 49 were canc ers (42 invasive, 7 non- invasive) and 21 normal/benign (7 B1, 12 B2 and 2 B 3). The CNR1 and RSD values were significantly lower for benign lesions than for invasive cancers (mean CNR1: 0.046 vs 0.066, p < 0.0095; mean RSD: 2 9.89 vs -8.48, p < 0.0001) but not significantly different for DCIS (m ean CNR1:0.046 vs 0.058, p < 0.07). Full agreement between CESM and MRI enhanc ement patterns was found in 29 of 38 cases (76.3%) with a Pearson chi- square value 2=54.5 and a Cram\u00e9r's V c=0.69 showing good correlation between the techniques. Conclusion: Quantification of enhancement intensity in CESM may be helpful to differentiate between benign and invasive breast lesions. Furthermore, there seems to be good correlation between MRI and CESM enhancement patterns. Limitations: Limited pathologies. Single centre.

V. Wong*, K. Rahmat, N. Ab Mumin, M. T. Ramli H amid, W. Y. Chan, F. Rozalli; Kuala Lumpur/MY (yeevoon@ummc.edu.my) Purpose: Ultrafast dynamic contrast-enhanced d emonstrated comparable diagnostic accuracy in characterisation of breast lesions. Three- dimensional sequence time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories (TWIST) allows rapid sequential imagin g within the first 2 minutes after contrast material injection at high temporal resolution. In this study, we aimed for evaluating the diagnostic performance of ultrafast DCE-MRI-derived kinetic parameters in detection of malignant breast lesions. Methods or Background: Fifty-five patients with suspicious BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions underwent standard breast MRI and ul trafast protocol (TWIST) between July 2020 and May 2021. Images were read by three radiologists in consensus. Ultrafast kinetic parameters were automa tically generated, maximum slope (MS), time to enhance (TTE), arteriov enous index (AVI), and maximal relative enhancement (MRE). These parameter s were compared using receiver operating characteristics (ROC), wit h p values <0.05 considered significant. Results or Findings: A total of 83 histopathologically proven lesions in 55 patients were analysed (34 benign, 49 malignant). 6 9 lesions were visualised on ultrafast MRI, comprising 48 malignant and 21 benign lesions. Of the malignant lesions, invasive carcinoma was most comm on n=34 (68.4%), followed by ductal carcinoma in with majority high grade (88%, AUC for MS and MRE were 0.836, 0.728, with sensitivity of 82.2%, 77.8% and specificity of 64.3 % and 57.1% respectively. MS and MRE demonstrated a significant difference between benign and malignant lesions, with p-value < 0.05. No signific ant difference was observed in TTE and AVI. Conclusion: Ultrafast DCE MRI-derived kinetic parameters, speci fically MS and MRE may be reliable in evaluating kinetics and differentiation of breast lesions, with advantages of reduced scanning time a nd cost-effectiveness.

The diagnostic efficiency of the category given by each group was compared. The BI-R ADS 4A lesions were combined with the prediction model alone to observe its diagnostic value for biopsy lesions. Results or Findings: The category given by examination group achieved th e highest diagnostic efficiency and its area under Wi thin all 4A lesions, some were redefined into follow-up category when they were consistent with benign models, while others were redefined into biopsy cat egory when they were consistent with malignant models. Then 80.17% of specificity and 94.50% of NPV in predicting biopsy lesions were achieved and the unnecessary biopsy rate was reduced (from 81.09% to 51.52%) on a base of lower risk of malignancy (from 18.91% to 5.5%). Conclusion: The midterm results of our multicentre study had co nfirmed CEUS prediction model could assist BI-RADS to improve its diagnostic value and reduce the unnecessary biopsy rate. Limitations: Due to the inconsistent familiarity of the physicians in the study centre with ACR BI-RADS\u00ae, the BI-RADS classificatio n of the in-situ lesions is not standardised, especially for the 4A lesions. Ethics committee approval: All hospitals in our multicentre study have received the ethics committee approval. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

Daniels*\u00b9, D. Last\u00b9, N. N. the breast provides high s ensitivity but variable specificity in detecting breast cancer, an d may lead to excessive benign biopsies. Treatment response assessment maps (TRAMs) are calculated from delayed-contrast MRI and reflect delayed-contrast clearance/accumulation. In brain tumour patients, T RAMs provide high sensitivity/specificity (>90%) for differentiating tumour (contrast clearance, blue in TRAMs)/non-tumour (accumulation, red) tissues, c urrently in routine clinical use. Here, we studied their application for reducin g benign biopsies in breast lesions. Methods or Background: 92 women with 133 breast lesions suspected as tumours were scanned by standard (including DCE) and delayed-contrast MRI. Lesions were determined by biopsy (119)/follow-up ( 18) as malignant/benign. The performance of benign/malignant classifiers cal culated from the TRAMs were studied using machine-learning (M L) leave- one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results or Findings: 100% of malignant lesions (78) appeared blue in the TRAMs while benign (55) lesions appeared mixed red/ blue. The lesion features found to be most predictive were: blue portion, blue intensity and largest blue cluster. The TRAMs-based classifier combining these features resulted vascular patterns for blue (vessels with closed/compressed lumens) and red (open lumens) regions. Conclusion: The TRAMs-based classifier may provide improved diagnosis of breast cancer as it resulted in nearly no false negatives and 60% of correctly identified benign tumours, thus allowing significan t reduction of benign biopsies. Expanding to more advanced ML methods and a larger cohort is ongoing. Limitations: Our cohort is naturally biased towards malignant lesions. Still, this does not affect the reliability determined by the n egligible percentage of false negatives. False positive cases were mainly due to hemangiomas/fat necrosis/fibroadenomas with myxoid components. Ethics committee approval: IRB approved.

Sassi*, M. Rinta-Kiikka, O. Arponen; Tampere/FI Purpose: The amount of incidental enhancing lesions in different biological subtypes of breast cancer remains unknown. As incid ental enhancing lesions pose a frequent diagnostic and surgical problem, mo re research is needed to improve their management. We assessed the prevalenc e and prognostic factors of incidentally detected breast lesions. Methods or Background: Although conventional mammography and ultrasound are the primary imaging modalities in br east cancer diagnostics, breast MRI has gained a growing role in preoperativ e staging. Breast MRI has superior sensitivity, but limited specificity in detecting malignant breast lesions. The percentual share of patients with incidental only-MRI-detected enhancing lesions ranges between 11-29%. We retrospectively c ollected all preoperative breast MRI examinations in Tampere University Hospi tal (TaUH) between the years 2014-2019. Altogether 948 patients with invas ive primary breast tumours underwent breast MRI examination, of which 167 had at least one incidental enhancing breast lesion requiring core needle biops y. We collected clinical and histopathological data from the medical records. Results or Findings: Patients with luminal A invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (NST) had a higher prevalence of all i ncidental enhancing lesions (p=0.038) and malignant incidental lesions (p=0.011 ) in breast MRI. Incidental enhancing lesions in the contralateral breast had a lower malignancy rate (27.3% vs. 59.1%, p<0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, the most substantial finding of this study is the higher incidence of incidental MRI-detected and mal ignant MRI-detected breast lesions in patients with invasive NST-breast cancer of luminal A biological subtype. Therefore, histological type an d biological subtypes of breast cancer should be considered when planning to subject patient to preoperative breast MRI.

Messina*, C. L. L. Piccolo, Sammarra, B. Beomonte Zobel; Rome/IT Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiologic al features of B3 breast lesions in patients with genetic mutations t o establish an anatomo- radiological correlation. Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled 227 women with histological diagnosis of B3 breast lesion at the B reast Unit of our Institute from 2010 to 2021. Among this group, we identified 21 pa tients with genetic test positivity for high, intermediate and low penetranc e mutated genes associated with breast cancer (BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM). Mammographic, sonographic and MRI studies were evaluated according to the BI- RADS lexicon (5th edition). Results or Findings: BRCA was the most frequent mutation (n=15) followed by ATM mutation (n=6). Histological findings showed 9 ductal hyperplasia (ADH), neoplasia (LIN) including in situ (LCIS), 3 flat epithelial atypia (FEA) and 3 radial scar (RS). Microcalcifications were the most frequent findings in mammography (71% ) with a prevalence of 75% in ADH, 50% in LIN and 100% in RS and FEA. Only 6 patients had a negative mammography, but they presented pathologic al features at MRI. MRI was performed in 12 patients and it demonstrated a \"non-mass like\" enhancement in all patients, with the final diagnos is of ADH (n=6), FEA (n=3) and LIS (n=3). We did not find sonographic findings in patients with BRCA mutation. All patients with ATM mutation had a hypo echoic nodule with irregular margins, interpreted with a high risk of malignancy (BI-RADS US 5). Definitive histological diagnosis showed RS (n=3) a nd LIN (n=3). Conclusion: According to our experience, B3 lesions in mutation carrier patients show high suspicious radiological features . Our results are promising but more studies are necessary in the future. Limitations: The study included a small sample of patients. Ethics committee approval: Approval for this study by an ethics committee was not necessary. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

A. S. Voort\u00b9, M. association between pre- radiotherapy tumour burden and overall survival (OS ) adjusted for the prognostic value of MGMT promoter methylation in ne wly diagnosed glioblastoma receiving radio-/chemotherapy with tem ozolomide. Methods or Background: Patients were included from the EORTC CENTRIC (EORTC-26071) and CORE (EORTC-22072) trials if post -operative MRI scans were available within a timeframe of 3 weeks after surgery and up to 4 weeks before radiotherapy, including both pre- and post-c ontrast T1w images and at least one T2w sequence (T2w or FLAIR). Automated segmentation was performed on post-operative (residual) pre-radiotherapy tumour to obtain volumetric measurement of (i) contrast-enhancing (C ET) and (ii) non- enhancing T2w hyperintensity (NET) tumour component s. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan Meier estimates were used to assess the prognostic power of CET / NET tumour volume for OS compared to known prognostic factors (age and performance status). Results or Findings: 408 tumour segmentations (MGMT methylated, n=270) were included in main analysis. Median OS for M GMT unmethylated tumours was 61 weeks versus 116 weeks for MGMT methylated tumors (p<0.001) without significant correlation between M GMT methylation status and CET volumes. When stratified for MGMT methylati on status higher CET volume (HR 1.02, 95%CI; p<0.001) and older age (HR 1.66, 95%CI: 1.212-2.278, P=0.002) were significantly ass ociated with shorter OS while NET volume and performance status were not. Conclusion: Pre-radiotherapy contrast enhanced tumour volume was strongly associated with overall survival in patients receiv ing radio/chemotherapy adjusted for the MGMT promoter methylation status.

Schouman-Claeys*\u00b9, J-C. (eschouman@gmail.com) To develop, initially at a national level, a standa rd on imaging quality, covering the services we offer in radiology structures and patient care before, during and after the examination. The stand ard should be applicable to any radiological structure, public or private; be as close as possible related to our professional practice; and apprehend the whole patient management and pathway, whatever the imaging technique used. Methods or Background: The initiative is the result of the practical exper ience we acquired by conducting voluntary quality audits in France since 2004, under the coordination of the profession. It showed the n eed to broaden our experience and of validated references in a context where most of the current standards are focused on equipment and radiation pr otection. The work implied the participation of various professionals and stakeholders, including patients, government agencies and regulatory bodies representatives. Results or Findings: The work led to the publication in July 2021 by AFN OR, the French standardisation body, of the standard NF S99-300 \"Quality approach in medical imaging\". Conclusion: Based on this dynamic, the future step is to try to develop a European dynamic leading to the construction of a c ommon standard. This is the rationale for the proposal of the establishment of a new Technical Committee at the CEN (European Committee for Standa rdization). Limitations: The extent of the scope and content of the future project is open to discussion. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: SFR (French Society of Radiology).

The aim of this stu dy was to evaluate the value of T2 TSE mDixon instead of other fat-suppression t echniques. Methods or Background: In a tertiary referral centre, 22 patients with sof t tissue tumours, such as leiomysarcoma, fibrosarcoma and liposarcoma, were included. They all underwent MRI with standard T2 S PAIR fat suppression on 3T. A T2TSE mDixon sequence was added to the existi ng scan protocol; the same field of view (FOV) and scan region as for the T2 multivane SPAIR were used. Images were visually analysed by a dedicated soft-tissue radiologist on image quality and artefacts. After every 5 scans, t he mDixon sequence was improved by changing various parameters, such as NS A, K-space and slice thickness, to gain an optimal SNR without artefacts and acceptable scan time. All mDixon sequences and the SPAIR were repeated on a phantom which consisted of an apple and bacon to measure signal a nd noise. Results or Findings: Absolute SNR has improved from 1,88 to 2,278: comparing SPAIR to mDixon. Susceptibility artefacts were eliminated. Total scan time has been reduced by 34 seconds. Conclusion: T2 TSE mDixon is a good replacement for the T2 SPAI R mv for the soft-tissue protocol on MRI. This is a great advantage, especially when used in a large FOV. Limitations: Only a small amount of scans were made in a single- centre study. To increase the reliability of the study, a multicentre study can still be considered.

Methods or Background: An image-guided form of superficial radiation therapy (IGSRT) was developed in 2013 where the tum our configuration and depth can be visualised prior to, during and subsequent to treatments, using a 22 megahertz (MHz) dermal ultrasound (U.S.) with a doppler component. We previously published the results using this technol ogy to treat 2917 early-stage epithelial cancers showing a high local control (LC ) rate of 99.3%. We compared these results with similar American studies from a comprehensive literature search used in an article/guideline publ ished by the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) on curative radiation treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and squamous cell carcinoma in-situ (SCCIS) lesions from 1988 to 2018. Only U.S. based studies with greater than 100 cases with similar patient/lesion characteristics and stages treated by external beam, electron or superf icial/orthovoltage radiation therapy were included in the criteria for selection. The resultant 4 studies had appropriate comparable cases identified and the dat a analysed/calculated with regard to local control. Logistic regression analys is was performed comparing each study to IGSRT individually and collectively w ith stratification by histology (BCC, SCC, and SCCIS). Results or Findings: IGSRT LC was found to be statistically superior to each of the 4 non-image-guided radiation therapy studies individually and collectively (as well as stratified by histology su btype) with p-values ranging Results of IGSRT in local control were statisticall y significantly superior across the board versus non-image-guided r adiation modalities in treatment of epithelial NMSC and should be consider ed a new gold standard for treatment of early-stage cutaneous BCC, SCC, an d SCCIS.

RPS 416-6 Skeletal muscle cut-offs to determine 3-month survi val in frail older cancer *A. nd psoas muscle index (PMI) cut-offs could predict 3-month overall survival (OS) and thus treatability in frail older cancer patients. Methods or Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for PMI. Low SMI and PMI, i.e. sarcop enia, are associated with poor survival in many cancers, but older frail patients are underrepresented in this research. The optimal oncologic treatment decisions for over-75-year-old frail cancer patients are chal lenging and optimised at Tampere University Hospital by comprehensive geriat ric assessment (CGA) and experimental SMI- and PMI-assessment were retrospectively assessed fr om CT scans of 43 males and 37 females; median age 80 (range 75-91) y ears. Optimal cut-offs were determined using the Younden method to predict 3-month OS-rates. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression were used. Median reverse Kaplan-Meier follow-up was 31 months. Results or Findings: Optimal cut-offs for SMI were 42.5 cm2/m2 for men and 33.1 cm2/m2 for women, and for PMI 4.39 cm2/m2 71% vs. 95% for PMI, with median OS of 11.5 vs. 14.4 months (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.1-3.1) for SMI and 11.5 v s. 12.9 months (1.31; 0.7- 2.4) for PMI. A Cox model for 3-month OS cut-off sh owed HR of 3.9 (95% CI 0.7-41) for SMI, 2.5 (0.4-16.8) for ECOG points. Conclusion: SMI and PMI can predict 3-month survival and thus guide in oncological treatment selection for older frail cancer patients. Limitations: Heterogenous and small patient sample.

Fervers\u00b9, F. Fervers\u00b2, D. Zopfs\u00b9, R. of virtual non-calcium (VNCa) bone marrow images of the spine in a large-scale cohort of healthy individuals. Methods or Background: Methods: The assessment of contrast-enhanced, dual-energy CT was fully automated and deep-learning supported and did not require specific user interaction. The thoracolumbar spine was segmented by a challenge winning, pre-trained convolutional neuron al network. Attenuation histograms of volumetric VNCa data were created for each exam and suppression setting. The percentage overlap of hist ograms in consecutive scans assessed the intra-individual consistency of our method. Background: VNCa images have shown high potential t o diagnose bone marrow malignancy of the spine, which is frequently disguised by dense trabecular bone on conventional CT. Yet, there is a lack of reference values defining the physiological appearance of the spine on VNCa data. Results or Findings: 500 exams of 168 individuals were included (88 female, patient age 61.0 \u00b1 15.9). In total, 8298 vertebrae were segmented (median 17 [interquartile range (IQR) 16-17] vertebrae per exam). Median overlap of histograms in two consecutive exams was 0.93 [IQR 0.88-0.96]. Bone marrow attenuation presented distinct age- and sex-specifi c profiles, which are reported in detail as part of the full manuscript. Conclusion: Automated, volumetric assessment is an intra-indivi dually robust method to evaluate the spine's bone marrow using VN Ca data. We provide the bone marrow attenuation profiles of a large-scale c ohort of healthy individuals as a reference for future studies. Limitations: Normal values are restricted to the specific scanne r we used. Yet the methodology is transferable to other imaging pr otocols. Ethics committee approval: IRB approved study.

Methods or Background: In 2016 Radiology made the use of the STARD guidelines mandatory for its authors. Our MEDLINE s earch identified 66 diagnostic accuracy studies published in Radiology in 2015 and 2019. The quality of reporting was assessed by two independent reviewers using the revised STARD statement. Item 11 was excluded because a meaningful decision about adherence was not possible. Studen's t-test for independent samples was used to analyse differences in the mean number of reported STARD items related to publication date, data collection, study design and citation rate. Results or Findings: Oncological imaging was the main topic of most of t he analysed studies (65.2%). The mean total number of reported STARD items of all included 66 diagnostic accuracy studies was 18. 6 \u00b1 2.4 of 29 items (64.1%). Adherence of diagnostic accuracy studies to the STA RD statement significantly improved from 17.7 \u00b1 2.4 in 2015 to 19.9 \u00b1 1.9 in 2 019 (p<0.001). No evidence of a difference was found for data collection (p=0. 67), study design (p=0.86) and citation rate (p=0.34). Conclusion: Overall adherence of diagnostic accuracy studies to the STARD statement in Radiology is moderate to good with a r elevantly better adherence after the use of the STARD guidelines became mandat ory. Limitations: We changed the original STARD checklist by excluding item 11 and only focused on studies published in Radiology. Due to these two points, the generalisability of our study may be limited. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

A multice ntre, H. Yang\u00b3, \u00b2Tianjin/CN, \u00b3Nanning/CN, Wuhan/CN, Shanghai/CN Purpose: We aimed to systematically investigate the value of Sonazoid-CEUS for diagnosing FLLs in different liver backgrounds compared to CEMRI/CECT. Methods or Background: This multicentre, prospective study included 915 patients with FLLs from 23 centres in China. SCEUS and CEMRI/CECT were performed between August 2020 and March 2021, and t he results were divided into four groups: (I) non-hepatitis and non-fatty l iver background, (II) hepatitis and non-fatty liver background, (III) non-hepatitis and fatty liver background, and (IV) hepatitis and fatty liver background. The diagnostic performance between SCEUS and CEMRI/CECT was compared. Diagnost ic performance was analysed using the McNemar test and chi-square test. Results or Findings: 915 participants (56.5 years \u00b1 12.2) were enrolled. We found that, regardless of liver backgrounds, SCEUS has high sensitivity and accuracy. Although the specificity in SCEUS, CEMRI/CECT is low in patients with hepatitis, SCEUS could significantly improve s pecificity re spectively). Although the specificity and accuracy in group III between S CEUS and CEMRI/CECT did not show significant difference (P>0.05), it is sti ll lower than that in group I. Conclusion: SCEUS has good performance in the differentiation b etween malignant and benign FLLs in different liver backgr ounds and is a more reliable tool than CEMRI/CECT, especially in patients with h epatitis. Accurate diagnosis using imaging is essential to determine t he correct treatment strategy.

Wormanns; Berlin/DE RPS 405-2 stratification for nodule s: comparing a learning approach multiparametric *L. Piskorski*, Purpose: Artificial intelligence is a promising tool helping clinicians estimate the risk of malignancy in pulmonary nodules. Previo us studies have been performed on highly preselected patient data. We us ed a clinically derived dataset, to compare the AI-based Optellum lung canc er prediction score (LCP score) to the Brock model and Lung-RADS\u00ae. Additionally, we investigated whether underlying pulmonary structural changes due to emphysema or fibrosis affect LCP scoring. Methods or Background: We conducted a retrospective study analysing CT images of incidental pulmonary nodules measuring 5- 30 mm. Ground-truth diagnosis was defined by histology (mandatory for m alignant nodules) or follow-up stability. Final analysis was performed o n 297 patients with 422 eligible nodules, of which 106 nodules in 95 patients were malignant. Results or Findings: Overall AUC score was 91,5% (p<0,005). AUC for assessing nodules patients emphysema slightly lower, with 90,6% (95% CI 86,2 compared to to 96,1), but not si gnificantly (p=0,503). Similarly for patients with fibrosis, an AUC of 88, 2% (95% CI 78,6 compared to 89,5% (95% CI 79,4 to 99,5) i n the control group (p=0,86). Conclusion: We could replicate previous studies showing LCP score outperforming Brock model, even when used in a clinically derived dataset. For the first time, we could show LCP score outperformi ng Lung-RADS\u00ae as well. Additionally, LCP scoring is not significantly affected when analysing nodules in patients with pulmonary emphysema or fibrosis. Limitations: Larger patient numbers needed for confirming the ap plicability of LCP score in emphysema and fibrosis patients.

AI-aided detection of nodules is helpful but the large volum e of unneeded alerts may cause radiologist fatigue. Filtration of AI findings via radiology report analysis will notify radiologists only of unreported nodules , reducing unnecessary alerts. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of 1,727 consecutive chest CT scans and corresponding reports. Scans processed by computer vision (CV) nodule detection algorithm (IMedis Ltd.). Associated radiology reports tagged by radiology resident to indicate mention/absence of nodules 6 mm. Combined outputs classified by 3 senior radiologist s. Results or Findings: Nodules 6mm were detected by AI in 588 cases, of which 169 were unreported as per report analysis. C onsensus radiologist review confirmed 23 cases with true unreported nodules, 111 cases with findings that were not nodules and 35 cases with no dules that were determined to be insignificant. Radiologist review revealed most non-nodule findings to be multifocal, infectious or inflammatory process. Lan guage for such processes was not considered as positive nodule mention at re port processing stage. Conclusion: Dual algorithm combining CV analysis of chest CTs and human report tagging outputs a relatively small number (9.8%) of scans for re-review, with high probability (13.6%) of clinically signifi cant missed nodules. In comparison, a CV only algorithm would produce 3.5 t imes as many alerts. Overall, in 1.1% (23/1727) of cases an actionable m issed nodule was detected. The high yield, small volume output of the dual alg orithm may justify radiologist review of these flagged cases, improving detection of actionable pulmonary nodules with minimal increased workload. Limitations: NLP would be the optimal method of report tagging but was not available in the report language (Hebrew).

Meanwhile, according to the new BTS guidelines, the use of volumetrics of noduli could result in earlier disch arge. Using AI in clinical practice is expensive. Determining the cost-effecti veness of AI is important for implementing these methods in routine clinical prac tice. To determine whether using the use of CAD of pulmonary nodules on computed tomography (CT) scan results in earlier di scharge from follow-up for lung noduli. Methods or Background: For this retrospective cohort study, consecutive patients screened with thoracic CT for pulmonary no dules follow-up were included. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients that could have been discharged earlier from follow-up based on the current BTS guidelines when using CAD for volumetrics. Secondary outcomes include nodule measurements, time saved when examining CT-scans wi th the aid of AI, and accuracy of AI in the detection of pulmonary noduli . Results or Findings: A total of 300 patients were included. Preliminary results of 50 patients show that based on current BTS guidelines 10 (20%) patients could have been discharged earlier from follow-up using computer-aided detection volumetrics. Additionally, with the use of AI, thoracic CT scans were examined 13% faster than without. Preliminary resul ts show no missed noduli in the AI analysis of thoracic CT scans. Conclusion: Based on current BTS guidelines, using AI in detect ing and measuring pulmonary nodules for lung cancer screeni ng leads to a shorter follow-up period and therefore a reduction of unnec essary CT scans. Limitations: Single-centre, retrospective cohort. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Financial support from Northwest Clinics, Alkmaar.

Predicting post-COVID pulmonar y sequelae applying AI to imaging and clinical data: prelimina ry results of an Italian multicentre study Al\u00ec\u00b9, As reported by the WHO, about 33% of COVID-19 patients have reported pulmonary fibrosis after the disease. However, currently it isn't possible to predict which patients will have lung s equelae. Thus, we designed a retrospective, multicentre study with the aim to develop an AI-based algorithm able to predict which patients will have pulmonary sequelae within one year after the disease. Methods or Background: Comorbidities, laboratory, ventilatory and imaging data acquired during the COVID hospitalisation were collected and used to train the algorithms. Moreover, CT-exams performed within 12 months of the disease were evaluated by an expert radiologist to assess the presence of post-COVID pulmonary sequelae. We developed a radiomic model which uses four classifiers: extra decision tree, gradient boosting, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). After that, an ensemble model, which combines conceptually different machine-learning classifiers and uses a majority vote to predict the class labels, was used. Results or Findings: A total of 118 patients (45 females) with complete clinical, laboratory and imaging data were analysed. Out 118 patients, 44 subjects (37%) with pulmonary sequelae were reporte d at CT scan. The developed models showed a balanced accuracy of 72% for the extra decision tree, 71% for the gradient boosting, 69% for the random forest and 67% for the SVM. The ensemble model, using a majority voting, obtained a balanced accuracy of 71%, a sensibility of 75%, a specificit y of 67% and a f1-score of 77%. Conclusion: The ensemble model showed robust results in predict ing pulmonary sequelae in post-COVID patients. Limitations: The main limitation is the dimension of the dataset , but since the data collection is still ongoing further analysis w ill be made.

Methods or Background: We developed a CNNs model to detect the presence or absence of pneumonia on frontal chest r adiographs. The convolution base of pre-trained CNNs model on ImageNet dataset was trained and validated on 26684 chest radiograph images (601 2 positive for pneumonia) based on the database from the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge. The performance of the CNNs model was compared with interpretations from four radiologists on 427 random test images using McNemar test for sensitivity and specificity. Results or Findings: For the entire test set, the accuracy of the CNNs m odel was 76.5%, with the area under the receiver operati ng characteristic curve of 0.91. Our CNNs model had a significantly higher sensitivity (81.0%) than one r adiologist (79.3%, p< .0.01). Conclusion: Our transfer learning-based CNNs model has a good classification performance for the detection of pne umonia. Limitations: The RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset is an imbalanc ed dataset.

Yi*; Changsha/CN (yixiaoping@csu.edu.cn) Purpose: It is extremely urgent to identify those patients a t higher transition risk to severe and critical disease in patients wit h no-severe COVID-19 at the first visit. The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chest CT-based deep-learning prediction system (DLPS) could be use d to predict the risk of transition to severe illness in patients with initi al diagnosis of mild COVID-19 infection. Methods or Background: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with mild common-subtype illness were retrospectively recruited between January 21, 2020 and March 19, 2020. Using a semantic segmentation module to segment muscle areas in chest CT images and a multi -window extraction technique by employing three sub-networks to select three different window widths and window levels of muscle region CT image, the feature-level and decision-level information of the three sub-network s are integrated to obtain the prediction results. Results or Findings: A total of 540 patients were included. Forty-eight of the enrolled patients transitioned to severe illness. W e found that the DLPS achieved high performance in identifying the critic ally ill patient of COVID-19 by using early CT images, e.g. 93.3% and specificity was 78.2%. Compared with other well-known CNN methods, our DLPS 10.9%, 6.5%, 8.9%, and 12.7% on AUC, accur acy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Conclusion: We found chest CT-derived automated measurements of thoracic muscle to be associated with higher risk of transit ion to severe illness in patients affected by COVID-19 who presented initial ly as having the mild common-subtype infection. Limitations: First, it was a single-centred, retrospective study . Second, the number of cases was relatively small. Ethics committee approval: This single-centred, retrospective study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Xiangya Hospital.

Keisa*, M. Radzina, Micena, Riga/LV (laura_keisha@inbox.lv) Purpose: After two years of the pandemic, more than 250 mill ion people have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Artificial intelligence(AI) has been recognised as an important tool for diagnosis of lung lesions caused by COVID-19 infection. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of AI by evaluating each lung segment and to determine the limitations and benefits of interpretation in a clinical context. Methods or Background: Clinical and imaging data of two groups with a mean age of 65 years(26-99 years): patients with PC R confirmed COVID-19 infection (n=250) and a healthy control group (n=50 ) of COVID-19 negative patients were retrospectively analysed. Non-enhance d CT of the thorax evaluation was performed by a cloud-based AI software which provides an objective quantification of the degree of lung involvement in the different lung regions and per lesion type as well as by an experi enced radiologist. Results or Findings: The highest accuracy (Acc) of AI performance in detection of COVID-19 lesions was in the right lower lobe despite lowest Sp- 38% and Acc Sp The main reasons for inaccuracy were Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 127 due to mild or soft ground-glass opacity or markedl y intense infiltrations-dense or extensive alveolar consolidations. Conclusion: AI has proven to be an effective tool in assessing the COVID-19 lung damage by providing useful data about the prognostic extent of the disease, although AI results should be supervised by an experienced radiologist due to suboptimal specificity in the ri ght lower lobe and left upper lobe as a result of minor or extensive interstitial involvement affecting calculation precision.

KOHLI*, T. Jha, A. B. Pazhayattil; Mumbai/IN (dranirudhkohli@gmail.com) Purpose: An important component of a pandemic like Covid 19 is to triage patients in order to prevent medical establishments from getting overwhelmed. The objective of our study is to find whether an initial HRCT chest can help triage patient by determining their oxygen requirem ent, the place of treatment, and the risk of mortality and to compare 3 CT scori ng systems to find if one is a better predictor of prognosis than the other. Methods or Background: This was a prospective observational study. Data collected included demographics, days from swab pos itivity to CT scan, comorbidities, place of treatment, laboratory param eters, oxygen requirement and mortality. We divided the patients into mild, m oderate and severe based on 3 criteria - 20 point CT score (OS1), 25 point C T score (OS2) and opacity percentage (OP). CT scans were analyzed using CT pneumonia analysis prototype software. Results or Findings: 1721 patients were included in our study. All the 3 scoring systems showed a significant positive correlation with oxygen requirement, place of admission and death. Based on ROC analysis a score of 4 for OS1, 8 for OS2 and 12.65% for OP was determin ed as the cut off for oxygen requirement. Conclusion: An early CT scan in patients affected by Covid-19 i s predictive of the oxygen requirement of the patient. The severity scoring system can be based on lobar involvement or based on percentage of lung involved, as they are all predictive of oxygen requirement. CT severi ty scoring using an automated deep learning software programme is a boon for triage. As the score increases, the chances of requirement of high er oxygen increases. Limitations: This was a singlecentre study and hence representat ive of data in a particular community. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was waived.

Mota*, F. L. C. M. Santos, I. Matos, F. M. Antu nes, C. Senra, P. F. G. T. Sousa, I. Marques; Vila Nova de Gaia/PT (cristina.sousa.mota@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate an AI-bas ed prototype algorithm for fully automated quantification of emp hysema on chest CT compared with the performance of the radiologists. Methods or Background: Emphysema is a complex and heterogeneous disease that can benefit from novel approaches to u nderstanding its evolution. Traditional evaluation of emphysema on CT is based on visual assessments, which can be subjective and prone to variation. Art ificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can be useful for the quantification of emphysema and the discrimination between the different types of emphy sema. In this work, we conducted a retrospective analysis, and a total of 348 who underwent chest CT acquisition in January of 2021 were randomly includ ed in this study. AI algorithm determines the emphysema index as the vol umetric percentage of the areas of low CT attenuation (-950 HU). The visu al classification of the emphysema subtype by the radiologists was made accordingly to the Fleischner Society visual emphysema CT patterns. Results or Findings: The results obtained show that AI-based emphysema quantification showed a very strong correlation wit h the visual classification of the different degrees of emphysema severity by the radiologists and that the AI algorithm mainly failed to report low grades of emphysema. We then performed a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to determine the cutoff point for each subtype of emphysema. Conclusion: Taken together, our work shows that AI-based fully automated emphysema quantification could be a useful complementary tool to an image- based diagnosis and quantification of emphysema sev erity. Limitations: Careful replication studies and reevaluation of the AI algorithm are needed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Novak*, A. Gill, P. S. Ather, F. Gleeson; Oxford/UK (alex.novak@ouh.nhs.uk) Purpose: To evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence-enhanced image analysis on the performance of acute care clinicians when identifying pneumothoraces on plain chest radiography. Methods or Background: Clinical readers were recruited from 4 different UK hospital sites, representing varying levels of seni ority across 6 different clinical specialties (Emergency Medicine, Acute General Medi cine, Intensive Care Medicine, Cardiothoracic Surgery, Respiratory Medic ine and Radiography). Using an online platform, readers interpreted 400 c hest x-ray images with respect to the presence or absence of pneumothorax, then repeated the interpretation after a 3-week washout phase, this t ime with the addition of an imaging heatmap and confidence score for the presence/absence of a pneumothorax as detected by the GE Critical Care Suite, an AI-enhanced image analysis algorithm. Reporting accuracy was compared in all readers with and without the AI overlay, along with time taken t o report the images. Results or Findings: 18 clinical readers participated in the study, with a resultant total of 144,000 image interpretations. A verage sensitivity (95% CI) to detect pneumothoraces improved from 65.4% (54.5 to 76.2) to 76.0 (67.0 to 84.9)%, p = 0.003. Average specificity (95% improved from 93.2 (90.2 to 96.3)% to 95.0 (92.5 to 97.6)% but this was not sta tistically significant (p = 0.25). Average (95% CI) time to complete scans decr eased by 11% (9 to 13%) from 33 seconds to 29 seconds. Conclusion: AI-enhanced image analysis can be used to significa ntly improve frontline clinicians' accuracy in correctly identif ying pneumothoraces on plain chest radiography. Limitations: This study used an enriched dataset with an artific ially high prevalence of pneumothoraces (50%).

Acar; Izmir/TR RPS 403-2 Listo*\u00b9, patte rns of ventricular involvement in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC). Different conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy or acute myocardial injur y, particularly acute myocarditis, may mimic a left dominant AC. Methods or Background: The most frequent genetic mutations associated with AC are plakophilin2 and desmoplakin. The most common form of this cardiomyopathy usually affects the right ventricle (RV) but left dominant (LD) or biventricular forms are also described. Fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium and ventricular arrhythmias with preserv ed systolic function is hallmark of this condition, but in advanced stages eventually, ventricular dysfunction may occur. This cardiomyopathy is more frequent in young adults and clinical manifestations range from no symptoms to life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Results or Findings: Compared to the International task force criteria, recent \"Padua Criteria\" include late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) as a major criterion. Acute myocardial damage in the setting of LDAC, mostly associated with desmoplakin mutation, may be indistinguishable from myocarditis, making a diagnosis challenging. The combination of SSFP intramyocardial \"India ink\", T2-STIR edema and LGE may help to make this differential diagnosis. We propose a new classification of AC, depending on the a) ventricular presentation at MRI, b) genetic mutation and c) presence of acute myocardial damage at MRI: desmoplakin chronic (no edema) negative/phenotype positive (all presentations) AC. Conclusion: Different MRI patterns of ventricular involvement i n AC are associated with different prognoses: desmoplakin LD ACs are more arrhythmogenic whereas plakophilin2 AC is more prone to heart failure. MRI is a key tool to identify AC excluding myocarditis, to suggest the potential genetic mutation and to provide prognostic stratification. Limitations: Studies are needed to validate this classification. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

In this study, differences in diastolic function be tween diseases were assessed using feature tracking strain-rate imaging. Methods or Background: 20 FD patients with severe myocardial involvement and 44 patients with HHD were retrospectively ident ified. 62 prospectively recruited individuals served as healthy controls (H C). In addition to clinical standard (volumetry, T1-mapping, LGE-assessment), feature-tracking strain analysis was performed and strain rates were utilised to assess diastolic function by passive and active ven tricular filling (E-/A-waves) and calculation of E/A strain-rate ratios. Results Findings: g/m2 vs. compared (58.7\u00b18.9 g/m2). FD patients showed similar E /A HC, while HHD showed significantly redu ced E/A strain-rate ratios compared to both other groups (HHDvsHCvsHD: 1.4\u00b11.3 vs. 4.2\u00b13.6 vs. 2.4\u00b11.6). This was driven by a significant reductio n of the A-wave in FD compared to HC/HHD (FDvsHCvsHHD: 0.4\u00b10.2 vs. 0.6\u00b10. 2 vs. 0.5\u00b10.3) and a reduction of the E-wave in HHD compared E/A strain-rate ratios, caused by a lower A-wave, suggesting a co-existing impairment of atrial function. HHD showed a reduction in passive ventric ular filling as a sign of predominantly disturbed myocardial relaxation with preserved active filling. Therefore, E/A-ratios should be used carefully to assess diastolic dysfunction in FD. Limitations: This study is a single-centre retrospective study.

Methods or Background: We assessed the impact of using MRI techniques to guide ICT on IOL outcomes in a cohort of 99 pati ents with TM (mean age at baselines 20.7\u00b16.9 years) followed from 2006 to 2019. We also assessed the ability of serum ferritin (SF) trends to predict ch anges in consecutive liver iron concentration (LIC) and cardiac T2* (cT2*) measurem ents. Results or Findings: Patients with (<7 mg/g dw) increase d from 57% to 77%, values (>20 ms) incr eased from 72% to 86%. We obtained the most significant improvement in pat ients with severe and moderate liver (p=0.006 and p<0.001) and cardiac (p<0.0013 and p<0.0001) IOL at baseline. SF trends were in the same directi on in 64% of changes in LIC, but only 42% of changes were proportional. Mos t of the changes in SF (64%) and LIC (61%) could not predict changes in cT 2*. Moreover, downward trends in SF and LIC were associated with worsening cardiac iron in 29% and 23.5% of consecutive cT2* measurements. Conclusion: Liver and cardiac MRI-driven oral iron chelation im proved the iron status of subjects with TM and demonstrated the importance of using validated MRI techniques in critical clinical decisions. Limitations: First, it includes retrospective and observational data. Second, MRI study intervals varied among individual patient s. Third, in this single- centre experience, the study population is relatively small. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by Ege University's Institutional Review Board.

Li*, Z-G. Yang, Yang, R. Shi, J. Li; Cheng du/CN (393549991@163.com) Purpose: To evaluate the impact of T2DM on right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction and interventricular interaction using cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (CMR-FT) in patients with essential hypertension. Methods or Background: Seventy-five 2DM+)] and fifty-four normal controls were included in this study. The bi -ventricular global radial, circumferential and longitudinal peak strain (GRS, GCS, GLS) and regional strain of RV including basal-cavity, mid-cavity, apical-cavity strain were calculated and compared among groups. Backwards stepwise multivariable linear regression analyses were used to determine t he effect of T2DM and LV strains on RV strains. Results or Findings: Biventricular GLS and apical longitudinal strain of RV deteriorated significantly from controls, through H TN(T2DM-), to HTN(T2DM+) group; middle longitudinal strains of RV in both pa tient groups were significantly reduced, and LV GRS and GCS and basal longitudinal strain of RV were decreased in HTN(T2DM+) but preserved in HT N(T2DM-) group. In patients with hypertension, multivariable regression analyses adjusted for covariates demonstrated that T2DM was independently associated and RV G LS (p=0.018, model R2=0.136) but not with RV GCS and GRS. When T2DM and LV GLS were included the ( =0.394, p<0.001, model R2=0.194) independently associated with RV GLS. Conclusion: These findings indicate that T2DM may exacerbate RV systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension, which may be associated with superimposed LV dysfunction by coexisting T2DM, suggesting adverse interventricular interaction.

Pu*, B. Cui, J. Liu, W. He, Lin, L. Peng; Ch engdu/CN Purpose: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune multi-organ disorder with frequent cardiovascular involvement. We aimed to evaluate myocardial involvement in SLE patients by cardiac m agnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping. Methods or Background: 38 SLE patients and 26 healthy age- and gender- matched controls were enrolled and underwent CMR ex amination. The association of T1 mapping parameters [including nat ive T1 and extracellular volume (ECV)] with native T2, LGE, and clinical var iables was analysed. Results or Findings: The native T1 and ECV were significantly higher than that of the control group (1308.26\u00b158.49ms vs. 1227.04\u00b140.61ms, 34.18\u00b14.85% vs. 28.34\u00b13.00%, respectively; all ECV (r=0.636, p<0.001). Global native T1 and ECV had moderate with native T2 (r = 0.517 and 0.583, respectively; all p <0.001), while they had no correlation with LGE ( p>0.05). Both native T1 and ECV had similar degree of correlation with pericardial effusion, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), C-reactive protein (CR P), myoglobin, and troponin T (r = 0.322-0.518, all p <0.05). Besides, native T 1 was also associated with creatine kinase-MB, brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP) <0.05). Conclusion: CMR mapping enables early detection of diffuse m yocardial fibrosis in SLE. The correlation of ECV with elevated T2 indicates that myocardial edema might play a nonignorable role in the extracellular volume expansion in SLE patients. These correlation findin gs of T1 mapping with CMR-based and clinical parameters might provide additive value for disease monitoring and therapeutic intervention for SLE pat ients.

Results or Findings: All metal-artifact-reduction techniques reduced per i- implant signal voids and diminished geometric distortions with oBW-VAT and SEMAC being most efficient. Compared to non-optimis ed sequences, oBW- VAT and SEMAC produced significantly smaller peri-i mplant signal voids (all p0.008) and significantly smaller distortion angles (p0.001). Only SEMAC could significantly reduce distortions of circular shapes in the peri-implant frame (p0.006). Notably, increasing the number of slice-enc oding-steps (SES) in SEMAC sequences did not lead to a significantly better metal-artifact reduction (all p>0.26). Conclusion: The use of basic and advanced methods for metal-art ifact reduction at 7-T MRI is feasible and effective. Bot h a combination of increased receive bandwidth and VAT as well as SEMAC signific antly reduce the peri- implant signal void and geometric distortion around metal implants.

For WB-CT and NWB-CT, the average and minimal JSW were quantified by 3D-analy sis of the minimal distance between any point of the subchondral tibial bone surface and the femur. Associations with mechanical leg axes and os teoarthritis were evaluated. Minimal JSW of WB-CT was further compared to WB-XR. Two- tailed p-values of <0.05 were considered significant. Results or Findings: Significant differences existed of the average medi al and lateral JSW between WB-CT and NWB-CT (medial: 4.7 v s. 5.1 [p=0.028], 6.8mm [p=0.008]). The minimal JSW on WB-XR (medial: 3.1 mm, lateral: 5.8 mm) was significantly wider compar ed to WB-CT and NWB-CT (both medial: 1.8 mm, lateral: 2.9 mm, all p<0.001) , but not significantly different between WB-CT and NWB-CT (all p 0.869). Significant differences between WB-CT and NWB-CT existed in participants wi th varus knee alignment for the average and the minimal medial JS W (p=0.004 and p=0.011) and for participants with valgus alignment for the average lateral JSW (p=0.013). ailed quantification of the femorotibial joint space and the effect of knee alignment on JSW. WB-CT demonstrates significantly more bone- on-bone appositions, which are even B-CT and WB-XR. Limitations: Full-length leg radiographs only available for 22/26 participants. Examinations (CT and XR) were perform ed in full-leg extension, which may differ from (semi-)flexed examinations regarding JSW.

Therefore, we report (1) mean FV, (2) prevalence of femoral retroversion (3) side-to-side difference for SCFE patients. Methods or Background: A retrospective MRI analysis involving 52 hips (26 patients, 01/2017-10/2021) was performed. Inclusion criteria were paediatric hip disease (16 SCFE patients and 10 Perthes patients, 10-16 years of age). We evaluated FV using the Murphy method on rapid bi lateral T1 VIBE Dixon MRI sequence (AT 32-40 seconds for 3 Tesla and for 1.5 Tesla) of the pelvis and knee (was added to the routine MRI protocol). F V was compared to the contralateral side. Five Perthes patients were treated surgically. Twelve SCFE patients presented with moderate or severe slips an d were treated surgically. All SCFE patients underwent contralateral prophylac tic pinning. Results or Findings: The results were (1) mean FV of SCFE patients (1\u00b12\u00b0 ) was significantly (p<0.001) lower to alateral side (16\u00b114\u00b0) and compared to Perthes patients SCFE patients (17\u00b116\u00b0) compared to Perthes patients (13\u00b19\u00b0). Conclusion: One third of SCFE patients, undergoing surgical treatment showed, had femoral retroversion and they had lower FV compared to Perthes patients. SCFE patients are at risk for femoral ret roversion that can cause anterior extraarticular hip impingement. Therefore routine radiographic follow- up is recommended for these patients. These findings could be important for radiologists and paediatric surgeons treating SCFE patients. Limitations: The limitations are the low sample size and the ret rospective study design.

Almansour*, A. (EF) of complex lower extremity f ractures is a common tool in trauma surgery. Evaluation of periop erative CT scans can be impaired by metal artifacts. Iterative metal artifa ct reduction (iMAR) algorithms are frequently used tools with different capabiliti es. However, there is no dedicated preset for EFs. The aim is to qualitatively and quantitatively identify the best preset for improving image quality and reducing artifact burden in EFs with varying geometries. Methods or Background: Seventy-two CTs with three types of EFs of the lower extremity (regular, hybrid and monotube) were included. CT- reconstruction ensued without iMAR (reference standard), and with three iMAR presets (spine, hip, extremity) that might fit the fixator geometry. Subjective image quality and diagnostic confidence (including potentially new artifacts produced by the iMAR algorithm) were independently analysed by two blinded readers on a 4-point-Likert-scale. Spectral artifac t quantification was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests. Int er/intra-reader agreement was determined using an intraclass-correlation-coef ficient(ICC). Contributors to image quality were identified via a post-hoc multinomial-regression-model. Results or Findings: A total of 288 CT reconstructions were compared. Inter/intra-reader agreement was good in all image quality assessments (ICC0.80,p<0.001). The presets iMARhip and iMARextremit y enhanced image quality significantly more than the other presets across all devices (p< 0.001). Although iMAR introduced new artifacts in all cases, diagnostic confidence was not impaired. Regression analysis showed the preset iMAR- extremity to have the greatest contribution to imag e quality (Odds Ratio 7, p<0.001). Spectral artifact quantification showed i MAR-hip and iMAR-extremity to produce the lowest artifact burden (p<0.001). Conclusion: Regardless of fixator geometry, iMAR-extremity show ed the highest performance in image quality enhancement an d quantitative metal artifact reduction. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective design and smal l sample size(288 CTs). This study included MAR algorithms a nd a CT scanner from a single vendor.

Cenacchi, R. D'Ang elo, Costa, C. Tonon, R. Lodi; Bologna/IT (lauraludovica.gramegna@unibo.it) Purpose: To propose a quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) score of muscle edema for distinguishing IIM (Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies) from other mimics. Methods or Background: MRI can detect muscle edema, which reflects active muscle inflammation, assessing the extent of muscle involvement in IIM. We retrospectively evaluated 85 consecutive patient s (mean age 57.4\u00b113.9 years; 48 F) with suspected IIM (i.e. muscle weakness and/or persistent hyper- CK-emia with/without myalgia) who underwent MRI of lower limbs using T2- weighted Fast Recovery-Fast Spin Echo (FR-FSE) images. Muscle inflammation was evaluated in 11 muscles on the upper and 8 muscles on the lower portions of both legs. The edema of each musc le was graded according to a 4-point likert-type scale (0=no edema, 1= slight edema defined as involving 1/3 of muscle area and/or being slightly hyperintense, 2=moderate defined as involving 2/3 of muscle area and/or bein g moderately hyperintense, or 3=severe edema defined as involving total muscle area and/or being severely hyperintense), totaling up to 114= ((11+8) *3*2). Diagnostic accuracy of the MRI edema total score was explored by comput ing the area under the ROC curve and measuring sensitivity and specificity . Results or Findings: According to an Expert Consensus Panel (a multidisciplinary team applying the Bohan and Peter diagnostic criteria), 34 (40%) patients were diagnosed with definite IIM (II M group) whilst 51 (60%) received an alternative diagnosis (non-IIM group). Our results showed that a potential cut-off score 18 was able to correctly classify patients with AUC=0.85, specificity=96% and sensitivity=52.9%. Conclusion: Our study shows that assessing the extent of muscle edema in the lower limbs with MRI may be capable of distingu ishing IIM from other mimics. Limitations: Different cut-off scores with different specificity and sensitivity values can be proposed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the local ethics committee.

B. B. Abrar*, K. L. Radke, M. Antoc h, A. M\u00fcller-Lutz; D\u00fcsseldorf/DE Purpose: establish optimise a protocol for imaging ch emical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) of lactate (LATEST) at 3 Tesla through in-vitro, in- situ, and in-vivo studies. Methods or Background: Using Bloch-McConnell simulations, we optimised LATEST sequences for the optimal detection of lactate at a clinical 3T MRI scanner. The optimised sequences were then evaluated under longitudinal variation of lactate concentrations, analysed using the nonparametric Friedman test and Kendall-Tau b-rank correlation. Results or Findings: The LATEST effect size of 0.4% expected by Bloch- McConnell simulations could be confirmed in in-vitr o and in-situ studies. Significant differences (p < 0.001) and a strong correlation ( = 0.67) of the LATEST effect size as a function of intramuscular l actate concentrations were observed in 9 human in-situ lower legs. In a healthy volunteer, an increase in lactate concentration was demonstrated after exerci se and recovery in the following 20 minutes using the LATEST technique. Conclusion: In this feasibility study, changes in lactate concentrations were detected using an optimised LATEST imaging protocol in-vitro, in-situ, and in- vivo at a clinical 3T MRI that enables the quantifi cation of altered lactate concentration using non-invasive MR imaging. Limitations: First, the technique is vulnerable to magnetic fiel d inhomogeneities. Second, our sample size was small. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Rumboldt; Rovinj-Rovigno/HR RPS 511-2 Quantitative in utero fMRI assessment of functional asymmetries in the developing human brain *A. Taymourtash*, E. Schwartz, K-H. Nenning, R. Prayer, G. Langs; Vienna/AT (athena.taymourtash@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: Cross-sectional studies of the language system in t he early infancy and newborns suggest that the basic neural mechanis ms are in place even before birth and the brain is primed for language w hile in utero. However, it remained unclear whether these functional asymmetri es arise in utero, or whether they are shaped principally by postnatal ex periences. This work presents, using in utero resting-state fMRI of typi cally developing fetuses, the assessment of functional asymmetry across different cortical regions. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 132 Methods or Background: rs-fMRI was acquired from 72 singleton fetuses between 19 and 39 weeks of gestation. Customised im age processing pipelines for fetal population including irregular fetal movement correction, and age-specific segmentation were used. Individualised functional connectivity (FC) matrices were then obtained by correlating regional brain activity over time. 24 cases were automatically excluded due to c omputational benchmarking of the resulting matrices. We calculat ed the lateralisation index for each individual subject as the normalised difference in the degree of FC between two hemispheres after thresholding negative and weak connections. Results or Findings: According to the Kostovic timeline of brain development, we divided the observed period of gestation to thre e intervals of pre-expansion (19-26), expansion (26-32), and post-expansion (32- 40). Number of significant functional connections increased significantly from first to second (average %21.5 to %25.7, p-val=0.032), and first to third (average %21.5 to %30.7, p- val=0.0004) period. We found after correcting for multiple comparisons. We obser ved a significant increase in functional laterality with gestation age (slope: 0. 025\u00b10.0087,p=0.005) for Temporal-Inferior region with the adjusted R-squared of 0.156. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that functional asymmetries are present during prenatal brain development. Limitations: Only control cases were included in this study.

Monti, *D. Del Roscio*, T. Casseri, F. , Galluzzi, A. Rossi; Siena/IT Purpose: The aim of this pilot study, by using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, was to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes b etween different anesthesiologic drugs Dexmedetomidine (DEX) hypothermia. Methods or Background: Twenty neonates (eleven females and nine males) with HIE, studied between December 2019 and December 2020, were included in this retrospective study. These neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of our hospital for therapeutic hypothermia. MR examination in sedation was performed within 4-10 days of life. Perfusion imaging data adapted to neonates was developed to perform automated ROI analysis bilaterally on thalamus, basal ganglia, frontal, temporal and occipital grey matter. with intranasal values in the basal ganglia and thalami were higher in no-DEX than DEX sedation, r espectively p-value=0,0088 and p-value=0,0002. No differences between cortical CBF values were observed. Conclusion: This pilot study shows lower basal ganglia and thal amus perfusion in DEX group with respect to no-DEX group. This result is opposite to what has been reported in literature in HIE newborns without hypothermia. Hypothermia, therefore, appears to be the causal factor responsible for these results. Limitations: The limitation of this pilot study is the small coh ort of selected patients. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Methods or Background: Nine postmortem human fetal brains (19-24 gestational weeks), without any pathology, were sca nned on T2-weighted 3TpMRI scans, compared with same slices high-resolution analysed using ImageJ software, MATLAB, and Statist ics Toolbox Release 2013a. Results or Findings: The SI profiles of the transient zones of the TL sp atially and temporally correlate to the SI profiles of the FL. The intermediate and subventricular zone of the TL during midgestation are about the size of the subplate zone (SP). The superficial SP shows highes t signal intensity and SI profiles that indicate a concurrent course of histogenetic events in the two observed brain lobes during this developmental peri od. Conclusion: Comparative evaluation of sizes of the transient developmental zones and the SI profiles of different cortical regions using 3TpMRI enables us to observe synchrony or differences in corticogenes is in different brain lobes. Thus, developing MRI methodologies could enable us to observe normal vs. abnormal transient lamination patterns using SI pro files and thicknesses. The MRI advancements in this direction are needed for prenatal detection of malformation of cortical development especially mil d ones, as well as white matter injuries of TL due to cytomegalovirus infect ion. Limitations: A rigorous selection of cases with the highest qual ity pMRI resulted in the modest number of cases in this study, but it is comparable to or even larger than the number of analyzed cases in ot her similar studies.

To compare degree of asymmetry with post- delivery outcome. Methods or Background: This is a retrospective study. Out of 658 Fetal MRI 's performed in our centre, 67 fetuses with isolated v entriculomegaly and 77 fetuses with normal brains based on prenatal ultras ound and MRI were included in the study. Fetal MRI images were retros pectively and blindly reviewed by two radiologists. Sulcal development was scored based on Kriakopoulou Asymmetry. The score is defined as sum of right side cortical development scores minus left side CDS divided by n umber of visible sulci post-delivery developmental outcomes were assessed using ASQ Questionnaires obtained at least one year post-deli very. Results or Findings: The mean gestational ages were 28.6\u00b16.3 weeks and 28.4\u00b16.1 respectively in the fetuses with and witho ut ventriculomegaly (p= 0.9). The mean sulcal development score was 3.6\u00b11.1 and 4.5\u00b11.3 respectively for fetuses with and without ventriculomegaly (p= 0.03 ). The mean asymmetry scores for fetuses with/wi ventricular was m m in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. The ASQ score was 11.3 \u00b1 9.8 mont hs and 22.6 \u00b1 12.8 months in fetuses with and without VMG. At year 2 of age, only 39% of the children with prenatal isolated ventriculomegaly se en in fetal MRI had normal neurodevelopment. Also, 8% of fetuses with ventriculomegaly underwent neonatal death. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 133 Conclusion: The fetuses with VMG had a significant delay in sul cation and development compared to the control fetuses. Sulcal asymmetry was more common in fetuses with ventriculomegaly who had del ayed development, compared to those with ventriculomegaly but normal developmental outcome.

Author and final review Saeid Esmaeilian: Author: Idea and data collection and Board: Concussion (mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)) is one of the most widespread types of trauma. The literature data on the [GABA] change after acute mTBI is based on the measurement of GABA+ lev els, where GABA signal is contaminated with macromolecular compounds. The aim of this study is to measure GABA in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) region in the acute phase of pediatric mTBI. Methods or Background: Nineteen patients with acute mTBI (12-70 hours since the injury, 16.2\u00b11.4 y.o.) and twenty-one healthy control (18.5\u00b12.3 y.o.) participated in the study. Philips Achieva 3.0T was used, standard MRI protocol for TBI patients revealed no pathological lesions in brain tissue of any subject. MRS voxel (50x25x25 mm) was located in PCC . MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence without macromolecular contamination was used: TR = 2000 ms, TE = 80 ms, 180-editing pulses applied on 1.9 ppm and 1.5 ppm, NSA = 288 (acq. time ~10 min). Spectra were processed in Gannet 3.1 , [GABA] and [Glx] values were calculated. Results or Findings: [GABA] was statistically significantly higher in mT BI group than in the normal group, while [Glx] was unc hanged. No correlations between age and metabolite concentrations were reve aled. Conclusion: Previously we GABA-/Cr in anterior cingulate cortex of children with mTBI. To our knowledge, the increase in GABA in PCC in the current study is reported for the first time. The lack of correlations between age and metabolite levels agrees with the literature data and eliminates possible bias in the results caused by group age differences. This study provides insight into metabolic alterati ons caused by mTBI and may facilitate better understanding of the long-term mT BI consequences. Limitations: There is a small between-group age difference. Ethics committee approval: All studies were approved by the local ethical committee.

St\u00fcmpflen, G. O. Kasprian; Vienna/AT (victor.schmidbauer@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: SyMRI\u00ae allows to retrospectively reconstruct differ ent MR imaging contrasts using a single acquisition of a multi-dynamic multi-echo (MDME) sequence. This study aimed to investigate the feasi bility of synthetic MRI- based fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion rec overy (FGATIR) contrasts for the brainstem pathways in vivo. Methods or Background: MRI (median gestational age at birth: 27+0; range, 23+4-41+6) w ere collected, which included MDME sequences and conventional T1-weighted/T2-weighted sequence acquisitions as a standard-of-reference. M DME-based FGATIR contrasts (TR/TE/TI: 3000/5/410 ms) were generated using the MR data post- processing software SyMRI\u00ae. The identification of s even brainstem pathways/regions of interest was assessed on synthetic FGATIR contrasts and conventionally acquired T1-weighted/T2-weighted quality in 31/31 identified. Conclusion: Synthetic generation of specific FGATIR contrasts enables reliable radiological identification of neonatal br ainstem pathway anatomy in vivo. The investigated MR approach depicts early my elinating tracts more reliable than standard-of-reference contrasts. Limitations: The limitation is the study's small sample size.

M. correction is an essential preprocessing step in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) of the fetal brain, to remove motion artifacts caused by fetal movement and mater nal breathing and to suppress erroneous signal correlations. Here, we pr opose a novel framework including a motion correction and volumetric recons truction methodology for fetal rs-fMRI. Further, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to improve functional connectivity estimates, reproduc ibility and signal interpretability. Methods or Background: The motion correction and volumetric reconstruction algorithm consists of three parts. F irst, a high-resolution 3D reference volume is estimated. Second, a slice-to-v olume motion correction procedure is performed, where each slice of a fMRI time point is registered rigidly to the reference volume. Third, motion corr upted time points are reconstructed using a Huber loss-based regularisati on scheme. Results or Findings: For the evaluation of the reconstruction performanc e, the outlier ratio and specific functional connectiv ity-based metrics were developed to assess reproducibility of the measured BOLD. Our approach was compared against state-of-the-art reconstruction and motion correction schemes, showing decreased outlier ratio (from 12.71% to 8.62% ) and correlation differences (from 0.193 to 0.191). Conclusion: The proposed framework allows the use of motion cor rupted fMRI acquisitions for further analysis which would tradi tionally be discarded. This could mitigate the need for repeated rs-fMRI acquis itions therefore leading to an overall reduction of scan time of fetal imaging. Limitations: The limitation is the number of rs-fMRI acquisitions: 15 subjects with 96 time points are used for evaluation.

Arzanauskaite; Liverpool/UK RPS 504-2 Ultra-high pitched tin-filtered angiography in radiation dose reduction for pulmonary embolism investigation s in young females standard to investigate pulmonary embolism (PE), are undergoing a recent surge secondary to COVID-induced hypercoagulable state. This technique carries significant radiation risk in young females because of radiosensitive breast and thymus tissues . An ultra-high pitched CT technique offers significant radiation dose reducti on (RDR) through interpolation and minimises breathing artefact. The addition of tube tin-filtration may offer further RDR. This retrospective study's aim was to assess RDR and image quality (IQ) of ultra-high pitch tin-filtered (UHPTF) CTPA against conventional-CTPA. Methods or Background: adult females age <50 years undergoing UHPTF-CTPA and conventional-CTPA in the past 12 months were included. CTs in both groups were compared for radi ation dose, adequate pulmonary arteries contrast density (Hounsfield uni ts (HU)) and movement artefact with Fisher's exact test, and p<0.05 consi dered significant. Diagnostic quality was also recorded. Results or Findings: 10 female patients (mean age 33) in UHPTF-CTPA group and 10 female patients (mean age 36) in conve ntional-CTPA group were included. There was no significant contrast density difference between the two groups in the main, left or right pulmonary arteries (322.72HU, 311.85HU and 319.41HU in UHPTF-CTPA group p=1.00). 8/10 group and 10/10 in the control group were >250 HU in all PA; the remaining 2 UHPTF- 337.1DLP, p<0.01). All CT scans in bot h groups were of diagnostic quality and none exhibited movement arti fact. Conclusion: This study was the first to demonstrate significant RDR with the UHPTF-CTPA technique whilst maintaining IQ. This technique is particularly beneficial in young females with suspected PE. Limitations: Future work of this UHPTF-CTPA technique includes interobserver-reliability assessment. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approved. Funding for this study: No funding required.

Methods or Background: 44 patients who did not develop chronic thromboembolic disease after acute pulmonary emboli sm and 43 patients who developed CTED after acute pulmonary embolism were retrospectively selected from 600 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who underwent computed tomography (forty-row CT scanner , Siemens). CT- angiography scans were evaluated for the diameter, number and type of origin of the bronchial arteries and their role in the pre dicting the CTED development in the future. Results or Findings: The diameter of the bronchial arteries in the group of patients who developed CTED after acute pulmonary embolism was significantly larger than diameters of the bronchial arteries in the group of patients who did not develop CTED after acute pulmonary embolism (p = 0.0001). There were no differences in the number and type of origin of the bronchial arteries in the group of patients who dev eloped CTED after acute pulmonary embolism and in the group of patients who did not develop CTED after acute pulmonary embolism. Conclusion: A significant difference was found between the diam eter of the bronchial arteries in patients who developed CTED a fter acute pulmonary embolism compared with patients who did not develop CTED after acute pulmonary embolism (p = 0.0001). ROC analysis showed a threshold value of the diameter of the bronchial arteries of 1.5 mm wi th a sensitivity of the method of 90.24% and a specificity of 95.12%. The presence of bronchial arteries with a diameter of 1.5 mm in patients after acute pulmonary embolism can be used as a prediction of CTED. Limitations: Retrospective study.

Q scans are favoured over CTPAs in those who have a normal chest radiograph in pregnant and young patients (Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal College of Radiologists). We hav e performed a re-audit with a target standard of 85%. Following on from our previous audit in 2019, we discussed our findings at multiprofessional meet ings and created a standardised operating procedure at our tertiary centre, highlighting a pathway where Q scans should be the first line investigation for pulmonary emboli if relevant criteria are met. Methods or Background: We retrospectively collected data on all patients aged 40 years and younger who underwent Q scans and CTPAs between 01/01/2021 and 31/12/2021. Pregnancy/post-partum st atus was noted. We excluded weekend data as Q scans were unavailable. Data was collected from CRIS and analysed on Microsoft Excel. Results or Findings: Out of a total of 288 patients, 212 patients were excluded due to having an abnormal chest radiograph or were severely unwell e.g. post cardiac arrest. This left a total of 76 p atients who could have a Q scan, of which 70% underwent a Q scan in 2021, an i mprovement from 40% in 2017. The proportion of pregnant patients who under went Q scans improved from 68% in 2019 to 98% in 2021. The proportion of Q scans in post-partum patients increased from 45% to 77%. Conclusion: We have significantly improved the proportion of patients who underwent a Q scan for the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli, consequently reducing radiation exposure and cost.

Son*; Bundang/KR Purpose: Primary imaging modality for echocardiography supplemented by ECG-gated CT angiography. However, the authors have recently enc ountered multiple patients with ruptured MVP, initially identified on non-ECG-gated chest CT. Notably, there has been no study regarding identifi cation of ruptured MVP on non-ECG-gated chest CT. Thus, the purpose of the pa per is to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of ruptured MVP on non-ECG gated chest CT. Methods or Background: We retrospectively assessed 50 patients with ruptured MVP and 15 patients without ruptured MVP as control who underwent non-gated chest CT. We analysed CT findings of the MVP including presence or absence of MVP (asymmetrical double line-sign due to overlapping of ruptured and non-ruptured mitral leaflet) and culpr it location of MVP (A1, 2, 3, P1, 2, 3). A retrospective evaluation was performed by two blind radiologists in a consensus manner for CT findings. Results or Findings: Double-line sign to predict ruptured MVP on non-ECG - gated chest CT resulted in sensitivity, specificity , negative predictive value and positive predictive valve of 68%, 73%, 41%, and 89% , respectively. In contrast, was correctly localised as the culprit lesion on non-ECG- gated chest CT. Conclusion: Asymmetrical double line sign may be a suggestive C T finding of ruptured MVP on non-ECG-gated chest CT. Familiarity of this CT finding may lead to prompt diagnosis and surgery of ruptured MV P. Limitations: This study is limited by its small retrospectively selected cohort, which may have led to selection bias. Ethics committee approval: IRB approved the retrospective study.

This study aims to correlate atrial size ratio (ASR) with 30-day mortality in patients with acute PTE and compare its accuracy with the pulmonary artery obstruction index (PAOI). Methods or Background: A prospective study was performed on 40 consecutive patients diagnosed with acute PTE on CT PA at Victoria Hospital, BMCRI, Bengaluru. ASR was calculated by the ratio o f axial longitudinal diameters of the atria. PAOI was ascertained by scoring the obstruction of the pulmonary arterial tree as given by Qanadli et al. ASR and PAOI were compared with 30-day mortality using area under rec eiver operator curve. Results or Findings: 11/ 40 patients (27.5%) patients with acute PTE had 30- day mortality. Middle aged and older patients were predominantly affected and majority of the patients in our study were men (mal e: female= 1.6:1). The mean ASR and PAOI were higher in the non-survivor group and correlated with 30- day mortality. AUC of ASR and PAOI was 0.906 and 08 98 respectively. ASR criterion of 1.47 showed the highest accuracy with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 75.9%, respectively. PAOI of 13 showed the highest accuracy. The sensitivity of PAOI at 13 was lower than ASR (90.9% ) but showed higher specificity (86.2%). Conclusion: ASR, a relatively easy technique, is comparable, if not better than, PAOI in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with acute PTE. It furthers the role of CTPA in the management of acute PTE. Limitations: Non-gated images were degraded by cardiac motion and all- cause mortality was assessed irrespective of treatm ent received by the patient.

D. F. Alkhanfar*; Sheffield/UK Purpose: Severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in chronic lung disease (PH- CLD) is associated with high mortality and morbidit y. There is increased interest in the identification of patients with sev ere PH in CLD, as there is new evidence of potential vasodilator therapy response. Echocardiography is the recommended screening test but can be challenging i n patients with advanced CLD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diag nostic role of MRI to diagnose severe PH in CLD. Methods or Background: 167 patients with CLD who underwent baseline cardiac MRI and right heart catheterisation were id entified from the ASPIRE registry. In a derivation cohort (n=67), the optimal diagnostic threshold of a previously published multiparameter model [Whitfiel d model (arbitrary units) = 27.7 + 5.75 loge septal angle) mm2)] was identified using the Youden index. In the test cohort (n=100), the diagnostic accuracy was tested using receiver opera ting characteristic (ROC) analysis, and, to assess the prognostic value, Kapl an-Meier curves were constructed. Results or Findings: The identified Whitfield model threshold 1.6 had high accuracy in the test cohort, area under the ROC cur ve (0.95) (p<0.0001); sensitivity, 80.8%; specificity, 87.2%; positive pr 87.5%; and negative predictive value (NPV), 80.4%. Patient s with Whitfield model 1.6 had worse survival; log-rank chi square 44.47, p<0. 0001. On Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex and body surface area, the W hitfield model also remained significant (hazard ratio=1.28; 95% CI: 1. 17, 1.41, p<0.0001). Conclusion: The Whitfeld MRI model with threshold 1.6 applied has high accuracy to detect severe PH in CLD and has strong prognostic value. Limitations: Retrospective, single-centre study.

To influence of HCC subtypes on CT/MRI LI-RADS categorisation in the su bgroup of high-risk patients. Methods or Background: This retrospective IRB-approved study included patients with resected HCC and available histopathological classification. Three radiologists independently reviewed preoperat ive CT and MRI exams. The readers evaluated the presence of imaging featu res according to LI-RADS v2018 definitions and provided an LI-RADS category in patients at high risk of HCC. Differences in LI-RADS features and categorisations were and seventy-seven patients (median 64.0 years old, 215 [77.6%] men) were analysed with 295 HCCs. There MTM-HCCs, and 13 (4.5%) other rare subtypes. The following features were more frequent MTM- presence least one LR-M featur e (P0.010 on CT), infiltrative necrosis or severe ischaemia (P0.038 on CT) and larger size (P 0.006 on CT, P 0.011 on MRI). SH-HCC was associated with fat in mass (P<0.001 on CT, P 0.002 on MRI). The distribution of the LI-RADS major features and categories in high-risk patients did not significantly differ among the three main H CC subtypes. Conclusion: The distribution of LI-RADS major features and cate gories is not different among the HCC subtypes. Nevertheless, car eful analysis of tumour- in-vein, LR-M, and ancillary features as well as cl inico-biological data can provide information for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC subtypes. Limitations: The limitation is the single-centre and retrospecti ve design. Only resected HCC was included in the study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by IRB.

Methods or Background: A total of 190 patients diagnosed as HCC were enrolled prospectively from three tertiary referral hospitals. All patients underwent preoperative laboratory examination to ob tain parameters pertaining to liver function, two-dimensional shear wave elast ography examination to obtain liver stiffness (LS), and three-dimensional virtual resection of the liver to obtain volume-related parameters. A nomogram was de veloped by using logistic regression and determined by receiver oper ating characteristic curve analysis and calibration curve analysis. Results or Findings: A nomogram was constructed with the following variables: liver remnant volume ratio, LS>9.5kPa, c hild-pugh grade, and the presence of clinically significant portal hypertens ion (CSPH). This nomogram enabled differentiation of symptomatic PHLF in the derivation cohort (Area under curve [AUC], 0.915), internal 5-fold The nomogram also showed good calibration in both the derivation and the validati on cohorts (Hosmer- Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, p=0.641, and p=0.127, respectively). With the best cutoff point of 81, the safe limit of the remnant ratio could be stratified using the nomogram. Conclusion: A simple nomogram model combining both preoperative clinical and imaging features could be useful in predicting postoperative outcomes in HCC. Limitations: First, the sample size was relatively small. Second, further studies should be designed for predicting postoperative mortality or long-term survival.

K. Segger*, N. L. Beetz, T. A. Auer, M. Schmelzle, U. Fehrenbach; Berlin/DE Purpose: As sarcopenic cancer patients appear to have a poor outcome during cancer treatments the aim of this study was to evaluate specific body composition types (sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis) in patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCC) to evaluate the influence on peri- and postoperative morbidity and outcome. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, preoperative CT datasets of 197 patients with pCC, who underwent ex tended hemihepatectomy were evaluated. Single slice segmentations (lumbar vertebra 3 as landmark) of the psoas muscle, abdominal muscle mass (TAMA ), visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were performed. Lumbar muscle index (LSMI) was calculated by normalising the TAMA by patients' height and was used to define sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. M yosteatosis was based on the density (HU) of the segmented muscles. These bo dy composition parameters were correlated to peri- and postoperati ve complications and outcomes. Results or Findings: 61,4% (121/197) of the patients were obesity ad myosteatosis. Neither sarcopenia nor sarcopenic obesity was independent r isk factor for the occurrence of peri- or postoperative complications. However, in patients with sarcopenic obesity, the 90-day-survival was signifi cantly decreased (p=0.009). Myosteatosis was associated with a prolonged ICU st ay (p=0.014), poorer disease-free survival (p=0.003) and overall survival (p<0.001). Conclusion: Sarcopenia does not increase perioperative morbidit y in patients with pCC undergoing extended hemihepatectomy, but s arcopenic obesity is associated with a poorer 90-day-survival. Myosteatosis is linked to prolonged ICU stays and decreased disease-free survival and overall survival. Our study shows the value of identifying certain body composition types to optimise individual risk and outcome assessment, and should encourage their implementation into routine clinical practice. Limitations: The limitation is the single-centre and retrospecti ve design, which indicates that these results may not be generalisable.

This study's aim is to provide CT imaging features of mPLC, focusing on th e differences between the two histological subtypes recently defined, combined hepatocellular- Methods or of patients with a biopsy-proven mPLC diagnosed between 2007-2019 at a single instit ution, were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists with 7- and 1-year experience in liver imaging. Dimension, number of nodules, morpho logy, margins(regular/irregular), enhancement (arterial, intensity and pattern), presence of capsule and internal necrosis were recorded. A comparative analysis between the two histological subtypes was made by using Fisher- exact test for categorical variables and t-Student test for continuous one. The inter-reader agreement was assessed with k-Cohen test. Results or Findings: Twenty-nine patients (18=cHCC-CC;11= undifferentiated) were enrolled. At the diagnosis, the majority of mPLC appeared as a single large nodule (mean diameter 64\u00b139mm), with a lobulated morphology (76%) and smooth margin (86%). The major ity of lesions (59%) showed a mild peripheral ring enhancement in arteri al phase with progressive enhancement in portal and delayed phase. Necrosis and capsule were present in 45% and 17% of nodules, respectively. The undiff erentiated often affected women (72%vs28%; p=0.027). Despite t hese lesions not differing in the enhancement pattern, they showed a weaker arterial enhancement (45%vs11%; p=0.050) and a capsule appea rance on the portal phase (54%vs0%; p= 0.004). A good agreement was found between the two radiologists (k=0.769). Conclusion: mPLC should enter in the differential diagnosis of large liver lesions with mild, peripheral ring arterial enhancement, progressively increasing in portal-delayed phase. In women, the p resence of a capsule on the portal phase should raise the suspicion of undi fferentiated subtype. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective design and the small sample.

CT ar structures and endoleaks in TNC and VNC images derived from ar terial and delayed (VNCd) phase of dual-energy fast-kVp switching in patients after EVAR procedure. Methods or Background: CT scans of 97 patients who had prior EVAR procedure performed were enrolled in this study. Al l CT scans were obtained using a dual-energy fast-kVp switching scanner (Dis covery 750 HD, GE Healthcare). TNC phase was obtained using single en ergy, both VNC phases were obtained using the fast-kVp switching techniqu e. An intravenous administration of 80 ml iodine contrast agent was applied. The delayed phase was performed 60 s after the arterial phase. Simult aneous TNC, VNCa, and VNCd measurements were performed for (among others) aorta, endoleaks. The differences in the mean CT numbers in TNC, VNCa and VNCd were analysed statistically. Results or Findings: The largest differences in the VNCa and VNCd densit ies were demonstrated in vascular structures. The mean density in the aorta 51.24 HU, 39.82 HU, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). The mean SNR measured in the aorta and endoleaks were: 2.11 and 2.04 in VNCa, 1.09 1.08 TNC, 1.5 and 1.44 in VNCd. Conclusion: The VNC images have higher SNR compared to TNC imag es. There are significant differences in CT numbers of the arteries and endoleaks in TNC, VNCa, VNCd images, with significantly lower densities in VNCd. The study shows a high diagnostic value of VNC imag es and suggests use of VNCd images in the assessment of endoleaks. Limitations: The study is limited to one method of dual-energy data acquisition.

C. Rotzinger*\u00b9, F. Nevesny\u00b2, A. W. been recogni sed as frequent COVID- 19-related abnormalities and proposed as severity m arkers. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved remain a mat ter of debate. We aimed to describe the relationship between VC, PE and alv eolar opacities (AO). Methods or Background: This multicentre observational registry includes 268 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and subjected to contrast- enhanced CT between March and June 2020. We diagnos ed acute PE in 61 (22.8%) patients, 17 females (27.9%), mean age 61.7\u00b114.2 years. We retrieved demographic, laboratory, and outcome data. CT image analysis at the segmental level included VC (qualitatively and quantitatively [diameter]), AO (semi-quantitatively as absent, <50%, or >50% involvement), clot location, and distribution related to VC and AO. Segments wit h vs. without PE were compared. Results or Findings: Of 411 emboli, 82 (20%) were lobar or (80%) were segmental or sub-segmental. Venous diameters were significantly higher in segments with AO (p=0.031), unlike arteries (p=0.138). At the segmental level, 77% of emboli were associat ed with VC. Overall, PE occurred in 28.2% of segments with AO vs. 21.8% wit hout (p=0.047). In the absence of VC, however, AO did not affect PE rates (p=0.94). Conclusion: Vascular congestion predominantly affected veins and most pulmonary emboli were located in segments with VC. In the absence of VC, AOs did not influence the PE rate. VC might result from increased flow supported by the hypothesis of pulmonary arteriovenous anastomosis dysregulation as a relevant contributing factor. Limitations: Only patients with contrast-enhanced CT were includ ed potentially missing patients with thromboembolic di sease who had no CT.

R. Lavon*, R. Godon, M. Lanclus, S. Bonte; Kontich/BE (benjamin.lavon@fluidda.com) Purpose: Algorithms to measure the volume of the pulmonary v asculature on volumetric, non-contrast, chest CT have shown promi se as imaging biomarkers for pulmonary vascular disease research and clinical decision-making. To estimate the impact of scan section thickness on th ese measurements, we resliced scans from healthy volunteers into various thicknesses and compared volumes of small pulmonary vessels detected by one such algorithm. Methods or Background: Chest CT scans from 107 COPDGene healthy volunteers, reconstructed with volumetric thin slic es (.7 mm) according to a standardised protocol, were resliced using the Mimi cs (Materialise, Belgium) reslicing tool to approximate reconstructed section thicknesses of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 mm, and analysed using Fluidda's (Fluidda NV, Bel gium) Functional Respiratory Imaging platform to quantify the volume of vessels between 1.25 and 140 mm2 in cross-sectional area. BV5, the volum e of vessels smaller than 5 mm2 expressed in milliliters and as % total pulmo nary blood volume, was compared between the different resliced cohorts. Results or Findings: 107 subjects' scans were analysed (73 female, 34 male); average age was 62.3 years (+/- 9.1). 88 .15 (15.01) ml, and 29.02 (5.7) ml for the .7, 1, 1.5, 2-, and 3- mm resliced cohorts, respectively. BV5 vessels represented In a paired t-test, each resliced cohort differed significantly from ev ery other resliced cohort (p<.001). Conclusion: Section thickness likely has a significant impact on the volume of small vessels detected and the proportion of total pulmonary vascular volume they represent. Research to clinically validate these endpoints should consider this impact when studying historical datasets. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not MR biomarkers for advanced classification and therapy monitoring of patients with venous malformation *F. Haupt*, A. Bern/CH (fabian.haupt@insel.ch) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate morphologi cal and functional MR sequences for the correct classification of venous malformations and for identification of imaging features, which contribut e to therapy monitoring. Methods or Background: Background: Congenital vascular malformations (CVM) are dev elop during angiogenesis in utero. CVMs are divided into high flow and low f low malformations and are classified by the ISSVA according to the predominant diseased vessel type. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best method for the morphological characterisation of CVMs, regarding extent, involve d compartments and lesion composition (pure venous vs combined malformation). to differentiate between vascular and lymphatic components. MR angiography (MRA) with Gadolinium-based contrast agents allows the visualisation and assessment of the perf used vascular portion of malformations. The continuous acquisition using tim e-resolved MRA allows semiquantitative analysis of the hemodynamics in malformations. Methods: MRI with morphological sequences of 15 patients with simple venous malformations was performed before and after treatment by percutaneous ethanol embolisation. Size of the m alformation was measured in T2w, size of vascularisation was measured in MRA . Number of draining veins was counted in MRA. Results or Findings: While T2w was only slightly reduced (n.s.), the vas cular volume was reduced impressively. The vascular porti on (MRA/T2w) was significantly lower after therapy (81\u00b127% vs 41\u00b128% ,p<0.001). The number of draining veins was significantly reduced after ther apy (1.7\u00b10.3 vs 0.3\u00b10.6%,p<0.05). Conclusion: MRI is feasible for therapy monitoring of venous ma lformations. Vascular volume in MRA is a better endpoint than morphological T2w-based morphometry. Draining veins are another feasible en dpoint.

Wang*, Y. Qiu, Dong; Sh anghai/CN (puguang61@126.com) Purpose: To investigate the value of high-frame-rate vector flow imaging (V flow) technology in evaluating the hemodynamic chan ges of moderate and severe carotid stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque. Methods or Background: In this prospective study, patients with moderate and severe carotid atherosclerotic stenosis were en rolled. Mindray Resona7s ultrasound machine and L9-3 linear array probe were used for V Flow and conventional ultrasound examination before surgery. Changes in vector arrows and streamlines in the carotid stenosis were observ ed and analysed by V flow imaging. Carotid wall shear stress (WSS) values at the proximal, narrowest and distal of stenosis were measured. Taking the ca rotid digital subtraction angiography results as gold standard, the diagnosti c efficacy of WSS value measured by V flow was analysed. Results or Findings: Finally, 54 patients with carotid stenosis rate 50% were prospectively included. V flow showed yellow or red vector arrows with a faster velocity at the segmentation of carotid sten osis. Taking WSS value > 1.05 Pa in carotid stenosis segments as the cut-off value, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of WSS value in diagnosing carotid stenosis was 79.3%, 72.2%, 80.6% and 68.2%. Conclusion: V flow dynamic imaging could reflect more comprehensively the hemodynamic changes caused by carotid atherosclerot ic stenosis.

Methods or Background: t3DUS is a promising imaging technique for quantifying carotid plaque by measuring the degree of stenosis and plaque volume. CPV could add benefit in predicting plaque vulnerability. t3DUS was used to obtain carotid plaque volume from 25 patients before surgery. CPV from the endarterectomy specimen was t hen measured using a validated water displacement method as a reference test. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot were used t o establish bias and limit of agreement between carotid plaque volume measurement s. Results or Findings: There was an excellent agreement between t3DUS and gold standard in measuring carotid plaque volume wi th an ICC value of 0.98 (95% CI 0.93 - 0.99, p <0.001). Bias in measurement s was 0.07\u00b10.08 cm3 (95% limit of agreement (LoA) -0.08 - 0.23). Intra- operator agreement of t3DUS CPV measurements was excellent with an ICC value of 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 - 0.97, p <0.001). Bi as in measurements was 0.004\u00b10.07 cm3 (95% limit of agreement (LoA) -0.14 - 0.15). Conclusion: t3DUS is a reproducible and accurate imaging method for measuring CPV. Further studies investigating the reliability of t3DUS in assessing plaque morphological characteristics are required. Limitations: Calcified plaques.

Methods or Background: A CNN model was trained predicting response to 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy in mCRPC patients on pretherapeutic PSMA PET/CT with serum PSA levels as the standard of ref erence. Four clinical relevant experiments have been carried out: CNN trained with whole 3D PET with attenuation corrected CT volumes (PET/CT); wit h whole 3D PET/CT volumes and stochastic weight averaging (PET/CT+SWA ); with whole 3D PET/CT volumes and the corresponding CT volume as s econd channel (PET/CT+CT); and with rotated and then MIP 2D images (Rotation+MIP). AUROC was calculated for all experiments separately . Results or Findings: The median AUROC for each experiment is was about 0.75, except for Rotation+MIP (median <0.7). Conclusion: In conclusion, it is hard to train a verifiable mod el, as only using different samples for training and validation show a high volatility in model performance. However, it seems like that the problem of predicting therapy response is solvable by CNNs under the requirement of more samples used for training and validating. Using more information (PE T/CT+CT), artificially increasing the dataset size (rotation+MIP) using st ate-of-the-art optimisation techniques (PET/CT+SWA) increase the model's generalisation and should be taken into account for further research. Limitations: The major limitation of this study is the sample si ze. Further studies with convolutional neural network-based analyses of larger patient cohorts are needed in order to train the CNN and validate the findings from this study.

Ponsiglione*, R. Megna, F. Petretta, A. Cuocolo; semiautomatic fr eeware software, Horos and LIFEx, for the evaluation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and muscle mass in 40 patients undergoing whole-body PET/CT. Methods or Background: Sarcopenia and coronary calcification may a relevant prognostic impact in oncological and non-o ncological patients. The use of freeware software is promising for quantitat ive evaluation of these after whole-body positron emission tomogr aphy (PET)/computed tomography useful for one-stop-sh op risk stratification without additional charges to health care costs. Results or Findings: The muscle areas obtained by the two software were comparable, showing high correlation by Lin's conco rdance coefficient (0.9997; 95% confidence intervals, a very good agreement by the Bland-Altman analysis (mean difference = 0.41 c m2, lower limit = -1.06 cm2, upper limit = 1.89). For CAC (95% CI: 0.9965-0.9984) and at Bland-Altman analysis there was a mean difference of 8 (lower limit = -32, upper limit = 48), with a slight overestimation of Horos CAC score as compared to LIFEx. We investigated the possible causes of this discrepanc y at the level of region of interest (ROI). The overestimation was due to a dif ferent calculation method of the CAC score, being the ROI equal for the two soft ware. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that off-line analysis per formed with freeware software may allow a comprehensive evaluat ion of the oncological patient, making available the evaluation of paramet ers, such as muscle mass and calcium score, that may be relevant for the sta ging and prognostic stratification of these patients, beside standard d ata obtained by PET/CT imaging. For this purpose, the Horos and LIFEx soft ware seem to be comparable. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 140 Limitations: Single-centre.

The aim of thi s study is to examine the radiological aspects of hereditary hemoglobinopathy , such as b-thalassemia, on skeletal samples from an ancient community, using CT. Methods or Background: Within the ERC Advanced project \"nEU-Med: Origins of a new Economic Union (7th to 12th centur ies): resources, landscapes, and political strategies in a Mediterranean region\", a sample of 15 ribs belonging to 9 individuals from early childhood to adult was examined. The samples come from the early medieval archaeological site (X-XI century) of Vetricella (Scarlino, GR), Italy. To complete the m acroscopic paleopathological analysis, the bone samples underwent CT investigati on, by using 128-layer GE equipment and a layer thickness of less than 1 mm. The measure of the density of the ribs and the alterations of the trabecular component were also evaluated. Results or Findings: The CT analysis of the 15 rib samples examined allowed the identification of findings compatible with the presence of b-thalassemia, such as signs of hyperostosis and the characteristi c \"rib-within-a-rib appearance\" of the anterior and median portions. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that skeletal c hanges in advanced stages of b-thalassemia can be assessed by CT on bone samples from ancient communities. Clinical findings of thes e conditions are rare in industrialised countries but are sometimes still pr esent in geographic areas with little or no access to transfusion and chelati on therapy. Therefore, the above analyses may be of interest also to improve o ur knowledge on the natural history of this pathology that represents t he most common genetic disorder worldwide.

To evaluate the performance various semi-automat ed techniques for quantification of myocardial infarct (MI) size on both conventional bright- blood and novel dark-blood LGE images using histopathology as the reference standard. Methods or Background: In thirteen Yorkshire pigs, reperfused MI was experimentally induced. At 7 weeks post-MI, both br ight-blood and dark-blood LGE imaging was performed on a 1.5T MRI scanner. Following MRI, the animals were sacrificed and histopathology was obtained. For both LGE methods, the percentage of infarcted myocardium was assessed per slice using various semi-automated scar quantification techniques, including the signal threshold versus reference mean (STRM, using 3 to 8 standard deviations (SDs) as threshold) and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) methods, as well as manual contouring. Infarct size obtained by histopathology was used as the reference standard. Results or Findings: In total, 24 paired LGE MRI slices and histopathology samples were available for analysis. For both bright-blood and dark-blood LGE, the STRM method with a threshold of 5 SDs led to the best agreement to histopathology without significant bias (-0.23%, (-1.57%, CI [-2.96,-0.18%], while manual LGE outperformed semi-automated quantification and demo nstrated the most accurate quantification in this study (-0.03%, 95% CI [-0.22,0.16%], p=0.760). Conclusion: The signal threshold versus reference mean method w ith a threshold of 5 standard deviations demonstrated the most accurate semi- automated quantification of infarcted myocardium, w ithout significant bias compared to histopathology, for both conventional bright-blood and novel dark- blood LGE. Limitations: MI induction to achieve the maximum amount of scar tissue led to significant dropouts due to arrhythmia-related deat hs.

However, novel dark-blood LGE methods proved superior for localisation of subendocardial scar by enhancing the often poor scar-to-blood contrast of conventional bright-blood LGE. Although extensively evaluated in the ventricles, dark-blood LGE has not been applied for the atria yet. Methods: 45 patients scheduled for atrial fibrillat ion (AF) ablation with pre- procedural LGE MRI were enrolled in this study. All patients received free- breathing 3D dark-blood PSIR LGE with high spatial resolution (0.63 x 0.63 x 1.00mm reconstructed) and a dynamic inversion time mechanism. LGE Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 141 datasets were analysed using ADAS-AF software (Figu re 1). Signal intensities were expressed as ratio to the mean signal intensit y of the blood pool (IIR). Results or Findings: 3D dark-blood LGE was successfully performed in 41/ 45 participants (91%). Four scans were terminated prem aturely due to arrhythmia. Image segmentation and analysis were successful in 39/41 patients (95%). In two patients, the atrial wall was non-interpretable due to artefacts (1 mechanical valve, 1 ICD). Patients without prior ablation (19/39 patients) showed lower IIR as compared to re-do patients. In addition, the IIR distribution suggests that the conventional thresholds for bright-blood LGE (healthy <1.20, scar >1.32) do not differentiate between scar and n on-scar in dark-blood LGE (Figure 2). Conclusion: Novel 3D dark-blood LGE of the atria is feasible and could be successfully performed and post-processed in a pre- ablation AF population. Future studies, however, should determine scar thresholds for 3D dark-blood LGE as conventional thresholds do not apply. Limitations: Atrial arrhythmias influenced image quality.

Mochula*, ov; Tomsk/RU (mochula.olga@gmail.com) Purpose: Purpose was to study the type of left ventricular m yocardial damage in patients with AMI according to early CMR. Methods or Background: The study included 66 patients (age 62\u00b111 years; 62% male patients) that were admitted to the emergency department with AMI. CMR was performed in a 1.5 T MR-scanner at a mean o f 6.9\u00b13.7 days after admission. For determination of oedema, short-axis slices using a T2-WI were obtained. Presence and type of scar were assessed i n LGE. Results or Findings: The admitted patients were diagnosed with AMI with ST- elevation in 68.18% of cases. According to the data of ICA, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with significant stenosis of the coronary arteries (CA) (MICAD) (48.5% n=32), with primarily single-vessel CA (MINOCA) (n=34, 51.5%). Myocardial damage (MD) detected of LGE was divided into three main types: ischaemic (IT), nonischaemic (NIT) and mixed (MT). According to LGE, patients with MICAD in 84.4% of cases visualised ischaemic type o f LV myocardial damage with varying patterns of LGE transmurality. In turn, patients of the MINOCA were characterised predominantly (65%) by non-ischa emic type of MD according to LGE-CMR. Nevertheless, in patients wit h MINOCA, in one-third of cases there was an IT MD. The combination of ischae mic and non-ischaemic MR patterns of myocardial damage was found to a les ser extent and in general amounted to 11% among all patients. Conclusion: CMR has important diagnostic value for determining the underlying cause of myocardial damage in patients w ith AMI. This is extremely important because various non-ischaemic diseases have a clinical picture similar to AMI. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Methods or Background: The study included 115 with STEMI who underwent endovascular revascularisation. To identi fy the of cTnI, NTproBNP, hsCRP, sS T2 were analysed at baseline, as well as after reperfusion therapy on t he 2nd (cTnI) and 5th (ST2, hsCRP, NTproBNP) days. Cardiac magnetic resonance i maging was performed 5 days after revascularisation. Results or Findings: Microvascular obstruction was disclosed in 54 patie nts (47%), of which 24 (44%) patients had a combination of microvascular obstruction and myocardial hemorrhage. In 61 cases (53%), no microvascular damage was registered. It was found that, with an i ncrease in the threshold initial NTproBNP levels >590 pg/ml, the odds ratio (OR) of myocardial injury was 12,2 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4,81-30,92, p<0,001). In addition, we analysed biomarker levels in the early period after myocardial infarction, at which threshold values of reperfusion injury parameters established as of m icrovascular injury were the initial NTproBNP values, as well as the cTnI, hsCRP , and sST2 values in the early postinfarction (sensitivity, 89,5%; specificity, 83,3%). Conclusion: Thus, the initial as well as cTnI, hsCRP, sST2 values after endovascular intervention are more informativ e for assessing the risk of microvascular damage in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

O. Shalaginova*, E. Butorova, (shalaginovayuliya@gmail.com) To compare native T1 mapping in assessing the exten t of myocardial injury in acute STEMI and myocardial viability with delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR-imaging. Methods or Background: 40 patients with revascularised acute STEMI underwent CMR imaging and T1-mapping 3-7 after onset of symptoms using a Siemens Magnetom Aera, 1.5 T MRI scanner. T1 maps w ere obtained using the modified MOLLI 5(3)3 sequence (Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery). Data were analysed on a Siemens workstat ion by a semiquantitative method. The severity of myocardial damage was obtained by calculating the fibrosis index, which reflects the depth and extent of the lesion. Results or Findings: MR images of 40 patients (680 segments in total) were analysed. 4 patients were excluded due to the unsat isfactory quality of T1 maps. All patients with gadolinium (GD) accumulatio n zones showed a change in relaxation time (T1). The sensitivity and specif icity of T1 mapping in detecting acute MI compared with LGE was 86.5% (95% CI 80.4-91.2) and 90.3% (95% CI 87.1-92.9), respectively. Median T1 f or regions with GD accumulation zones was 1211.5 ms [1186.3;1249.6], a nd for unaffected myocardium it ms [1049.5.3;1094.6]. T1 f or subendocardial and transmural lesions did not differ significantly. Co rrelation analysis of the severity of myocardial injury on LGE MR imaging and native T1 maps revealed a statistically significant direct moderate correlation (R=0.67, p<0.001). Conclusion: Native T1-mapping may detect ischaemic myocardial i njury and assess its extent without using contrast. It's important for patients with chronic kidney disease, allergic reactions to gadolinium-co ntaining contrast agents, and patients with serious conditions because it reduces the study time. However, the assessment of transmurality on native T1 maps requires further research. Limitations: The small cohort. Using a semiquantitative method f or detecting myocardial injury.

Methods or Background: A total of 39 patients with a diagnosis of prematur e ventricular complexes were studied by cardiac 1.5 T MRI. The study was performed with cardiac and respiratory gating to compare the PSIR-TFE LGE sequences and the native T1 mapping (MOLLI). Results or Findings: The analysis of LGE values detected variations of s ignal characteristic of myocardial alteration in 50 cardi ac segments in 14 (36%) patients. The native T1 mapping values recognised v ariations of signal in 278 cardiac segments in 33 (85%) patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that without contrast enha ncement and with a reduction in acquisition time, T1 mapping sequences are more sensitive compared to the traditional PSIR-TFE LGE in detecti ng premature ventricular complexes and in discovering signal alteration in m ore extensive myocardial areas.

Methods or Background: E-Cervix is a software programme that uses intrinsic compression to excite tissue and allows t he evaluation of quantitative parameters on the basis of pixel distribution in an elastogram. In total 222 patients participated in the study. We assessed 5 ultrasound parameters: elasticity index (ECI), hardness ratio (HR), internal os strain (IOS), external os strain (EOS), and IOS/EOS ratio. Each study was per formed according to a predetermined standardised protocol. Results or Findings: For all assessed elastographic parameters, we obtai ned good intra- and interobserver reproducibility. interclass correlation for and from 0.771 to 0.826 for interobserver variability. We demonstrated a significant correlation of some obtained elastographic parameters with the basic clinical features of patients, such as age, the number of pr evious caesarean sections, pregnancy weight, and BMI. In each case, the correl ation was very low. Conclusion: Quantitative elastographic assessment with the use of E-Cervix is characterised by good repeatability. Some clinical features may affect the value of the parameters obtained. The clinical relevance of this interference requires further investigation. Limitations: Analysis of correlation in our sample group may be subject to limitations due to the selection of the sample, which included patients hospitalised at the pregnan cy pathology unit rather than a population of patients in physiological pregnancy.

P. Radeva*, G. v, E. R. Panova, E. Naseva; Sofia/BG Purpose: The aim of our study is to evaluate the overall sensitivity and specificity of MR for diagnosing disorders of the placenta accreta spectrum and the pathologic features that have the highest predi ctive value. Methods or Background: Between March 2018 and October 2021, 66 pregnant women with risk factors of placenta accret a underwent MR examination after inconclusive ultrasound or to det ermine the size and depth of invasion for already diagnosed placenta accreta. Me an maternal age was 35.2, mean gestational age was 29.4. All MR examinations were reviewed by two radiologists with experience in genitourinary radiology. The standard of reference were intraoperative and pathologic findin gs. ROC curve analysis was used to test the discriminative ability of MRI feat ures for abnormally adherent and invasive placenta. Results or Findings: MR exhibited high overall sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 88.4 %, PPV of 94.4% and NPV of 82% ng abnormalities of the spectrum of placenta accreta. The features which ex hibited the greatest sensitivity and specificity were presence of dark bands, placental-myometrial bulge, vascular lacunes, myometrial thinning, myome trial disruption, serosal vessel sign, bladder vessel sign, bladder tenting. The loss of the dark line between placenta and myometrium and the change of t he pear shape of the uterus that are cited to have high sensitivity and specificity in other studies did not show to have high diagnostic value in our study . Conclusion: MR is a helpful adjunct tool to ultrasound in diagn osing placenta accreta spectrum disorders with very high sensitivi ty and specificity and thus aiding the preoperative planning and patient management. Limitations: The study includes a small number of patients. Intr aoperative data might be biased due to adhesions from previous C-section, therefore there might be some intraoperative overdiagnosing of superficial bladder invasion.

Assess the possibility of develo ping a radiological subcategorisation of rudimentary horn attachment to aid surgical planning. Methods or Background: Review of imaging and management of all patients with unicornuate uterus diagnoses between 2010-2021 with a diagnostic MRI via a PACS and electronic records system search (n= 33). Data on the following was collated: age at and reason for presentation, unicornuate uterus subtype (AFS classification), anatomical features on MRI (emphasis on attachment of rudimentary horns) and patient outcomes. Results or Findings: 33 female patients, age range at presentation 19-59 years, with mean age at presentation 32.5 years. 18/33 patients had a rudimentary horn, 6 functioning (33%) and 12 nonfunctioning (67%). Those without horns or with nonfunctioning horns presente d later with unrelated symptoms, and therefore no intervention was require d. Of the 6 functioning horns, 2 communicating horns were detected incident ally, but the 4 noncommunicating horns presented with significant associated symptoms and were offered resection.

S. L. Dedulle*, N. Fitousi, H. Bosmans; Leuven/ BE (andedulle@gmail.com) Purpose: One of the features of dose management systems is outlier analysis by alerting for doses above threshold levels. Inclu ding the patient size in outlier analysis could reduce the number of false positives due to large-sized patients. The purpose of this study was to prove this hypothesis in a large dataset of chest posterior-anterior radiography examinations. Methods or Background: A dataset of 8777 chest posterior-anterior examinations performed on three devices was extract ed from a dose management software (DOSE, Qaelum). The patient siz e in terms of the water equivalent diameter was estimated based on data in the radiographic DICOM header (Dedulle et al. 2021). First, an examination was marked as outlier when the dose area product (DAP) exceeded the target val ue of 1dGy.cm2. Second, the DAP of the examination was correlated with the patient size and robust regression and outlier removal was used to obtain t he outliers of the correlation curve (Graphpad Prism). Results or Findings: The target value was exceeded in 5% of the examinations (397). Of these cases, 60% were also a n outlier in the curve analysis. The remaining 40% were larger-sized patie nts, with a water equivalent diameter above 29cm and for these patients, a higher dose is justified. The curve analysis also gave 114 additio nal outliers, with main causes distributed as follows: high doses for small er-sized patients (12%), wrongly indicated view (lateral images, 16%) and a large part of the abdomen included in the examination (35%). Conclusion: The study showed the win of an integrated two-param eter analysis (size and dose area product) in quality as surance of chest radiography; this analysis pointed also to other ca ses than just size and dose outliers. Some issues would have gone undetected if only doses had been evaluated. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Fluoroscopy imaging represents a real-time guide of moving objects during interventional procedures. The presentation of high and low contrast moving objects is affected by different characteris tics of the fluoroscopy device i.e. the typical lag of the detector, the number of frames per second acquired and the recursive filters applied. Methods or Background: A simple phantom has been assembled to simulate the motion of high and low contrast objects and qua ntify the effect of high and low contrast dynamic objects. Fluoroscopy images fr om 2 equipment (Siemens Artis Q, Germany and Philips Juno, the Netherlands) have been analysed to quantify lag and blur. A 30 rpm motor allows the rotation of an aluminium plate; high contrast lead disks and a linear steel insert with 0.2 mm of diameter, are assembled on the rotating plate. Lag, defined as the signal persistence of high contrast disks has been evaluated; furthermore, blu r or the contrast changes of low contrast detail has been measured. Results or Findings: The lag effect on the closest frame is about 1.3% w ithout recursive filtration while it is about 74% for recursive filters with k=4. The contrast decreases to about 1/10 applying a recursi ve filter with k=4. Finally, the contrast of the linear steel insert decreases w ith the k factor as 1/k. Conclusion: This phantom allows a deeper characterisation of the effects of acquisition parameters on dynamic images; it gives both a quantitative and qualitative estimation of blur, lag and distortion, especially regarding their temporal behaviour.

M. Sanchez*, D. Va\u00f1o, J. M. Purpose: This a smartphone application protot ype for occupational dosimetry in interventional practices where the professionals involved who wear an electronic personal dosimeter (with wireless transmission capacity), can follow their occupation al doses received at any time and can compare them with dose limits and with the other working colleagues. Methods or Background: Wearing electronic dosimeters on the chest over the apron, Hp(10) is recorded every second and sent to hubs located at interventional labs. Occupational cumulative dose and dose rate are archived at operator and procedure level, and it is shown to the users, in a comprehensive way, on their smartphones or PCs. A c olour code (green, amber, red) indicates if the cumulative dose is wel l below the dose limits or on the contrary, requires optimisation. A dosimeter located at the C-arm is used as a reference. Results extracted from the first months of use are presented. Results or Findings: Eight interventional laboratories and 29 interventi onal professionals (interventionalists, radiographers and nurses) are being monitored with the DOSIM prototype. During Jan-Sept 2021 one interventionalist received 25 mSv over the apron, w hile the average dose for his professional profile is 4.3 mSv. The ratio betw een the personal cumulative dose and the dose at a reference C-arm dosimeter ranged from 0.2% to 6.6% (a factor of 33) for different interventionalists. These differences suggest different protection habits among operators, as wel l as a target for optimisation. Conclusion: With this system, professionals have easy access to their occupational dosimetry records using their smartphones, to thereby actively engage in the optimisation process. Limitations: The limitation is the potential lack of use of the personal dosimeters. Ethics committee approval: An approval by an ethics committee is not required.

E. Colombo*, G. Muti, S. Riga, M. Felisi, A. Torresin; Milan/IT (paolae.colombo@ospedaleniguarda.it) Purpose: This work aims to determine using the radiation dos e index monitoring (RDIM) software typical diagnostic refer ence levels (DLRs) for cardiologic, electrophysiology, interventional radi ology and procedures, as recommended the European Directiv e 2013/59/EURATOM. Methods or Background: 1-y retrospective study for the thirteen most frequent fluoroscopically-guided procedures is perf ormed. Demographic information and dosimetric data, such as fluoroscopy time (FT), air-kerma at the interventional radiological point (Ka,r) and ke rma-area-product (KAP) were collected using the RDIM software NEXO[DOSE]\u00ae (Brac co Injeneering SA, Lausanne). The 3800 studies analysed were carried on by four clinical teams and using seven angiographic rooms equipped with tw o biplane Philips Azurion, two Philips Integris Allura, two GE Innova2100IQ and a Siemens Artis Zeego. values of KAP, FT and Ka,r were evalu ated and compared to international DRLs. Three neuroradiology procedures (cerebral aneurysm repair, mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke MT and cerebral angiography), two electrophysiological procedures and Results or Findings: The typical DRLs established were reported, respectively, for values for diagnostic and therapeutical procedures were evaluated and are lower than European and nati onal DRLs, except for cerebral aneurysm repair in emergency. This work suggests that NEXO[DOSE]\u00ae software can be used for effective eval uation of large amount of data. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: European Directive 2013/59/Euratom included paediatric exposure in special practices that requi re appropriate optimisation. Ollier disease is characterised by enchondromas, ca rtilage tumours that begin as benign but may become malignant, and then need l ong follow-up. Diagnostic and dosimetric performances of EOS are c ompared to those of digital radiography (DR) and computed tomography (C T). Homemade bone structures are stuck on a 5-year-old anthropomorphi c phantom to mimic enchondromas, and imaged with DR, CT, and EOS at three x-ray tube speeds. Experienced radiologists measure the dimensions of the inserts and compare them with those derived from CT and DR. For each technique, Monte Carlo simulations and in-phantom measurements with thermoluminescent dosimeters are performed. Effective dose and Lifetime-Attribut able-Risk (LAR) are estimated. Three scanning speeds and two DR acquisi tion protocols (diagnostic and follow-up) are investigated. Results or Findings: The EOS system performs similarly to DR and CT in detection and measurement of enchondromas-like inserts. The fast protocol provides a reduction of effective and organ doses w ith respect to DR diagnosis protocol, but not to follow-up protocol. However, t he latter is equivalent to the fast protocol in terms of LAR. Doses and LAR of CT are always considerably higher than of the other techniques. Conclusion: EOS has same diagnostic capability as DR and CT. Al though no dose reduction is observed with respect to DR follow-up protocol, the fast protocol still provides low doses, and the two techniques are equivalent concerning LAR. Thus, it may be considered a soluti on for diagnosis and follow-up of Ollier enchondromatosis and other bone pathologies, allowing easier and faster examinations. Limitations: Not applicable.

Vancoillie*, L. N. Marshall, H. Task-based evaluation of synthetic mammography (SM) of different vendors using a 3D structured phantom and anthropom orphic model observer (MO). Methods or Background: SM images of a phantom containing 3D models of microcalcifications and masses were acquired at AEC , \u00bdAEC A 4-AF C study was performed for 5 microcalcification and mass diameters. Percentage correct (PC) was calculated using results from 5 readers and used for MO training. A two-layer non-biased Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO) was tuned separately for each system from a MO developed for DBT: a Laguerre -Gauss localisation CHO followed by a Gabor classification CHO. MO unce rtainty was estimated using bootstrapping. Agreement between human and CH O results was evaluated using three criteria: difference between human and CHO scores (mean error (ME)), linear regression slope (a) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Results or Findings: Microcalcification results for all systems were in the range -7.8<ME<11.9, a>0.90 and 0.86<r<1.08 suggesti ng good modelling of human performance. CHO predictions differed for the clarity S2D at \u00bdAEC (ME=-18.2 and a=0.72), probably due to low microcal cification visibility in the human reader results. For the masses, results were -8.4<ME<10.4, a>0.90 and 0.86<r<1.09. The CHO underestimated reader performa nce for mass detection on V-Preview and Intelligent 2D images, at MEmax=-16.1 and MEmax=-16.5, respectively. However, the trend of increasing PC f or increasing diameter was maintained (V-Preview: a>0.80 and 0.89<r<1.07 Conclusion: A two-layer CHO predicted human observer results fo r microcalcification and mass detection in phantom SM images of 5 vendors. The CHO in combination with the phantom is a promis ing candidate for periodic, standardised SM performance evaluation. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: 85 patients with SAS after OLT treated with embolisation were retrospectively reviewed. DSA was used to assess treatment success and to stratify patients accordin g to the site of embolisation. Liver function was thrombocyte count. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. Median laboratory values of pre, 1- and 3-days, as well as 1-week and 1-month post-embolisation were compared using linear mixed model regression analysis. Results or Findings: All procedures were technically successful and show ed an improved blood flow in the hepatic artery post-embolisation. Ten patients were excluded due to re-intervention or inconsistent image documentation. Pairwise-comparison using linear-mixed-model-regres sion analysis showed a significant embolisation (122 ( IQR 108) vs. 83 (IQR 74) in thousands, p=0.014). For all other laboratory values, no statistically significant difference could be shown with respect to the embolisation site. Conclusion: We conclude that a successful embolisation of the S A is independent of the site of embolisation. Choice of technique should therefore be informed by anatomical conditions, safety consid erations and preferences of the interventionalist. Limitations: Single-institutional retrospective analysis with a medium-sized cohort with fairly heterogeneous underlying diseases.

Martella*, (c.martella92@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the outcome of the treatment and trans- arterial embolisation of aneurysmal bone cysts in a cohort of 320 patients, comparing their effectiveness and safety. Methods or Background: We retrospectively studied the data obtained from patients diagnosed with aneurysmal cysts, treated at a single referral centre from 1994 to 2020: 266 received curettage, 54 embol isation. The site, lesion activity status (latent, active, and aggressive) an d clinical response were evaluated with a follow-up of approximately 40 mont hs in the curettage group and 121 months in the embolisation one. Results or Findings: The efficacy in the curettage group was 77% (n=205) . Cases of recurrence th embolisation (n=5), curettage 100%, 74% and 83% respectively. 4 patients who experienced a recurrence were no longer treated. From the group of embolised patients, 59% (n=32) were considered healed at first procedure. The remaining patients underwent embolisation (n=12), curettage (n=8) or infiltration (n=2), with a clini cal efficacy of the second treatment of 38%, 71,4% and 50%, respectively. The recorded data demonstrated a lower rate of complications (5% vs 9.6%) and days of hospitalisation (1 vs 3) in embolised patients comp ared to those receiving the other treatments. Conclusion: Selective arterial embolisation represents an attra ctive option for the management of these lesions. This minimal invas ive treatment is correlated with good results and a lower complication rate than the curettage. Furthermore, it is associated with a shorter hospit alisation period. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective design. Ethics committee approval: The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of our hospital.

Formation of pseudoaneurysms (PSA), delayed bleeding and rupture can lead to failure of NOM. Interventional Radiology (IR) em bolisation is now an integrated part of NOM. The aim is to look at incid ence and management of PSAs at our institution and the association with failure of NOM. Methods or Background: A single centre retrospective study from a Major Trauma Centre. All adult trauma patients who sustai ned a splenic injury between January 2014 and September 2019. Protocol i n our centre is for imaging at 48 hours and 6 weeks post-injury. Results or Findings: 226 patients with splenic injury were identified. 69 were managed non-operatively, with 41 receiving IR embol isation. NOM was successful in 98.8% of cases. There were 19 cases of PSA (8.4%) in our cohort, with a median time of diagnosis of 2.4 +/- 0.87 days from injury. Higher average grade of injury was seen in PSA patients (3.16 +/- 0.481) compared to the whole cohort (2.5 +/- 0.211). 42.1% of PSA were detected via the imaging protocol. 3 patients with PSA underwent splenectomy . 11 patients with PSA underwent IR embolisation. Persistent PSA, defined as PSA seen on imaging post IR, was seen in 6 patients. One of these patie nts required further IR intervention, 3 had resolution of PSA on follow-up and 2 did not have further imaging but remained clinically well. 5 patients wi th PSA were managed conservatively, with half having PSA resolution con firmed on imaging. Conclusion: NOM was successful in 98.8% of cases (compared to 80% in the literature). Aggressive pursuit of PSA in our insti tution is associated with high success of NOM. Limitations: The limitation is the single-centre design. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

S. Carbone*\u00b9, P. Marra\u00b9, a tertiary refe rral center for pediatric orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the interventional radiological (IR) and conservative management of acquired arteri oportal fistulas (APFs). Methods or Background: A retrospective search was performed to retrieve pediatric patients (<18 years old) with APF diagnos is at color-Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) from 2010 to 2020. Criteria for treatment were hemodynamic al terations at CDUS reversal) or clin ical manifestations (bleeding; portal hypertension). Conservatively managed patients served as a control population. Clinical and imaging follow-ups were analysed. Results or Findings: Twenty-three pediatric patients (median age 4 years ; interquartile range=11 years; 15 males) with 24 APF s were retrieved. Twenty patients were OLT recipients with acquired APFs (16 iatrogenic). Twelve out of twenty-three patients were managed conservatively. The remaining 11 underwent angiography with confirmation of a shunt in 10, who underwent a total of 16 embolisation procedures (14 endovascular; 2 transhepatic). Technical success was reached in 12/16 (75%) procedures. Clinical success was achieved in 8/11 (73%) patients; three clinical failures resulted in one death and two OLTs. After a median follow-up time of 42 months (range 1- 107), successfully treated patients showed an improvement in hemodynamic parameters at CDUS. Conservatively managed patients showed a stable persistence of the shunts in 6 cases, spontaneous r esolution in 4, reduction in 1 and mild shunt increase in 1. Conclusion: In pediatric patients undergoing liver interventions, APFs should be investigated. Although asymptomatic in most cases, IR treatment of APFs should be considered whenever hemodynamic changes a re found at CDUS. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective design, the wid e time range, and small number of very selected patients.

Methods or Background: All consecutive patients with cancer and at least one episode of hemoptysis that required pulmonary artery embolisation from December 2008 to December 2020 at participating centres were included in this observational retrospective review. The endpoi nts were technical success, clinical success, recurrence of hemoptysis and complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify va riables associated with recurrence or death. Results or Findings: A total of 92 patients were treated with pulmonary artery embolisation with 12 patients presenting recurrence after bronchial artery embolisation and 38 treated with simultaneous pulmo nary and bronchial embolisation. Pulmonary artery embolisation was tec hnically successful in 82 (89%) patients and clinically successful in 77 (84% ) patients. Recurrence occurred in 49% of patients. Infectious complications occurred in 15 patients (16%). The 30-days mortality rate was 31%. At 3 yea was (p=0.004), tumour cavitation (p=0.004) sis. Tumour cavitation (p=0.01) and pulmonary artery pseudo-aneurysm (p=0. 009) were associated with recurrence using ur size mortality. Using a multivariate analysis, tumour cavitation (p=0.001), pulmonary artery pseudo-aneurysm (p=0.007) and treatment with covered stents (p<0.001) were associated with shorter survival. Conclusion: Pulmonary artery embolisation is an effective treat ment to initially control hemoptysis in patients with lung carcinoma. Recurrence rate remains high and overall survival remains poor with less than 5% of patients still alive at 3 years. Limitations: This is a retrospective, one-sample cohort with no control group.

Methods or Background: A monocentre, retrospective study of 76 consecutive patients who underwent TAE for bleeding gastroduodenal peptic ulcers from 2005-2020. Patient demographics, endosc opy findings, co- morbidities and interventional procedure findings w ere recorded. The outcome measures were technical and clinical success, procedure-related complications, recurrent bleeding, length of hospit al stay, 30-day mortality and overall survival. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 147 Results or Findings: The technical success rate was 90.8% and the clinic al success was 65,8%. The rebleeding and 30-day mortal ity were 30,7% and 22,4% respectively. A higher international normalis ed ratio (INR) was a statistically significant risk factor for 30-day mo rtality (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 1.67- 30.70; p=0.008). Comorbidity Index (CCI) and a lower Rockall score were significantly associated with a longer overall survival (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.35; p =0.0001) and (HR, 1.32; p=0.003) respectively. The occurrence of early rebl eeding is significantly associated with a lower overall survival (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.57-4.71; p=0.0004). There were no statistically significant differences in outcome or overall survival using different embolic agents. Conclusion: Type of embolic agent did not influence overall sur vival. A higher INR was a significant risk factor with a higher 30- day mortality. A lower CCI, a lower Rockall score and the absence of early rebleeding were significantly associated with a longer overall survival.

S. Sarkadi*, J. Cs re, D. Veres Sandor, N. L. Moln\u00e1r, V. B\u00e9rc zi, E. Budapest/HU Purpose: Evaluate factors associated with pseudoaneurysm for mation in a relatively large patient population. Methods or Background: Between January 2016 and May 2020, 30196 patients had interventional radiological or cardiac endovascular procedures arterial (appr 26362) or venous (appr 15308) puncture; all patients developing PSA were identified. A matched (age, gender, and type of procedure) control group of 134 patients was create d to assess factors associated with PSA formation. For statistical anal ysis, ANOVA and likelihood- ratio tests were calculated; effect sizes were expr essed as odds ratios (ORs; with PSA versus without PSA). Results or Findings: 134 PSAs (symptomatic: N = 112; 83.6%) were identified in 134 patients (72 women; 25.4% of PSAs were localised to the upper limb and 74.6% to the lower limb (vascular cl osure device used in 37 of these patients). Treatments for upper and lower lim b PSAs, respectively: bandage replacement in 25 cases, transducer compres sion in 5 cases, thrombin injection in 86 cases, and surgical recons truction in 18 cases. Compared to the matched control group (N = 134), anemia (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 2.3-5.2; P = 0.016) was a predictor of PSA formation. Conclusion: The risk of PSA formation is higher in the case of preoperative anemia, high INR, and if vascular closure devices w ere used. Limitations: Limitations of this study include those inherent to a single centre retrospective analysis.

Tcacenco*, J. Poto nik, C. Brophy, A. Lunney, D. Duggan, J. M. Grehan, S. J. Foley, J. L. A. Rainford; Dublin/IE (Antoninatcacenco@yahoo.com) Purpose: Virtual Reality (VR) in the context of healthcare education is an immersive and interactive simulated environment. Educators can recreate a clinical environment or experience without exposing the patient to any associated risks and is ideal for students to gain radiation safety knowledge. Methods or Background: A cohort of final year radiography students (n=100) and medical students (n=35) were introduced to 3 Di mensional Virtual Reality (3DVR) software designed to improve the learners' understanding of radiation safety in a radiology interventional suite. The radiography students underwent formal training as part of an academic module and c ombined this experience and that gained on clinical placement when being as sessed in the 3D virtual space. Volunteer medical students attended similar 3DVR activities without assessment. A feedback survey gained insight into how the 3DVR radiation experience had supported their knowledge of radiati on safety. Results or Findings: In total 76 survey responses were received from 49 radiography and 27 medical students. Participants r eported an increase in confidence in their knowledge of radiation safety a nd valued the simulation experience. 87% of respondents stated they would recommend the 3DVR as a learning tool to other students. The majority of pa rticipants (n = 84%) also agreed that the 3DVR sessions had helped them under stand radiation safety matters better and enhanced their critical thinking. 80% of participants enjoyed using 3D VR as part of their learning and 74% state d they would prefer more time using the 3D VR. Conclusion: The students identified the 3DVR radiation safety s oftware as very beneficial and were encouraging of its integra tion into the curriculum in conjunction to traditional lecture and lab-based teaching in line with universal design learning principles.

L. McFadden*, C. Hughes, T. Flood, A. O Neill, P. McClure; Belfast/UK (s.mcfadden@ulster.ac.uk) Purpose: Variation in training and education of therapy radi ographers (TRs) across Europe leads to variations in clinical pract ice. The aim of this study was to gain an insight into patients' perceptions of the required skills and competencies of TRs to inform the development of undergraduate curricula across Europe. Methods or Background: Ethical permission was obtained from Ulster University, Belfast, UK. Online and face to face in terviews were conducted with radiotherapy patients across UK, Portugal, and Malt a. Patients >18years currently receiving, or had received radiotherapy w ithin the last 24 months, Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 148 were included in the study. Thematic analysis was performed with the aid of NVivo. Results or Findings: In total, 38 interviews (18 in the UK; 11 in Malta; 19 in Portugal) have been conducted to date. Patients fel t that TRs had the required competencies to listen, understand and communicate compassionately with them during their treatment. The importance of psyc hosocial support and building a relationship with the TRs varied conside rably. Patients who developed stronger relationships with their TRs fel t safer compared to those patients with less established personal connections to their TRs. Patients expressed a desire for further information from their TRs at the end of their radiotherapy treatment and through the post-treatment phase of their care. Conclusion: Patients need more holistic support at the end of t reatment and in post-treatment care. Role extension/specialist roles are needed to support patients. Limitations: As not all European countries were involved in this study, the findings may not represent the breadth of patient experiences throughout Europe.

Matthews*\u00b9, J. Atutornu\u00b2, P. of the FORCE project is to develop virtual web- based learning resources where radiography undergraduates can engage in interactive, problem-based development of radiographic knowledge, ability and professional awareness. Methods or Background: It is a pre-requisite of radiographer education that students learn during clinical placements. This is essential for the development of competence and confidence in the emerging graduate. The number of undergraduate radiographers in training poses chall enges to clinical placement capacity in many countries, which in turn impacts t he quality of the clinical education experience. Solutions are needed to augme nt the scale and quality of clinical learning. The FORCE project is leveragi ng a variety of web-based tools to develop a simulation system to augment cli nical education, and within this will promote the recognition and validation of the knowledge, skills, and competences thus gained. Results or Findings: Within a web-based virtual learning environment (VLE), simulated patient cases (20 diagnostic, 10 RNI and 10 therapy) that encourage learner interaction are being developed. Each patie nt case includes learning resources pertaining to patient care; performance of diagnostic radiography or radionuclide imaging or therapy planning; patient s afety; image interpretation and radiographer roles and responsibilities. Conclusion: The presentation will summarise some achievements and challenges from the development process. Limitations: The FORCE project is a work in progress and will not complete until May 2023.

SWOT/TOWS analysis was performed t o understand the status quo of education and training (E&T) in radiation protection in Europe. Methods or Background: The project work package team (n=14) included representatives from IAEA; and five clinical experts representing: medical phy sics; nuclear medicine physicians; radiologists; radiation oncologists and radiographers. Four subgroups performed SWOT/TOWS analysis related to E &T in RP developed under previous EU programmes and on the guidelines on radiation protection education and training of medical professionals in the European Union. Results or Findings: Consensus agreement identified four main themes for strengths and opportunities, namely: (1) existing s tructures and training recommendations; (2) RP training needs assessment a E&T model(s) development; (3) E&T dissemination, harmonisation, and accreditation; (4) financial supports. Weaknesses and threats analysis resulted in two themes: (1) awareness and prioritisation at a national/global level and (2) awareness and prioritisation by healthcare professional groups and researchers. Conclusion: EuRnR strategic planning needs to consider processes at European, national and local levels and incorporate the multiple factors identified. Clear, efficient governance structures and expert leadership are required, as are finances to facilitate a pan-Europ ean radiation protection training network which is sustainable and accredited across multiple national domains. Limitations: Future consideration does need to incorporate the expertise of E&T scientists as the EuRnR framework documentation is progressed.

M. Oliveira*\u00b9, B. Barbosa\u00b2, J. G. Couto\u00b3, I. Br avo\u00b2, C. Hughes , S. L. McFadden Purpose: This study aimed assess advanced practice (AP) r oles amongst therapeutic radiographers (TRs) and to identify edu cational gaps for this level across Europe. Methods or Background: A self-designed mix-method cross-sectional online survey (English) was validated by 5 external expert s and by 5 TRs from different countries. It was distributed to TRs prac ticing AP roles across Europe irrespective of recognition as \"advanced practition ers\" (between December 2021 and March 2022). Practitioners were asked about current AP roles and opinions regarding current and future education nee ds to underpin these roles. Convenience sampling was used to recruit the qualif ied TRs working in AP using multiple strategies to disseminate the survey including snowballing. Quantitative data (using SPSS) and qualitative data (thematic analysis using NVivo12) were analysed separately, triangulated and interpreted. Results or Findings: 271 participants responded with 189 valid participa nts from 21 European countries. Inconsistency was found in role titles, scope of practice, educational backgrounds, and AP roles implementation across countries. These practitioners have a trend to work more in clinical practice Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 149 domain with a low percentage of time allocated to r esearch. Education needs regarding knowledge about image-guided and adaptive Radiotherapy (RT), multimodal imaging and technologies, and advanced t reatment planning were found. Training needs on leadership and management skills, and clinical site- specific expertise were identified. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to standardise AP in RT to uniformise educational and training at the national and European levels. Limitations: The language bias of the survey may have excluded s ome participants from non-English speaking countries.

Foley; Dublin/IE (cliodhnamurphy06@gmail.com) Purpose: To identify whether practitioners and referrers in Irish hospitals have sufficient knowledge about ionising radiation to ad equately inform patients on the risks and benefits associated with imaging exam inations. Methods or Background: The EU Directive 2013/59/Euratom requires referrers and practitioners explain the benefits and risks associated with medical imaging examinations to their patient, prior to radiation exposure. This has been transposed into national legislation amongst member states. To comply with this legislation, these professionals m ust have sufficient knowledge about radiation, although published research suggests this is not the case. An online survey was sent to three Irish radiology departments of varying sizes for distribution to radiographers, referring nurses and doctors in each hospital. This asked about participant demographics, ionising radiation knowledge and benefit-risk conversations. Quantitat ive responses were analysed manually, and SPSS software was used for s tatistical analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative res ults. Results or Findings: 34 responses were received. Results demonstrated th at all three professional groups have a low level of r adiation knowledge. Radiographers scored highest on the knowledge-based questions (radiographers mean score: 0.47, medical doctors: 0.32, nurses: 0.28). Legislation compliance was low among participants, with only 5 (17%) indicating they regularly engage in benefit-risk conversations, even though 17 (57%) participants stated they had confidence in doing so. Opinions differed on who should deliver this information to patients and when. Conclusion: Further education and training is required for referrers and radiographers to ensure consistent and accurate benefit risk communication to patients and ensure compliance with key EU radiation legislation.

Matthews, *C. Heckmann*; Dublin/IE (caoimhe.heckmann@ucdconnect.ie) Purpose: When using a bank of images to teach or measure ima ge interpretation, it is important to include images w ith varying levels of difficulty. Previous authors propose rigorous but resource-inte nsive methods for establishing these degrees of difficulty. The current study proposes a simple approach in an image bank suitable for an observer study. Methods or Background: Extremity examinations with radiological reports were harvested. Of 94 images, 51 were reported as abnormal, 43 as normal. The report was taken as the true opinion. Insight o f these reports, the researchers assigned the level of normality or abnormality as obvious or subtle. The 94 images were then reviewed independently by four radiographers, blind of the reports. Each radiograp her assigned an opinion from obvious abnormality, subtle abnormality, not s ure, probably normal and definitely normal. Each radiographer's opinions wer e scored relative to the report opinion on a scale from 0 to 3. Observer scores for each image were summed, and ranked by median values in two groups: radiology normal and radiology abnormal. The eeing with of calculated as a perc entage. Results or Findings: Combined consideration of median values and % agreement with radiology opinion allowed categorisation of ease of image interpretation as very easy, easy, moderately diffi cult, very difficult, too difficult. A random selection of the categorised images was tr ialed in an image observer study investigating student radiographer image interpretation ability. Student performance correlated moderately with the degree of difficulty assigned, thus validating the method. Conclusion: The method permits reasonable categorisation of image interpretation difficulty for observer studies. Limitations: A larger radiographer observer study would further validate the approach.

Methods or Background: Cystic renal cell carcinoma consists of fluid-filled malignant masses that are diagnosed based on the Bo sniak classification system. This CT-based classification system often r esults in over-diagnosis and consequently the unwanted resection of benign m asses and is affected by interreader variability. To overcome these shortcom ings, machine learning models were trained using 5 quantitative imaging features selected for their robustness and predictive power. An ensemble of linear SVMs was used to perform classification. The imaging data were collected at two medical centres (Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+) and t he University of California - San Francisco (UCSF) medical center). Leave One-Out-Cross- Validation was performed on the UCSF dataset. MUMC dataset was used as an external validation dataset. To make them interpretable and facilitate adoption, the models were made explainable via Shapley analysis. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 150 Results or Findings: For the UCSF dataset, a precision of 0.97\u00b1 0.07 and recall of 0.85 \u00b1 0.15 was obtained for benign cysts (precision 0.60 0.34 and recall 0.82 \u00b1 0.38 for malignant cysts). External v alidation yielded a precision of 0.84 and recall of 0.88 for benign cysts (precision of 0.79 and recall of 0.73 for malignant cysts). These results are competitive wit h clinical performance. Conclusion: An interpretable machine learning pipeline based on radiomics features can aid clinicians in reducing the number of unnecessary surgeries. Limitations: The reproducibility of radiomics features should be investigated using phantoms and test-retest patient data. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the ethics committees.

RPS 605a-3 Prospective post-marketing surveillance of AI for b reast cancer screening in clinical practice *D. Byng*\u00b9, S. Bunk\u00b9, D. Sch\u00fcler\u00b9, M. surveillance (P MS) data can provide a multifaceted picture of the robustness of an AI device in clinical practice. We introduce an integrated AI system with live monitoring to support PMS in breast cancer screening. Methods or Background: Routinely-documented data on screen-detected cancers and recalls from 6 German screening units using a CE-marked AI system was collected over a 9 month period in 2020/ 21. Age- and density- stratified crude unadjusted cancer detection and recall rates were calculated and compared between studies read with, and without AI support using Pearson's chi-squared test. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between screening with AI and likelihood of cancer detection or recall. Models were weighted by invers e propensity scores, adjusted for important risk factors (age, breast de nsity, incident or prevalent screening) and clustered by reader ID. Results or Findings: Data on N=23,453 studies read with AI, and N=37,019 studies not read with AI were documented. Unadjusted cancer detection rates and recall rates across subgroups were higher for s tudies read with AI. When controlling for important risk factors, the likelih ood of cancer detection was higher, and the likelihood of recall was lower for studies screened with AI vs studies not screened with AI (odds ratio (OR) for c ancer detection 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.30; OR for recall 0 .96, 95% CI 0.90-1.03). Conclusion: There is a trend towards a higher cancer detection rate and lower recall rate among studies read with AI. Continuous live monitoring in breast screening units, analogous to PMS, can provide invaluable information to safely roll-out AI systems. Limitations: Not applicable Ethics committee approval: This is a post-market surveillance study of routinely-collected clinical data of a CE-marked medical device.

Luo*, W. Du, J. Ding, M. Chen; Beijing/CN Purpose: We aimed to introduce a deep learning model with ResNet added with attention mechanism to differentiate pneumonia -type lung carcinoma from pneumonia based on chest CT images. Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled 131 patients with pneumonia-type lung carcinoma and 171 patients with pneumonia from October 2019 to February 2021. There were slightly more men than women (162 vs 140), with the average age of 68\u00b115 years old. A Unet model was applied to extract lesion features from chest CT im ages. The extracted lesions were classified by a designed spatial attention mec hanism network. The model AUC and diagnostic accuracy were analysed and compared with radiologists' (junior and senior radiologists) performance. Results or Findings: This model detected and classified each lesion within 6.31 seconds. The average AUC could reach 0.82 ugh according to lesion t exture diversity and boundary ambiguity, it could produce 13.5% of false -positive samples. Its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (74.2%, 60.4% , and 89.4%) were higher than 75.0%) or senior (65.0%, 51.9%, and 79.2%) radiologists. With the assistance of this model, both junior (76.0%, 62.8%, and 89.8%) and senior (78.0%, radiologists' performance were improved. Conclusion: ResNet added with attention mechanism could be a pr actical approach to detecting and differentiating pneumonia -type lung carcinoma from pneumonia. Limitations: There is an overlap between pneumonia-type lung car cinoma and other pulmonary injuries. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Gombolevskiy*, R. V. Reshetnikov, I. Blokhin, Moscow/ RU (g_victor@mail.ru) Purpose: To develop an understanding of the limitations of applying artificial intelligence (AI) to lung cancer screening (LCS). Methods or Background: LCS has proven to be an effective methodology that results in fewer lung cancer (LC) deaths. However, AI in LCS could change the balance: reducing false negatives can increase unnecessary invasive procedures and complications. AI-based det ection of pulmonary nodules, coronary calcium, emphysema may seem benef icial but will inevitably increase the burden on health care. Results or Findings: LCS is an additional burden; scaling up without AI would be impractical or even unfeasible. That being said, only a few LCS studies require immediate action. With the introduction of AI, the benefit-to-harm ratio of LCS will change. The potential harms will be dif ficult to assess during the initial introduction of AI in LCS. A difficult-to-p redict redistribution of patient groups with different management tactics is likely, primarily due to a decrease in patients with normal findings. Proving the benef it of AI in LCS will take years. The algorithms are updating so rapidly that classic lengthy randomised trials on AI in LCS are impractical. To address this race against the machine, we need to develop and use new progressive research designs . Conclusion: First, full-scale lung cancer screening will not be possible without AI. Second, AI could imperceptibly change the balance of benefit and harm in LCS. Third, AI is evolving so rapidly that future m ulti-year studies evaluating AI in screening are impractical and require new approaches to study design. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

B. Netzer*, A. Schrader, M. G\u00f6rtz, C. Schlemmer, D. Bonekamp; Heidelberg/DE Purpose: Deep learning based segmentation of significant prostate cancer (sPC) has been shown to perform similar to PI-RADS assessment. However, questions remain on the transferability of models t rained on homogeneous training data to different MRI protocols. Here, we investigate the ability of training using only one diffusion sequence to gener alise to two different diffusion sequences, and the benefit of training wi th all three diffusion sequences. Methods or Background: Bi-parametric (T2w, ADC and high b-value) MRI sequences from 1022 exams were used for training an d 246 were used for testing. 3D U-Net based CNN ensembles (5-fold cross -validation) to segment sPC were trained: and (rsDWI) and zoomed-FOV imaging (zDWI) (1613 unique combinations). Testing was performed on three different test sets, T2w paired with a) 246 epiDWI, b) 246 rsDWI, c) 246 zDWI images. Performan ce was assessed by patient-based prediction of sPC determined by extended systematic and targeted MRI/TRUS fusion biopsy. Results or Findings: On the epiDWI test set, models A and B reached area under the receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC-A UC) of 0.86. On rsDWI test set ROC AUC was 0.84/0.85 for models A/B respective ly, and 0.85/0.86 for zDWI. All differences were statistically insignific ant in DeLong's test. Conclusion: Epi-only CNN training led to only minor reduction of performance on rsDWI and zDWI test sets, demonstrating that a l arge fraction of domain- specific knowledge can be transferred from epi-only training. However, small gains in performance and robustness from zDWI and r sDWI enriched training motivate inclusion of multi-sequence data into trai ning the future, especially as no detrimental effect on epi-only test data was found.

Several metrics such as RECIST or volume can be derived from a lesi on segmentation. The goal of the study was to develop and evaluate a n AI-based algorithm for segmenting lymph nodes and soft tissue lesions in f ollow-up CT of cancer patients with minimal user interaction. Methods or Background: In this approved retrospective study, we include follow-up CT examinations from 206 stage IV melanom a patients from the University Hospital. Lesions are first identified b y a radiologist with one click in the baseline CT scan and then automatically segment ed by a neural network in less than a second. In follow-up, the segmentation is created fully automatically by propagating the click point using a co-registrat ion and applying the same neural network. The neural network was trained on 163 patients with overall 3462 lesions and validated on 43 patients with over all 222 lesions. The accuracy of our algorithm was measured in terms of diameter and volume overlap compared to a manual segmentation performed by an experienced radiologist. Results or Findings: The algorithm achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.81 on baseline and 0.81 on follow-up soft tissue lesions and of 0.79 on baseline and 0.75 on follow-up lymph nodes. The median relative diameter error over all lesions is 0.13 and the median relat ive volume error is 0.23. Conclusion: Soft tissue lesions and lymph nodes can be successf ully segmented by an AI-based algorithm. This can potent ially increase reading efficiency in both clinical routine and research. Limitations: The study was performed within a single institution and among patients with a single cancer entity. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the ethics committee.

Purpose: Deep learning classification may be affected by scanner type. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a novel method th at simultaneously identifies and quantifies the changes of liver metastasis in contrast enhanced abdominal CT (CECT) between a current and a prior s can by deep learning classification on a custom phantom scanned with dif ferent vendor CT scanners. Methods or Background: The liver phantom (QRM) consisted of a semi- anthropomorphic frame with two custom-designed inserts in which 28 spheres (14 in each insert) of 12 diameters (3-50 mm) and d ensities were embedded to simulate lesions and lesion changes. It was scanned 3 times on 4 scanners (Philips iCT, Siemens Somatom, Canon Aquilon, GE Optima 660). Pairs of scans corresponding to clinical current and prior s cans were processed with a novel method that automatically detects and segment s the liver metastases with a simultaneous 3D U-Net classifier. The scan r esolutions were 512\u00d7512\u00d7350-449, 0.75-0.85\u00d70.75-0.85\u00d71.5 mm3 with 0.75 mm slice overlap at 120 kV. The sphere detection, matching changes, individual volume and matching spheres volume difference were computed and compared to the theoretical ground truth values defined by the liver inserts design. Results or Findings: The method correctly detected all 484 (28 spheres \u00d7 16 scan pairs) and correctly classified all 32 \"new\", 32 lesions that \"disappeared\" and 384 \"existing\" sphere changes. The mean -18.1% [-100.0,+41.5], [-99.6,+42.5], 0.22cc [-0.6,+2.93]. All sphere volumes and sphere volume changes measurements were within \u00b11/2 voxel spheres diameter imaging resolution (\u00b10.75-0.85 mm) . Conclusion: Simultaneous deep learning based detection and quantitative volumetric analysis of liver lesions follow-up chan ges analysis in CECT provides accurate detection and measurements on a c ustom phantom among different scanners.

Shnayien, T. Patients with Marfan syndrome or related disorders are at risk for aortic dissection and aortic rupture, and therefore require appropriate monitoring. Computed tomography (CT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) are routinely used for initial evaluation and follow-up. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of TTE and CT in i nitial assessment and two- year follow-up. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 95 patients aged 55 years diagnosed with Marfan syndrome or related disorders. All patients underwent initial assessment including aortic diameter measurement using both TTE and ECG-triggered CT. 42 of the patients d id not undergo aortic repair within two years after initial assessment an d were monitored by follow- up imaging. Differences between the two methods wer e compared using Bland-Altman plots. The acceptable clinical limit of agreement was predefined as <+/-2millimeters. Results or Findings: Measurement differences showed wide limits of agreement for initial assessment, with the aortic s inus ranging from +6.3mm to 5.9mm and the aorta from +5.6mm to -8.9mm , and for follow-up, with the aortic sinus from +6.7mm to -5.8mm and the ascending aorta from +8.1mm to -10.1mm. Regarding the ascending aorta, T TE systematically overestimated aortic diameters with a difference bi as of -1.6mm for initial assessment and -1.1mm for follow-up. Progressive ao rtic enlargement was detected in 57% using CT and 40% using TTE. The frequency of measurement differences outside the acceptable clinical agreement limit of difference was highest for the ascending aorta for initial assessm ent (40%). Conclusion: Monitoring of patients with Marfan syndrome and rel ated disorders should include ECG-triggered CT of the ao rta for initial assessment, follow-up, and determination of diameter changes ov er time to correctly identify aortic enlargement and progressive disease. Limitations: Retrospective dataset, possible selection bias towa rd patients with less severe disease. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

A. Rinkel, V. Guglielmi, S. M. Boekholdt, L. F. Beenen, C. B. L. M. Majoie, Y. n; Amsterdam/NL Purpose: To assess the feasibility and diagnostic yield of c ardiac CT in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. Methods or Background: We performed a single-centre, prospective cohort study in consecutive adult patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Patients underwent prospective ECG-gated cardiac CT, immediately after CT- angiography of the aortic arch, cervical and intrac ranial arteries. Patients also underwent routine stroke work-up, including transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Primary endpoint was the proportion of patie nts with a predefined high- risk cardio-aortic source of embolism on CT versus TTE in patients undergoing both investigations. Results or Findings: 452 patients (59.2% male, median age 72) were included and underwent cardio-aortic CT. The median additional scan time of cardiac CT was 6 (interquartile range 5-7) minutes with good or excellent image quality in 73.2%. In total, 350/452 (77.4%) patients underwent TTE. A high-risk source of was dete cted on CT, (odds ratio 5.60, 95% confidence interval: 2.28-16.33). Cardiac throm bus was the most frequent CT finding (25 patients [7.1%]). The diagnostic yield of cardiac CT in the full study population (n = 452) was 12.2%. Among 175 pat ients with cryptogenic stroke after routine diagnostic workup, cardiac CT identified a potential cause of stroke in 11 (6.3%). Conclusion: Cardiac CT acquired in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke is technically feasible and has a higher diagnostic yi eld than TTE to detect high- risk sources of embolism. Cardiac CT may be considered as an alternative to TTE to screen for cardioembolism. Limitations: Compared CT with TTE and not transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), time difference (median of one day) between CT and TTE.

(6) Diagnose the most common complications. Methods or Background: Not applicable. Results or Findings: Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is made up of three different entities: aortic dissection, aortic intra mural haematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer; each with charac teristic radiological findings. Despite the low incidence of AAS (7.7 cases per 100 ,000 people/year), it is a pathology with high mortality, reaching up to 57% a t 10 years in the case of aortic dissection. An accurate and early diagnosis is of vital importance in the context of this urgency; this is where the role of the radiologist is valuable. The radiological study of the AAS should include a simple thoracic computed tomography (CT) study and subsequently a CT angiogr aphy. The radiological study should allow us to identify and interpret the most characteristic radiological findings of the different entities of the SAA, taking into consideration their differential diagnosis and poss ible image interpretation errors that may occur. Conclusion: SAA is a vital clinical situation, where its progno sis depends on an accurate and quick diagnosis, for an early start of its treatment. The role of the radiologist is of utmost importance in the management of the patient with suspected AAS. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: The midtarsal joint is composed by several bones and ligaments. The evaluation of these structures i n post-traumatic injuries could be challenging in many cases. The Bifurcate l igament and the Spring ligament complex have a key role in the stability of the midfoot and the plantar arch of the foot respectively. Bifurcate ligament i s a Y-shaped ligament composed by two components: the calcaneo-navicular component extends from the anterior process of the calcaneus to the dorso-lateral navicular and the lateral calcaneo-cuboid component extends from the anterior process of the calcaneus to the dorsomedial cuboid. The plantar Calcaneonavicular Ligament (CNL), also known as the spring ligament c omplex, extends from the calcaneus to the tarsal navicular and has three ligaments, and plantar ligaments. These complex structures can be damaged in sprain injuries of the ankle and the midfoot. Results or Findings: We will provide dedicated US-MR images compared with detailed anatomic schemes and dynamic animatio ns showing the most common injury patterns. Conclusion: Dynamic HRUS allows a quick, real-time evaluation o f midtarsal ligaments and combined with MRI allows a complete and thorough evaluation of ligaments anatomy and biomechanics of traumatic injuries.

Solano L\u00f3pez; Barcelona/ES Purpose: To perform a preliminary study and validate Shear W ave elastography as a new imaging tool to identify synovitis, comparing the stiffness of synovial tissue in patients with clini cal suspicion of synovitis versus a healthy control group. Methods or Background: In the period between April 2020 and June 2021 an observational retrospective study was carried out i ncluding a group of patients with clinical suspicion of synovitis under therapy (n = 50), and a control group of volunteers without clinical suspicion of synovit is (n = 50). All the subjects underwent complete reumathologic examinations and l aboratory tests. In all the participants, the biomechanical evaluations wer e carried out using 2D Shear Wave elastosonographic module of wrist and hand using a multiplanar scanning technique according to EULAR guidelines. A synovial tissue elasticity score was also inserted, which was dependent on the synovial tissue stiffness measured by Shear Wave elastography. Grade 1 0-30 k Pa, Grade 2 30-60 kPa, Grade 3 60-90 kPa and Grade 4 90-120 kPa. Results or Findings: In the 50 patients with clinical suspicion of synov itis, detectable joint effusion was found in 46 (92%) of them. The mean synovial tissue stiffness value measured by Shear Wave elast ography in this group was 72.18 kPa. In 50 healthy volunteers, joint effusion was found in 25 (50%) of them. The mean synovial tissue stiffness value meas ured by Shear Wave elastography in this control group was 6.91 kPa. Conclusion: Shear Wave elastosonography is a promising, simple, accurate, reproducible and non-invasive imaging technique tha t allows differentiating between physiological joint fluid and synovitis. Limitations: First study on the subject with few patients. Neces sary evaluation of the different rigidity in specific rheumatologic al diseases to confirm the usefulness of the technique.

M. slice-selective magnetic resonance angiogr aphy (QISS-MRA) in its ability to diagnose and monitor endoleaks and aneur ysm size after abdominal endovascular aneurysm tomography angiography (CE-CTA). Methods or Background: Our study included 20 patients (17 male, median age 79.8 years) who underwent radial QISS-MRA and C E-CTA after non- fenestrated infrarenal EVAR at first follow-u p examination. Two interventional radiologists evaluated datasets from both techniques for each patient concerning presence of endoleaks, types of endoleaks, aneurysm diameters and image quality. Results or Findings: Compared to CE-CTA, all endoleaks after abdominal EVAR were detected and classified correctly on QISS -MRA. The interobserver agreement between CE-CTA and QISS-MRA was almost pe rfect, except for type 2 endoleaks, where agreement was substantial. Intermodal aneurysm diameter measurements correlate \"very strongly\" for both observers. All results were statistically significant. Hyperdense imaging artefacts in CE-CTA cause aneurysm diameter measurements to be inaccurate by up to 1 cm. These artifacts were not present in QISS-MRA. Also, QISS- MRA seems to be more sensitive in detecting type II endoleaks. Some type II endoleaks could only be detected in QISS-MRA but not in CE-CTA, which was m ost likely due to low- flow endoleak characteristics. Conclusion: Radial QISS-MRA is a contrast agent-free technique for diagnosing and monitoring all types of endoleaks an d aneurysms in patients after abdominal EVAR. It provides information about specific clinical questions concerning aneurysm size as well as presence and ty pes of endoleaks without exposure to radiation and contrast agents.

Ramaekers*\u00b9, J. Westenberg\u00b2, Venner\u00b9, J. F. Lamb\u00b2; \u00b9Maastricht/NL, \u00b2Le iden/NL Purpose: Abnormal blood flow may be related to aneurysm grow th. However, sex-specific normal values for aortic flow and pote ntial sex differences have not been established yet. This study assesses quant itative flow parameters including velocity, wall shear stress, vorticity, helicity, and flow displacement in healthy males and females. Methods or Background: Forty young healthy volunteers (28.9 \u00b1 5.0 years, 50% male) were prospectively recruited and underwent 4D flow MRI of the total aorta at 3T. Quantitative flow parameters wer e calculated for all systolic cardiac phases in the following segments: (SR A) and infrarenal aorta (IRA). Data was compared using a student T-test, p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results or Findings: Females show smaller aortic diameters, which are significant for AoR (33.8\u00b12.6 vs. vs. 14.8\u00b11.0, p<0.01 mm). Maximum velocit ies are significantly lower in for the AoA (56.37\u00b19.6 vs. 49.7\u00b15.7 cm/s , p=0.011). Wall shear stress is significantly lower in females for the AA o (p=0.032). Vorticity is higher in females for the AoR, SRA, and IRA (all p<0.05). There are no significant differences in helicity and flow displacement. Conclusion: This study establishes sex-specific hemodynamic nor mal values for the entire aorta. Significant differences are present between males and females. This stresses the importance of a patient- specific approach for hemodynamic evaluations. Further studies are necess ary to evaluate sex- specific cut-off values in aneurysm prognosis. Limitations: The spatial and temporal resolution of 4D flow MRI is limited. However, both groups underwent identical scanning protocol, thus highly comparable.

R evaluation of parameters for ao rtic aneurysms often relies on patient-specific blood flow simulat ions. The purpose of this study is to present a tracking approach to estimate the local motion of the aortic wall from 4D MRI data, in view of fluid-stru cture interaction simulation calibration. Methods or Background: At every time step a simplified elastic model-based prediction is corrected with a dynamical state obse rvation derived from the whole 4D MRI data, both as geometrical and kinemati c data, with a Kalman filter. Systematic error estimation is provided, as suming that the near-wall velocity error is gaussian. Parameter sensitivity a nalysis is conducted on 2D academic cases. An elastic vesicle immersed in the cavity flow is simulated to generate time-resolved image sequences with a veloc ity field. The tracking is then tested for one patient exam. Further validatio n can be expected on a cohort of 5 patients with aortic aneurysm. Results or Findings: The accuracy of the tracking is evaluated in terms of surface reconstruction (Dice coefficient ) and mesh-point trajectories, in academic test cases. Satisfying surface reconstruct ion is obtained on slightly blurred images (Dice > 0.92), for different levels of data noise. Similar results are obtained with one patient exam (D = 0.92). Conclusion: The study shows promising preliminary results of a tracking method for the surface reconstruction of the aortic wall, with reasonable parameter sensitivity. It also provides an estimati on of the local wall displacement and velocity. Limitations: The method could be improved with further validation and the computation time needs to be optimised for only segmentation purpose.

However, the accuracy and reliability of personalised 3D-printed models a re not established. Dedicated imaging studies are necessary to standardise the measurement methods and to demonstrate safety and reliability of 3D-printed models use for FEVAR. Methods or Background: 16 3D-printed models of aortic arch and 13 3D- printed models of aorta and their corresponding angio-CTs were generated for patients with stable aortic aneurysms that were used in this accuracy study. First, 3D-models were scanned in CT and evaluated by three radiologists experienced in vascular CT. Next, CT-scanned 3D-mod els were segmented, aligned with patient data, and evaluated for the Hausdorff matrix. Finally, Bland-Altman plots determined the degree of agreement. Results or Findings: Intraclass Correlation Coefficients values were mor e significant than 0.9 for measurements of aorta diam eters in all landmark locations. Therefore, reliability of aortic 3D-models was outstanding. The Bland-Altman plots analysis indicated measurement biases of 0.05 to 0.47 for aortic arch templates and 0.06 of Hausdorff's mean distances for 3D-arch-templates mm and for 3D-abdominal-templates was 0.24\u00b10.03 mm. Conclusion: 3D-printed models based on angio-CT images of aorti c aneurysms appeared to be reliable. Thus, they can b e widely used in interventional radiology and endovascular surgery d epartments worldwide to accurately guide the PMEGs fenestration for advanced treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic diseases.

(riwa.meshaka@nhs.net) Purpose: A skeletal survey to screen for fractures is indicated when there are concerns over inflicted injury in a young child. Royal College of Radiologists 2017 guidance on imaging in suspected physical abus e (SPA) includes the addition of lateral radiographs of the joints. Our objective was to determine the additional diagnostic value of lateral radiographs in SPA. Methods or Background: A retrospective review of all SPA skeletal surveys in children aged under 30 months over a 3-year period was carried out. Incomplete and follow-up surveys were excluded. Bli nded reviews by two consultant paediatric radiologists were undertaken: firstly, with only frontal views available, secondly with frontal and lateral views. Fractures and confidence scores (1-5) were recorded. Results or Findings: 138/173 surveys met the inclusion criteria, mean age of 8 months, 17/138 (54%) male, 29/128 (21%) live case s. 9/138 (7%) had a of 16 appendicular fractures. 14/15 (93%) and 13/14 (93%) detected fractures were visible on the frontal view alone by Radiologist 1 and Radiologist 2, respectively. A distal radius fracture only seen on lateral view by Radiologist 1 was suboptimally imaged on the frontal view (whole arm view only). There was diagnostic uncertainty over a dist al tibial fracture only seen on the lateral view only by Radiologist 2. A significant increase in confidence was demonstrated in normal cases, but not fracture cases. Conclusion: Lateral views led to apparent additional fracture detection rate of 13% (2/16 in our study). The majority of corner met aphyseal fractures were visible on frontal view alone. Lateral views increa sed reporter confidence in correctly identifying the absence of a fracture in normal cases. Limitations: A single centre study limited by a small number of fractures. Larger, multi-centre studies are required. Ethics committee approval: Approval by an ethics committee was not required.

S. Vries\u00b9, M. Nagtegaal\u00b9, V. Konijn\u00b2, E. van de Mortel\u00b2, total body CT scan replace the skeletal survey in a post mortem setting? Methods or Background: In a retrospective observational cohort study we included deceased children aged 0-4 years who under went both a post mortem skeletal survey and a whole-body post mortem CT (PMCT) as part of a legal autopsy at the Netherlands Forensic Institute between November 2008 and December 2020. The studies were reviewed on a PACS System by one of two experienced paediatric radiologists. Results or Findings: Sixty-three cases were included. The median age was 4.0 months (range 0 - 58 months). The majority of c hildren were younger than 2 years old (91.4%). Most of the children were male (60.5%). Fractures were observed in 36 (44.4%). A total of 202 unique fract ures were identified with PMCT and/or the skeletal survey. PMCT (n=182) detec ted significantly more fractures compared to the skeletal survey (n=75, p= 0.011). Conclusion: PMCT is superior for the detection of skull and rib fractures, but missed more metaphyseal corner fractures and hand and foot fractures. The two modalities should be seen as complementary but based on these findings a limited skeletal survey could be performed if a t otal body CT is obtained. Limitations: The main limitation is that the pathology reports w ere not structured and that despite the fact that all cases underwent autopsy a pathology correlation was not possible.

MRI shows that the evaluation of knee joint epiphyses can all ow age estimation, especially with regard to the legally relevant age limit of 18 years. We checked the published age estimation criteria on their practicability in routine MRI data from German patients aged 12-25 years. Methods or Background: MRI of the proximal tibial epiphyses of 413 patient s (214 m and 199 f) who had a knee MRI (1.5T and 3.0T MRI) were analysed retrospectively. Quality assessment (Likert scale 1 -3) and staging (stages 2-6 according to Vieth et al. 2018) were based on coron ary sequences (T1 TSE, FS; T2 TIRM/STIR; slice thickness 3 mm). Results or Findings: 29 of initial 442 cases (6%) could not be classifie d regarding their stages due to bone marrow edema. Intra-observer agreement was \"good\" (=0.798). MR image quality (assessed on a Likert scale from 1 to 3) did not show a significant influence on the process of stag e determination. The first results of the analysed MRIs show significant accel eration in male gender (female sex stage 2 = 12.11yrs, 3 = 12.03yrs, 4 = 1 2.57yrs, 5 = 14.61yrs, 6 = 18.55yrs; male sex stage 2 = 12.08yrs, 3 = 12.43yrs , 4 = 15.23yrs, 5 = 16.52yrs, 6 = 20.27yrs). Detailed statistics including age minima and maxima of the individual stages are presented with exempla ry pictures and discussed. Conclusion: The staging according to Vieth et al. is possible using routine MRI data sets of the knee joint. However, an evaluation and weighting of the individual sequences in the age estimation is neces sary. Limitations: The limitation is the small number of volunteers.

Hanke, D. Busch, K. Ziebarth; Bern/CH Purpose: Patients with slipped-capital-femoral-epiphyses(SCF E) are at risk for development of osseous deformities causing hip pain and osteoarthritis. Therefore, we report on (1) prevalence of cam-defor mities, (2) prevalence of reduced femoral head-neck offset and (3) osteoarthr itis at long-term follow-up in patients with SCFE. Methods or Background: We performed a retrospective radiographic analysis involving 32 hips (32 patients, 1998-2010). Inclusi on criteria were SCFE patients that underwent modified Dunn procedure. We evaluated pelvic radiographs at mean follow-up time of 9\u00b13 years to calculate alpha angle on AP and lateral radiograph, head-neck offset, signs for osteoarthritis, Articulo- trochanteric distance(ATD) and minimal joint space width. Most patients had acute-on-chronic slip. The mean age of SCFE patient s was 13\u00b12 years at time of surgery and all patients presented with moderate or severe slips. Four Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 156 patients underwent subsequent hip preservation surg ery for correction of cam- deformities. Results or Findings: First, in total nine patients (28%) had cam deformi ties. Seven patients (22%) had cam-deformites (alpha-angl e>60\u00b0) radiographs. on Mean 51\u00b12\u00b0 on 40\u00b12\u00b0 <20 mm. Third, osteo arthritic changes were present in two SCFE patients (OA Grade 2 according to T\u00f6nnis). Minimal joint space width was 3.5mm\u00b10.5. Five patients developed periarticular ossifications, one patient had bilateral osseous cy sts of the proximal femur. Conclusion: One out of four SCFE patients developed cam-deformi ties associated with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). Although we found a low prevalence of osteoarthritis, these patients are at risk for developing hip osteoarthritis. We recommend routine radiographic f ollow-up for these patients. This could be important for doctors treating SCFE patients. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective analysis. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was obtained.

KK is one of the most frequent causativ e pathogens of osteoarticular infections in children under the age of 4 years. Infant osteoarticular infection is often insidious in nature and infections with KK usually have unremarkable inflammatory biochemical markers, adding further to the difficult diagnostic dilemma. Methods or Background: This retrospective study reports on 33 paediatric patients in an Australian metropolitan paediatric p opulation with PCR proven KK osteoarticular infection between September 2015 and September 2018. Each individual patient had clinical and biochemical parameters measured; additionally, radiological investigations were unde rtaken for 32 of the patients. Results or Findings: Often, radiograph imaging alone is not enough to diagnose a KK infection. Radiographs if viewed in i nsolation were only 50% sensitive to support a KK infection. However, from this study, it was shown that ultrasound, if viewed in insolation, was 96.15% sensitive in supporting a KK infection. Of these ultrasounds, all reported an ef fusion as one of the findings. 87% of the patients had a white cell count within n ormal limits and only 97% had a negative blood culture. Conclusion: KK infection is easy to misdiagnose because it affects a paediatric population that can be difficult to asse ss clinically, often appears relatively well and biochemical markers often withi n normal limits. It is therefore imperative to consider KK in the correct patient, s o appropriate imaging can be performed. Our study concludes that ultrasound is highly sensitive to positive findings and should be performed first if KK infect ion is suspected. Ultrasound is optimal for the demographic having no radiation side effects and being non- invasive. Limitations: The limitation is the study's sample size.

Sebaaly, rheumatologic condition characterised by multiple s terile inflammatory bone lesions with relapsing and remitting course. In ear ly stages, lesions may be osteolytic in nature with progressive sclerosis over time resulting in hyperostosis. Methods or Background: We retrospectively evaluated 106 patients with a diagnosis of CRMO that underwent at least 1 whole-b ody MRI between April 2014 to April 2020. Whole-body MRI and radiography images were assessed for hyperostosis. Results or Findings: 31 sites of hyperostosis in 24 patients were identi fied. Mean age at symptom onset was 8 years (range 2-14 y ears), with a F:M ratio of 14/10. Sites of hyperostosis included clavicle i n 12, femur in 5, pelvis in 5, humerus in 4, radius in 2, mandible in 2 and scapul a in 1. At baseline MRI, 29 lesions had cortical thickening, with accompanying bone marrow edema in 28 and soft-tissue edema in 26 lesions. At baseline wh ole-body MRI, additional regions of bone marrow edema were identified at 99 sites in 21 patients. X-ray was available in 28 lesions. Baseline x-ray revealed expansion and sclerosis in 25 lesions, accompanied by periosteal reaction in 6 and lytic changes in 2. 3 lesions had only periosteal reaction at baseline. F ollow-up MRIs were available for 28 lesions with a mean follow-up of 34 months ( 5-83 months). At final follow-up, 3 patients suffered from leg discrepancy and 1 patient had restricted jaw opening. Conclusion: Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis is a dif imaging diagnosis. periosteal reac tion have a predilection for clavicle.

Basten*\u00b9, D. Leyhr\u00b2, D. \u00b2T\u00fcbingen/DE, Purpose: To comprehensively evaluate value of MRI for skelet al bone age (SBA) assessment in healthy male adolescents. Methods or Background: In this cross-sectional study n=63 male, elite socc er athletes between 10-13 years (mean: 12.35\u00b11.1 years ) were examined on two weekends in November 2019. No chronic disease was k nown. All participants underwent 3.0 Tesla MRI acquiring by three independent blinded radiologists: specific pediatri c, senior, and resident. SBA was assessed using the common Greulich-Pyle (GP) at las and Tanner- Whitehouse (TW2) method. Results were statistically processed by computing descriptive statistics, inter-rater reliabilities, T-Test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney- Test and Bland-Altman-plots. Results or Findings: Mean total acquisition time was 5:04\u00b10:47 min. Imag e quality was sufficient in 63/63 (100%) cases. The T 1-3D-VIBE sequence was determined as the preferred diagnosing sequence in 63/63 (100%). MRI appraisal was significantly faster (p<0.001) using GP with mean 1:22\u00b10:08 min (range: 1:04-1:47 min) compared to TW with mean 7:3 9\u00b10:28 min (range: 6:51- 9:42 min). SBA assessment by GP resulted in mean ag e of 12.8\u00b11.2 years (range: 10-16 years), by TW in 13.0\u00b11.4 10.6-16.6 years). Inter- rater reliabilities of all for both MRI is a clinically feasible, radiation-free and rapidly evaluable method to assess SBA of healthy male children. Usin g the most common Greulich-Pyle (GP) atlas or the Tanner-Whitehouse ( TW2) method reliable results are obtained independent of the radiologist 's experience level. Limitations: Due to the study design and the German law, we coul d not compare to the most common and investigated method conventional x-ray.

Kilburn-Toppin; Cambridge/UK RPS 602-2 Timeline for resolution of detected mRNA is associated with post-vaccination lymphadenopathy, but the timeline for its resolution remains unclear. This study describes the resolution pattern of incidentally detected post-vaccination lymphadenopathy in women referred for routine breast ultrasound examinations. Methods or Background: Between January and March 2021, women referred for breast ultrasound, if demonstrating axillary ly mphadenopathy of 3 mm cortical thickness, were questioned whether they underwent a recent COVID- 19 vaccination. If vaccinated in the ipsilateral ar m within 6 weeks, serial follow- up axillary ultrasound was performed every 3 weeks until lymphadenopathy resolved. Data was collected and analysed retrospec tively. Results or Findings: Forty-one women were included in the study. Time fr om the second COVID-19 vaccine injection ranged from 1 day to 6 weeks (mean 2.2; median 2). Cortical thickness at presentation ranged between 3 and 9 mm (mean 4.4). At 3-5 weeks of follow-up (n=38) lympha (55%) with cort ical thickness between 3 and 7 At 6-8 weeks (n=13), lymphadenopathy resolved in 7/13 (54%) and persisted in 6/13 (46%) with cortical thickness ran ging between 3 and 5 mm. By 9 weeks (n=5) lymphadenopathy persisted in 3/5 ( 60%) women, consequently biopsied at 12 weeks, with benign pathology and documented resolution by 21 weeks. Overall, lymphadenopathy persisted 6 weeks in 32% and 9 weeks in 12%. Conclusion: Post COVID-19 vaccination related sonographically detected axillary lymphadenopathy, persisted in one of three women for 6 weeks, and in 12% for 9 weeks. This timeline should be considered in guiding management. Limitations: This study involved a relatively small series, with some women lost to follow-up during serial imaging.

M. Capaccione*\u00b9, S. Huang\u00b9, A. predicted excess breast cancer mortali ty as an indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we sought to identity which stage or stages of breast cancer diagnosis were delayed by t he pandemic in order to identify vulnerable populations to target for compr ehensive follow-up. Methods or Background: Using the radiology search engine MModal Catalyst, we identified patients with BIRADS 0, 4, and 5 mammograms in 2020 and 2019 for comparison. Using the medical record s ystem Epic, we identified dates of key stages of the mammographic abnormality workup to define time intervals. Additional demographic and clinical info rmation were also collected. We analysed these data to assess if there were significant differences in time intervals or other characteristics in 2020 during t he pandemic compared to the prior year. Results or Findings: In 2019 the average follow-up interval of a BIRADS 0 mammogram was 31 days (SD= 59.9 days) compared to 1 40 days (SD= 131.3 days) in 2020, a statistically significant difference (p=0.000003). For patients with BIRADS 4 and 5 mammograms in 2019, the average time intervals from screening mammogram to diagnostic mammogram, biopsy , first surgical consult, and surgery were 12, 15, 33, and 66 days, respectively. In 2020, the same intervals were 24, 14, 36, and 51, respectivel y. None of these intervals were significantly different between 2019 and 2020. Conclusion: Patients with BIRADs 0 mammograms in 2020 had signi ficantly increased follow-up intervals. Targeting this popul ation for close follow-up may reduce predicted morbidity and mortality stemming f rom the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations: Limitations of this study were that patients were d rawn from a single health care system, and there was a relatively small sample size.

Catanese*\u00b9, A. L. Scarano\u00b2, M. (carolamialaura.catanese@eoc.ch) Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence of AL in patients for br east imaging examination at different time intervals after COVID -19 vaccination. Methods or Background: In this IRB approved study women undergoing breast imaging from July to Semptember 2021 for any indication were enrolled prospectively. Exclusion criteria was a known metas tatic lymphadenopathy. COVID-19 vaccination status, timing and side of vac cination were recorded. AL was considered positive with one or more of the fol lowing features in at least one lymphnode ipsilateral long a xis >2 cm. Participants were divided in subgroups based on the following time intervals after COVID-19 vaccination: (a)<6 weeks; (b) 7-8 weeks; weeks and (e) >12 weeks. Descriptive statistics and chi-squar e test with post-hoc comparison were performed to compare proportions. A p-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results or Findings: 162 consecutive women (median age, 56 years; range 23-84 years) were included with the following number of cases at different time interval after vaccination (a) 34 (21%); (b) 25 (15 .4%); (c) 31 (19.1%); (d) 24 (14.9%) (e) 48 (29.6%). 44 women in total (27.2%) presented 2/44 (4.5%). The differences were only significant for t he time interval a and e (p- value (p<0.0001). The most common observed pathologic features were a diffuse or eccentric cortical thickening (41/44; 93 .1%). Conclusion: After COVID-19 vaccination, AL has the highest prev alence in the first 6 weeks whereas after 12 weeks it is only rar ely observed. As literature suggested, 6 weeks after vaccination, AL should be regressed, so we advise to perform breast imaging in asymptomatic patients at least 6 weeks after the possible next vaccination.

Linck*, C. Garnier, Bordeaux/FR (pierre.linck@hotmail.fr) Purpose: To evaluate the impact of the lockdown in France on the diagnosis and staging of breast cancers diagnosed in a tertiary cancer centre. Methods or Background: Our database was searched for all consecutive invasive breast cancers diagnosed in our institutio n during the lockdown period (36 working days), during equivalent periods of 36 working days immediately before and after the lockdown and during a referenc e period in 2019 (equivalent to these three periods in term of date range and number of working days). Number and staging of breast cancers diagnos ed during and after the lockdown were compared to the pre-lockdown and the reference periods. Results or Findings: In comparison with the reference period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed decreased by 20% during th e lockdown. After the lockdown, breast cancers where more often palpable (p=0.001) and demonstrated bigger tumour size (p=0.0008). In comp arison to the reference period, the rate of small tumours (T1) was reduced by 38% (p=0.01), the rate of locally advanced cancers (T3, T4) increased by 80% (p=0.04) and the rate of lymph node invasion increased by 64% (p=0.006). Conclusion: The lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic was assoc iated with a 20% decrease in the number of diagnosed breast cancers. Because of delayed diagnosis, breast cancers detected after th e lockdown had poorer prognosis with bigger tumour size and a higher rate of node invasion. Limitations: We only evaluated the impact of the lockdown on the diagnosis of breast cancer in one institution. The study was conducted too early after the lockdown to be able to evaluate its impact on recur rence and mortality rates. Ethics committee approval: Institutional Ethics Review Board approval was obtained for this retrospective study and informed consent was waived.

This \"selection\" process may benefit from a structured, comprehensive, and objective methodology. Such methodologies are well established in the field of strategic management. Here, they support, for example, product development and marketing campaigns. However, strategic managem ent tools (SMTs) specifically designed for academic radiology are lacking. We developed a SMT for the personalised evaluation of breast-imaging r esearch projects. Methods or Background: The SMT was developed based on principles of strategic management in four steps: First (1), the DEFINITION of essential requirements (brainstorming) (1). Second (2), the I DENTIFICATION of pre- existing tools (systematic search of literature) (2 ). Third (3), the DESIGN of the SMT as an open-access web-application based on results of steps (1) & (2). Fourth (4), TESTING of the SMT in a timely and cont roversial topic (breast MRI vs contrast enhanced spectral mammography/CESM) Results or Findings: In step (1) Four perspectives summarising 18 attrib utes were identified: structure (cross-linked, semi-structured, hierarchical), assessment (extra/financial performance indicators, weighting), and criteria of the SMT were defined (stakeholders, timing, resourc es). In step (2), key elements of activity-based costing, balanced scorec ard, diffusion theory (Rogers) and scoring-models where identified to support the SMT. In step (3), the SMT was designed based on the previous two steps and published open- access (http://35.178.93.39/shiny/rstudio/CESM/). I n step (4), the SMT was successfully tested. In our personalised use-case t he SMT substantiated strategic advantages of research projects related t o CESM over breast MRI. Conclusion: An open-access SMT for the personalised assessment of research-projects in breast-imaging was developed. Methodologies well- established in strategic-management were applied. A ccordingly, the SMT provides structured decision support to academic radiologists in selecting optimal research projects. Limitations: Validation studies evaluating the SMT within multiple intuitions, researchers, and research topics are pending.

Igual Rouilleault\u00b9, L. Sobrido\u00b2; \u00b9Pamplona/ES, \u00b2Madrid/ES (nachosoriagua@gmail.com) Purpose: The objective of this study was to compare the axil lary lymph node reaction to anti-COVID-19 vaccination between mRNA and viral vector vaccines. Methods or Background: Between February and July 2021, 512 employees from our centre were invited to participate in this prospective study after receiving complete vaccination with either Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca. Patients were classified into two groups: mRNA (Pfi zer and Moderna) and viral vector (AstraZeneca) vaccines. Volunteers were scan ned with axillary US within the week after receiving the second vaccine injection. Multiparametric US assessment of lymph nodes included: total number of visible nodes, maximum measurements of the long-axis size and cort ical thickness (mm), morphological Bedi's classification (grades 1 to 6) and colour Doppler evaluation (grades 0 to 3). Due to absence of normal distribution of variables, Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analys is. Results or Findings: Out of 223 volunteers who accepted to participate i n this study, 146 (65.5%) received mRNA vaccines (91 Pfizer and 55 Moderna); while the other 77 participants (35.5%) underwent A straZeneca vaccination. Statistically significant differences (p 0.001) were found in all the US findings evaluated, with higher values in the mRNA vaccine group: the total number of visible nodes (mean 6.38 vs 4.26), maximum diameter (mean 23.46 mm vs 20.58 mm), cortical thickness (mean 4.81 mm 2.92 mm), classification 62.3%). Conclusion: Patients who received mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Mod erna) showed significantly higher values in all the axill ary lymph node US findings evaluated, compared with viral vector vaccines (Ast raZeneca). Limitations: Other lymph node localisations (subclavian, submandibular...) were not assessed.

Abate*, C. Di Bella, M. Pellitteri, Purpose: San Gerardo Hospital in Monza is one of the centres most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Many non-emergency services were discontinued, elective surgeries were postponed. Li mited resources during the pandemic compelled rigorous discipline. Breast pati ents were classified into groups according to cancer risk, delivering accurat e treatment using priority criteria, preventing overtreatment and preserving t ime and supplies. Methods or Background: A score from 1 to 5 called Correlation Categories (CC) was assigned to patients matching biopsy resul ts and radiological findings. A management score, called Action Categor ies (AC) ranging from standard follow-up to surgical/oncological treatment was assigned to patients on the basis of CC score during a multidisciplinary meeting discussion. Results or Findings: Using this scoring system we decided the diagnostic and therapeutic path of 237 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the findings showed a concordance. In 2020, surgical activity has decreased in absolute numbers, but not in terms of rate. The 2020 cohort accounted for a higher number of CC1 and CC2 (49.4% and 26.6%) than the cohort (52.7% and 9.5%), a lower number of CC3 than in 2019 (10.1% versus 26%). Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 159 AC distribution did not show substantial difference s, but AC4 action (larger volume biopsy) increased (8.9% from 2.3%). Conclusion: This score was successfully applied during the COVI D-19 pandemic in our breast unit, reducing procedure repetition, avoiding non-urgent interventions and planning the most suitable follow -up. We believe it could be useful in non-emergency times, especially in low resource environments, with limited treatment facilities and hospitals with a l ack of equipment.

Gong, *Y. Peng*; Shenzhen/CN Purpose: To association between cine magnetic resonance (CMR)-based radiomics signature and microcirculatory in elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 116 consecutive patients with STEMI, who underwent CMR within 6 days after P CI, were retrospectively enrolled. According to the late gadolinium enhancem ent (LGE) of CMR, the myocardial infarction dichotomised into wi th without MVO. Radiomic features were extracted from cine CMR images and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used for features selection and radiomic signatures construction. Binary logistic regression was used to assess between radiomic signatures and MVO with adjusted for baseline clinical characteristics. Results or Findings: Of 116 patients with STIMI, MI with MVO was found i n 50 patients and MI without MVO was found in 66 pati ents. LASSO regression selected five radiomics features for radiomics signature construction. Logistic regression revealed that radiomics score, high sens itivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and creatine phosphokinases (CPK) were independent risk factors for MVO with odds ratio (OR) of 4.41 (95%CI: 2.26-9 .93), (95% CI: 1.00- 1.01) (95% CI 1.000-1.001), respectively. Area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of radiomic s score to predict factor of MVO in patients with STEMI, wh ich showed the potential of this contrast free radiomics signature to be an ima ging biomarker for MVO. Limitations: Although cine CMR-based radiomics ratio (4.41 [95% CI 2.26-9.93]) for MVO in thi s study, only medium predictive preformance (a ROC-AUC of 0.75 [95% CI: 0.68-0.85]) was obtained. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Funding for this study: Funding was received from the Shenzhen Science and Technology Project (No. GJHZ20180928172002087). Author Disclosures: Jingshan Gong: Nothing to disclose 603-3 Cine Background: Forty-eight patients with acute myocardial infarcti on (AMI) confirmed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE ) on CMR were included. Radiomic features of the myocardial segme nts were extracted from the cine CMR images, and the myocardial segments were randomly divided into training and validation sets at a ratio of 0.7:0.3. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used f or feature selection in the training set. Radiomic signatures were constructed in both the training and validation sets, and their predictive performance w as assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC-ROC). Results or Findings: Of 768 myocardial segments in the 48 patients, ther e were 291 (38%) segments with MI and 477 (62%) segme nts without myocardial infarction (MI). After univariate analys is, there were 22 radiomics features related to MI with statistical significanc e. LASSO regression selected 18 radiomics features for inclusion in the radiomic s signature. The AUC-ROC of the radiomic signature for predicting segments w ith ning and validation sets, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.14). Conclusion: Cine MR-based radiomics signatures can achieve good prediction performance for MI and show potential as promising imaging biomarkers for MI with no need for contrast agents. Limitations: Although cine CMR-based radiomics signature could be a contrast-free biomarker to predict myocardial segment with MI, segmentation was time-consuming.

N. use of myocardial nT1 values for the differentiation and quantitative measurement of the area-at-risk (AAR) and infarcted-area (IA) in patients with AMI (STEMI and NSTEMI). Methods or Background: 29 patients diagnosed with AMI underwent CMR within 10 days of the myocardial infarction. The ac PSIR sequences acqui red after administration of contrast agent (LGE). The AAR and the IA were identified and measured as areas of increased signal in the STIR-T 2 and LGE images. nT1 values were measured in the RA, in the IA in the remote myocardium (RM) and analysed using ANOVA and independent samples t-test . Therefore, the analysis of the ROC curves was carried out to evaluate the capability of nT1 values to distinguish between AAR, IA and RM. Results or Findings: Myocardial T1 values measured in the AAR (1145.6\u00b171.4 ms), the IA (1335.2\u00b176.4 ms), the RM ( 1025.4\u00b144.8 ms) and in the ventricular cavity (1617.9\u00b1102.6 ms) were signi ficantly different from each other (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Analysis of RO C curves demonstrated excellent performance of myocardial nT1 to distinguish between the AAR and the RM (AUC: 0.972, p<0.001) and between the IA and the these threshold values to nT1 maps, the volumes of AAR and IA showed a high correlation with those respectively obtained from the STIR-T2 and LGE images (Pearson's r: 0.927 for the AAR and 0.859 for the IA, p<0.001 for both). Conclusion: The T1 mapping sequences allow identification and p recise measurement of the extent of myocardial AAR and IA in patients with AMI. Limitations: The small population and manual semi-automatic segm entation of the areas were identified as limitations. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Metzler; Innsbruck/AT Purpose: This study examined myocardial tissue dynami cs over a decade after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (ST EMI). Methods or Background: Sequential CMR examinations (within the first week after STEMI and at 4, 12 months and 9 years thereaf ter) were conducted in 74 patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneo us coronary intervention. Left ventricular (LV) function, infarct size (IS) a nd microvascular assessed at all time-points. T2* and T2 mapping (n=59) were added at 9 year scan to evaluate the presence of ir on and oedema within the infarct core, respectively. Results or Findings: IS decreased progressively and significantly betwee n all CMR time-points (all p<0.001), with an average reduction rate of 5.8% per year [IQR 3.5-8.8] and a relative reduction of 49% [IQR 39-76] over a decade. MVO was present in 61% of patients at baseline, but in none of the follow-up examinations. At 9 year CMR, 17/59 patients (29%) s howed iron whereof revealed persi stence respectively, was assoc iated with greater infarct size on any occasion (all p<0.001) as well as prese nce of MVO (p<0.001). Patients with persistent iron and oedema showed a l ower relative regression of IS (p=0.005 and p=0.032, respectively) and greater end-systolic volumes over a decade (all p<0.012 and p>0.023, respectively). Conclusion: The evolution of IS is a dynamic process that exten ds well beyond the first few months after STEMI. Persistenc e of iron and oedema within the infarct core occurs up to a decade after STEMI and is associated with initial infarct severity and poor infarct heal ing.

E. Park, *J-H. Choi*; Seoul/KR Purpose: This study aimed to establish the assignment of 12- lead electrocardiography (ECG) for localisation of myocardial infarction validated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Methods or Background: We enrolled a total of 349 patients with ST- elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwe nt CMR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. ST-elevation in each of 12 leads was compared with the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using the left ventricular myocardial 17-segment model. Results or Findings: LGE was found in 6\u00b13 segments per patient, and in 2,109 (36%) out of a total of 5,933 myocardial segm ents. Overall, 1 out of every 5 myocardial segments with LGE did not match with the empirically assigned ECG lead (N=423, 20%). In per-lead analysi s, no myocardial segments matched 100% with a specific ECG lead. Leads I, aVR, and aVL corresponded not only to LGE in lateral myocardial segments but also to LGE anterior myocardial segments. We developed a new mo dified assignment of 12-lead ECG to myocardial 17-segment model. It coul d additionally match a total of 212 myocardial segments (10%) to ECG leads , and increased the rate of matching between ST-elevation of 12-lead ECG and myocardial 17-segment model from 80 to 90%. Conclusion: ST elevation in leads I, aVR, and aVL corresponded to both anterior and lateral wall myocardial infarction. A newly proposed ECG assignment could correctly reclassify the location of myocardial infarction in 1 out of 10 myocardial segments. Our result suggests that the current standard assignment of 12-lead ECG for infarction localisati on may require reappraisal.

Polacin*, Zurich/CH Magnetic late gadolinium enhancement with fixed short inversion time (LGE_short) provides excellent tissue contrast with dark scar, grey blood pool, very bright remote myocardium and does not need prior myocardial nulling. We hypothesise better visibilit y of ischaemic scars and equal visibility of non-ischaemic LGE in LGE_short compared to clinically established LGE (LGE_standard). Methods or Background: LGE_short (fixed inversion time at 110 ms at 1.5 T) and LGE_standard (individually adjusted inversion t ime) were retrospectively evaluated in 179 patients (3043 segments) with suspected or known coronary artery disease by four blinded readers (reader A: m ost experienced - D: least experienced). Amount of ischaemic and non-ischaemic LGE as well as visibility (1: very good - 4: poor) of ischaemic LGE was visually assessed. Results or Findings: All readers detected more infarcted segments in LGE_short compared to LGE_standard (378 as p= p= 0.8, C, D: p= 0.03). Scar visibili ty was scored higher in LGE_short by all readers (A, B: p= 0.03; C, D: p= 0 .02), especially visibility subendocardial infarcts (A, B: p= 0.04, C, D: p= 0. 02). Less experienced readers detected significantly more infarcted papil lary muscles (C: p= 0.02, D: p= 0.03) and had reduced dataset reading time in LG E_short (C: p=0.04, D: p=0.02). Non-ischaemic its maximal operational simplicity detects more ischaemic LGE with improved scar visibility compared to LGE_standard, independent of experience level. The visibility of non-ischaemic LGE is equivalent to LGE_standard. Less experienced reader s can diagnose ischaemic and non-ischaemic LGE faster in LGE_short . LGE_short can be used for visualisation of all types of fibrosis - i schaemic and non-ischaemic - instead of LGE_standard, independent of experience level.

The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic acc uracy and reader confidence for late-gadolineum enhancement (LGE) detection of a novel free breathing, respiration-gated 3D LGE sequence with fat-water se paration, in comparison to a free breathing motion-corrected 2D LGE sequence i n patients with cardiomyopathy. Methods or Background: Patients undergoing cardiac MRI containing both sequences were enrolled. Two independent blinded readers analysed both sequences and compared them regarding image quality , LGE detection/ quantification, SNR/CNR. Results were compared by W ilcoxon test for paired samples. For the LGE detection and confidence ratin g, a JAFROC analysis with fixed readers and random cases was performed, JAFROC figure of merit (FOM) calculated as the area under the AFROC curve. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 161 Results or Findings: 47 patients were included (technical failure rate 5/47). The mean sequence times of the 2D sequence were significantly shorter compared to the 3D sequence (p<0.001). 3D-LGE seque nces were significantly superior for evaluation of fine anatomical structures such as the atria or pericardium. JAFROC analysis revealed a si gnificantly higher (FOM = 0.77; p=0.003). There were no differences in overall image quality or all the other analysed parameters. Conclusion: The 3D LGE sequence allows the accurate LGE detecti on with higher confidence and better delineation of fine anatomical structures. Scan acquisition time for the 3D sequence is just slight ly longer than the 2D sequence. 3D LGE is ready for implementation in cli nical routine protocols. Limitations: The small sample size, the retrospective nature of the analysis as well as the heterogeneity of the underlying etiology (ischemic and non- ischemic cardiomyopathies) were identified as limit ing factors.

E. Keussen; Stockholm/SE RPS 609-2 Does the use of angio-CT vs cone-beam CT influence the radiation exposure cancer? *M. Nowak*, A. Viry, Amaral, A. F. Ponti, S. has the acc uracy of image-guided procedures, in particular intra-arteri al therapies such as transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). More recent ly, a CT-scanner coupled with a C-arm system has been used in this setting t o perform angio-CTs. Although these technological evolutions allow for a better image quality and tumour targeting, they also impact patient radiatio n exposure. The aim of our study was to compare CBCT and CT modalities on pati ent exposure during TACE for liver cancer. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who underwent TACE with either CBCT (Philips Allura Xper Hospital (2015- 2021). Clinical (e.g. BMI) and dosimetric data (e.g. dose area product or dose length product) were collected, and tumour response (modified RECIST) was assessed and compared between the imaging modalities. Effective doses were calculated by multiplying the dosimetric indicators specific to each modality by the associated conversion factor. Results or Findings: Ongoing analysis of 132 TACEs performed (CBCT, n=55; angio-CT, n=77) in 53 patients. Total patient radiation exposure (2D+3D imaging) was 1.4 times lower with Angio-CT when com pared to CBCT (median 27.1 vs 37.7mSv) with a clear trend (p=0.076). Angi o-CT delivered 17% more dose than CBCT on 3D-imaging (median 19.2 vs 16.4mS v) although this was not statistically significant (median 19.2 vs 16.4m Sv; p=0.169). Dose gain was mainly due to fluoroscopy and digital subtraction a ngiography which was 2.2 times less irradiating with Angio-CT (p<0.001). Tre atment targeting (p=0.376) and tumor response (p=0.764) were similar between t he groups. Conclusion: A clear trend showed that Angio-CT achieved less pa tient radiation (2D+3D imaging) than CBCT with similar ef ficacy. More patients are currently being included. Limitations: Retrospective, single-centre study. Ethics committee approval: IRB-approved study (CER-VD-2021-02213). Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Oung*, Y. Aleman, A. Digklia, N. Halkic, N. Vil lard, G. Tsoumakidou, S. Boughdad, N. Schaefer, R. Duran; Lausanne/CH Purpose: To quantitatively assess volumetric liver changes i n patients with liver metastases treated with Yttrium90-selective i nternal radiation therapy (SIRT). Methods or Background: Single-centre, institutional review board approved, retrospective study of a prospectively collected database (2010-2020). Patients with liver metastases treated with SIRT and who und erwent CT-scan before and 3, 6, 9, 12 months after treatment were included. A 3D quantification of individual liver segments, whole liver, tumour burd en and spleen volume was performed for each time-point using a semi-automati c software. Liver segment volumes were precisely obtained based on portal/hepatic vein anatomy. Clinical, laboratory, imaging and SIRT data were an alysed. Results or Findings: 142 volumetric assessments were performed on 47 patients. SIRT was administered to the whole liver in 23 patients, right/left liver in 12/6 patients, and other (sectorial/sub/segmental) in 6 patients. Treated liver volume decreased significantly at 3 months from 932+/-367 mL to 865+/-324 mL (p<0.05) whereas untreated liver region volumes increased. When receiving whole liver treatment, liver volume did n ot change significantly over time (all time-points, p>0.05). Complex segment changes were observed. Tumour volume did not change significantly over tim e (all time-points p>0.05). Spleen volume increased significantly at all time-p oints, from baseline 238+/-35 mL to 288+/-63 mL at 12 months (all p<0.05). The ev olution of liver, tumour and spleen volumes was not significantly correlated with the administered Y-90 activity at the different time-points (p>0.05). Conclusion: Dynamic and complex changes were observed in liver and spleen volumes of patients with liver metastases tr eated with SIRT.

Methods or Background: From February 2019 to August 2021, 130 patients undergoing TACE for HCC were randomly allocated to the TRA (n = 65) or TFA (n = 65) group. All patients completed the post -catheterisation questionnaire and 8-item short-form health survey 1 day after TACE. Results or Findings: Technical success rate, crossover rate, contrast ag ent dose, fluoroscopy time, procedure time, air kerma, dose-area product, length of hospital stay, and total cost were similar between the two groups (all P > .05). The incidence and severity of adverse events were also similar between the two groups (all P > .05). However, overall discomfort, difficulty going to the bathroom, difficulty feeding or self-caring, diffic ulty walking, general health, physical function, role physical function, social f unction, mental health, and role emotional function was better in the TRA group than in the TFA group (all P < Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 162 .001). Consequently, more patients preferred the current access for their next procedure in the TRA group than in the TFA group (90.8% vs. 24.6%; P < .001). Conclusion: In patients undergoing TACE for HCC, using TRA inst ead of TFA can improve patient satisfaction without compromisi ng procedural variables and safety. Limitations: First, most patients had HCC caused by hepatitis B virus. Second, the efficacy of TRA-TACE and TFA-TACE were not compared. Last, the patients and the investigators could not be bli nded to allocation. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional review board.

Lipiodol is used as imaging biomarker for computed tomography due to its radiopaque nature. H owever, data regarding lipiodol TACE imaging via MRI is limited and result s are not familiar to radiologists for regular assessment. Methods or Background: We assessed patterns of retention of lipiodol upon different MRI sequences. After taking approval from IRB-EC, all patients who underwent lipiodol TACE, having both 4-6-week post- treatment CT and MRI were included. 25 patient fulfilled criterion. Foll owing confirmation of presence of lipiodol on CT scan, pattern of signal intensiti es of lipiodol was noted on all MRI sequences. Results or Findings: On T1-weighted MRI, 15 lipiodol retention areas wer e hyperintense, 7 appeared hypointense while 3 were i sointense. On T2- weighted images, 13 appeared hypointense, 8 hyperintense, 1 isointense and 3 showed mixed intensity signals. Restricted diffus ion was observed in 2 lesions, facilitated diffusion in 4 lesions, 7 lesi ons were low on both DWI, ADC while 12 exhibited no specific pattern. Fat suppres sed images showed 19 being hypointense, 3 hyperintense and 3 remained is ointense. Conclusion: Fat-suppressed T1 were most sensitive in detecting lipiodol retention. On T1-weighted images, lipiodol retention areas appeared hyperintense in 60% of the lesions and on T2 weight ed images only 52% of the lesions were hypointense. Diffusion-weighted imaging sequences give a much more variable appearance. Results indicate that whi le MRI remains most useful and reliable imaging modality for assessing HCC's following cTACE however requires cautious interpretation with knowl edge of the variable signal appearance seen on different imaging sequences.

Methods or Background: By using conventional angiography in TACE, we can detect and identify the vascular anatomy of the liver by obtaining 2D images. Recently C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is introduced for obtaining cross-sectional and three- dimensional (3D) images for better visualisation. A prospective study was done on patients diag-nosed with HCC by imaging and laboratory criteria, re-ferred t o do TACE as the recommended treat-ment. Inclusion criteria were HCC patients with well-preserved liver function who refused the surge ry or who were not suitable for resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneo us ablation. Results or Findings: The number of detected focal lesions by angiography was 51 compared to 87 focal lesion detected by CBCT ; of those, 45 and 77 were active lesions by both procedures respectively . For lesions, less than 1 cm CBCT detected 23 lesions while angiography detec ted only one lesion. Angiography detected 87 feeding arterial branches w hile cone-beam CT-HA detected 130 branches to the same number of target lesions. Feeder tractability and confidence were better by CBCT. Conclusion: CBCT is superior to angiography in tumor detectabil ity, detection of lesions less than 1 cm, feeder detection, and fe eder traction; however, conventional angiography and DSA are irreplaceable. Thus, combination of CBCT with angiography during TACE produces better r esults and less complication. Limitations: The limitation is the small sample size.

Gogna, D. C. E. Ng; Singapore/SG Purpose: radiochemical microspheres used to treat liver dominant malignant tumours are infused via catheter into the hepatic artery branches under fluoroscopic guidance. Currently, the microspheres are in radiolucent dextrose 5% (D5) solution which precludes real-time monitoring implantation. We investigated w hether mixing Y90 microspheres in different concentrations of iohexol diluted with D5 or normal saline is radiochemically acceptable in terms of st ability of the Y90 microspheres, leaching of Y90 from the of potential by-products. microspheres suspended in iohexol D5 or saline solution at various concen trations. Respective mixtures were left to stand for 4 hours and the radiochemical purities determined by instant thin layer chromatography (iT LC) as the stationary phase and saline as the mobile phase. The mixtures were passed through a 0.22 micrometer filter and the filtrate measured for radioactivity compared to the residue. As the microspheres sizes range from 20 to 60 micrometers, the filtrate would only contain leached Y90 activity. purities on from 90.92% when to 75% with normal saline, to 98.11% when iohexol was diluted to 50% with D5. No significant photopeaks to suggest by-product radioactive species were detected. The proportion of Y90 activity in the residue after filtration was microspheres was less than 5% with D5. Conclusion: Suspension of Y90 in iohexol contrast in ac ceptable radiochemical purity, particularly with D5. Limitations: The limitation is that the study is preclinical.

Lanza*, S. i, G. Carrafiello; Milan/IT Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe safety and ef ficacy profiles of TACE using DC Beads LUMI. Background: Were retrospectively analysed 90 patients with HCC who underwent TACE with DC Bead LUMI. Were eval uated number of treated lesions, dose of DC Beads LUMITM, dose of E pirubicin and DC Beads LUMITM target tumour coverage. The efficacy assessm ent of TACE was based on reviewing the follow-up imaging for evidence of response in target lesion(s), according to modified response criteria in solid tumours (mRECIST) with following outcomes: complete response (CR), pa rtial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD). S afety assessment was classified according to CIRSE classification. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 163 Results or Findings: 72 patients were enrolled, 95 procedures were carri ed out. Target tumour response rate at 1 month has CR, PR, SD, PD of respectively 67,3%, 10,3%, 13,1% and 4,7%. Overall tumour(s) (whole liver) response at 1 month has CR, PR, SD, PD of respectiv ely 58,9%, 12,6%, 10,5% and 17,9%. We found a significant association (p<0.01) between tumour CR or CR + PR and number of target lesion(s). CIRSE classification grade I and II complications were recorded in 11.6% and 6.3% procedures. No grade III-IV-V complications occurred. Conclusion: TACE using DC Beads LUMI is a safe and effective tr eatment option for patients with HCC. Limitations: The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature, limited simple size, and the absence of the control group, which means the impossibility of demonstrating the relative perform ance of the LUMI with other beads. Ethics committee approval: All procedures performed were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later am endments or comparable ethical standards. Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective review. Funding for this study: The authors received no financial support for this study.

A. Barry*, G. Orpen, E. Kenny, P. J. Macmahon; Dublin/IE (meallabarry@mater.ie) To share our experiences in incorporating cone-beam CT (CBCT), into the evaluation of patients with acute radiocar pal injury. The use of CBCT in patients with suspected radiographically occult fractures optimises visualisation of the carpal bones with a minimal increase in radi ation dose. We review the fracture detection rates, cost-effectiveness and ra diation dose implications. Methods or Background: Meta-analysis of articles published by the Department of Radiology, Mater Misericordiae Univer sity Hospital Dublin. Results or Findings: Incorporating CBCT in the management pathway for acute radiocarpal injury yielded a 50% fracture det ection rate in patients with negative wrist radiographs but ongoing concern for radiocarpal fracture. CBCT had a sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 100%. Fractures of the trapezium, which are rarely diagnosed on plain film radiographs, were found to be the most common radiographically occult fracture. Cost- effective studies have demonstrated that advanced multiplanar imaging tech niques performed shortly after presentation reduce cost and morbidity compar ed to empirical wrist immobilisation in the setting of scaphoid fracture. CBCT may be the most cost- effective imaging option for initial evaluation. Ef fective dose at the wrist from standard CBCT has been calculated as 0.7-2.4 times greater than wrist radiographs; however MDCT of the wrist was calculat ed as 8.6 times greater than plain radiographs. Conclusion: Cross-sectional imaging should be considered in all cases of post-traumatic wrist pain with negative radiographs . CBCT is a cost-effective modality that demonstrates a sensitivity of 98.3% a nd specificity of 100%, at a lower radiation dose than conventional MDCT. CBCT s hould be regarded as the new standard of care in the management of patients following acute radiocarpal injury. Limitations: Patient movement, the lack of soft-tissue detail and degraded images when in-cast imaging is performed were ident ified as limitations of the modality.

Methods or Background: Six ankles, six feet, and five hands (in both superman and next-to-torso positions) were imaged at a 3T MRI system with standard and patient-specific FS techniques. For each subject, water and fat resonance frequencies obtained routinely during scanner calibration were used as real-time inputs to apply an individualised radi ofrequency pulse with a high time-bandwidth product for homogenous fat suppressi on. Corresponding MR images obtained with routine and patient-specific F S pulses were compared and ranked by a musculoskeletal radiologist in a bl inded fashion. The non- parametric signed test was used to assess the difference between the two techniques. Results or Findings: At the ankle, the images obtained with the patient- specific FS were ranked superior to the routine protocol (46% superior, 51% equal, p<0.001). Similarly, the patient-specific FS was preferred at the feet (39% superior, 60% equal, p<0.001). For hands in the superman position, the patient-specific FS was ranked superior to the standard FS (27% superior, 57% equal, p < 0.001), whereas no statistically significant difference was seen between the two techniques when hands were imaged n ext to the torso (30% superior, 40% equal, p>0.05). Conclusion: Patient-specific optimised FS technique holds promi se to improve the homogeneity of fat suppression in distal extrem ity MRI significantly. Our initial results are most promising in the forefoot, which is more susceptible to inhomogeneous fat suppression due to complex anatom y and off-centre positioning resulting in higher B0 and B1 inhomogen eity. Limitations: The study's limitations are a lack of comparison wi th other techniques (SPAIR and DIXON) and performance evaluation only at 3T.

RPS 610-4 Assessment of visibility of bone structures in the wrist using photon counting computed tomography R. the visi bility of bone structures in the wrist on photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) images and to compare -integrating CT (EID-CT). Methods or Background: Four human cadaveric wrist specimens were scanned with EID-CT (Siemens SOMATOM Edge Plus) and PCCT (Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha) at comparable CTDIvol of 12.2 mGy, a s well as 6.1 mGy (half dose). Axial images were reconstructed using the thinnest possible slice thickness, i.e. 0.4 mm on EID-CT and 0.2 mm on PCCT (UHR-mode) at 50% overlap, with the largest image matrix size possibl e (512x512 on EID-CT and 1024x1024 on trabecular bone structures was measured using CNR, sharpness of the cortical bone-air boundary, by histogram analysis in the trabecular structure. Als o, visibility of bone structures and nutrient canals was assessed by five radiologis ts at two hospitals using visual grading characteristics (VGC) analysis. Results or Findings: At equal dose, images obtained with PCCT had in the radius (p=0.02) than those obtained with EID-CT. This was confirmed by VGC analysis showing superior visibility of cortical bone, trabeculae and nutrient canals (AUC> 0.89). At half dose, PCCT also yielded superior image quality, both in quanti tative measures and based on VGC analysis. Conclusion: Despite a lower CNR, PCCT offers superior visibilit y of bone structures in the wrist at half dose relative to st ate-of-the-art EID-CT, due to smaller detector elements, reduced slice thickness, sharper kernels and a larger image matrix.

We estimated HH-genotype associations with musculoskeletal outcomes and joint arthroplast ies in a large community genotyped cohort; UK biobank. Methods or Background: 451,143 European ancestry participants (mean 56.8yrs) were followed from baseline (40-70yrs) unt il 2020 in hospital records (mean 11.5yrs). Cox proportional hazards regression models assessed associations between genotypes (HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D) and incidence of musculoskeletal outcomes, adjusting for age, assess ment centre, genotyping array, and population genetics substructure. Analys es were stratified by sex. Results or Findings: Participants included 2,890(0.6%) p.C282Y homozygotes. Male homozygotes have increased males. osteoporosis (HR: 1.71[95%CI:1.11-2.64, P=0.02). The osteoporosis ass ociation disappeared when excluding those with a liver fibrosis/cirrhosi s diagnosis. Female p.C282Y homozygotes had an increased risk of osteoarthritis only (HR: 1.46[95%CI:1.12-1.89]; P=0.01). In lifetable estima tes based on observed 5- year age-band incidence rates from 40-75 years, 15. 5% (95%CI:12.6-19.1) of the male p.C282Y homozygotes are projected to under go hip replacement surgery, compared to 8.7% (95%CI:8.5-9.0) with no v ariants. Conclusion: p.C282Y homozygotes ri sk of OA, with male p.C282Y homozygotes also at increased ris k of joint replacement surgeries, osteoporosis and femoral fracture, compa red to those without mutations. Osteoporosis was associated with a diagnosis of fibrosis/cirrhosis.

Sch\u00fcle\u00b9, M. J. Beer\u00b2, *C. Hackenbroch*\u00b2; \u00b9Munich/DE, \u00b2Ulm/DE Purpose: Our goal was to a) improve image quality of metal i mplants in CT and b) reduce radiation exposure without compromisi ng diagnostic image quality. New methods of metal artifact reduction (M AR), such as the tin filter (Sn) and dual-energy technique (DECT), were compare d with conventional CT examinations for this purpose. Methods or Background: Four human pelvises from body donors with orthopedic implants were tested with 9 different pr otocols on a 3rd generation DECT scanner - including FD (full dose, CTDIVol 10 mGy) and LD (low dose, CTDIVol 3.3 mGy) protocols. Sn, DE, virtual monoenergetic (VM), and conventional CT images were compared. FD- and LD pr otocols were evaluated by ten radiology and eight surgical residents. CT i mages with the highest diagnostic image quality received the maximum score and vice versa. The scores obtained were summed over the four pelvic specimens. Statistical testing was performed using a rANOVA or the Friedman test. Results or Findings: In FD- and LD-protocols, Sn 150 kV CT-images were superior to DE and VM CT-images (p<0.05). There was no difference between the 150 kV protocol with and without tin filteratio n (p>0.18). Surgeons and radiologists rate protocols equally (p>0.82). Except for the vertebral cement CT-images, 95% of the raters found the LD protocol sufficient for clinical questions (e.g. detection of periprosthetic fractur e or prosthetic loosening). Conclusion: Sn-protocols are an excellent method for MAR with optimum image quality of the adjacent structures. DE and VM protocols are inferior to tin filter protocols. A dose reduction of 66% is possible in pelvic imaging with tin filtering. Sn-protocols have their limitations when imaging the cancellous bone of the spine. Limitations: The small number of pelvic cadavers examined (n=4) is a limitation of our study. Ethics committee approval: Approval was obtained by the local ethics committee.

Methods or Background: Fresh blood imaging (FBI) NC-MRA and time- spatial labeling inversion pulse (Time-SLIP) NC-MRP images were acquired in three different positions on 6 volunteers (3 males, 3 females, 23-48 yo) at 3T scanner. FBI was performed using the DelayTracker ( auto-determined trigger delays) and ECG-prep scan (manual). Parameters were TR/TEeff = 3 RR intervals/60 ms, STIR = 200 ms, resolution = 0.5x0. 5 mm, and 320x320 matrix for FBI. Time-SLIP parameters were: TI 1000/1500/20 00 ms, SPAIR fat suppression, and resolution=0.4x0.4 mm. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), qualitative visual score (VS) of segmented arteries , and the degree of artifact in NC-MRA, qualitatively VS, the degree of artifacts, and quantitatively the arterial lengths from the tag position (AL) in NC-MRP were e valuated with reconstructed MIP images by one experienced radiologist. All the data were statistically analysed. Results or Findings: Pain scores showed a lower trend in SS position (p=0.12). In NC-MRA, the images with the DelayTrack er showed significantly high VS in the SS position (p<0.05). In NC-MRP, sig nificantly smaller VS (p<0.05) and shorter AL (p<0.05) at TI = 1500 were observed in SO position. Artifact at TI = 2000 was significantly less in the SS position (p<0.05). Conclusion: The SS position demonstrated significantly higher V S with ECG- prep in NC-MRA and less artifacts in NC-MRP, with t he lower pain scale. The SO position presented inferior VS and AL and increased artifacts in NC-MRP. Limitations: The small sample size is the limitation of this stu dy.

Upadhyaya; Lucknow/IN purpose of the study was to correlate the presence of extra- plexal findings with the severity of injury in pati ents with traumatic brachial plexopathy who underwent an MR neurography of the brachial plexus. This association, if proved, would help the referring cl inician predict the course and outcome of the injury, and prognosticate the patient better. Methods or Background: This was a retrospective observational study of imaging data of thirty subsequent patients who underwent MR neurography of the brachial plexus following trauma. The study was conducted over a period of 6 months, from July to December 2021. Patient consent for the use of images for academic and research purposes was obtained. Al l data was entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysed. No statis tical tools were used. Wednesday Abstract-based Programme A B 165 Results or Findings: The extra-plexal findings in these patients include d fractures of the clavicle, scapula, humerus and ver tebrae, shoulder joint effusion and axillary artery thrombosis. Clavicular fractures were most common and were seen in 23.3% of patients followed by scapular fractures in 16.7% of patients and humeral fractures in 6.7% of patients. Vertebral fractures were the least common and were seen in 3.3% of patients. Bot h shoulder joint effusion and axillary artery thrombosis were seen in 3.3% of cases each. Conclusion: Presence of extra-plexal injuries points to a great er severity and extent of injury to the brachial plexus, and result s in poor outcome in patients with traumatic plexopathy. Limitations: The study has a small sample size and more data is required to make any definitive recommendations. Ethics committee approval: Institutional ethical clearance was waived off as no patient identifying factors were present in the current dataset. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

The greatest disadva ntage, however, is the operator dependence on image acquisition. Another s ource of variance could be the ultrasound system. The goal of this work was to use an unsupervised learning algorithm to learn 'clusters' of operators and hardware and act as a quantification tool for operator skill and hardware variance from ultrasound images. Methods or Background: A BLUE phantom from CAE Healthcare (Sarasota, FL) with various mock lesions was scanned by three operators of varying skill levels using three different US systems (Siemens S3 000, Clarius L15, and Ultrasonix SonixTouch) producing 39013 images. Dime nsion reduction and feature extraction was done using principal component analysis (PCA). The extracted features were given to a K-means clusteri ng algorithm to determine clusters of operators or clusters of hardware. Silh ouette scores and misclassification rates were used to judge model pe rformance. Euclidean distance from cluster centres was used to compare s kill levels and hardware types. Results or Findings: The hardware model had a misclassification rate of 0.597%. The operator model had a misclassification rate of 71.4%. The silhouette scores and average distance between clus ter centres were higher in the hardware model, implying that the hardware data is more separable. Conclusion: K-means clustering was able to learn clusters of ha rdware well but the ability to learn operator clusters was limi ted, suggesting hardware variance is higher than operator variance. Limitations: More operators with varying levels could have strengthened the results. Also the US systems varied widely in age a nd type. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Filtration of AI findings via radiologi st's report analysis, (as a surrogate to NLP) will notify radiologist only of unreported dilated aortas while reducing unnecessary alerts. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of 1,727 consecutive chest CT scans (contrast and non-contrast protocols) and their corresponding reports. Scans were processed by CV aortic measurem ent algorithm (developed by IMedis Ltd.). Corresponding radiology reports tagged by radiology resident to indicate mention/absence of ascending aortic dilation (42mm). Combined outputs were classified blindly by 3 senior radiologists, with consensus round for disagreed cases. Results or Findings: Dilated ascending aorta was detected in 35 cases (2%), of which 19 (54.3%) were unreported. Consensus radi ologist review confirmed 16 (84.2%) true positives and 3 false posit ives. Conclusion: A dual algorithm combining CV analysis of chest CTs and human report tagging alerts for missed ascending aortic dilation with a high true positive rate and minimal false positives or unneed ed alerts. The algorithm doubled the number of detected cases of aortic dilation (16 reported cases, 16 unreported cases) while alerting only 1.1% of cases (19/1,727 cases). The high true positive rate of the dual algorithm and the 100% increase in detection justifies radiologist review of these flagged cases , to improve detection of actionable ascending aortic dilation with minimal i ncreased workload. Limitations: NLP would be the optimal method of report tagging but was not employed as it was unavailable in the report langua ge (Hebrew).

Colombo Serra*\u00b9, A. learning method to amplify contrast in contrast- enhanced MR (CE-MR) images was evaluated. The proposed training strategy is based on synthetic data not requiring reduced contrast images, i.e. images obtained after the injection of a non-standard dose of Gadolinium Based Contrast Agent (GBCA). Methods or Background: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to boost contrast enhancement. Loss function, hyperpar ameters, and CNN architecture were modified and tuned. CE-MR images for training were artificially generated reducing the contrast in sta ndard CE-MR images of a fraction k. The CNN was then trained to learn the t ask of amplifying contrast by a factor k using standard CE-MR images as target. 1 990 CNS clinical cases were used to train, test and validate the proposed approach. Contrast amplification from standard CE-MR to predicted imag es amplified using different k factors was characterised qualitatively and quantitatively. The method was also tested in a preclinical setting wit h a model of human glioma (120 rats). Results or Findings: Increased contrast-to-noise ratio, lesion-to-brain ratio and contrast enhancement is observed in amplified i mages. Notably, lesions count and diameter remain unvaried between standard-dose and amplified images. Preclinical results show similar performanc es between CNN trained on synthetic and CNN trained on real data. Conclusion: The proposed DL approach trained on simulated images demonstrates promising performances in amplifying t he effects of GBCA. The proposed data simulation strategy can be used to av oid the collection of reduced-dose CE-MR images not included in the stand ard of care. Limitations: The limitation is that it is a monocentric study at CDI. Ethics Milano area Funding for this study: No profit study.

Purpose: Artificial intelligence-based ion (AI-CAD) systems are supposed to help radiologists with the detection of pulmonary nodules in medical images. However, inappropriate t rust in these systems often leads to an incorrect use, manifested in both under- and over-reliance. Literature suggests that a lack of transparency in the system and insufficient knowledge of the underlying algorithm from the user are the main causes for this concern. The current study tested proposed sol utions for the design of CAD systems to counter these causes. Methods or Background: Eleven radiologists took part in an online experiment, detecting pulmonary nodules in thoracic CT slices using AI-CAD. Participants were randomly assigned to one of six c onditions, varying in the degree of transparency of the system and whether AI was used as first or second reader. Transparency was reflected in the di splay of the system's performance, confidence ratings for each mark, and extensiveness of the explanation of the system. The outcomes measured were the subjective evaluations of the radiologists as well as specific ity, sensitivity, and additional false positives marked. Results or Findings: Specificity was lower in the least transparent conditions, without affecting sensitivity. Specificity was also lower with CAD as second reader. The evaluation showed that participants did not think the explanation of the system affected their trust. They did indicate that display of the performance and confidence ratings helped them with scanning, pattern recognition, and decision-making processes, leading to more confidence and higher satisfaction. Conclusion: Displaying performance levels and confidence ratings could lead to increased appropriate trust in CAD, as does using CAD as first reader. Limitations: Due to the small sample size, only data exploration was performed. In addition, the experiment was performe d without supervision and in a lab setting. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

The latter requires to be evaluated and rated manually by the examiner, which is time-consuming and potentially error- prone. We tested whether natural language processin g (NLP) can be used to semi-automatically analyse and score free text answ ers in order to support the examiner. Methods or Background: The European Board of Radiology (EBR) provided a representative dataset comprising of questions and their corresponding answer keys, together with original answers and mar kings from all participants. Based on the official answer key, RadLex terms were used to code free-text answers. Results or Findings: Answers from 96 participants extracted from one sam ple question were analysed and ranked via a rule-based classification (0-3 points, as in the original answer key). Afterwards, ranking s from the NLP engine were compared to the original rankings provided by the E BR. For 0-1 points, the probability for correct classification by NLP yielded 71%. Conclusion: Our feasibility study showed that NLP can be used s uccessfully to automatically analyse and score free-text answer s. However, the more complex the question/answer is, the more challengin g it is to 1. find \"right\" terms for coding free-text answers and 2. train the NLP engine. A well-trained NLP engine might not only help improve the review p rocess at first but could also help develop future exams, which can be assess ed fully automated. Limitations: As data only contain 96 cases, the NLP engine shoul d be improved with more training and more input data bef ore implementation in the \"real\" world is feasible.

Background: Computed tomography (CT) images of a multi-sized image quality phantom (Mercury v4.0) were acquired with two CT machines from different vendors under six radiation dose lev els (0.7/1.5/3.0/6.1/12.2/24.4 mGy). Those images were reconstructed using various IRs (advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE), iDose4, iterativ e model-based reconstruction (IMR)) with two different strength l evels (low or medium, high) for each IRs, and were then denoised with DLM. For all IR and DLM images, the detectability index (d') (a task-based detection performance metric) was obtained using a phantom with a diameter of 31 cm, under various combinations of three target sizes (10/5/1 mm), fiv e inlets (CT value difference with the background; -895/50/90/335/1000 HU), and s ix radiation dose levels. DRP measures the dose reduction made by using DLM w hile yielding d' equivalent to that of IR at a reference dose level (12.2 mGy). Results or Findings: The mean DRPs were 93% and 88% (81-94%) for the By inlet type, the mean DRPs were 91% (83-98%) for the highest contras t material (1000HU) and 87% (81-92%) for the lowest contrast materials (50HU). The DRP of the high contrast materials increased with smaller target size, while that of the low contrast materials decreased with smaller target si ze. Conclusion: Additional dose reduction was possible using the vendor-agnostic DLM applied to images reconstructed with IR methods of different vendors. Limitations: DRPs were evaluated using a phantom. Further resear ch using clinical CT images is needed. Ethics committee approval: Institutional Review Board approval was waived.

Methods or Background: MRI of 64 patients with parotid tumours, including 41 cases of pleomorphic adenomas and 23 cases of malignant tumours confirmed by pathology were analysed retrospectivel y. Mazda software was used to select ROIs in the maximum tumour level ima ge on axial T2WI. Gray histogram analysis was carried out to obtain 9 char acteristic parameters, including mean, the characteristic parameters of histogram between pleomorphic adenoma and malignant tumours. ROC curv e was drawn to evaluate the effectiveness of the characteristic parameters of histogram in tumours differentiating. Results or Findings: Among 9 characteristic parameters of histogram, per c 1% and perc 10% had significant differences between pleomorphic perc 10% of pleomorphic adenoma were significantly higher than those of malignant tumours. ROC curve analysis showed that perc 10% was the most effective parameter for differential diagnosis. The AUC was 0 .07(P=0.01), and the optimal critical value was 76.00. The sensitivity and specificity were 66.70% and 60.00% respectively. Besides, the AUC, optimal critical value, level histogram can be used as an important method to differentiate pleomorphic adenoma from malignant tumours of parotid gland before operation, which ca n provide valuable references for clinic.

We aimed to investigate whether employing tumoural and peritumoural radiomics features from computed tomography (CT) images can identify c apsular status of parotid PA by applying an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach. Methods or Background: A total of 143 patients with parotid PA (76 patient s had complete capsule and 67 patients had other caps ular status) were randomly divided into a training set (n=115) and a testing set (n=28). The volumetric region of interest was identified for the tumour and peritumoural parotid parenchyma (2 cont ract-enhanced CT images. Radiomics features were Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)-filtered and wavelet-filtered images . We tree-based pipeline optimisation tool (TPOT) as the AutoML met hod to the extracted feature sets to obtain the optimal pre-processing s teps, classification algorithm, and intratumoural and radiomics peritumoral). An ext ra trees classifier using textual features from original and LoG-filtered CT images achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 on the test set. Conclusion: Radiomic features from peritumour regions may ident ify capsular status of parotid PA by applying an AutoML approach. It could be a promising tool which may assist in the treatment planning for patients with parotid PA. Limitations: The following limitations were identified: a relati vely small sample size was used (n=143); there was a lack of further external validation; the fact that MRI images may contain more valuable informati on.

Lorenzon*, F. Tulipano Girometti, C. Zuiani; Udine/IT Purpose: To assess sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound (US) for the diagnosis of lymphoma in primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome ( pSS) patients at increased lymphoproliferative risk with focal lesio ns of the major Salivary Glands (SGs). Methods or Background: pSS-patients have an increased risk of lymphoma of SGs (SGs-L), which can appear with a diffuse or focal pattern. In this clinical setting, recent evidence suggests that focal SGs-L are frequently associated with some US features, specifically: OMERACT grade 3; appearance very hypoechoic, homogeneous, with ned margins, presence of septa, colour-doppler vascularisation and posterior acoustic enhancement. As the number of these features, simultaneously present in a lesion, increases, then also the likelihood of SGs-L increases. We prospectively included all pSS- patients at high risk for SGs-L with focal lesions of SGs that were referred to our Department for US assessment and US-guided core-needle biopsy (CNB) between September 2019 and March 2021. We assessed US sensitivity and specificity for SGs-L when 5/8, 6/8, 7/8 or 8/8 of the features reported above were simultaneously present in each focal lesion. Results or Findings: 16/27 pSS-patients who underwent US-guided CNB had a focal lesion. 9/16 (56%) of them were affected by SGs-L, in 7/16 (44%) the diagnosis was different. Considering increasing sim ultaneous features, the sensitivity/specificity were respectively: for 5/8 features features 77.8%/85.7%, 8/8 features Abstract-based Programme A B 168 Conclusion: In pSS-patients with high risk of SGs-L with focal lesion, US provides useful information to guide CNB. The thres hold of 6/8 features suspicious for SGs-L simultaneously present in a lesion represents the best trade-off in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

Wei, *Z. Ding*, Z. Han; Hangzhou/CN (hangzhoudzx73@126.com) Purpose: To investigate the maximum signal inte nsity of tumour on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images for t he differential diagnosis of benign and malignant parotid tumours in two medi cal centres. Methods or Background: MR images of 87 pleomorphic adenomas (PAs), 58 Warthin tumours (WTs), and 38 malignant tumours (MT s) in centre A were retrospectively analysed and compared with 45 PAs, 45 WTs, and 36 MTs in centre B. The maximum signal intensity of tumour and the mean signal intensity of buccal subcutaneous fat were measured on T1-weighted images, then the tumour to fat signal intensity ratio (T1-M ax-SIR) was calculated. The distribution differences in T1-Max-SIRs among the t hree groups of tumours within and between the two medical centres were analysed statistically. The diagnostic performance of T1-Max-SIR to identify parotid tumours was analysed using the receiver operating characteristi c curve. Results or Findings: In the two centres, T1-max-SIRs were higher in WTs than in PAs (P<0.001) and MTs (P<0.001), while ther e was no statistically significant difference between PAs and MTs (center A: P=0.257, center B: P=0.543). In centre A and centre B, the AUC, sensit ivity, and specificity for differentiating WTs from PAs were 0.862 vs. 0.833, 0.810 vs. 0.844, and 0.793 vs. 0.844, respectively, and the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for differentiating WTs from MTs were 0.791 vs. 0.788, 0.778, respectively. Conclusion: T1-max-SIR was helpful in differentiating WTs from PAs and MTs with highly consistent diagnostic efficiency betwee n the two medical centres. Limitations: First, this study did not classify MTs according to pathological type. Second, no combination with other MR imaging parameters.

Methods or Background: This prospective study included 126 consecutive patients with parotid gland lesions surgically trea ted in a single tertiary centre. After institutional review board approval, MPUS examination was performed prior to FNAC or surgery using B-mode Ultrasound (B -mode US), Colour- (CDUS), Ultrasound Elastography (USE) and Ultrasound (CEUS). We studied the diagnostic perfor mance of the different techniques taken alone and in combination. Histological examination was considered the gold standard. Results or Findings: Histology identified 93 benign tumours and 33 malignancies. In the differential diagnosis between malignant and benign lesions, B-mode US, CDUS, CEUS, Ultrasound Elastogr aphy US and CEUS greatly impro ved the sensitivity of the CEUS performed individually and presented remarkable accuracy. USE did not improve the diagnostic perfor mance of the B-mode US, alone or in association with CEUS; however, it revealed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation between benign lesi ons. FNAC demonstrated lower values in comparison with CEUS and with USE. Therefore, according to our study, MPUS could be proposed as a valid alternative to FNAC. Limitations: The sample size of the study was limited, Shear-wav e elastography was not performed and a comparison bet ween MPUS and MRI was not carried out.

Janssen*, A. Bernaerts, J. van ers, B. De Foer; Antwerp/BE (nick.janssen2@student.uantwerpen.be) Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study is to provide a summary of the role of conventional MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in the diagnosis and histopathological characterisation of parotid tumours. Methods or Background: evaluated with conventional MRI, DWI and DCE-MRI in the period from 2019 to 202 1 and confirmed by histopathology, were included in this study. MRI st udies were read by two experienced head and neck radiologists. Different m orphological features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and time-intensity curves (TIC) were considered. Washout ratios of the TICs were determi ned at 300 seconds after gadolinium-contrast administration. Multiple compar isons were made to determine if any differences between the various hi stopathological types existed. Results or Findings: Some malignant tumours showed benign morphological features, making conventional MRI alone less reliable. Warthin tumours and malignancies had great overlap producing low ADC values. Pleomorphic adenomas and other benign tumours produced higher A DC values and therefore showed little overlap with Warthin tumour s and malignancies. TIC patterns were often very characteristic for a speci fic histopathological type. All pleomorphic adenomas demonstrated a progressive enhancement and no washout. All Warthin tumours showed a fast peak wit h washout ratios of 50% or more. The malignant tumours also showed a fast p eak but variable washout ratios, ranging from a plateau up to nearly 40% was hout. Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenomas were larger lesions, showing higher ADC values compared to other malignancies and had mixed TIC patterns. Conclusion: The combination of conventional MRI, DWI and DCE-MR I has the highest diagnostic accuracy in determining the histopathological type of parotid tumours and discriminating malignancies. To safely differentiate Warthin tumours, cut-off values of at least 50% sho uld be used for the washout ratios.

Prosch; Vienna/AT RPS 704-2 The difference in pulmonary veins enhancement as a sign of pulmonary embolism on contrast-enhanced CT L. by pulmonary embolism is hypothesised to have slower venous return of the contrast agent to the left atrium. The purpose of the study is to assess the difference in the enhancement of pulmonary veins as a sign of pulmonary embolism on contrast-enhanced chest CT. Methods or Background: One hundred three patients with pulmonary embolism and 104 controls were examined by an ident ical protocol of contrast- enhanced chest CT. Attenuation values of the four pulmonary veins were measured by a manually placed region of interest on each vein. The ratio between veins of the lowest and highest enhancement (Vmin/Vmax) was calculated, indicative of the difference in attenua tion value of the pulmonary veins. Pre-test predictive values and area under th e Receiver-Operator- Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) were calculated. Als o, the means of Vmin/Vmax in patients with pulmonary embolism were compared with the control group. Results or Findings: Vmin/Vmax was statistically lower in patients with pulmonary embolism (mean 0.76, SD 0.12) compared to control group (mean 0.88, SD 0.6), p value < 0.001. AUC-ROC was found t o be 0.82. At a cut-off value of 0.8, the sensitivity, specificity, and acc uracy of this parameter for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism were 60%, 88%, and 74%, respectively. Conclusion: The difference between enhancement of the individual pulmonary veins with a Vmin/Vmax ratio of 0.8 is a useful diagnostic sign of pulmonary embolism.

K. Henning*, T. M. S. Johansen; Oslo/NO (meid@ous-hf.no) Purpose: To investigate different contrast medium (CM) administration regimes for chest CT used by members of the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI). Methods or Background: An online questionnaire was e-mailed to 650 ESTI members. The survey focused on CM protocols. In par ticular, questions referred to CM concentration, the use of fixed CM v olume or weight/body composition tailored CM administration, injection r ate, kV, and fixed delay or use of bolus tracking for chest CT. Results or Findings: The overall response rate was 15.2%. Approximately 44% of the respondents used 350 mgI/ml and 54.5% us ed fixed CM volume regime. The injection rate varied between 1.5 to 5 ml/sec. Around 42% of respondents used fixed kV varying between 80 to 140 kVp and the majority used kV-modulation. Nearly 52% of the respondents used bolus tracking with a delay of 20-90 seconds. Conclusion: Our survey showed a large variation in CM protocols used across Europe. There is a clear preference for using fixed CM administration regime for thoracic CT. More attention to the optimisation and establishment of a standard CM administration protocol in chest CT is needed. Limitations: A limitation is the low response rate. However, thi s is in line with response rates in other survey studies. Ethics committee approval: The study was reviewed and approved by the Local Ethics Committee.

Pozdniakov; Saint regional differences in quantitative pulm onary perfusion parameters, i.e., pulmonary blood flow (PBF), mean transit time (MTT), and pulmonary blood volume (PBV) in the entire lung on a voxel-by-voxel basis in 10 volunteers with no signs of interstitial lung damage according to computer tomography data and clinical and laboratory data. Methods or Background: Three-dimensional ultrafast dynamic contrast- enhanced MR imaging using 3D T1-weighted images was performed on 10 healthy volunteers with no signs of interstitial lu ng damage. Postprocessing methods based on the indicator dilution theory and the central volume limit theorem were applied to the dynamic image series, w hich enabled evaluating PBF, PBV, and MTT for the targeted regions of inter est. Arterial input function (AIF) was used, as well as the time-intensity curves. Results or Findings: Regional PBF, MTT, and PBV showed reliable differences between central and peripheral sections of lung lobes. An applied calculation model can be used to evaluate the entir e volume of lung tissue. Conclusion: A three-dimensional ultrafast MRI sequence is feasi ble for the assessment of regional quantitative pulmonary perfusion parameters in the lung tissue, regardless of physiological features o f blood supply mechanisms of different lung regions. Limitations: The main limitations of our study were the unavoidable selection bias and the small sample size.

In our study we decide to assess the comparability of coronary calcium and coronary risk values measured on LCS ultra-LDCT (>1 mSv) without ECG-synchronization Methods or Background: The study comprised 283 studies: a) 68 patients who underwent ultra-LDCT in LCS and standard ECG-Gated Cardiac CT. Comparison methods: index for both CT, vi sual and quantitative CAC-DRS scales for both CT, and b) 49 patients with LCS ultra-LDCT and standard CCTA, also carried out in one visit, meeti ng all inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and in LCS. Comparison methods: visual and quantitative (V&A) CAC-DRS scales for ultra-LDCT, CAD-RADS scale for CCTA. Results or Findings: We have established correlation of Agatston score determined with ultra-LDCT in LCS (p< .001). Also, we have established correlation betwee n data of A/V CAC-DRS on ultra-LDCT .001 and score in 0.887/0.965 (p<.001). Risks identified by the ultra-LDCT fixed by CAC-DRS are comparable to risks identified by CCTA with CAD-RAD S with SCC in 0.855 score in 0.821 (p< .001). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 171 Conclusion: Methods of coronary calcium assessment with chest ultra-LDCT and CT with ECG synchronisation are comparable. Therefore it is possible to assess coronary calcium in lung cancer screening by ultra-LDCT at a reliable- high level using both quantitative and visual CAC-D RS scales.

Scans were performed in t he multienergy (QuantumPlus) mode at 120kV with weight-adjusted intravenous contrast agent. non-contrast images (VNC), well a s virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) from 40-80keV obtained in 10keV interv als, were reconstructed. CT attenuation was measured in the aorta; noise was measured in subcutaneous fat and defined as the standard deviat ion of attenuation. Contrast-to-noise with ROI in the ascending aorta a nd signal-to-noise ratio in the subcutaneous fat were calculated. Subjective im age quality was rated by two blinded radiologists. Emphysema quantification (threshold at -950 HU) was performed by a commercially available software. VNC images served as reference standard for emphysema quantification. Results or Findings: Noise and CNR showed a strong negative correlation (r=-0.98; p<0.01) to VMI-energies. The score of subjective assessment was highest at 70keV for lung parenchyma and 50keV for pulmonary vessel evaluation (p<0.001). The best trade-off for the as sessment of emphysema while maintaining reasonable contrast for pulmonary vessel evaluation was determined between 60-70keV. Overall, contrast-enha nced imaging led to significant and systematic underestimation of emphy sema as compared to VNC (p<0.001) and decreased with increasing VMI-energy (r=0.98; p=0.003). The least difference in emphysema quantification between scans and VNC was found at 80keV. Conclusion: Emphysema quantification was significantly affected by intravenous contrast administration and VMI-energy level. VMI at 80keV yielded most comparable results to VNC. The best tr ade-off in qualitative as well as in quantitative image quality evaluation was determined at 60/70keV. Limitations: The limitation is the single-centred design.

Sardanelli, F. Secchi; Milan/IT Purpose: Our aim was to assess the accuracy of a fully autom ated AI-based segmentation of ventricular volumes in patients wit h Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) compared to manual measurements. Methods or Background: Patients with ToF who had undergone magnetic resonance at our institution were retrospectively r eviewed. Fully automated cardiac segmentation was performed by an AI-based s oftware, to obtain right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic (EDVi) and end-systolic (ESVi) volume indexes, and ejection fraction (EF). A human reader then per formed manual segmentation to obtain the same parameters. Results or Findings: 55 patients were included in the study, 23 of whom were females (42%), with a median age of 27 years (inter quartile range [IQR] 18-40 years). Comparisons showed a bias of -9 mL/m2 and a CoR of 65 mL/m2 for RV EDVi, a bias of -12 mL/m2 and a CoR of 45 mL/m2 for RV ES Vi, a bias of 7% and a CoR of 32% for RV EF. Conclusion: While the biases for automatic segmentation are wit hin acceptable clinical range, reproducibility is not f ully satisfactory due to wide variation ranges. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective and monocentric design. Ethics committee approval: The local Ethics Committee approved this retrospective study.

Kalifa*, G. Chatelier, Azarine; (kalifalaurette@hotmail.fr) Purpose: the feasibility of a dual-velocity encoding (Dual-Venc) 4D Flow MR prototype sequence to assess various vascul ar flows in complex congenital heart disease patients. Methods or Background: Routine cardiac MRI was performed on 17 young adults mostly followed for complex congenital heart disease on a 3T Magnet MRI (Discovery MR 750, GEMS). The usual 4D flow seq uence has been replaced by a Kt-ARC accelerated prototype sequence, using two different velocity encoding (Venc) set to 300/100 cm/s; tempo ral/spatial resolution = 40- 45msec / gadolin ium-based agent injection (Gadovist, Bayer, Germany). MRI data was anonymised and sent to a cloud-based software (Arterys). After automatic phase offsets and background correction, we assessed velocity-to-noise ratio (VN R), peak velocity and forward flow for different vessels, simultaneously and comparatively between high and low Venc datasets. All patients were infor med and signed a consent to test the prototype sequence. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 172 Results or Findings: All MRIs were successfully acquired in a mean scan time of 15 \u00b1 4 minutes, reducing total scan time by 33% compared to two separate acquisitions. Cloud-based post-processing enabled easy analysis of both low and high Venc heavy datasets. Aliasing art ifacts occurred more often for arterial measurements performed at low Venc. VN R at low Venc was always significantly better. The variability of ins tantaneous net flow measurements was significantly higher at high Venc than at low Venc (p < 0,05), especially for low velocity and medium calib er veins. Conclusion: Kt-ARC accelerated Dual-Venc 4D Flow MR sequence is feasible and particularly well suited for patients with complex congenital heart disease. Limitations: The limitations are a small number of patients and no control subjects. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by IRB (number 00012157).

In cases of a combination of AVSD wit h cardiac and noncardiac anomalies, the indicators of diagnostic efficiency change. Purpose: to evaluate the effectiveness of Echo, MDCT and MRI in the diagnosis of complex anatomical variants of the defect. Methods or Background: 279 patients with different anatomical variants of AVSD. Results or Findings: According to Echo results, 142 (50.1%) patients wer e diagnosed with additional CHD, 49 (34.5%) more than two and 12 (8.5%) complex HD, including AVSD, common atrium, TAPVC, TGA, PA, DORV. This complex anatomy has been observed in patients with heterotaxic syndrome. In visualisation of intracardiac anatomy, 48 cases required clarification: in 29 cases, an additional MDCT was performed and 19 cases MRI examination. The overall accuracy of Echo in the diagnosis of pathology did not exceed 89.2% (sensitivity 83.4%, specificit y 38.9%; predictability of a positive result 84.7%). False-negative results were obtained in 9 out of 48 cases, false-positive results in 7 patients. verall accuracy MDCT was 98.9% (S-96.2%, Sp-99.8%; PPR-98.7%). FNR was obtained in 2 of 29 cases. At the same time, concomitant pathological broncho-pulmona ry changes were detected in 35% of children. verall accuracy MRI was 99% (S - 98.9%, Sp - 98%; PPR - 99.7%). FNR was obtained in 1 out of 19 cases. Conclusion: In the diagnosis and identification of pathology concomitant with AVSD, MRI and MDCT have significant advantages over Echo due to the high sensitivity and specificity in visualisation of ext racardiac structures. The possibility of diagnosis of concomitant pathological broncho-pulmonary changes in 35% of children is also a significant advantage over Echo.

Methods or Background: Pediatric CHD patients, who underwent cardiac MRI with FP-MRA followed by mDixon SS-MRA at 3T wer e retrospectively analysed. Image quality was assessed using a Likert scale from 5 (excellent) to 1 (non-diagnostic). Blood-to-tissue ratio, fat suppression quality, and quantitative measurements of the thoracic vasculature were assessed. Measurements were performed separately and/or in consensus by two readers. Paired Student t-test, Wilcoxon test, and ICCs were used for statistical analysis. Results or Findings: 32 patients with CHD (mean age: 3.3\u00b11.7 years, 13 female) were included. Overall image quality of mDi xon SS-MRA was higher compared to FP-MRA P<0.001). contrast 85\u00b14.75 vs. 6.35\u00b12.23; P=0.133). Fat suppression of mDixon SS-MRA was perfect in 30/32 (94 %) cases. Vessel diameters were greater in FP-MRA compared to mDixon SS-MRA with the greatest differences at the level o f pulmonary arteries and veins (e.g., right pulmonary artery for reader 1: 1 0.4\u00b12.4 vs. 9.9\u00b12.3 mm, P<0.001). Interobserver agreement was higher for mD ixon SS-MRA for all measurements compared to FP-MRA (ICCs >0.92). In 9/ 32 (28%) patients, 10 additional findings were identified on mDixon SS-MR A (e.g., partial anomalous venous return, abnormalities of coronary arteries, subclavian artery stenosis), which were not depicted using FP-MRA. Conclusion: mDixon SS-MRA offers a robust fat suppression, a hi gh image quality, and diagnostic utility for the assessment of the thoracic vasculature in pediatric CHD patients.

Prayer; Vienna/AT RPS 711-2 Comparison used pine procedures have evolved from IUsing iCT, radiation exposure can significantly be reduced. Methods or Background: The radiation exposure to the patient and operating room staff in posterior intervertebral lumbar fusio n procedures is compared between iCT and C-arm fluoroscopy. The effective do se of the surgeon, operating nurse and anaesthesiologist were measured during surgery with personal dosimeters. The effective dose of the pati ent was calculated and the lateral and abdominal peak skin dose was measured w ith GafchromicTM films. Time-efficiency of the procedure was evaluated by r ecording the duration of pedicle screw fixation and the duration of the total surgery time. Results or Findings: A total of 75 patients participated in the study, 30 patients had surgery guided by iCT and 45 by C-arm fluoroscopy. The radiation dose of the surgeon, the operating nurse and the an aesthesiologist was significantly lower with surgeries assisted by iCT, compared to C-arm fluoroscopy. In contrast, the effective dose of the patient significantly increased with iCT. Conclusion: Using iCT, radiation exposure of the operating room staff can be reduced significantly. iCT increases the effective dose of the patient and prolongs the operative time. Limitations: First, there was a significant difference between t he iCT and the C-arm fluoroscopy group in terms of the surgeon who performed the MI-PLIF procedures.

Purpose: Post-traumatic atlanto-axial instability is classic ally associated with tears of the transverse atlantal ligament at C1-C2 and is indirectly evaluated on plain film and cervical spine CT. The purpose of our study was to determine which method is most sensitive in predicting transv erse atlantal ligament injury. Methods or Background: Adult and paediatric trauma patients who suffered a transverse atlantal ligament tear on cervical MRI w ere identified retrospectively using Nuance mPower software. The cervical CT and MRI exams for these patients were reviewed by two neuroradiologists for the following: anterior and lateral atlanto-dens interval widening, C1 C1-C2 rotatory subluxation, and transverse atlantal ies on cervical MRI. Results or Findings: Twenty-seven trauma patients were identified with a tear of the transverse atlantal ligament on cervical MRI . Eleven percent of these patients demonstrated an anterior dens interval measuring greater than 2 mm, 26% of patients demonstrated lateral mass offset of C1 on C2, 18% of patients demonstrated an asymmetry greater than 1 mm between the left and right lateral atlantodens interval, and one patient demonstrated atlanto-axial rotation measuring greater than 20%. Conclusion: An anterior atlantodens interval measuring greater than 2 mm is an unreliable methodology to screen trauma patients for transverse altantal ligament injuries and atlanto-axial instability. Mo reover, C1 lateral mass offset, lateral atlantodens asymmetry, and atlanto-axial rotation were all poor predictors of transverse atlantal ligament tears. O ur findings underscore the importance of cervical MRI in the diagnostic workup and management of patients with acute, high velocity cervical spine t rauma and suggest that anterior atlantodens interval widening on cervical CT is an unreliable screening method for atlanto-axial instability.

T (leonardo.pertici@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify which structure contributes most to determining the worsening of lumbar foraminal stenosis through the study of dynamic magnetic resonance in the supine and orthostatic position. Methods or Background: We retrospectively evaluated 200 patients who underwent standard supine and standing weight-beari ng MRI scans of the lumbar spine (on a 0.25T MR scan). The inclusion cr iteria were grade 1-2-3 foraminal stenosis and complete good quality examinations Foraminal stenosis parameters were manually measured by two radiologis ts and included: depth of the lateral recess; angle of the lateral recess; area of the lateral canal in sagittal and axial. As explanatory variables, the s ame and midpoint ligamental flava thickness; and height; A matched t est was used to compare supine vs orthostatic measurements. The Log-likelihood ratio statistics was used to assess the overall model fitting between fo raminal stenosis parameters and explanatory variables. Results or Findings: We found significant differences between supine and orthostatic position for all foraminal parameters a nd explanatory variables. Foraminal stenosis gets worse by reduction of the depth and angle of the lateral recess and the lateral canal sagittal and axial area (mean decrease 15- 20%). The linear mixed model showed significant regression coefficients between foraminal stenosis thickness (z 1.85, p<0.05), facet joint thickness (z 2.87, p 0.004), s pinal processes distance (z 2.87, p 0.033), spondylolisthesis 2.40, p 0.016) . Conclusion: According to our weight-bearing study, changes of p osterior elements induced by load may be the prevalent deter minant of foraminal stenosis.

Fiester*, G. Rahmathulla, M. Jenson, J. Patel, E. Soule; Jacksonville/US Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify and class ify the different types of anterior atlanto-occipital membrane complex injuries on MRI and evaluate for the presence and location of a prevert ebral effusion. Methods or Background: Patients who suffered an anterior atlanto-occipital membrane complex injury were identified retrospecti vely using Nuance mPower software. The cervical CT and MRI exams for these patients were reviewed for the presence and location of a prevert ebral effusion. Age-matched positive and negative control groups were obtained. Results or Findings: Fifty patients were identified with an acute anteri or atlanto-occipital membrane complex injury. Three di stinct patterns of anterior atlanto-occipital membrane complex injury were obse rved: 1) increased STIR signal and disruption of the anterior atlanto-occipital membrane (19 patients); 2) increased STIR signal and disruption of the anterior atlantoaxial membrane (10 patients); 3) increased STIR signal and disrupt ion of both the anterior atlanto-occipital membrane and anterior atlantoaxial membrane (21 patients). Ninety-four percent of patients with an anterior at lanto-occipital membrane complex injury presented with a prevertebral effusi on at the craniocervical junction with an average anteroposterior dimension of 8 mm. Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant assoc iation between anterior atlanto- occipital membrane complex A craniocervical prevertebral effusion in 94% of patients with an anterior atlanto-occipital membrane complex tear. Based on our findings, the presence of a craniocervical prev ertebral effusion is 94% sensitive and 94% specific for an anterior atlanto- occipital membrane complex injury in high velocity trauma victims.

Jeonju/KR (tytyuuii96@naver.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate angiographic and contrast enhancement patterns on three-dimensional (3D) blac k blood (BB) contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patient s with acute medulla infarction. Methods or Background: From January 2020 to January 2021, we retrospectively analysed stroke 3D BB contrast-enhanced MR imaging and angiography findings of patients visiting the emergency room for symptom evaluation of acute medulla infarction. In total, 28 patients with acute medulla infarction were enrolled in this study. We divided the four groups according to Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 174 whether angiography findings suggested occlusion, hypoplasia, or normal and whether vertebral artery (VA) contrast enhancement was shown or not. Results or Findings: Of 28 patients with acute medulla infarction, seven (25.0%) showed delayed positive findings after 24 h ours on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Of these patients, 19 (67.9%) showed contrast enhancement of unilateral VA. Of 19 patients with contrast enhancement of VA, 18 showed no visualisation of enhanced VA on MR angiography and one showed hypoplastic VA. Of seven patients with delayed positive findings on DWI, five showed contrast enhancement of unilateral VA and no visual isation of enhanced VA on MR angiography. Conclusion: Unilateral contrast enhancement on 3D BB contrast-enhanced MR imaging and no visualisation of VA on MR angiogr aphy are related to recent occlusion of distal VA. These findings suggest that recent occlusion of distal VA is related to acute medulla infarction including delayed visualisation on DWI. Limitations: This is a retrospective study featuring a small cas e series.

Fiester*, M. D. Rao, E. Soule, G. Rahma thulla; Jacksonville/US Purpose: The purpose of our study is to identify adult traum a patients with an acute, traumatic tear of the transverse atlantal li gament on cervical MRI and evaluate for concomitant craniocervical junction li gamentous injuries. Methods or Background: Adult trauma patients who suffered a transverse atlantal ligament injury on cervical MRI were ident ified retrospectively using Nuance mPower software. The cervical CT and MRI exams for these patients were reviewed by two neuroradiologists for the foll owing: bony fractures of transverse atlantal integrity, major craniocervcial ligamentous integrity membrane, atlanto-occipital membranes cord trauma, and intracranial trauma. Results or Findings: Thirty trauma patients presented to the ED with a history of high velocity trauma and an acute, mid-substance transverse atlantal ligament tear on cervical MRI. Twenty seven percent of patients demonstrated a tear in at least one major craniocervical ligament (atlanto-occipital capsular ligaments, alar ligaments, and tectorial membrane) with 17% demonstrating a tear in two major craniocervical ligaments, and no patients demonstrating a tear in all three major craniocervcial ligaments. M inor craniocervical ligament injuries (anterior and posterior atlanto-occipital membrane complex) were common and observed in 73% of patients. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a C1 and/or C2 fracture. Two patients underwent occ ipital cervical fusion and five patient underwent C1-C2 posterior fusion for t heir injuries with the remaining patients treated with prolonged external immobilisation. Conclusion: Major and minor craniocervical junction ligamentous injuries are relatively common in the setting of transverse atla ntal ligament injury.

Methods or Background: Age and gender are known factors that modify bone structure. Radiomics may depict modification of CT trabecular bone that could predict subjects' gender and age, and that could id entify bone frailty and vertebral fracture risk. Further, little is known a bout reproducibility of CT radiomics. We annotated spherical regions-of-intere st (ROIs) (9 mm diameter) in the centre of vertebral body of lumbar vertebrae (L1-L5) in 233 subjects undergoing lumbar CT for back pain on 3 different C T scanners, and we evaluated features from each ROIs. Subjects with a history of bone methabolism disorders, cancer and vertebral fractur es were excluded. We performed machine learning classification and regression models to evaluate gender and age respectively on each lumbar vertebra e and we provided a model which combined predictions on each vertebrae. Results or Findings: The machine learning model was trained on 173 patients and validated on a testing dataset of 60 patients. Radiomics models were able to predict patients' gender within the same CT scan ner (ROC AUC: up to 0.9714), with lower performance on the combined dat aset of the 3 scanners (ROC AUC 0.5545). Subjects' age was found to obtain good consistency among scanners (R2 0.568 all scanner) and MAD of 7. 232 years, with highest results on a single CT scanner (R2 0.667, MAD 3.296 years). Conclusion: Radiomics features able to extract subjects' information from lumbar vertebral trabecular bone, and predict subjects' gender and age with great accuracy.

Initial experience with a next-generation low-field MRI scanner *M. Dietzel*, F. B. Laun, E. R. Hei\u00df, M. Ohlmeyer; Erlangen/DE Purpose: Breast-MRI is essential for state-of-the-art breast imaging. However, broader clinical use is limited due to high procedu ral costs, technical complexity, limited availability and substantial requirements on local infrastructure. Low-field breast-MRI may compensate for these disadvantages. We report on our first experiences with a next-gene ration low-field scanner operating at 0.55 Tesla. Methods or Background: In this prospective IRB-approved study we examined patients based on standard beyond traditional MRI departments (height <2 metre, weight <3.2 tons, no quench pipe necessary etc.). Likewise, total cost of ownership is approximately 40% reduced compared to 1.5T systems. We optimised a dedicated blinded expert reader (>15 years breast-MRI experience) assessed the examinations based on established procedures (BI- RADS, ADC-measurement by Wielema et al., artifact-g rading by Fischer et al.). Results or Findings: We examined ten patients (mean: 54.6 years, range: 36- 72 years) with typical scar, therapy- response, preoperative-staging, CUP-syndrome, asses sment etc.). In all patients, image quality was compelling and entirely diagnostic. No significant artifacts were noted. Scanning a full, non-abbreviated multiparametric protocol was possible in less than <20 minutes. We will prov ide clinical cases, technical-, and protocol-specifications at the meet ing. Conclusion: We demonstrate feasibility of low-field breast-MRI with compelling image quality. Low-field scanners promis e to drive affordability and accessibility of breast-MRI. If upcoming clinical s tudies confirm our initial observations, the method may emerge as an alternati ve to high-field breast- MRI. We expect the greatest benefits of low-field breast-MRI for personalised screening. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 175 Limitations: A more detailed analysis of low-field breast-MRI (qualitative, quantitative, statistical, multireader, etc.) is re quired and will be part of future clinical trials.

Methods or Background: This study included 48 patients with malignant breast lesions. SBCT was performed in all patients before and two minutes after intravenous contrast application. Lesion Houn sfield units (HU) were recorded in the unenhanced scan and in the contrast -enhanced scan of SBCT using a circle tool. Lesion contrast enhancement was calculated as the difference measured in HU. All histopathology resul ts were approved via image-guided biopsy or surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted for expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progester one receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and Ki-67 index. Contrast enhancement of breast lesions was correlated with i mmunohistochemical breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A/B, HER2 positive, triple negative), Ki-67 expression and (G1-G3). Results or Findings: Lesions with high Ki-67 (n=35) index showed higher contrast enhancement than those with low Ki-67 inde x (n=13): 106.8 vs. 94.5 HU (P = .151). Highest contrast enhancement was see n for Luminal B lesions (114.2 HU, n=19) and HER2 positive lesions (102.9 H U, n=9) compared to Luminal A lesions (94.4 HU, n=16) and triple negati ve lesions (75.0 HU, n=4). G1 lesions (n=11) showed G2 (n=20) and G3 tumours HU a nd 100.7 HU, respectively. Conclusion: Contrast media uptake of malignant breast lesions i n SBCT seems to be different depending on immunohistochemi cal subtype and Ki-67 expression. This could be a valuable benefit in the pre-operative work-up of breast cancer patients. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by IRB.

Methods or Background: US/optical hybrid prototype. The device consists of SSI Aixplorer Mach 30 ultrasound system combined wi th a diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system. SOLUS includes, in a singl e exam, B mode ultrasound, colour doppler, share wave elastography and DOT, through a probe that has a normal US transducer in the centre, flanked, laterally, by 8 optodes that emit and receive light in the red and infrared spectrum. The optical study allows one to measure the concentrati ons of water, lipids, collagen, oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated (Hb), ( SO2 = HbO2 / tHb), as well as to provide information on cell membranes and subcellular organelles. The clinical study plans to compare, in vivo, the parameters obtained from the evaluation of 20 fibroadenomas and 20 malignant les ions to verify the possibility of differentiating them with this multi modal device. Results or Findings: To date, the cases of multimodal in vivo analysis, performed in the preliminary phase of the study, have confirmed the possibility of acquiring useful information for the characteris ation of breast lesions, confirming the expectations. Conclusion: Very initial data, based mainly on DOT findings gui ded by ultrasound, suggest that a multiparametric analysis may have a role in the characterisation of breast lesions. Limitations: The limitation is very initial data. Ethics committee approval: The Ethical committee of IRCCS San Raffaele approved the study. Funding for this study: The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement n. 731877.

Santangelo*, G. Maffeis, Panizza; Milan/IT (carola.santangelo.md@gmail.com) Purpose: Preliminary evaluation of the performance of an opt ical mammography prototype in predicting and monitoring the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Methods or Background: An optical mammography prototype was developed by the Department of Physics of Politecnico of Milano to study the compressed breast in two projections, such as X-ray mammography. It emits pulsed light at seven wavelengths that passes through the breast an d is measured by detectors placed on the opposite surface. This devi ce allows non-invasive detection of the concentration values of eters such as: oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, 6 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast canc er were evaluated with optical mammography, monitored with mammography, ul trasound and MRI; optical parameters were measured before, during and after treatment. Results or Findings: In the responders, the first data show clear correl ation between the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the variation of some of the optical parameters examined, more marked imm ediately after the first administration of the drug: the percentage of hemoglobin, water and collagen decreases rapidly while that of the lipids increases. Conclusion: The preliminary data confirm the potential of this optical mammography prototype, in the prediction and monitoring of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in a non-invasive way. These data are such to justify a study on large numbers to optimise the pr otocol and verify their usefulness in daily clinical practice. Limitations: The limitation are the preliminary results.

Methods or Background: All patients at the University Breast Cancer Centre who underwent a clinically indicated dual-layer CT- scan (IQon, Philips) for pretherapeutical staging of invasive breast cancer from 03/2017 to 07/2020 were prospectively included. Virtual monoenergetic (VM) images (40/100 keV), iodine concentration maps, and zeffective maps were reconstructed from the CT-image datasets. Spectral attenuation curves were calculated additionally. ROI-based evaluations of the index tumours and the reference \"aorta\" were performed semi-automatically in identical anatomical positions using dedicated evaluation software. Descriptive statistical analys is was based on Spearman's rank correlations. Results or Findings: Bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between conventional Houndsfield scores and Her2neu receptor status (p=0.004) molecular subtyping (p=0.041) for all car cinomas, which were both confirmed by the evaluations of iodine content, VM slopes, and zeffective values (p=0.002-0.021). Additionally, iodine content and zeffective values and proges terone receptor (p=0.005,0.006). Normalisation of the measured values in the tumours with those in the aorta confirmed significant correlations of iodine content, VM slopes and zeffective-values compared to estrogen, progesterone and Her2neu receptor status (p=0.002-0.024). The result s were consistent in 168 carcinomas of the non-significant type (NST). Conclusion: Our preliminary results indicate that quantitative evaluations of iodine content, VM slopes, and zeffective-values on dual-layer CT- examinations allow conclusions on the hormone and H er2neu receptor status of invasive breast carcinomas. These initial result s will be further elaborated with the clinical introduction of photon CT-imaging and may be translated into clinical care in the long term. Limitations: The limitation is a low number of cases prohibiting further subgroup analyses.

I. Argyropoulou; Ioannina/GR RPS 712-2 Imaging differ between and contralateral br ain parenchyma (CBP) and if alterations in specific clinical features affect DT I indices. Methods or Background: This single-centre retrospective, cross-sectional study, considered children and adolescents with foc al structural epilepsy associated with FCD who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including DTI sequence. FCDs were manually segmente d on high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI. After normalising the DTI to the anatomical images, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were calculated in both FCD and CBP. DTI indices facilitating an optimal differentiation between FCD and CBP were further analysed to determine if clinical features affected DTI indices. Results or Findings: 32 patients (20 male; mean age at MRI 6.0\u00b14.7 years ) were enrolled in this study: FCD was histologically confirmed in 15/32 cases. FA values were lower in FCD compared to CBP (p = 0. 028), whereas MD values were higher in FCD than in CBP (p = 0.044). In histologically confirmed FCD, the difference in FA values between FCD and CB P was higher for FCD type IIb than for FCD type I (p = 0.033), and for p atients with a positive vs. negative history of status epilepticus (p = 0.015). None of the clinical features influenced the difference in MD values. Conclusion: FA values discriminated FCD from CBP and distinguis hed between FCD (1) is a retrospective single-centre (2) two different DTI protocols were used; (3) FCDs were ma nually segmented.

Methods or Background: We review three paediatric patients presenting with medullary concussion after minor trauma in which is olated central canal dilatation was seen in the MR. We analyse the CT an d MR of 3 children who after spinal trauma were presenting with incomplete traumatic cord syndrome (mostly altered sensation). Patients underwent CT f or depicting traumatic injuries with no abnormalities found. In MR images only central cord dilatation was found, as an isolated imaging finding. Patients were treated conservatively with complete neurological function restoration. Furthermore, we do a non- systematic review of the available literature. To t he best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to describe this entity and its clinical course. Results or Findings: Isolated central canal dilatation was not previousl y described as an imaging finding after spinal trauma. A condition called presyrinx was described as being the predecessor of the development of syringomyelia. This state was characterised by the presence of extensive spinal cord T2 hyperintensity, a feature that is not seen in our cases. The recently described glymphatic system and the import ance of aquaporin 4 in reabsorbing the cerebrospinal fluid and the altered expression of this protein after trauma can be a physiopathological explanation. Other classically described physiopathological mechanisms for the dev elopment of syringomyelia are also reviewed and commented on. Conclusion: The isolated central canal dilatation can be an underdiagnosed entity in patients presenting with medullary acute syndromes after trauma categorised as medullary concussions or SCIWORA.

In paediatric population JSS symptoms are commonly not obvious, especially in lo calised symptoms. The diagnostic criteria are still unclear for paediatri c population. The previously leading imaging methods, like x-ray sialography or scintigraphy, are avoided nowadays due to radiation and invasiveness. Nowaday s ultrasound (US) starts to play an important role, however not included in the diagnostic criteria. In our study we present characteristics of ultrasound findings in major salivary glands in children with JSS. Methods or Background: 13 children with proven JSS and positive salivary gland biopsy (LSGB) were included for the study (5 males and 8 females, the mean age 9 years, range: 4-14 years). The clinical data was collected, including the time of duration and frequency of the symptoms, clinical symptoms xerostomia, ocular dryness, and laboratory exponents of JSS. The ultrasound examination was focused on the major sal ivary glands, parotids and submandibular, done with high frequency linear prob e. The results were compared with clinical disease activity. Results or Findings: All children presented sonographic changes in saliv ary glands, only in one of the cases the findings were not specific for JSS. In 10/13 patients parotids and submandibular glands were inv olved. In 2/13 children observed isolated changes in submandibular and subl ingual salivary glands, with parotid glands spared. The changes limited to parotid gland were found in only one child. No correlation of clinical presentation and imaging findings was found. Conclusion: Ultrasound is a very sensitive and specific tool fo r diagnosis JSS. However, low correlation of clinical symptms and im aging findings needs further prospective studies. Limitations: Low number of patients. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

T. Paula*, P. V. P. Helito, S\u00e3o Paulo/BR (vitortav@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this presentation is to highlight the current and rational imaging evaluation of musculoskeletal infections in children population. Methods or Background: Pictorial essay containing clinical imaging cases from our paediatric and musculoskeletal radiology departments with correlation to clinical and laboratorial data and also to anatomopathological and culture results from biopsies and drainage interventions. Results or Findings: We reviewed the accepted current guidelines and scientific evidences about imaging evaluation of musculoskeletal infections in children and illustrated that rational concepts wit h the cases from our radiology department. Common and uncommon presentations of spondylodiscitis, osteomyelitis, pyomyositis and septic arthritis wer e highlighted and correlated to the diagnostic approach and clinical outcomes. C onventional radiography, computed tomography, ultra-sonography, magnetic res onance and nuclear medicine methods were the most frequently used modalities to assess paediatric musculoskeletal infections and the correspondent results were demonstrated. Inflammatory markers, blood culture a nd cultures of osseous and soft tissue collections samples were also emphasised. Conclusion: A pictorial essay applying the review of evidence-based concepts about imaging role on musculoskeletal paediatric infections constitutes a valuable tool in order to enhance and renew knowledge of radiologists, especially paediatric and musculoskeletal ones. The conjugation of the theoretical concepts with corresponding imaging findings contributes to didatic learning about rational use of imaging modalities a nd correct interpretation and reporting on daily practice with paediatric populat ion.

A. Alfahad*, A. A. Alboukai, K. Attia, M. Al Bo ukai; Riyadh/SA Purpose: To dif ferentiating medullary osteonecrosis from osteomyelitis in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods or Background: All MRI scans done for children with SCD (ages 0- 13 years) admitted for acute bone crisis between 2015-2021 were collected. MRI parameters were noted by 2 radiologists with ex perience in paediatric and musculoskeletal imaging, providing radiological diagnoses of osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, or indeterminate. Electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain clinical diagnoses (censuses of haematology, infectious diseases, and orthopaedic surgery). Kappa test was used for clini cal/radiological agreement. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate statistically significant MRI parameters in relation to the radiological and clinical diagno ses of osteomyelitis or osteonecrosis (statistical significance defined at P < 0.05). Results or Findings: A total of 50 radiological observations were gather ed, and 8 were excluded due to lack of imaging findings or diagnosis of epiphyseal AVN. Agreement between clinical and radiological di agnoses was fair (Kappa = 0.52). MRI parameters that show statistical signifi cance related to both clinical and radiological diagnoses included: presence of cortical defect (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), presence of soft tissue inflammation (P = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively), soft tissue inflammation relative to bony changes (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), the presence of subperiosteal collections (P = 0.002 and 0.029, respectively), non-fat saturated T 1 signal intensity of the bone marrow (P = 0.021 and 0.014, respectively), and bone marrow fluid collection (P = 0.011 and 0.004, respectively). Conclusion: MRI can reliably differentiate osteomyelitis from m edullary osteonecrosis in children with SCD. Findings that s upport osteomyelitis include the presence of cortical defects, extensive soft ti ssue inflammation relative to bony changes, and bone marrow fluid collection. Ost eonecrosis is highly suggested with high bone marrow signal intensity on non-fat saturated T1WI, relatively less extensive soft tissue inflammation, and absence of subperiosteal fluid collection. Limitations: Confounding factors, misclassification bias, and mi ssing information related to the retrospective nature of the study. There are also uncertain diagnoses, lack of follow-up and small sample size. Ethics committee approval: Local IRB requirements were fulfilled. Funding for this study: None to report.

P. and subcutaneous tissue of unknown etiology. W hile localised GA (LGA) affects all ages, subcutaneous GA (SGA) occurs excl usively during childhood. So far, accurate diagnosis of SGA was mainly establ ished by surgical biopsy. This study evaluated potential imaging signs in chi ldren with GA. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of available imaging in children diagnosed for GA at our institution betwee n 01.01.2001-31.12.2021 was performed. Results or Findings: 56 patients were diagnosed with GA. Only 4/28 patients with LGA received ultrasound imaging, all others we re diagnosed clinically. All 28 SGA patients were examined by ultrasound, 16 pat ients received an x-ray, and 12 patients were examined by MRI. All imaging w as inconclusive, and subcutaneous vascular anomalies were the main diffe rential diagnoses. Surgery was done in 18 patients, including all pati ents examined by MRI. During retrospective analysis of MR images we discovered a specific shape of SGA lesions, resembling an epifascial mound with br oad circular fascial base extending centrally into the subdermal/dermal tissu e. This characteristic shape of the lesions was present in all MRIs of SGA patie nts. The same shape was found in the analysis of ultrasound images. Interes tingly, in analysis of ultrasound images of LGA patients we found the subdermal inverse mound sign. Conclusion: We describe for the first time, pathognomonic imagi ng signs for SGA and LGA in children. To the best of our knowled ge, there is no other known subcutaneous lesion presenting in the shape of epifascial mound or subdermal inverse mound as we just described. We believe that recognition and awareness of epifascial mound sign will signifi cantly reduce the need for surgery in children with SGA. Limitations: Low number of LGA patients examined by ultrasound.

Vosshenrich*; Basel/CH \"hedging\" exp ressions in radiology reports and how the introduction of struc tured reporting and a reporting culture with focus on certainty affects hedging expression occurrence. Methods or Background: 1,073,324 reports written from 2013 to 2021 in our department's body (n = 134,817), cardiothoracic (n 253,924), musculoskeletal (n = 373,090), neuroradiology (n = 207,730) and nuclear medicine section (n = 103,763) were retrieved from the radiological information system (RIS). Nine expressions such as \"prominent\", \"accentuated\" and \"cannot exclude\" considered as hedging were identif ied by a group of board certified radiologists. Using a text search algorit hm the occurrence of hedging expressions including their grammatical variations were searched and counted. The algorithm does only register the occurrence of the expression in a report, not the number of occurrences within a report. 100% structured reporting and a culture using factual standardised reporting langua ge was introduced in the body and cardiothoracic sections in 2015/16. Results or Findings: There was a 60.5% overall decrease in the use of hedging expressions from 2013 (n = 11,859) to 2021 (n = 4,681). In body imaging overall hedging decreased by 73.6%, in cardiothoracic by 72.8%. The occurrence of the expression \"prominent\" decreased by 97.8% from 2013 to 2021 in body (n = 274 vs. n = 6) and in cardiothoracic imaging by 89.3% (n = 597 vs. n = 64). In musculoskeletal imaging hedging decreased by 74.5%, \"prominent\" by neuroradiology by 29.3% , \"prominent\" by 69%. In nuclear medicine overall hedging increased by 5.8% and \"prominent\" decreased by 46.3%. Conclusion: The introduction of structured reporting and awaren ess for certainty using a factual standardised reporting la nguage appears to decrease the use of uncertainty \"hedging\" expressions.

Methods or Background: The pandemic has urged countries to reorganise their healthcare. It has caused cancellation/deferm ent of elective surgeries, face-to-face consultations, medical inventory short ages, diagnostic modalities delay and limited health maintenance globally. This had major effect on non- COVID-19 conditions, especially on chronic and undi agnosed patients with clinical manifestations. This study was designed as cross-sectional online survey of a sample of adults about their access to the non-COVID19 diagnostic imaging services. It was conducted from July-Novemb er, 2021. The survey was posted on Facebook in four public groups with approximately 83.000 members. The study population consisted of adults w ho fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: older than 18 years and member of one of the target Facebook public groups. Results or Findings: There were in total 364 participants of both sex (m/f:30.5%69.5%), with mean age of 37.94\u00b113.35. Amo ng the participants who responded to the question about chronic condition, one-third had at least one 113/244 (31.6%68.4%). Among the participants who responded to the question about undiagnosed condition, which required diagnos tic imaging, one fifth had at least one 79/285 (21.7%78.3%). Waiting period (i n and predictors with significant influence on missing an imaging ap pointment were: female gender and chronic disease (AdjustedOR= 2.070, 1.967, respectively). Conclusion: There is a need for creation of \"chronic care model \" during crises such as pandemic, due to great morbidity, mortality and economic burden of chronic conditions and the fact that undiagnosed conditions need to undergo imaging in order to start treatment.

C. Rodr\u00edguez radiologists a ssessing 3D rendered CT studies of basilar skull fractures on an immersive virtual reality headset (IVR) and its comparison with workstation v isualisation (WS). Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, two groups of observer s conformed each by two radiologists and two resident s in their 2nd and 3rd year, assessed a set of 10 non-contrasted head CT of patients diagnosed with linear or comminute fractures alongside control cas es in the facilities of IVR or WS. This set was randomised and reviewed again after a week. Only clinical data provided was \"traumatic head injury\". Fracture s were classified posterior fossa fractures\" thr ough formularies for statistical analysis applying logistic regression models and RO C curves for posterior comparison. Results or Findings: 90% for anterior, and posterior fo ssa respectively, on 95% CI. WS sensibility middle and posterior fossa respectively, on 95% CI. ROC curves for IVR had values of AUC= 0,979, 0,724 and 0,734 with a p=0,001 for anterior, middle and posterior fossa. The ROC curves for WS had values of AUC=0,938, 0,807 and 0,680 with posterior fossa respectively. Conclusion: AUC on both groups did not have major significant v ariations, in general, they both had variable sensibility and gre ater specificity values, this is in accordance with patterns reported by international literature (sensibility 18%- 85%, specificity 100%). Limitations: Only assessed linear or comminuted fractures in adults, confirmation by autopsy was not possible.

Methods or Background: To drive first-time-right acquisition services, it is paramount that radiologists are accessible to technologists. However, in many hospitals radiologists are consulted over phone or in person, leading to frequent interruptions of the diagnostic workflow. This has been associated with increased stress, errors and turn-around-times . We developed an asynchronous communication tool (RadConnect) that e nables radiologic technologists to send a \"ticket\" to a radiology sec tion role account. A ticket comprises a question category, urgency (i.e. desired response time) and imaging status. The tickets appear on a prioritised worklist from which the radiologist can open it to engage with the technologist in a chat channel. Four technologists and five radiologists from an academi c hospital in the Netherlands participated in a two-hour usability st udy. They performed simulated tasks in RadConnect. A member of the rese arch team acted as sending/receiving counterpart. A structured survey was conducted at the end of each session to gauge perceived value on a 5-poi nt Likert scale (1=Strongly disagree, 5=Strongly agree). Results or Findings: Study participants expected to use RadConnect frequently (4.3) and that it will reduce phone comm unication by >80% (4.3). Radiologists preferred RadConnect over phone for pr otocolling (4.9) and image review (4.3) questions, and were not concerned about incoming tickets interrupting their workflow (1.7). Conclusion: RadConnect is expected to have impact on reducing w orkflow interruptions by asynchronous communication between radiologist and radiologic technologist, potentially contributing t o a more pleasant work environment and sustainable radiological workforce.

Al Dahery*\u00b9, W. \u00b2Madinah/SA Purpose: This is the first study to evaluate teleradiology at hospitals from Saudi radiologists' perspectives, to evaluate the i mpact of teleradiology in radiology departments at Saudi hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to suggest reorganising the workflow at Saudi hospi tals. Methods or Background: Teleradiology is an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain social distancing and reduce cross-infection, activities in radiology departments can be adapted to remote workstations which is also useful in providing consistent qualit y health service to patients. It is based on digital transmission of medical images from one site to another to provide services remotely, which can result in mini mising the expansion of COVID-19. Results or Findings: A total of 102 radiologists participated in this st udy (56% males and 44% females). The majority (85%) were eit her residents or consultants. The results showed that qualification is significantly associated with the overall responses. However, no statistical difference was noted between hospital type, years of experience, and res ponses. Only 41% of participants believed that teleradiology might incr ease the quality of radiological reports during COVID-19. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that teleradiology can acc elerate the interpretation process and improve patients' access ibility to the healthcare services during the pandemic, and could have a futu re in developing new projects for Saudi hospitals. However, some partici pants were dissatisfied with the level of communication between healthcare professionals. Limitations: A Saudi radiologist's perspectives only of teleradi ology. The results may need to be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, which may not be generalised to the whole radiologi st in Saudi Arabia.

(DLR) a new imaging technology for CT. Among them, DLR for improving spatial resolution for conventional CT targeting ultra-high resolution CT (UHR-CT) was dev eloped. In this report, we examined the image performance of conventional CT, UHR-CT and DLR-CT. Methods or Background: We evaluated changes in spatial resolution and CT values. The wire method was used to measure the spatial resolution. For changes in CT values, CT value profiles and peak CT values were measured in a spiral wire phantom. Results or Findings: The spatial resolution of DLR images was superior t o conventional CT, but slightly inferior to UHR-CT. T he CT value profile was similar. No characteristic edge undershoot appeared in any of the images. The peak CT value of the wire was higher than that of t he conventional CT, but slightly inferior to that of UHR-CT. Conclusion: DLR-CT image was able to obtain spatial resolution close to that of UHR-CT with conventional CT. DLR-CT not only imp roves the spatial resolution but also has the effect of improving the CT value of small blood vessels. DLR-CT is effective in diagnosing small bl ood vessels. Limitations: This report is based on the phantom experiment. We are planning to conduct research using human body data. Ethics committee approval: Our experiments have been approved by the ethics committee. Funding for this study: We are not financially funded by any organisation f or this report.

It is a widely used preprocessing step for many medical imaging-related clinical applicati ons like image reconstruction, and it strongly affects the perform ance of algorithms that rely on image alignments, such as multimodal segmentation. Thus, the quality control (QC) of medical image registration is essential for controlling the failure rates of many downstream clinical applications. Methods or Background: This study provided a deep learning-based registration QC model that can correctly classify m isaligned image pairs on multiple datasets and can be generalised to multipl e modalities/anatomies using the strategy of combined training. Results or Findings: Our approach can perform well on multiple datasets with different contrasts and with randomly synthesised m ovements. On 3 validation datasets of spine MR image with affine transformati ons, SVF transformations, and brain MR image with affine transformations, the model can flag misaligned image pairs with 0.98, 0.93, and 0.99 F1 scores. Conclusion: We proposed a feasible method based on deep learnin g CNN and combined training with synthesised movements, t hat can achieve automatic, accurate, and fast medical image registr ation quality control by predicting misaligned image pairs. This method can be applied to multiple contrasts and anatomies. Limitations: The limitations are that data collection-wise, we need to have the corresponding image pairs in the training set for t he model to have nice generalisability of that kind of image data.

R\u00e9my-Jardin; CT-radiomic and systemic immune- inflammatory features predict the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced NSCLC patients *G. Milanese*, G. Mazzaschi, L. Moron Dalla Tor, L. Leo, M. Balbi, R. E. Ledda, M. Silva, M. Tiseo, N. Sverzellati; Pa rma/IT Purpose: biomarkers foreseeing response to immune heckpoint (ICIs) can be obtained by decoding tumou r heterogeneity and its evolution during treatment. We tested whether longi tudinal assessment of radiomic features (RFs) and blood descriptors of sy stemic inflammation (SI) may predict ICI efficacy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods or Background: CT-derived RFs and peripheral blood SI parameters, including derived Neutrophil-to-Lymphoc yte ratio (dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were acquired at basel ine (T0) and at first disease assessment (T1) for 92 stage IV NSCLC patients undergoing ICIs. Primary endpoint was ICI response per RECIST. T1-T0 variations of 852 RFs and 6 SI indices were challenged into machine learning-based predictive models. RFs pre-processing included redundant featu res elimination training/test. Resulting delta-radiomic ( R), immune/inflammatory ( I) and integrated ( Int) models were compared based on performance metr ics. Results or Findings: Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were (95%CI, (95%CI, patients were responders and 58 (63%) non- responders. A model validation calibrated at up to 10 parameters, 5 delta-RFs and delta-LDH was built according to ROC-AUC scores and adopted for R, I and Int models. ROC-AUC and accuracy (\u00b1SD) were 0.86 (\u00b1 (\u00b10.09) and 0.67 (\u00b10.09) for I model. Int model 0.88 (\u00b1 Conclusion: dynamic blood-radiomic predictor of ICI efficacy in advanced NSCLC suggests that current predictive models might be implemented by non- invasive interception of systemic and local events critically implicated in cancer evolution.

Antol\u00edn Redondo*, M. Ligero, E. Garralda, E. Escobar, R. Perez Lopez; Barcelona/ES (antolin.andreu@gmail.com) Purpose: To assess the rate of differential response between lesions in patients with metastatic lung cancer treated with i mmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through a radiomics analysis of CT images at best response and progressive disease timepoints. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 102 lesions corresponding to 42 patients with metastatic lung c ancer treated with ICIs were included. Lesions were semi-automatically segmented using 3DSlicer at baseline and follow-up contrast-enhanced-CT corresponding to best-response and disease-progression. Volume change was calculat ed per lesion from baseline CT to both timepoints. Differential response was defined as co- existence of lesions with volume increase or decrease (+30%/-20%) at same timepoint or volume decrease of 1 lesions with appearance of new lesions. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitn ey U-test and Pearson's chi-squared test for quantitative and categorical v ariables respectively, with significance at p<0.05. Results or Findings: Differential response occurred in 31% of the patients (13/42) at the time of progressive disease. However , there was already a differential response trend in 4 patients at best r esponse timepoint while considered stable-disease (2/4) and partial-respons e (2/4) by RECIST 1.1. Higher number of lesions, total volume and number of organs affected associated with differential response (p<0.05). Conclusion: This study proves the existence of differential res ponse in patients with metastatic lung cancer treated with I CIs, which may limit the clinical efficacy of this therapy due to heterogeneous response. Therefore, the extraction of imaging biomarkers in these patients should not consider general response as an indicator; instead, there should be a move towards personalised analysis per lesion or organ cluster. Limitations: The small number of patients with multiple lesions (n<30) reduces statistical power. Ethics committee approval: The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Need for informed consent for computational analysis was waived. Funding for this study: M.L. is funded by the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Methods or Background: A cohort of 98 pathologically diagnosed SCLC patients underwent whole-body MRI, FDG-PET/CT and c onventional staging methods. TNM and VALSG stages were determined by a tumour board. All PET/MRIs were generated by means of our proprietary software. Each factor, TNM and VALSG stage were then evaluated by means of consensus reading. Kappa statistics were determined for evaluations of agreements for each clinical stage between each method and final diagnosis. Finally, diagnostic accuracy of TNM and VALSG stage evaluations were st atistically compared among all methods by using McNemar's test. Results or Findings: Agreements for each factor, TNM stage and VALSG stage were determined as substantial or almost perf ect (0.67 0.94, p<0.0001). Accuracies (88.8%) (86.7%) were significantly higher PET/CT (77.6%: vs MRI, p=0.001; vs PET/MRI, p=0.004) and methods (72.4%: vs p<0.0001; vs PET/MRI, p=0.0001). In VALSG stage (95.9%), PET/MRI (95. 9 %) and PET/CT (98.0%) were significantly higher than that of conv entional staging methods (82.7%: vs MRI and vs PET/MRI, p=0.0005; vs PET/CT, p<0.0001).

Author Disclosures: Kazuhiro Murayama: Grant Recipient: Canon Medical Yui: Employee: Purpose: To explore the feasibility of radiomic analysis bas ed on computed tomography (CT) plain scan and biphasic contrast-en hanced differentiation of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytom a (PSP) from atypical lung cancer. Methods or Background: The chest CT image data (plain scan, arterial phase and venous phase) of 67 patients with PSP and 58 pa tients with atypical lung cancer were collected. The tumour lesions in CT images were manually delineated, and obtained the regions of interest. T he two sample t-test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were applied to the most discriminative features selected. Using the hold-out method, the original set was randomly divided into training dataset (70% ) and testing dataset (30%) (the proportion of two group patients in the traini ng and testing datasets was similar). The feature selection and model training were performed based on the training dataset and three machine learning classif ication models were constructed, including random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). The diagnostic performance of the models in testing dataset were validated by the area under receiver o perate curve (AUC). Results or Findings: We got the best LR classification model with 0.89 accuracy (AUC=0.85) by 9 discriminative features selected based on arterial phase image. Combining the plain and contrast-enhanced features, the LR model got the best performance with 0.73 accuracy ( AUC=0.79). Conclusion: This study indicated that the radiomic analysis met hod has a high application value in differentiating PSP from atypi cal lung cancer.

Lennartz*, M. Sch\u00f6neck, T. Struck, N. Gro\u00dfe D. Zopfs, T. Persigehl; Cologne/DE Purpose: of metastatic and be nign lung nodules in cancer patients using radiomics in a large cancer patient cohort. Methods or Background: 537 cancer patients who received contrast- enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest were retrospectively included in this singlecentre study. The dataset included thin-slice reconstructions in the lung window derived from mul tiple CT scanner types. 1135 lung metastases CT follow- up imaging, histopathology or FDG-PET/CT and 426 benign lung no dules confirmed by either histopathology or follow-up CT were included. Semi-automated segmentations of lung were performed. After image resampling and pre-processing, 118 radiomic features were extracte d using PyRadiomics. Lesions were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. Powerful features for lung nodule differentiation were selec ted by means of ANOVA f- test and mutual information and redundant features were excluded by correlation analysis. After feature normalisation, model training was performed with 5-fold cross validation; the best performing m odel was evaluated on the test dataset. Model performance was evaluated using the balanced accuracy score (BAS), F1 score and sensitivity. Results or Findings: A random forest classifier using features selected based on mutual information yielded the best performance in differentiating metastatic from benign lung nodules (BAS: 0.75, F1 score: 0.78, sensitivity: 0.78). When applied to the test set, the model attained a BAS of 0.71, an F1 score of 0.75, and a sensitivity of 0.75. Conclusion: Radiomics-based differentiation between benign and metastatic lung nodules in contrast-enhanced CT is feasible. W e found satisfactory model performance in a large retrospective, multi-scanner cohort.

Katulska; Poznan/PL RPS 717-2 Deep-learning based reconstruction for multiphase C T angiography: a rapid method for diagnosis and prognosis of acute i schaemic stroke can provide sensitive time-variant blood flow information of culprit vessel and collat eral circulation for patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). We aim to compar e the usefulness of colour-coded and conventional mCTA for stroke detec tion and prognosis evaluation of patients with AIS. Methods or Background: Consecutive patients with anterior circulation AIS were reviewed at our stroke centre. Baseline collat eral scores of colour-coded mCTA and conventional mCTA were evaluated by a 6-point scale. The imaging to reporting time and detection of \"delayed vessel sign\" regarding the two mCTA methods were recorded. Receiver operating char acteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive value of colour-coded and conventional mCTA for a favourable outcome of AIS. Results or Findings: A total of 127 patients were included in our study. Patients with favourable prognoses were correlated with abundant collateral circulations on both colour-coded and conventional mCTA (both P < 0.05). Compared with that of the conventional method, the imaging to reporting time of colour-coded mCTA was shorter (186 \u00b1 192 secs). While colour-coded might to the precise d etection of \"delayed vessel sign\" in 17 cases with almost \"normal\" manif estations on conventional mCTA, ROC curves revealed that colour-coded and conventional mCTA achieved similar performance (P = 0.427) in prognos is evaluation. Conclusion: Radiologists can rapidly detect \"delayed vessel sign\" and reach high diagnostic accuracy when interpreting colour-c oded mCTA images. Colour-coded mCTA provides equivalent prognostic information with less time consumption when comparing with that of conventional mCTA in stroke imaging. Limitations: The heterogeneity of baseline stroke severity and t ime windows in our retrospective study might lead to selection bias.

Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the first scanner integrated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm t o detect brain haemorrhages in a clinical routine setting. Methods or Background: This retrospective study includes 435 consecutive non-contrast head CT scans. Automatic brain haemorr hage detection was calculated inline as a separate reconstruction job in all cases. The radiological report, always created by a radiology resident and finalised by a senior radiologist, served as reference. Results or Findings: Brain haemorrhage detection was executed successful ly in 432 out of 435 patient images. The AI algorithm and reference standard were consistent in 392 (90.7%) of cases. The diagnostic performance was calculated as sensitivity 98.1% (95% CI, 94.3%-100% ), predictive value (NPV) 99.7% (95% CI, 99.1%-100%). There was a single false negative case with a very small lesi on of 0.4x0.2 mm. Conclusion: Execution of scanner integrated AI detection of bra in haemorrhage is fast and stable. The diagnostic accuracy has a high specificity and a very high negative predictive value and sensi tivity. However, many false positive findings resulted in rather moderate posit ive predictive value. The limited image quality in the emergency setting by p ositioning and compliance problems may be the reason for this relative low outcome. Limitations: This study could be limited by the number of only 2 radiologists reviewing the images as the reference standard.

Segeroth*, Basel/CH Purpose: To investigate if fluctuations in polytrauma-CT sca n occurrence are related to weather changes and thus predictable. Methods or Background: Due to the unpredictability of emergency examinations, any approach for estimation would improve resource planning in a hospital. All polytrauma-CTs between 1.1.2011 and 31.12.2020 (n = 4613) were retrieved from the radiological information sy stem. Daily local weather data was downloaded from meteoblue.com. To account for the increase of the maximum number of polytrauma-CTs per day (2011: 4 t o 2020: 11) and meteorological weather changes, all data were normalised (subtraction of mean and division by the difference between maximum and mean of the corresponding year). Data was smoothened using the moving average of the preceding 15 days. Above normal number of daily pCT was defined as above median. Logistic regression analysis was used as a prediction model. Results or Findings: A significant seasonal change in polytrauma-CTs in the winter compared to summer months was observed (norm alised median fewer polytrauma-CTs in the lowe r temperature quartile compared to the upper temperature quartile (normali sed 0.39), sunshine duration (r = 0.34) and ultra- violet amount (r = 0.35) correlated positively, wind velocity (r = -0.39) an d clouds (r = -0.22) negatively with polytrauma-CT occurrence (correlations were si gnificant p < 0.001). The diagnostic performance of the prediction model for identification of days with above normal number of polytrauma-CTs achieved an a rea under the curve of 0.74 (p < 0.0001) with a specificity of 71% and a s ensitivity of 68%. Conclusion: Using weather data, it is possible to partially predict normal or above normal daily number of polytrauma-CTs and thus improve resource planning. Limitations: Retrospective study.

Tam*; Cardiff/UK (telex@wstam.uk) Purpose: A literature review was presented at ECR 2020, whic h revealed that abdominal x-rays (AXR) performed for the accident and emergency department (A+E), had low sensitivity and high rates of further imaging and non-alignment to the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) justification guidelines. A single-site audit was performed to investigate the current practice. Methods or Background: An audit was performed at the largest A+E in Wales, in accordance with the RCR audit guidelines. All the AXR requests from A+E, regardless of the patient's age, within the 28 days period commencing 17th November 2021, were retrospectively assessed. Non-A+E patients and abandoned examinations due to uncooperative patient s were excluded. Results or Findings: The total number of AXR requests received by the A+ E imaging department was 169, with 28/169 falling int o the exclusion criteria. Of the 141 included requests, five unjustified request s were correctly rejected; the remaining 136 requests were accepted and subsequent ly performed. However, only 115/136 had justified indications. The most common justified and unjustified indications were obstruction and renal stones, respectively. Additionally, 45/136 patients had further imaging, with CT being the most popular modality. Only 4% of reported AXR had non-f oreign body abnormalities. Conclusion: The small proportion of significant findings agreed with previous studies, suggesting a significant AXR overuse. Over 80% of non-compliant requests were performed, and awareness of the justi fication guidelines can be increased by clinical governance, posters, or an al gorithm previously presented. However, the 32.4 % further imaging rate , as opposed to the 73.7% reported previously, merits attention. Stopping the overuse of AXR can minimise the radiation dose received and relieve the mounting pressure in imaging and reporting, which can serve other patien ts who would benefit from the services otherwise. Limitations: Single-centre study limits the validity of the result. Going forward, a multi-centre study and a re-audit after implement ing the interventions mentioned are warranted.

Methods or Background: Abdominal MRI studies, performed for the clinical suspicion of IH of pregnant patients with a history of RYGB, were analysed by two abdominal radiologists. Both readers independently evaluated the T2 HASTE sequences to determine the presence or absenc e of IH. Diagnostic performance of T2 HASTE MRI was evaluated compared to the clinical diagnosis of IH as the gold standard. Results or Findings: The results in this study, with 16 patients with IH and 15 patients without IH, portray a high accuracy for th e detection of IH, ranging from 88.0% to 90.3%. A high NPV (86.7%-100.0%), sensitivity (88.9%-100.0%) and specificity (80.0%-86.7%). This study also port rayed a substantial interobserver agreement (0.741) for the evaluation of IH. Conclusion: T2 HASTE MRI shows an excellent sensitivity and NPV for the detection of IH in pregnant patients. Fast acquisit ion time makes this sequence useful in the emergency setting, and it can be used for the diagnosis or exclusion of IH in pregnant patients. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 183 Limitations: First, our sample size was rather small. Second, reader bias cannot be avoided as our readers had a high suspici on for internal herniation in this sample. Third, little is known about the MRI f indings in asymptomatic patients with a (recent) history of RYGB. Finally, we should address the retrospective nature of our study of patients that did not undergo surgical exploration, indicating possible verification bias.

L. Urbano*, C. Mendon\u00e7a, B. Silva, J. B. Lei t\u00e3o, J. R. Inacio; Lisbon/PT (mluisa.urbano@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate if there is a correlation between the extent of pulmonary parenchymal disease and the presence of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included all COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) from June 2020 to January 2021, who underwent computed tomography pul monary angiography due to pulmonary embolism (PE) suspicion. In total, 224 patients with COVID- 19 and suspected PE were classified into two groups based on the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism. All patients were categorised in absence or presence of pulmonary parenchymal disease extent in 25% intervals. Results or Findings: The study cohort consisted of 211 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, 118 male and 89 female, with mean age 6 8.7\u00b116.5. The extent of pulmonary disease was 0% in 13 (6%), 1-25% in 84 (39%), in 13 Pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed in 40/211 (19%) patient s, with 18/40 (45%) patients showing small vessel PE. The mean age in P E group was 73.4\u00b112 versus 67.6\u00b117,2 in the non PE group (p = 0,015). T here was no difference in the extent of pulmonary disease between PE and non PE groups (p = 0.49). Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, the extent of the pulmonary disease was not correlated with the presence of PE. Limitations: Our study has some limitations. It is a retrospecti ve single-centre and chart review study. We only included patients a dmitted in the ED, and cannot infer whether these results can be applied t o the whole COVID population with PE suspicion. Previous CT exams wer e not evaluated to differentiate the parenchymal abnormalities from pr e-existent parenchymal changes.

Methods or Background: The European Society of Emergency Radiology ran an online workshop on the topic of blunt trauma CT via a video conferencing service. Thirty delegates spanning 18 countries wer e given access to online links to cases via the DICOM viewer, Pacsbin, which they could scroll through in real time during the workshop. Interactive discu ssion was encouraged throughout. The teaching method was evaluated using online quiz before and after the workshop took place, comprising of 10 of the same knowledge-based questions aligned to the learning objectives. They were also asked to rate their level of confidence in reporting blunt trauma CT us ing a five-point scale. 21 delegates completed the quiz before the workshop an d 27 after. Results or Findings: Following the workshop, 74% (20/27) that took the q uiz stated that they felt either \"very confident' or \"e xtremely confident\", compared to 35% (7/20) describing these levels of confidence before the workshop (39% increase, p = 0.03). The average quiz score from th e knowledge-based questions improved from 77% of the pre-workshop qui z to 92% of the post workshop quiz (15% increase, p = 0.15). Conclusion: This evaluation demonstrates the potential of using software with screen-sharing capabilities and an online DICOM viewer to deliver interactive teaching to an international audience. This is likely to have an increasingly integral role in medical, and notably radiological, education. Limitations: Small sample. No paired comparison between delegate s before and after the workshop due to the method of data collection. Repeated testing may have influenced quiz results. Ethics committee approval: Not required.

Moderator J. J. F\u00fctterer; Nijmegen/NL RPS 707-2 The first 5 targeted trans-perineal prostate biopsi es diagnose the majority of PROMIS criteria cancer in patients with a Likert 4 or 5 score on mpMRI *W. M. Stevens*\u00b9, E. Adiotomre\u00b2, O. if the first 5 trans-perineal (TP) biopsies give a diagnosis of PROMIS criteria cancer in patients with a likely pr ostate cancer on mpMRI. Methods or Background: NICE guidelines suggest multiple prostate biopsies for histological diagnosis of cancer in those patients with a Likert 4 or 5 score on their mpMRI scan. Depending on the treatment pla nned, some patients need systematic TP biopsy, but in frail patients, t hose with limited treatment options or extensive disease, a cancer diagnosis may be all that is required. 375 patients had an mpMRI for suspected prostate cancer between January and June of 2021 in a large volume quaternary centr e. 367 were given a Likert score of which 108 were scored Likert 4 or 5. Of these, 94 patients were sent for biopsy. 70 of the biopsied patients were ultimately diagnosed with PROMIS criteria cancer. A separate pot was sent containing the first 2-5 targeted biopsies in 69 of the 70. Results or Findings: The median number of biopsies in all patients sent for biopsy was 12 (range 3-19). The first 2-5 targeted biopsies showed PROMIS criteria cancer in 65 of the 69 (94.2%) Likert 4 and 5 patients diagnosed with cancer. 62/69 (89.9%) showed the maximum length or grade of cancer in the first 2-5 targeted biopsies. All 4 of the missed cancers were ISUP 2 or less and located in the apex of the gland. Conclusion: A cancer diagnosis is usually obtained in the first 2-5 targeted biopsies in patients with a Likert score of 4 or 5. Further biopsies may be required for treatment planning or for lesions in t he apex of the gland where cancers can be missed. Limitations: This was a single-centre observational study.

Methods or Background: 5 experienced reporters in a quaternary referral unit used a standardised reporting template to prospecti vely collect PI-RADS and Likert scores for all mpMRI querying prostate cancer between January and June 2021. The histology results were recorded for those patients who proceeded to a transperineal biopsy. Results or Findings: 367 of the total 375 patients were allocated a PI-R ADS and a Likert score. The number of PI-RADS scores th at were changed to a different Likert score varied between reporters (3. 3%, 21.7%, 23.5%, 26.9%, 47.3%). The median PI-RADS score was 3 and the medi an Likert score was 2. The number of equivocal \"3\" scores given was halved in Likert (13.9%) compared with PI-RADS (26.2%). Assuming a protocol in which all patients scoring 3 or above were advised to proceed to biops y, fewer patients scored with Likert (43.3%) than with PI-RADS (59.4%) would have been so advised (59 fewer patients). Using the same assumption, the predicted biopsy yield improved when Likert scores were used (48.4%) inste ad of PI-RADS (35.3%). The number of clinically significant cancers (ISUP 3-5) who were scored 1 or 2 (very unlikely or unlikely to have cancer) was the same (0.3%) whether PI- RADS or Likert was used. Conclusion: PI-RADS and Likert were not the same for any report er. The Likert score had several outcome advantages compare d with PI-RADS. Limitations: This was a single unit study. Cases not randomised. The numbers of scans reported by each reporter varied. Cancer outcomes were only verified in biopsied patients.

Van Stiphout*\u00b9, H. \u00b2Nijmegen/NL (R.vanstiphout@lzr.nl) Purpose: In succession to our award-winning presentation on the ECR 2020 we present our expierence and results of the in-bor e robot assisted MRI guided target biopsy (MRGB) of the prostate in 500 cases. Methods or Background: Men with elevated PSA levels (>/= 3 ng/ml) are at risk for prostate cancer and will undergo a mpMRI of the prostate. Suspicious lesions are graded according to PIRADS v2.0 classif ication. In patients advised (EAU). Systemati c TRUS biopsy has been the standard for years with a higher risk of sepsis (4%). How accurate and feasible is target biopsy using the Robot controlled manipulator from Soteria Medical to detect high grade prostate cancer? Results or Findings: This method is as feasible and accurate as manually MRGB, though much faster. Our results are equal to the results found in recent literature. By the beginning of 2022, we are able t o analyse the data of 500 cases. We will discuss the role of target biopsy compared to TRUS biopsy and the literature about the combination of both method s. The robot-assisted method can be considered in small lesions (<10 mm), lesions in hard to reach locations for TRUS biopsy, such as anteriorly or laterally located lesions and in patients with very high suspicion on high grade pro state cancer and repeatedly negative TRUS biopsies. Conclusion: Robot-assisted MRGB is as feasible and accurate as manual MRGB. It is of great help in hard to reach lesions and small lesions and in patients with repeatedly negative TRUS biopsies. It has much lower risk of sepsis or bleeding. Limitations: Patients should be MRI-compatible and be able to li e down in a prone position.

Methods or Background: 175 retrospectively and 30 prospectively identified and histopathologically proven PCa patients underwe nt pretherapeutic multiparametric MRI, structured reporting and rPx. Data collection, image annotation and machine learning-based analysis were conducted on the cloud- based \"International Radiomics Platform\" (IRP) as a n initiative of the German and Austrian radiological societies. Conventional i maging biomarkers (PI- RADS, mean ADC), selected MR-based radiomics featur es and clinical (digital rectal examination, PSA density (PSAD)) as well as pathological data (ISUP grade, T-status) were used to predict therapy decis ion parameters (nerve- sparing surgery) and R-status. Repeated 5-fold cros s validation was performed to test robustness of the results. Results or Findings: In total, 112 of the 205 included patients received nerve- sparing surgery and 34 of 205 showed positive resec tion margins (R1). A signature of 16 multimodal features atus after rPx with an 0.61 sur gery with an AUC of 0.69 (p<0.01), compared to a combination of mean ADC, PI -RADS and PSAD with an AUC of 0.55 and 0.53, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, the feasibility of an integrated, machine- learning based analysis of multimodal medical data on the IRP could be demonstrated. Broadly available multimodal data com bined with quantitative image analysis and structured reporting can be used to support risk stratification and surgical planning of primary PCa patients. Limitations: The small number of patients with R1-status and the lack of an external validation cohort were identified as limit ations.

Methods or Background: 142 patients with clinical suspicion of PCa underwent 1.5T or 3T biparametric prostate MRI with various scanner types (n=7) in different institutions (n=14) and exhibite d suspicious lesions PI- RADS 3 in peripheral or transitional zones. Whole-gland prostate and index lesion segmentations were performed semi-automatically on T2w- and diffusion-weighted images. 1482 quantitative morphologic, shape, texture, and intensity-based imaging features were calculated to assess the impact of a radiomics signature for non-invasive prediction of PCa aggressiveness. Several bias mitigation techniques were applied and robustness of results was evaluated. Performance was compared with mean ADC ( mADC), PI-RADS scores and PSA density (PSAD). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 185 Results or Findings: Discriminative potential of radiomics machine learning approaches (mean AUCs from 0.77 to 0.84) to differe ntiate clinically significant PCa from clinically insignificant PCa or benign les ions was comparable to clinical assessment using PI-RADS scoring (AUC=0.78), (AUC=0.72) and PSAD of datasets demonstrated high performance variability even when employing advanced mitigation techniques for the high-dimensional feature space a nd inherent class imbalance. Conclusion: The clinical applicability of radiomics models on s uspicious prostate lesions in a heterogeneous dataset is limi ted because of low robustness and high variations of results. Radiomic s did not reliably improve clinical decision-making compared to conventional i maging biomarkers. Feature variability, robustness and reproducibility of radiomics-based measures should be addressed more transparently in future research to enable broad clinical application.

Messina*, S. Cipollari, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based analysis pipeline for the classification of prostate MRI ima ge quality. Methods or Background: Prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is technically demanding, requiring high image quality. An automated method to identify diagnostically inadequate images could help optimise image quality. 316 mpMRI scans and 312 men were retrospectively enrolled. MRI scans were reviewed by three experienced genitourinary radiologists. Sequences were labelled as high quali ty (Q1) or low quality (Q0) and used as the reference standard for all analyses . Sequences were split into training, validation, and testing sets (869, 250, a nd 120 sequences, respectively). Following preprocessing and data augmentation, 28 CNNs were trained. Model performance was assessed on both a p er-slice and a per- sequence basis. A pairwise t-test was performed to compare performances of the classifiers. Results or Findings: The number of sequences labelled as Q0 or Q1 was 38 vs 278 for T2WI, 43 vs 273 for DWI, 41 vs 275 for A DC, and 38 vs 253 for DCE. Interreader agreement was almost perfect for T 2WI and DCE and substantial for DWI and ADC. On the per-slice sis, DWI, and 92.31% 0.00% for ADC. The t hree best algorithms performed significantly better than the remaining o nes on every sequence (p- value < 0.05). Conclusion: CNNs achieved high accuracy in classifying prostate MRI image quality on an individual-slice basis and almost per fect accuracy when classifying the entire sequences. Limitations: A relatively small sample size was used for training. The CNNs were trained on images acquired on a singl e MR scanner and protocol.

Bleker*\u00b9, T. Kwee\u00b9, D. C. Purpose: To determine value of a deep learning masked (D LM) auto-fixed volume of interest (VOI) segmentation method as an alternative to manual segmentation for radiomics-based diagnosis of clini cally significant (CS) prostate cancer (PCa) on biparametric magnetic reso nance imaging (bpMRI). Methods or Background: This study included a retrospective multicentre dataset of 524 PCa lesions (of which 204 CS PCa) on bpMRI. All lesions were both semi-automatically segmented with a DLM auto-f ixed VOI method (averaging <10 seconds per lesion) and manually segmented by an expert uroradiologist (average 5 minutes per lesion). The DLM auto-fixed VOI method uses a spherical VOI (with its centre at the locati on of the lowest apparent diffusion coefficient of the prostate lesion as indicated with a single mouse- click) from which non-prostate voxels are removed using a deep learning based prostate segmentation algorithm. Thirteen dif ferent DLM auto-fixed VOI diameters (ranging from 6 to 30 mm) were explored. Extracted radiomics data were split into training and test sets (4:1 ratio). Performance was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results or Findings: In the test set, the area under the ROC curve (AUCs ) of the DLM auto-fixed VOI method with mm (0.76 [95% CI: 0.66 - 0.85]) was significantly higher (p=0.0198) t han that of the manual segmentation CI: 0.52-0.73]). Conclusion: a pot entially more accurate radiomics diagnosis of CS PCa than ex pert manual segmentation while also reducing expert time invest ment by more than 97%.

The purpose of this study is to describe the imaging findings and frequency of i ntracranial extension of sino-nasal mucormycosis. Methods or Background: A retrospective study was done using a tertiary ENT referral hospital using the HIS search system. Over a 24-month period from January 2020 to December 2021, 50 patients wer e admitted and treated with rhinocerebral mucor mycosis. For all patients, multiple PNS CT scans were available during their hospital course and all had at least one brain MRI. Demographic data, COVID-19 status and underlying di sease were recorded. Imaging findings indicating intracranial spread wer e recorded. Results or Findings: In 12 (24%) patients evidence of intracranial extension was present. This included 5 patients with positive COVID-19 PCR test and 7 with negative PCR test. Imaging findings include cerebritis presenting as T2 hyperintensity of frontal lobe cortex and subcortic al white matter in 5 patients, extension to cavernous sinus and cavernous sinus th rombosis in 2 patient, ICA occlusion in 2 patients, frontal lobe meningeal enhancement in 2 patients, and parenchymal haemorrhage in one. Conclusion: A relatively high percentage (24%) of rhinocerebral mucor mycosis can extend intracranially despite timely eatment. Despite the recent surge of mucor mycosis, intracranial extension is n ot significantly different in patients with positive PCR. Limitations: Number of intracranial extension was low for generalisations. Later a meta-analysis can be helpful. Also there ar e too many confounding factors to control for between the two groups.

Makai*, F. Kakuja, Z. Fejes, P. Nagy, Z. T. Kincses; Szeged/HU (makaieszter8@gmail.com) Purpose: There is an increasing evidence that tissue rigidit y as measured by elastography may aid the differentiation of thyroid tumorous and benign nodules. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) in the diagnostic algorithm of nodular thyroid disease. Methods or Background: Ultrasonography was used to determine the size of the nodules, the distance from the surface and the EU-TIRADS classification. Standard approach was used for SWE measurements cyt ological samples from FNAB were evaluated according to the 2017 Bethesda criteria. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to generate facto rs for pathological abnormalities and radiological data, their relationship was analysed by Pearson correlation. Results or Findings: 63 patients with thyroid nodules were included (mean age 60.4 year). 62% of the nodules were EU-TIRADS c ategory III. The mean elasticity of the nodules was 31.6 kPa (\u00b110.7). Col loid content explained most of the variability in the pathological factor gener ated by PCA and the mean elasticity in the radiological factor. There was al so significant correlation between pathological and radiological factors (p = 0.023). Conclusion: Here we showed that a set of radiological measures can reliably predict the pathological picture of thyroid nodules , the most important of which is the elasticity. Rigid structure of the malignant nodules may indicate cell-rich areas, helping to localise the site of FNAB, and may reduce the number of non- diagnostic and unnecessary FNABs. Limitations: Increasing the size of the patient population could further improve the statistical power.

Li; Kunming/CN (wave.forever@yeah.net) Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of identifying the occu rrence and development of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) 2 diabetes mellitus using Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw). Methods or Background: 28 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI +) in T2DM, 8 patients without mild cognitive impairment (MCI -) in T2DM and 11 normal control (NC) subjects were included. APTw was performed in patients with T2DM and evaluated by the multiple field cogni tive function scale. APTw signal intensity(SI) (%) of hippocampus in three gr oups and the APTw SI (%) of the hippocampus were analysed. The correlation of A PTw SI and multiple field cognitive function scale was analysed by Pearson analysis correlation in MCI+ group. Results or Findings: The APTw SI (%) of left hippocampal head, left hippocampal body and right hippocampal tail were st atistically different among three groups (P < 0.05). SVF score was positively c orrelated with APTw SI (%) in left hippocampal head of MCI+ group (rho = 0.414 , P 0.044) , TMT-A score was negatively correlated with APTw SI (%) in left hippocampal tail of MCI+ group (rho = -0.333, P = 0.021), AVLT-H (delaye mem ory) scores were correlated with SI (%) in left hipp ocampal tail of MCI+ group (rho = -0.376, P = 0.000 ). Conclusion: Findings suggestive of the progression of MCI were found from the APTw SI in different regions of hippocampus. AP Tw technique may be a noninvasive and potential imaging biomarker for DAC D of T2DM at molecular imaging level. Limitations: This study only measured the APTw SI in hippocampus , but not in other brain regions.

Mournet, T. Sene, Purpose: To assess the impact of timing from visual symptoms ' onset to diffusion-weighted (DW) 3T MRI completion to detect ischaemic changes of the optic disc and optic nerve in AION patients. Methods or Background: This IRB-approved retrospective single-centre study included 3T MRI data from 126 patients with A ION and 111 controls with optic neuritis treated between January 2015 and May 2020. Two radiologists blinded to all data, individually analysed imaging. A senior neuroradiologist resolved any discrepancies by consensus. The primar y judgment criterion was the restricted diffusion of the optic disc and/or t he optic nerve assessed subjectively on the ADC maps. ADC values were also measured. Spearman rank correlations were used to examine the relationships between timing from visual symptoms' onset to MRI completion and both t he restricted diffusion and the ADC values. Results or Findings: 126 patients (47/126 [37.3%] women and 79/126 [62.7%] men, mean age 69.1 +/- 13.7 years) with AIO N were included. Restricted diffusion of the optic disc in AION eyes was more frequent in the early MRI group than in the late MRI group: 35/49 ( 71.4%) eyes versus 3/83 (3.6%) eyes, p<0.001. ADC values of the pathological optic discs and optic nerves were lower in the early MRI group than in th e late MRI group: 0.61 good diagnostic performance to detec t AION when performed early after the onset of visual symptoms. Limitations: The limitation was the monocentric study design in a tertiary centre specialised in ophthalmological diseases. 3T MRI is not available everywhere. No use of high-resolution DWI.

Boyken, in after multiple exposures to Gd-based contrast agents (GBCAs) has been part of i ntensive research in recent years. While most studies investigated Gd pr esence in brain, Gd was similarly observed in skin and other organs. The current animal study investigated all marketed extracellular GBCAs and evaluated the skin of rat foot pads for Gd presence and neuro-histological changes after repeated administration of GBCAs. Methods or Background: Rats received 8 gadodiamide, gadobenate, mmol Gd/kg body weight or saline. Animals were sacrificed 5 weeks p.i., the amount of Gd was measured by induct ively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The quantification of the intrae pidermal nerve fiber density in the footpad was determined by PGP9.5 immunofluor escent staining and automated image analysis which was performed in bli nded fashion by an external provider. Results or Findings: The concentrations of Gd [nmol/g] in the skin were highest for linear followed by gadopentetate [0.080\u00b10.01] and gadoterate gr oup contained 0.024\u00b10.01 nmol Gd/g tissue. Quantitative analysis detected ap proximately 15 nerve fibers/mm in the lower epidermis of the footpads of all groups with no significant differences between them. Conclusion: In the current animal study using a multiple dosing regimen and an examination 5 weeks after last GBCA administrati on, there were no signs of small fiber neuropathy in the skin of the footpads.

Our aim was to compare image quality of a novel mobCT to stationary scanne rs for patients at a Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Methods or Background: From November 2020 to April 2021 all patients examined by brain CT on a mobCT (Somatom On.site, S iemens Healthineers) at a tertiary referral center for neurosurgery were included if they had at least one stationary CT examination during the same hospi talisation. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 188 Quantitative image quality parameters included attenuation (HU) and noise (1SD) in four predefined regions of interest (ROIs) , as well as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between grey and whiter matter. Subject ive image quality was rated by two neuroradiology fellows and two senior neuroradiologists blinded to scanner parameters. Results or Findings: MobCT images had significantly higher noise in all ROIs and lower CNR compared to images from stationary CT scanners. The mobCT images had lower subjective quality rating (mean 2. 1) than stationary CT images (mean 2.4). Two of the raters favoured the s tationary CT images, whereas one rater neutral and one rater slightl y favoured the mobCT images. The prevalence of grade 1 (poor image quali ty) when rating overall image quality was 14% for mobCT images compared to 8% for the stationary CT images. Conclusion: Point-of-care imaging by mobCT was successfully per formed with few examinations rated as poor image quality. The q uantitative and qualitative image quality parameters favoured stationary CT, but the differences were generally small, and the advantages of point-of-car e imaging may potentially outweigh the small reduction in image quality. Limitations: Only one mobC was studied in this single centre study. All patients had severe intracranial pathology, lim iting generalisation to other groups.

Methods or Background: 58 SD rats were selected for MCAO treatment. Ten rats were selected for MRI before and after oxygen challenge at 1h, 3h, 6h and 12h, and the T1 values and T1 rate in different brain regions were measured. Twenty-four MCAO rats were selected for oxygen chal lenge treatment at the above time points, and another 24 MCAO rats were tr eated with no oxygen challenge. HE staining and immunohistochemistry wer e performed before and after oxygen challenge. The expression of RACK1 protein was statistically analysed, and the correlation between protein expression and relaxation value was analysed. Results or Findings: The expression of RACK1 protein in the cerebral ischaemic area at different time points before and after oxygen challenge showed a downward trend, and the expression of RACK 1 was higher than that before oxygen inhalation. The difference was statis tically significant, P <0.05. There is a positive correlation between the express ion of RACK1 protein and T1 value. Conclusion: Oxygen challengeMRI can be used to determine the ox ygen metabolism in the brain tissue of rats after infarc tion. The oxygen challenge MRI T1 value and T1 change rate can help to identif y the ischaemic penumbra of MCAO rats. Oxygen stimulation may delay the development of cerebral ischaemia; the expression of RACK1 plays a protecti ve role in acute cerebral ischaemia and is related to the development of hypoxia in brain tissue.

M. El-Mossly*, A. Abdel Latif, H. Abdelkader Ah med, S. R. R. Hanna, S. A. Mohammad; Cairo/EG (dollyelmossly@yahoo.com) Purpose: To demonstrate functional and anatomical alteration s following endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) by using, PC -MRI and bFFE sequences in relation to clinical outcome. Methods or Background: This is a prospective study including twenty patien ts with hydrocephalus who recently underwent ETV. Pati ents underwent MRI- study within first postoperative week; and they wer e followed clinically after procedure (mean=8.6 months). In addition to convent ional MR sequences, mid-sagittal 3D-bFFE sequence (at plane of third ve ntriculostomy); and axial/sagittal PC-MRI were acquired with CSF flow quantitative analysis by using \"2D Q-flow\" PC-MR angiography software on Phi lips MR-workstation. Three-month follow-up MRI was available in 5 patients. Results or Findings: The overall ETV success and failure rates were 70% and 30%, respectively. There was statistically significant association between flow identification in PC-MRI sequence with the pat ients' late clinical outcome (P<0.001). Functional patency by PC-MRI was more se nsitive in the radiographic prediction of early ETV clinical outcome than the anatomical patency by 3D-bFFE sequence (83.3% and33.3% sensiti vity respectively). All CSF quantitative flow data (peak systolic velocity, peak diatolic velocity, absolute stroke volume, forward flow and backward f low) had a statistically significant association (P<0.001) with late clinical outcome except for regurgitation fraction and ventriculostomy AP-diameter. Patients with successful clinical outcome who underwent follow-up MRI (4 patients) showed increased most of CSF parameters in their follow-up MRI compared to the only failed ETV. Conclusion: Whenever there is agreement between functional and anatomical patency, clinical success was the outcome. While in case of functional- anatomical mismatch, functional patency had a stron ger contribution to clinical outcome, however correlation between them is of ult imate importance. CSF flow quantification in early post-operative study c an predict early ETV failure, also the follow-up parameters can do. Limitations: The limitations are the small sample size and short follow up period due to COVID-19. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Amorim; Madrid/ES Purpose: The purpose of this study is (1) to describe the di fferent types of tumours and characteristics in which intraoperative MRI (IOMR) was performed in our centre, (2) to evaluate the frequency of tum our remnants detection, (3) to evaluate the impact of tumour remnant detection on the surgical approach, (4) to describe the type and rate of complications dete cted by IOMRI. Methods or Background: Settings and anatomopathological and surgical reports of intracr anial tumours operated with the assistance of IOMR were reviewed from February 2019 to January 2021. Statistical methods: Descriptive analysis of the fo llowing variables was performed: type of tumour, extension of the surgery according to the evidence of tumour remnant and complications evidenced in the IOMRI. The association between the presence of tumour remnant evidenced in the IOMRI and the extension of the surgery in the same surgical time was evaluated by a bivariate descriptive study. Results or Findings: 42 patients were included in the study. In 32 (76.2%) cases tumour remnant was detected on IOMRI of which in 30 (71.4%), surgery was extended to optimise the surgical result. Surgi cal complications were identified in 8 (19%) patients, 5 of which were isc haemic and 3 hemorrhagic. None of them had significant clinical repercussions . Conclusion: Intraoperative brain MRI is a novel technique whose main role is the detection of tumour remnant, allowing an optimi sed resection at the same surgical act while monitoring for potential complic ations and providing an updated neuronavigator. In our experience, intraope rative MRI has an impact on surgical management by detecting operable tumor remnants during surgery. Limitations: Further multicentre and prospective studies are needed to assess its implications on the patient's surgical outcomes and survival rates undergoing this technique.

Methods or Background: Nine ischaemic stroke patients who underwent one- stop scans including unenhanced scan, CTP, and CTA with dual-layer detector spectral CT were retrospectively With perfusion F-Stroke, ischaemic areas (infarc t core and penumbra) and normal tissue were determined in each patient. The spectral quantitative parameters (Z-effective value (Z-eff) and iodine co ncentration (IC)) were measured and compared between ischaemic areas and n ormal tissue using Mann-Whitney test. Received operating characteristi c (ROC) curves were plotted to determine the optimum threshold and diag nostic efficiency of Z-eff and IC. Results or Findings: Both Z-eff and IC showed significant differences between areas of ischaemic area and normal tissue ( P<0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). AUC 7.566, sensitivity specificity 88.9%), and the AUC of IC was ev en higher 0.926 (cutoff 0.261, sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 100%) . Conclusion: Spectral parameters of Z-eff and IC on dual-layer detector CT showed good diagnostic performance in d etermining ischaemic area of ischaemic stroke patients, which could develop to be potential alternative to CTP.

However, recent advancements in ult ra-high field (7T) imaging allow for the evaluation of CNS morphology without processing, sectioning and staining. The main challenge, howeve r, consists in the proper correlation of MRI findings with microscopy, especi ally when considering small structures (i.e. brainstem nuclei) and lesions. Her e we present a working pipeline for the anatomo-radiological correlation o f 7T ex-vivo MRI findings with anatomical and staining techniques and its applicat ion in both morphology and neuropathology. Methods or Background: Human brain specimens deriving from the Body Donation Programme of the University of Padova were employed for the study. The specimens were formalin-fixed, stored in a perf luoropolyether-filled cylinder, and underwent imaging on a 7TMR system eq uipped with a 2 ch- tx/32ch-rx head coil for whole-brain imaging and wi th a custom-built for brainstem imaging. We acquired high-resolution sequences for morphologic purposes, as well as images tailored to design sample-specific cutting boxes. These are custom-built 3D printed devices acting as a negative plaster cast for the specimen and provided with gui des for sectioning. The resulting sections were paraffin-embedded and stain ed to evaluate both morphology and histopathology. Results or Findings: Cutting boxes allowed for micron-precise sectioning along with MRI acquisition. Histochemical and immun ohistochemical staining was not influenced by immersion in perfluoropolyether. The profile of brainstem nuclei and fiber tracts was preserved and perfectly comparable. Histopathological alterations were revealed in a neuropathology referral case and their MRI correlates were analysed. Conclusion: The presented working pipeline facilitates the corr elation between MRI findings and microscopy, revealing both the normal architecture of the human brainstem, as well as fine neuropathol ogical alterations. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by Padova: BodyDonationProgram Regulations; CEAVNO:17664.

Asp signal (in MRS spectrum 2.72 ppm) approximation seems to be challenging. T herefore, the main goal of the current study is optimisation of A sp assessment using different approximation approaches. Methods or Background: MRI examination: 75 Asp-edited MEGA-PRESS spectra acquired in healthy volunteers (mean age - 21.2\u00b13.3 years) were retrospectively collected, using Philips Achieva dS tream 3.0T MRI scanner. The spectra localisation was: ci Processing: one, two, three and four gauss models, simulated spectrum and phantom spectrum were used for Asp approximation. MEGA-PRESS spectra were pre-processed using gannet 3.1 script. We esti mated Asp/Cr signal intensity, fitting error values, and group variatio ns. Results or Findings: In case of ACC spectra, one and two gauss models demonstrated the lowest approximation quality (fitt ing errors: 15.6\u00b12.4% and 13.3\u00b12.4%). three - 9.9\u00b12.4%, four -11.2\u00b12.7%, simulated spectrum - 11.1\u00b13.0%. Conclusion: Four gauss models demonstrate the best fitting errors in each case. In addition, we have correlation between fitt ing errors and variation of Asp/Cr values, therefore four gauss model provides the most accurate Asp concentration determination. Thus, this work presents unique results in the optimisation of the Asp approximation and suggests the most effective approaches. Limitations: In VC and DLPFA low SNR leads to the fact, that all approaches, except four gauss, had no significant differences i n fitting errors (average value for DLPFA and VC: 18.3\u00b13.2% and 23.2\u00b12.5%).

Schmaranzer*\u00b9, (1) develop and validate a deep learning approac h for fully automatic labrum segmentation based on MR arthrography of the hip against manual segmentation; (2) compare labrum volume amon g different hip deformities. Methods or Background: Sixty patients (mean age 31 \u00b1 7 years, 67% female) with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and hip dys plasia (DDH) were included. All patients underwent direct 3T MR arthr ography including high- resolution 3D T1-w MP2RAGE (0.5 x 0.5 x 1 mm). Pati ents were assigned to three subgroups based on ( (n=22). Manual segmentations of labrum served as training data for the neural network (3D U- Net) to obtain an automated 3D labrum model. A 5-fo ld cross-validation was performed and dice-coefficient as measure of overla p, Pearson correlation coefficient and mean bias were calculated. For morphological analysis of the labrum, ANOVA test was performed to compare labrum volume among groups. Results or Findings: Mean dice coefficient was 75 \u00b1 6 %, corresponding t o a mean non-significant difference of 24mm\u00b3 (95%CI: -107 - 154 mm\u00b3, p = 0.716) and a high correlation (rp =0.88, p <0.0001) in lab rum volume. Mean labrum volume differed (p = 0.040) among the hip deformiti es with 2840 \u00b11332mm\u00b3 for DDH, 2064 \u00b1744mm\u00b3 for with and 2223 \u00b1 755mm\u00b3 for pincer hips. Conclusion: Automatic segmentation of the hip labrum based on MR arthrograms using deep learning is feasible and acc urate. Our results suggest that labrum volume adapts to acetabular coverage. I ntegrating these 3D models into the daily clinical workflow has the pot ential to improve surgical decision-making.

Harder; Purpose: To visually and quantitatively investigate hip impl ant-related metal artifacts on a 0.55T scanner system in comparison t o 1.5T and 3T imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences from clinical ro utine. Methods or Background: Femoral components from total hip arthroplasty made of three different alloys were evaluated in a water phantom at 0.55T, 1.5T and 3T. An optimised imaging protocol from cli nical routine was used for imaging at 1.5T and 3T and adapted to 0.55T. Artifacts were visually assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists and one orthopedic surgeon using a 7- point Likert scale. Quantitative assessment was per formed by calculating the coefficient of variation and the fraction of voxels within the water phantom lying above or below a standardised threshold. Inter- and intrareader agreement was evaluated using interclass correlation. Results or Findings: Interreader agreement was strong to moderate (0.74- 0.82). For titanium implants, artifacts were rated less intense at all field strengths (Likert-score 0.55T and 1.5T than at 3T (p<.05). Coefficient of variation showed strong correlation between visual and quantitative assessment (r=0.81; p<.001) and was lowest for titanium implants at all field strengths. The fraction of voxels with in a threshold of a control ROI showed strong (25%/50% threshold: r=-0.84; p<.001) or moderate (10%: correlation with the visual assessment. Conclusion: Artifact intensity was lowest for titanium implants imaged at 0.55T. For all other alloys, artifact intensities a t 0.55T were comparable to MARS imaging at 1.5T but superior to 3T. Therefore, low-field MRI at 0.55T is a promising technique and may further improve image quality in patients with total hip arthroplasty. Limitations: The limitation is that it is a phantom study.

Albano*, C. Messina, S. Gitto, L. Zagra, L. M. Sconfienza; Milan/IT (albanodomenico@me.com) Purpose: Our diagnose infect ion (PJI) preoperatively, ultrasound-guided joint aspiration (US-JA) may not be performed when effusion is minimal or absent. We ai med to report and investigate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound-guided periprosthetic biopsy (US-PB) of synovial tissue to obtain joint s amples in patients without fluid around the implants. Methods or Background: One-hundred nine patients (55 men; mean age: 68 \u00b1 13 years) with failed total hip arthroplasty (THA ) who underwent revision surgery performed preoperative US-JA or US-PB to rule out PJI. Results or Findings: Sixty-nine of 109 patients had joint effusion and underwent US-JA, while the remaining 40 with dry joints required US-PB. Thirty-five of 109 patients (32.1%) had PJI, while 74/109 (67.9%) had aseptic THA failure. No immediate complications were observ ed in both groups. Technical success of US-PB was 100%, as the procedu re was carried on as planned in all cases. Sensitivity, specificity, pos itive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of US-JA were 52.2%, 97.8%, 92.3%, 100%, 80%, and 82.5%, respectively, with no significant difference (P = . 779). Using the final diagnosis as reference standard, we observed a moderate agreement with both US-JA (k = 0.56) and US-PB (k = 0.50). Conclusion: We present a novel US-guided technique to biopsy periprosthetic synovial tissue of failed THA to rule out PJI. We f ound similar diagnostic performance as compared with traditional US-JA. Thi s supports future larger studies on this procedure that might be applied in patients without joint effusion. Limitations: The limitations are (1) the retrospective study's design on relatively small sample size, particularly concerni ng the biopsy group of patients, and (2) more than one biopsy sample might have increased the sensitivity of periprosthetic biopsy.

Frenken*, D. B. B. Abrar, L. Wollschl\u00e4ger; D\u00fcss eldorf/DE Purpose: Muscle injuries are common and difficult to quantif y diagnostically because muscle edema often masks actual muscle dama ge. DTI can provide insight into muscle structure and fiber routing. This study used a standardised ex-vivo defect model to investigate the ability of DTI to quantify muscle injury. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 191 Methods or Background: Ex vivo, 9 human lower legs (4 right, 5 left, 80y\u00b18 , 8f/1m) were subjected to a defect model. A cuboid s tandardised muscle defect was cut into the tibialis muscle. After rotation by 90\u00b0, it was reinserted and closed using subcutaneous fat and skin. 3T-MRI exam ination was performed before and after defect insertion and included morphologic sequences (T1 TSE cor., STIR cor., T2 TSE trans.) and DTI. Analysis w as based on ROIs. Standard DTI parameters (axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), fractional anisotropy (FA), streamline mean) and visual representation of fiber tractography were evaluated. Results or Findings: After 90\u00b0 rotation of a muscle cube, change of the main fiber direction from longitudinal to transverse is visible in the rotated area. DTI parameters AD, MD and RD showed incre ase (AD: p=0.003, MD: p=0.0001, RD: stream.: p=0.0001). Conclusion: Rotational defects can visually and quantitatively with DTI fiber tractography. Significant changes in DTI parameters can be attributed to structural injury. DTI is a promising tool for identification and quantification of muscle defects and may potentiall y serve for recovery prognosis of muscular injuries in the future. Limitations: The study was performed ex-vivo to obtain basic kno wledge about the assessment of DTI parameters in muscular injuries using a standardised defect model. In the following, these findings may be valuable for patients. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Boesen; Copenhagen/DK Purpose: To investigate knee osteoarthritis (KOA) in an enti re production year from 2018 at Bispebjerg and Frederiksberg Hospital, Copenhagen, using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach. Methods or Background: We included patients aged 35-79 with weight- bearing radiographs, provide Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) the tibiofemoral compartments and presences of distal/proximal patella osteophytes. Results or Findings: In total, 1,737 patients were included and their 1, 701 left and 1,698 right posterior-anterior/anterior-posteri or and paired lateral (1,718) non-repeated radiographs. Sixteen patients with ort hopedic hardware or unknown assignments were excluded. The average age was 58.9 years (SD 11.7), and female patients were overrepresented (1, 018). The distribution of KL-grades were 0: 18.9%; 1: 7.5%; 2: 37.7%; 3: 22.2%; 4: 13.7%. Ordinal logistic regression showed that each year of age increased the odds of a higher KL-grade by 1.08 CI95% [1.07-1.09] (p<0.001) , and female sex increased the odds by 1.34 CI95% [1.12-1.60] (p<0.01). A tendency for slower advancements was seen in younger males (<60 years). Median KL-grades increased with age from 0 to 2, and higher mean KL- grades were seen among female patients (1.8 vs 1.4). There were no differences between paired lateralities (p>0.05), and 55.5% of patients with n o KOA (KL<2) had patella osteophytes. Conclusion: We found that 73.6% of patients had radiographic KO A (KL 2-4), and high age is the predominant risk factor in our consecutive cohort. Furthermore, females had higher KL-grades and showed advancement trends earlier on. Over half of the patients without radiographic KOA had patella osteophytes which could explain their symptoms/refe rral. Limitations: We did not test RBknee's accuracy, but a previous publication shows performance at a senior MSK radiologist consultant level.

Methods or Background: A retrospective observation cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2018 to April 2020 in w hich 50 patients (male n=30, female n=20) of mean age 35 years with medial ankle injury were consented to be imaged on 3T GE MRI scanner using s tandard three plane PDFS sequence who also underwent diagnostic and/or therapeutic arthroscopy. Multiple established MRI criteria namely, presence or absence of joint recess, depth of the joint recess, width of t he joint recess, shape of joint recess, presence of double black line sign & medial malleolus marrow oedema, were used to differentiate true from false-positive avulsion tear of superficial deltoid ligament of the ankle. Results or Findings: Of 50 patients who underwent arthroscopy, 40 patients showed superficial deltoid ligament tear & 10 patients had normal ligament. MRI using established criteria yielded a sensitivit y of 99% (39/40) and specificity of 98% (8/10) for superficial deltoid l igament tears of the ankle. Conclusion: MRI using established criteria in 3T scanner showed very high accuracy in diagnosing and differentiating true from pseudo avulsion tear superficial deltoid ligament of the ankle.

Jung*, P. Giesler, P. evaluate T1rho relaxation times of talar cartilage in individuals with chronic mechanical ankle instability (CAI) and healthy controls (HC) with and without axial-loading during MRI acquisition. Methods or Background: Individuals with CAI (n=10) and HC (n=17) underwent 3T-MRI of the ankle with and without in-s itu axial-loading of 500N applied by a custom-built ankle arthrometer. T1rho relaxation time measurements of talar cartilage were performed using a 3D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence augmented with variable spin-lock preparation intervals (0/10/20/30/40ms) and mono-exponential pixel-by-pix el T1rho-fitting. Manual segmentation of six talar cartilage regions (ROI) w as performed. Median T1rho values, and changes between no-load and load, were compared using Mann- Whitney-U-test. Results or Findings: Age was 22.5\u00b13.1 years (mean\u00b1SD; n=20 female). No cartilage defects are depicted on morphological MRI . Without axial-loading, median T1rho values of were cantly higher in all medial to the HC-group (p<. 05). Axial-loading led to a significant decrease of T1rho values of the talar cartilage in significantly higher T 1rho relaxation times were observed in the posterolateral ROI of the CAI-group (p=.047). Comparing the CAI- and HC-group, no significant differences were observed between the changes of T1rho values ( no-load/load). Conclusion: In chronic ankle instability, significantly higher T1rho values were found in medial segments of talar cartilage, indicating early cartilage matrix degeneration. Axial-loading particularly affects the middle and posterior areas of the talar surface. The lack of differences of T1rho values between groups with axial-loading may indicate maintained cartilage shock-absorbing function at this early time-point, where no morphological ch anges were detected. Following, preventive measures may be effective to halt progression of ankle joint degeneration. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Hanafy; Cairo/EG (sahar_mnsr@yahoo.com) Purpose: Assess the impact of adding artificial intelligence to the mammogram of the dense breasts on the diagnosis of malignancy . Methods or Background: High breast density is a risk factor for breast cancer and overlapping of glandular tissue can mask lesions thus lowering mammographic sensitivity. Also, dense breasts are m ore vulnerable to increase recall rate and false positive results. Ad ding ultrasound to mammography in dense breasts improves the sensitivi ty and specificity of mammography. New generations of artificial intellig ence (AI) have been introduced to the realm of mammography. The study i ncluded 6600 mammograms of dense patterns \"c\" and \"d\". All the patients were subjected to digital mammography and breast ultrasound, and mamm ographic images were scanned by AI software. The AI provided color hue f or abnormality overlay and a abnormality scoring percentage according to the p robability of malignancy as follows: 0 and definite cancer. Results or Findings: This study presented 4061 breast abnormalities. Diagnostic indices of the sono-mammogram were a sen sitivity of 98.71%, a specificity of 88.04%, a positive predictive value of 80.16%, a negative predictive value of 99.29% and an accuracy of 91.5% . AI-aided mammograms presented sensitivity of 88.29%, a specificity of 9 6.34%, a positive predictive value of 92.2%, a negative predictive value of 94.4% and an accuracy of 94.5% in its ability to read dense mammograms Conclusion: The artificial intelligence algorithm applied on mammogram of the dense breasts showed a notable reduction of sono-mammographic misdiagnosis, so, it can be used as a decision-support tool for breast with heavy glandular tissue. Limitations: Clinical data. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Sahar Abdelkhalek Mansour: Hanafy: 802-4 *W. Sanderink*, I. Sechopoulos; Nijmegen/NL Purpose: To determine if, for equal compressed breast thickn ess (CBT), there is an equal distribution of volumetric breast densi ty (VBD) across screening populations worldwide. Methods or Background: Ten digital mammography screening datasets consisting of the VBD estimates (Volpara Health), C BT, view, side, and anonymised exam identifier were collected. In total , 732,376 screened women 50 years old from 10 datasets from 9 different countries were included. The distribution of VBD within each of the 10 different CBT bins (16-25 mm, 26-35 mm, etc.) were analysed to estimate different perce ntile densities, and 95% CI, for each CBT bin. Differences among the correspondi ng VBD for the same percentiles across datasets were compared. Results or Findings: The absolute difference in VBDs for the same percen tile density and CBT bin across sets had a range of CC: -7.0%-+6.3% and MLO: - 7.8%-+10.7% from the worldwide means of the medians , with 942/1190=79.2% being statistically significant diff erences. For example, the 50th percentile VBD of a 56-65 mm thick CC-view bre ast varies, across the ten datasets, between 4.2% and 8.5%, with nine of the t en datasets having significant differences from the mean of this media n VBDs of 5.7%. Conclusion: Descriptive statistics on breast characteristics ar e required for dosimetry or cancer risk estimations, but internati onal variations in breast density suggest that a single model may not be widely representative. However, this quantitative data analysis shows that breasts of comparable thickness have similar VBD distributions, with the differences being statistically significant. For dosimetry estimations, this is pro bably not clinically significant, while, for cancer risk estimations, more accurate p redictions may be needed. Therefore, without patient-specific VBD estimates, a single population-based model of VBD as a function of breast thickness may be suitable for many applications. Limitations: Not applicable.

Sefidbakht\u00b9, Ataei V. breast referred to a sub- specialty breast clinic for lesion type and modality. Methods or Background: Images and biopsies performed over 6 months in a breast-imaging clinic were reviewed for missed case s in a multistep process. (1) Two physicians reviewed the studies and excluded those without priors. (2) Two radiologists reviewed the reports compared with priors and excluded the studies with stable/benign findings. The remaining studies were reviewed for missed findings. The missed cases were categorised by modality, modality- specific lesion type and delay caused by misdiagnos is. Results or Findings: Out of 8974 studies performed over 6 months, 1570 studies had new findings. 151 lesions were missed i n previous studies. These included 49 mammographically detected lesions (11 t issue distortions including 5 visible in one view); 18 focal/developing asymmet ries; 13 grouped/segmental microcalcifications (6 overlooked, and 7 for which follow-up was recommended); and 7 masses (4 missed in dense background, 3 partly seen due to extreme posterior position and/or quality is sues in prior mammograms). Out of 97 missed cases in ultrasound, 34 were addit ional cancer (multifocal/centric; 18 missed LN (including 14 low er level 1 and 7 level 2)); 7 tissue distortions; 31 non-mass lesions; and 7 mass es erroneously considered probably benign for follow-up (including 3 mucinous cancers, 3 mixed- solidcystic masses proven to be papillary carcinoma and one round luminal B cancer). There were 4 cancers detected in re-biopsy of previously biopsied lesions with benign/inconclusive results. 3 of the non-mass lesions missed on ultrasound in women >40 would have been detected if mammogram had been performed first, as per protocol. Conclusion: Most common errors in breast imaging are detection of focal asymmetries and microcalcifications in mammogram; detection of non-mass esions in both; and failure to detect multifoc ality/multicentricity in breast cancer and lower level-1 axillary LNs. Limitations: Calling a case missed/underdiagnosed is somehow subjective. Ethics committee approval: An institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective study.

Iotti*, P. Giorgi efficacy of self- compared to radiographer-led compression to reduce the average glandular dose wi thout affecting image quality and compliance to follow-up mammography. Methods or Background: Women presenting for mammography in clinical practice (cancer follow-up, symptoms, opportunistic screening or familial risk) were asked to participate and, if willing, randomis ed to self-compression or radiographer-led compression. Image quality was ass essed blindly by two independent radiologists and two radiographers. Pai n and discomfort were measured immediately after mammography and their recall was asked when the women participated in the follow-up mammogram o ne or two years later. Results or Findings: 495 women (mean age 57 years +/-14) were enrolled, 245 in the self-compression and 250 radiographer-compression arms. Image quality (radiologists' judgement p = 0.62; radiographers' judgement P=.34, slightly better in self-compression for both), dose (0.94 vs. 0.96 mGy, P=.38) and pain (3.8 vs. 4.0, P=.50) were similar in the t wo arms. Compression was stronger in the self than in the radiographer arm ( 11.4 vs. 10.2 daN, P<.001), with a small impact on thickness (46.4 vs. 48.1 mm, P=.13). Moderate/severe discomfort was reported by 7.9% vs 9.9% (P=.46). Ti me was slightly longer with self-compression (11.5 vs. 10.2 minutes, P=.06 ). Compliance to the subsequent mammography was 95.1% and 97.1% in the s elf and radiographer arm, respectively (P=.28). Conclusion: Self-compression achieved stronger compression of t he breast, with comparable image quality, but did not substant ially reduce glandular dose. The proportion of women who attended follow-up mamm ography was similar in the two groups. Limitations: The study had insufficient power to detect differences in participation in subsequent mammography due to a mu ch higher participation than what was anticipated in the sample-size evaluation, but data do not suggest any increase.

The objective is to evaluate the impact on diagnost ic performance of obtaining a DBT spot compression view for assessment of equiv ocal DBT findings. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 102 women in whom a DBT spot compression view was obtained to ch aracterise an equivocal finding on DBT, performed between December 2018 and December 2019. Two fellowship-trained radiologists and one b reast-imaging fellow independently reviewed examinations. Readers first assigned a BI-RADS category using standard DBT views followed immediat ely by a category using the DBT spot compression view. Histology and at least 1 year of imaging follow-up served as reference standard. Diagnostic performance was compared between DBT with and without DBT spot compression views using McNemar tests. Results or Findings: Intrareader agreement increased from 0.43 to 0.72, and interreader agreement increased from 0.21 to 0.45, based on kappa coefficients for DBT with and without spot compress ion views. Compared with standard DBT views, DBT spot compression views yiel ded significantly increased accuracy for three readers (74% vs 90%, 73% vs 94%, 71% vs. 94%); vs 90%, 75% vs 94%; 68% vs. 93%); and increased sens itivity for one reader (67% vs 94%) without significant change in sensitivity f or the two other readers. Radiation dose was 1.97 mGy for the DBT spot compression view, versus 1.78-1.81 mGy for standard DBT view. Conclusion: The DBT spot compression view increased intrareader and interreader agreement and diagnostic accuracy; the view's supplemental dose was slightly higher than that of a standard DBT vie w. Limitations: It's a retrospective, single-centre study. Populati on was relatively small. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review board approval was obtained.

Gommers*\u00b9, how radiologist performance characteristics can be leveraged to determine the optimal set of pairs of radiologists for the double reading of screening mammograms. Methods or Background: We analysed three datasets of women who underwent screening mammography in Sweden, the UK a nd Norway. Any examination that was flagged by either radiologist was classified as abnormal. Cancer detection rates (CDR) and abnormal interpret ation rates (AIR) were evaluated. Individual radiologists were divided int o four categories: high CDR and low AIR (HL), high CDR and AIR (HH), low CDR an d AIR (LL), or low CDR and high AIR (LH). Random pair performance, for whi ch any pair was equally likely, was compared to specific pair performance. Results or Findings: The CDRs for the random and all specific pairings w ere not significantly different. The Swedish and UK dat asets did show a similar significant pattern for AIR: compared to random pai rings, pairing strategies involving opposite AIR radiologists resulted in a s ignificant AIR reduction of 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively. For the Swedish dataset, the pairing strategy with fully opposite performance radiologists also r esulted in a significant 10.3% AIR reduction when compared to random pairing. The Norwegian dataset showed a different pattern, with no significant dif ferences between the AIRs of specific pairings and the random pairing. Conclusion: Pairing radiologists based on their performance characteristics, as opposed to randomly, may improve grouped screeni ng performance. However, our data showed contradicting patterns for the different pairing strategies. Further analyses with more datasets from different screening settings have to be done to confirm our results. Limitations: Each examination was read by only two radiologists, so only existing pairings were possible to be analysed.

B. van den Oever*, Michielsen, M. C. Pinto, I. Sechopoulos; Nijmegen/NL (daan.vandenoever@radboudumc.nl) Purpose: To develop and evaluate a maximum likelihood iterat ive reconstruction algorithm with material decompositio n (ML-MADE) digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) for single-DBT a cquisitions involving multiple X-ray spectra. Methods or Background: ML-MADE considers the spectral nature of the beams used to acquire the DBT projections, resultin g in two reconstructed basis material images that are combined into a virt ual monochromatic DBT volume. DBT projections of a breast phantom containing objects representing different lesion types were acquired for evaluation. Two acquisitions were made: one with all projections using a W/Rh spectrum at 28 kVp, 8.75 mAs/projection; and one at 35 kVp, 3.1 mAs/projecti on. Three DBT volumes were reconstructed to test our algorithm: one refer ence volume from only the 28 kVp projections; the second using half the 28 kV p and 35 kVp projections interleaved; and the third with the first half of t he projections at 28 kVp and the second half at 35 kVp. Contrast-to-noise (CNR) and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios were calculated to quantify the image qualit y of the lesions representing masses. Calcification lesion representation was evaluated qualitatively. The average glandular doses (AGD) were estimated using entry-dose and published-dose conversion factors. Results or Findings: The AGD was reduced by 19% by acquiring dual- spectrum projection sets. The CNR and SNR of the masses in the reference reconstruction were 1.27 and 18.1, and 1.09 and 15. 0 for both dual-spectrum acquisitions, respectively. The calcifications from the three reconstructions were not discernibly different. Conclusion: Dual spectrum acquisition is feasible with our ML-M ADE algorithm at the 19% lower dose levels by interleav ing spectra or switching spectra halfway during acquisition, therefore, requiring no second regular scan. No information appears to be lost as a monochromati c reconstruction is still possible. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

L. van Winkel*, R. M. Mann; Nijmegen/NL (Suzanne.vanWinkel@radboudumc.nl) Purpose: To assess the yield and diagnostic accuracy of breast MR surveillance in women with a history of chest irradiation under 40 years old (RT<40), usually due to childhood cancer. Methods or Background: This retrospective study analysed the performance MR breast cancer screening in RT<40 patients. Women with RT<40 and at least one screening MR in our hospital between 2012 and 2020 were included. Information on indication, number of screenings and age was extracted from the medical record, recall-, biopsy- and cancer det ection rate were calculated as the number of positives per 1000 screens. Pathol ogic outcomes were obtained for biopsied lesions. Results or Findings: 59/1755 women (3,4%) received breast MR because of RT<40 (min.1; max.5; median 2; total 123), maximum follow-up: median age at first MR: 38,7 (min.24; 211/1000 for mammographic screens. Biopsy rates were 130/1000 for MR and 210/1000 for mammographic exams. In total, 17 biopsies in 16 woman were performed, of which resp. 2 and 1 due to MR and mammography findings only. Cancer was det ected in 6 women (2 DCIS, 4 invasive): 1 underwent mammography screening only before her diagnosis; 5 underwent screening by both modalities . All positive cases (5/5) were visible at MR (cancer detection rate 41/1000), 5/6 on mammography. No interval cancer yield (41/1000 MRI) within women after mediastinal RT justifies intensive screening. Adher ence to a structural surveillance program appears to be low. Limitations: More research and data aggregation is necessary to determine the best surveillance approach for these women. Ethics committee approval: Not required.

Palk\u00f3; Szeged/HU RPS 801-3 Preoperatively, with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may guide personalised managemen t and Song; Chengdu/CN Purpose: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is featured w ith high heterogeneity and dismal prognosis. We aimed to div ide ICC patients into different clinical phenotypes based on preoperative data, and identify ICC patients who benefit most and least from liver rese ction. Methods or Background: Between January 2009 and December 2017, 308 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed ICC who underwent preoperative CECT were retrospectively enrolled. Cl inical data, imaging findings and radiomics scores associated with progn ostic outcome were collected. Exploratory factor analysis was performe d to variable selection and identify relative variables. Hierarchical cluster a nalysis was used to identify preoperative phenotype. A decision tree algorithm w as applied to predict the phenotype. Results or Findings: In the hierarchical cluster analysis, four phenotypes of ICC patients were identified. Phenotype 1 (n=78) wa s associated with biliary dilation and low AFP value, phenotype 2 (n=41) was related to large tumour size and tumour in vein, phenotype 3 (n=80) was featured by satellite nodule and multifocality, while phenotype 4 (n=109) was characterised by small tumour size and a low radiomics score. Phenotype 2 was associated with the poorest prognosis (median survival time: 12.1 months, while phenotype 4 was associated with the longest median survival time of 27.0 months. Biliary dilation, satellite nodule, multifocality, and tumour in vein were used to construct a decision tree with five nodes, and 90.58% of the subjects were assigned to the correct phenotypes. Conclusion: Four clinical phenotypes based on clinical and imaging features were identified with different pathological findings and prognostic outcomes. Moreover, the phenotypes may be useful for preopera tive patient selection and personalised management.

Yan; Shanghai/CN Purpose: To explore correlation of viscoelastic properties of HCC and background liver with aggressive biological behavio r. Methods or Background: From June 2020 to August 2021, 81 patients with 85 histopathologically confirmed HCC lesions were i ncluded in this prospective study. They were classified as cirrhotic and non-ci rrhotic groups. All patients underwent preoperative multifrequency MRE combined with tomoelastography post-processing. Viscoelasticity was quantified as shear wave speed (c, m/s) representing tissue stiffness and loss angle of the complex shear modulus ( , rad) relating to tissue fluidity. Tumour aggressive signature (differentiation grade, microvascular invasion, Ki-67 and CK19 expression), and fibrosis stages and inflammation activity of background liver were evaluated. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 195 Viscoelastic parameters were compared between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic group. Further subgroup analysis was performed betw een HCC with different aggressive signature. Results or Findings: Cirrhotic HCC showed higher value than non-cirrhotic HCC (1.20 \u00b1 0.24 rad vs 1.08 \u00b1 0.19 rad, p=0.022). For subgroup analysis of cirrhotic HCC, high-grade and high Ki-67 expression group showed increased value than those with low-grade and low Ki-67 expr ession (1.25 and 1.25\u00b1 0.24 vs 1.08 \u00b1 0.17, p=0.018; respectively), and CK19 positive HCC showed increased c value than negative \u00b1 0.89 vs iver, cirrhotic HCC showed increased c and value compared with non-cirrhotic HCC group ((2.30 \u00b1 Conclusion: liver has a distinct biomechani cal phenotype associated with less aggressiveness.

Jiang, B. Song; Chengdu/CN (weih_cat@163.com) the effectiveness of preoperative ga doxetic acid- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI) edicting in early-stage hepatocellular carcin oma (eHCC). Methods or Background: This retrospective study enrolled consecutive treatment-na\u00efve adult patients who underwent EOB-MR I within 3 months before curative resection for eHCC within the Milan criteria between July 2015 and November 2020. All MR images were independently reviewed by two radiologists with respect to the Liver Imaging Repo rting and Data System (LI- RADS) version 2018 imaging features, LI-RADS category and several non-LI- RADS imaging features. Univariable and multivariabl e logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for microvascular invasion (MVI) and poor histologic grade of eHCC. Model performanc e was estimated by using the area under the receiver operating charact eristic (AUC) curve analysis. Results or Findings: One hundred and six patients with pathologically confirmed HCC were included; 28 of 106 (26.4%) pati ents had MVI, whereas 29 of 106 (27.4%) patients had poor histologic grade. Variables significantly predictive of MVI included fat in mass, more than a djacent liver (odds ratio [OR] = 0.202), marked diffusion restriction (OR = 3 .152), and non-smooth tumour margin (OR = 7.187). Variables significantly predictive of poor histologic grade were AFP level > 400 ng/mL (OR = 4.820) and marked diffusion restriction (OR = 2.428). Incorporating t he aforementioned predictors, the risk score model achieved an AUC of 0.829 (95% confidence for poor histologic grade, respectively. Conclusion: EOB-MRI-based models effectively predict tumour aggressiveness in eHCC and may contribute to a rati onal therapeutic choice. Limitations: The sample size of this study is small.

Yao*, Y. Wei, H. Tang, B. Song; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To determine whether gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI combined with vascular features of dynamic enhanced CT can improv e the diagnostic performance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on various diagnostic criteria. Methods or Background: 142 patients with 169 surgically confirmed nodules (137 HCCs, 32 non-HCCs) were retrospectively enroll ed. Included underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRl and dynamic enhanced CT preoperatively. All the MR and CT images were anony mised and combined as two protocols for reviewing:1) full gadoxetic acid- enhanced MRI sequences; 2) dynamic CT combined with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR I but excluded the vascular features-related phase. Three independent reviewers characterised the nodules according to the LI-RADS v2018 and EASL. The clinical impact of CTAP and MRAP images for detecting the arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), the sensitivity and specificity of the CTAP -combined and MRAP images were analysed and compared. Results or Findings: For the whole hepatic nodules, CTAP-combined images had a significantly higher detection (104/137) from 70.80% (97/137) on MRAP images (p=0.016), with the minimal decrease of the specificity to 71.88% (23/32) from 75.00% (24/32) ( p=1.000). For EASL, MRAP images showed a sensitivity of 78.10% (107/137) and a specificity of 71.88% (23/32) for HCC diagnosis. However, when determining APHE on CTAP, the sensitivity showed numerical increase to 81.02% (111/137) (p=0.152), whereas the specificity decreased to 75.00% (24/32) which w as not statistically significant either (p=1.000). Conclusion: The combined use of dynamic enhanced CT vascular features for HCC diagnosis enables high sensitivity and comparable specificity when compared with the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.

Khaleghi*, Tehran/IR (mkh712003@yahoo.com) Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the uterine artery embolisation (UAE) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for conservative management of placental adhesive disorders. Methods or Background: Patients with placental adhesive disorders (including accreta, increta, and percreta lesions) that were treated with uterine artery embolisation in combination with methotrexat e (MTX) were identified and were followed prospectively for outcomes including uterine preservation and complications. Results or Findings: Twenty-six patients were identified who had the diagnosis of abnormal placenta implantation during this study. Fourteen patients were excluded because they were treated by a caesarean hysterectomy. Among remaining 12 patients, successf ul uterine preservation was observed in seven (58%) cases. Menstruation cyc les returned in all successfully treated patients, although they did not have a desire to get pregnant. Five (42%) patients underwent primary or delayed hysterectomy due to severe post-partum haemorrhage in three cases, a nd intestinal adhesion/peritonitis and secondary post-partum haem orrhage/sepsis in two patients, respectively. Conclusion: Although this interventional method is relatively s uccessful in uterine preservation, the possibility of treatment failure cannot be ignored. Given that there are too little data regarding its efficacy and safety, this method should be reserved for patients who have a strong d esire to maintain the uterus and their fertility, or if it is technically difficult to perform hysterectomy due to the extent of the invasion.

V. Mall*, R. R. Yadav, S. Singh, A. I srar; Lucknow/IN (ranavishwadeep@gmail.com) Purpose: Increased liver stiffness (LS) is observed in patients with Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS). The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the serial changes in LS after endovascular interventio ns in chronic BCS using Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) and to determine its effectiveness as a non- invasive monitoring tool in follow-up. Methods or Background: This prospective study included 32 patients diagnosed with chronic BCS who underwent endovascul ar therapy. Serial evaluation of LS was performed pre-procedure, post- procedure, at 1 month and at 3 months post-revascularisation. These changes in LS were correlated with Liver Biopsy during the recanalisation. Results or Findings: Technical success was achieved in 31 patients (96%) . A significant reduction (p=0.001) of liver stiffness was observed in patients with chronic BCS after endovascular venous decompression, suggesting that liver congestion could be the primary determinant of liver stiffness, particularly in the cohort of patients with lower grades of fibrosis (METAVIR 2). Beyond the 3 to 6 months post-intervention period, the liver stiffn ess could be suggested by levels of residual fibrosis. Patients with chronic BCS did not show resolution of liver stiffness to non-cirrhotic levels, even at 6- months post-revascularisation. Conclusion: In conclusion, SWE could be used as an effective mo nitoring tool in follow-up after endovascular therapy for chronic BCS. It could also be used to gauge effective venous decompression relative to the degree of fibrosis. Limitations: Repeat liver biopsies were not performed at follow- up for assessment of residual fibrosis and for correlation with liver stiffness. Ethics committee approval: This single institute prospective study was performed after obtaining approval from Institute E thics Committee. Funding for this study: No external funding was necessary as it was part of standard protocol at the institute.

S. Alizadeh*, I. Yel, T. L. D. Gr\u00fcnewa ld, V. Koch, C. Booz; Frankfurt a. Main/DE Purpose: Impact of pre-interventional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) on prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) regarding workflow, radiation dose, and clinical outcome. Methods or Background: Retrospective evaluation of 259 patients (mean age 68 \u00b1 9, range 41-92) with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) undergoing PAE. MRA was performed in 137 cases. In 122 patients, no pre-interventional MRA was performed. Origin of the PA, volumetry of the prostatic gland and ADC values were evaluated. International Prostate Sympt om Score (IPSS), Quality of Life (QoL) and International Index of Erectile F unction (IIEF) were evaluated before and after PAE. Results or Findings: Origin of the PA was identified in all cases. Signi ficant differences regarding volume reduction (-20\u00b113 ml w ith MRA vs -17\u00b19 ml without MRA) and ADC value reduction were found (-7 8\u00b1111 10-6mm2/s with MRA vs -45\u00b199 10-6mm2/s without MRA). PAE workflow was modified in 16 patients due to MRA findings. Radiation dose (5518. 54\u00b16677.97 \u00b5Gym2 with MRA vs 23963.50\u00b119792.25 \u00b5Gym2 without MRA) and flu oroscopy times (19.35\u00b19.01 min. with MRA vs 27.45\u00b112.54 min. witho ut MRA) significantly differed. IPSS reduction improved (-11\u00b18 points wit h MRA vs -7\u00b19 points without MRA, p<0.001), while QOL (-2\u00b11 points with MRA and -2 \u00b1 2 points without MRA) and IIEF (+2\u00b110 points with MRA and +1 \u00b111 points without MRA) showed no significant differences (p>0.05). Conclusion: Pre-interventional MRA facilitates improved workflow, patient safety and clinical outcome of PAE while reducing r adiation dose. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective single-centre design and a limited follow-up time for clinical outcome. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approved with a waiver for informed consent. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

S. N -E. Mohammed; Frankfurt a. Main/DE Purpose: To evaluate the impact of pre-interventional MR angiography (MRA) on prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) regarding workflow, radiation dose, and clinical outcome. Methods or Background: 259 patients (mean 68.28\u00b18.69; range 41-92) with severe benign prostatic syndrome (BPS) who had unde rgone PAE between 01/17 and 12/20, were retrospectively evaluated. Pr e-interventional MRA was performed in 137 patients vs. 122 patients without pre-interventional MRA. MR images were evaluated regarding PA origin, volumetr y of prostatic gland and ADC values. Impact of MRA on PAE workflow and radiation dose was examined. International-Prostate-Symptom-Score (IPS S), Quality-of-Life (QoL) and International-Index-of-Erectile-Function (IIEF) were evaluated before and after PAE to examine clinical improvement. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 197 Results or Findings: PA origin was identified in 100% of cases (31% vesicalis inf., sup., other origin). Significant diff erences regarding volume reduction (-20\u00b113 ml with MRA vs. -17\u00b19 ml without) and ADC value reduction (-78\u00b1111 10-6mm2/s with MRA vs. -45\u00b199 10-6 mm2/s w ithout) were detected. Workflow during PAE was changed because of pathological findings in MRA in 16 patients. Radiation dose (5518.54\u00b16677.97\u00b5Gym2 w ith MRA vs. 23963.50\u00b119792.25\u00b5Gym2 without) and fluoroscopy tim es (19.35\u00b19.01 min with MRA vs 27.45\u00b112.54 min without) were significa ntly lower with MRA. The MRA group showed significantly higher improvement i n IPSS reduction (-11\u00b18 points with MRA vs. -7\u00b19 points without) while QoL (-2\u00b11 points with MRA vs. - 2\u00b12 points without) and IEF (2\u00b110 points with MRA v s. 1\u00b111 points without) showed no significant differences. Conclusion: Pre-interventional MRA significantly improved workf low and clinical outcome of PAE while reducing radiation dose. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective study design.

Vogl: Nothing to disclose Nour-Eldin Abdelrehim Nour-Eldin Mohammed: Nothing to s, and long-term outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty f or endovascular treatment of syndrome (BCS ). Methods or Background: We retrospectively identified 51 patients (31 femal e, mean age 27.2\u00b19.1 years) with symptomatic short segment ( 30 mm) HV-type who underwent percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTBA) with/without stenting between October 2014 and January 2019. Baseline characteristics, technical success, clinical succes s, complications, and long- term outcomes were analysed. Results or Findings: The intervention was technically successful in 94.1% of cases (48/51) - 32 patients underwent PTBA and 16 patients underwent HV stenting. Procedure-related complications occurred in 14 patients (29.1%). The clinical success rate at 4 weeks was 91.7% (44/48). Nine patients underwent reintervention, six patients due to restenosis/occl usion and 3 patients with clinical failure. Among the 9 patients, 5 underwent HV stent insertion and 4 underwent TIPS insertion. The mean primary patency duration was 64.6\u00b119.9 months (CI, 58.5-70.8; range, 1.2-81.7 months). The cumulative 1-, 2-, and 5- year primary patency rates were 85.4, 74.5, and 58. 3%, respectively. The cumulative 1-, 2-, and 5-year secondary patency rat es were 93.8, 87.2, and 75%, respectively. The cumulative 1-, 2-, and 5-yea r survival rates were 97.9, 91.5, and 50%, respectively. Conclusion: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with and with out stenting is effective and achieves excellent long-term patency and survival rates in patients with symptomatic HV-type BCS. With its low er incidence of re- occlusion and higher clinical success rate, HV angi oplasty combined with stenting should be the preferred option, especially in patients with segmental HV-type BCS. Limitations: The limitations are the retrospective study design and the small sample size, especially the subset of patients who underwent HV stenting.

(DVA) provided higher contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and better lower extremity angiography than Digital Subtraction Angi ography (DSA). Our aim was to investigate whether DVA has similar quality advantage in Prostatic Artery Embolisation (PAE). The secondary aim was to explore whether the newly developed colour-coded DVA (ccDVA) technology might be useful in PAE. Methods or Background: We evaluated angiographic acquisitions of 30 patients (mean age 67.47, SD 9.76, range 42-82) und ergoing PAE. The CNR of DSA and DVA images was calculated and compared. Visual evaluation of DVA and DSA image quality was performed by four exp erienced interventional radiologists in a randomised blinded manner. The di agnostic value of DSA and ccDVA images was analysed by the experts using clinically relevant criteria in a paired comparison survey. Data were analysed by t he Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kendall W analysis or Fleiss Kappa an alysis was used to determine interrater agreement. Results or Findings: DVA images provided 4.12 times higher CNR than DSA (median, Q1-Q3 3.29-5.01). The visual evaluation sc ore of DVA images (4.42 \u00b1 0.05) was significantly higher than that of DSA (3. 38 \u00b1 0.07, p<0.01). The Kendall W analysis showed moderate but significant agreement in both groups. The overall diagnostic value of ccDVA images was judged superior to DSA in 82% of comparisons with an 85% The Fleiss Kappa was 0.41 data show that DVA provides higher CNR and bett er image quality also in PAE. This quality reserve might be used for dose management (reduction of radiation dose and contrast agent vol ume), and the ccDVA technology has a high potential to assist PAE inter ventions in the future. Limitations: The limitation is the single centre retrospective e valuation. Ethics committee approval: Waiver for informed consent has been obtained.

Svarc*\u00b9, T. Hagen\u00b2, M. Bl\u00e4ckberg\u00b3, Purpose: To evaluate the effects of center experience and a variety of patient- and procedure-related factors on patient radiation exposure during prostatic artery embolisation (PAE) in three Scandinavian centres with different PAE protocols and levels of experience. Understanding f actors that influence radiation exposure is crucial in effective patient selection and procedural planning. Methods or Background: Data were collected retrospectively for 352 consecutive PAE procedures from January 2015 to June 2020 at the three centres. Dose area product [DAP (Gy\u00b7cm2)] was selec ted as the primary outcome measure of radiation exposure. Multiple pat ient- and procedure- related explanatory variables were collected and co rrelated with the outcome variable. A multiple linear regression model was built to determine significant predictors of increased or decreased radiation exposure as reflected by DAP. Results or Findings: There was considerable variation in DAP between the centres. Intended unilateral PAE (p = 0.03) and eac h 10 additional patients treated (p = 0.02) were significant predictors of decreased DAP. Conversely, increased patient body mass index (BMI, p < 0.001), fluoroscopy time (p < 0.001) and of digital angiography (DSA) acquisitions significant predictors of increased DAP . Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 198 Conclusion: To minimise patient radiation exposure during PAE r adiologists may, in collaboration with clinicians, consider uni lateral embolisation, pre- interventional CTA for procedure planning, using pr edominantly anteroposterior (AP) projections and limiting the use of cone beam CT (CBCT) and fluoroscopy. Limitations: The results of the statistical analysis might have been affected by the retrospective study design. Further, radiation dose parameters were obtained from the imaging system and not directly f rom dosimeters, and therefore should be considered as estimates of the true dose received by the patients. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approvals (31-1521-421 in Denmark, 2020-04211 in Sweden and 20/14473 in Norway) were obtained.

The purpose of this s tudy was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the aforementioned intervent ion and also to determine the incidence of complications. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included a total of 56 patients with small pleural lesions, with a thickne ss of 10 mm, who underwent the transthoracic needle biopsy at the Department o f Radiology, Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, from January 2015 to July 2021. One of the inclusion criteria for this study was a pleural effusion. Results or Findings: Pleural effusion was considered a protective factor for complications since no pneumothorax was noted. The sensitivity of CT-guided transthoracic biopsy (TTB) in our study was 84.6 %, specificity 100 %, PPV 100 %, and NPV 73.9 %, while diagnostic accuracy was 89.3 %. The overall diagnostic contribution of TTB in our study is comp arable with the results of the other reports. Conclusion: Our study shows a major diagnostic contribution and a zero complication rate in the presence of pleural effusi on. These results indicate that CT-guided TTB can be considered the optimal method for the diagnosis of small suspected malignant pleural lesions. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: The Ethics Committee has approved the conduct of this research. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

A pilot study to evaluate knee IONA performed by interventional radi ologist *F. Arrigoni*, M. G. F. Masciocchi; L'Aquila/IT Purpose: Trained musculoskeletal radiologists ensure high level of diagnostic accuracy in MRI of the knee. However, orthopedists still complain of reduced sensibility and specificity in some pathologies inv olving cartilage, synovium and meniscus. For this reason, since the '90s orthopedi sts have introduced an arthroscope with reduced caliber, disposable and po rtable kits to turn diagnostic arthroscopy into an in-office procedure (IONA), routinely performed by orthopedists. Interventional radiologist could be a qualified operator to perform this procedure: knowledge of the MRI anatom y and manual skills allow them to have a short learning curve and to focus their attention on the MRI's dubious findings. Moreover, such procedure can be c oupled with biopsies if these are needed to confirm the diagnosis (for exam ple, synovial biopsy in case of clinically unclear arthritis). Methods or Background: Seven procedures of knee IONA were carried out by an interventional radiologist as first operator assisted by a trained orthopedic surgeon. All patients have been previous ly undergone to high-field MRI with uncertain results, not consistent with pai nful clinical conditions. All procedures were performed using local anesthesia wi th the patient awake. One arthroscopy was combined with synovial biopsy to confirm diagnosis prior to total synovectomy. Results or Findings: No complications were recorded. The procedures required one-day hospitalisation; no limitation in function were recorded after the procedure. In four cases, pathological findings not visible on MRI were detected (three meniscal tears and one mucoid degeneration of the ACL). Biopsy was successfully performed. Conclusion: The interventional radiology setting seems adequate to carry out IONA of the knee. The radiologist, in fact, provide s the patients with a definitive diagnosis quickly obtained by submitting them to mi nimally invasive diagnostic procedures shortly after a not diriment MRI.

Methods or Background: Clinical data of 62 patients with rectal cancer wer e retrospectively analysed. Before surgery, all patients received NCRT, and underwent MSCT as well as MRI successively. Diagnos tic accuracy and agreements of the two methods in T and N restaging of rectal cancer after NCRT were assessed with the postoperative pathologi cal staging as golden standard. Results or Findings: The total diagnostic accuracy of MSCT and MRI for T restaging were 51.6% and 41.9%, respectively, and no statistical difference was found between them (P>0.05). The two methods failed to accurately diagnose ypT0~1 staging, and the wrong staging was mainly over staging of ypT0~2. The diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI for N retaging were 56.5% and 53.2%, respectively, and no statistical difference was found between them (P>0.05). There were fair agreements between MSCT a nd MRI P<.001). Conclusion: MRI not better than MSCT in the diagnosis of preoperative T and N restaging of rectal cancer after NCRT. Theref ore, in order to save medical resources, MRI may be unnecessary sometimes . Limitations: Firstly, our series included a small number of ypT0 and ypT4 lesions. Secondly, while this study is a retrospect ive case analysis, we only studied the conventional sequence of MRI, and did n ot study the new sequence as well as functional imaging.

The aim was to test this scoring system in a multicentre setting among multiple readers with different experience levels, and compare it to a more simplified and specified 4-point risk score, designed for the purpose of thi s study. Methods or Background: 22 international radiologists (5 rectal MR-experts, reviewed the pre-CRT MRIs of n=90 patients (from 10 centres) to estimate the chance of achieving a complete response (CR) post-CRT. Readers first appl ied the 5-point 3=likely; 4=highly likely to achieve C R). They then assigned a risk score from 0-4 with 1-point for the presence of eac h of the following adverse features: bulky (cT3cd-4) tumour, obvious mesorectal obvious extramural vascular inva sion. Diagnostic performance to predict CR was assessed using ROC-cu rves, interobserver agreement (IOA) was calculated using Kendall's coef ficient (W). Readers were asked to indicate their preferred scoring method. Results or Findings: Mean (+ranges) area under the ROC-curve (AUC) for the 5-point confidence score was 0.67 (0.60-0.76) the MR-experts 0.61 (0.52-0.73) and 0.62 (0.52-0.70), respectively. IOA was for both methods (W0.65 for the confidence score; W0.66 for the 4-point risk score), but higher for the MR-experts (W0.76 a nd W0.78, respectively). Most readers (55%) favoured the 4-point risk score. Conclusion: Diagnostic performance to predict a complete response was moderate with similar results for the 5-point confi dence score and 4-point risk- score. Diagnostic performance and IOA were better f or the more experienced readers. Limitations: The limitation is that the study was retrospective. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Curvo-Semedo\u00b3, s\u00b9; \u00b9Amsterdam/NL, \u00b2Montpellier/FR, \u00b3Coimbra/PT Purpose: To assess the impact of MR image quality on diagnos tic performance to assess rectal tumour response after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on restaging T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI . Methods or Background: As part of a previous trial, 22 radiologists assess ed response to CRT in a multicenter patient group of n=90 (from 10 centers with varying acquisition protocols) on post-CRT T2W-MRI (using the mr tumor regression grade (mrTRG)) and a combination of T2W- MRI+DWI (using a modified-mrTRG incorporating DWI-findings), respect ively. Impact of image quality on average sensitivity/specificity/NPV/PPV/ accuracy to diagnose a complete response versus residual tumour was calcul ated using mixed model linear regression. Image quality was graded for eac h MRI with a 0-6-point score, which was designed for the purpose of this s tudy (based on current guidelines), according to the following criteria: f or T2W-MRI high b-value b800, (5) sufficient signal to noise ratio, (6) absence of significant artefacts. A total score of 3 was classified as below- standard quality. Results or Findings: Quality of 38/90 (42%) cases was classified as below- standard, which had a significant negative impact o n the readers' average specificity (effect size -0.096, P<0.001) and overall accuracy (effect size - 0.045, P <0.001), with similar effects when calculated for the mrTRG (T2W- MRI) and modified-mrTRG (T2W-MRI+DWI) scorings. Ave 77% the below-st andard quality scans. Conclusion: MR image quality has a significant effect on radiol ogists' diagnostic performance to assess response of rectal tumours to chemoradiotherapy on restaging MRI. Optimising imag e acquisition is therefore crucial to ensure optimal diagnostic performance. Limitations: Retrospective; non-validated quality scoring system . Ethics committee approval: Yes.

To evaluate the best DLCT parameters and diagnostic phase for the diagnosis of vascular nerv e invasion, in order to expect DLCT to predict the biological behaviour of rectal cancer before operation. Methods or Background: A total of 70 patients with rectal cancer were included. DLCT data of arterial phase and venous ph ase of rectal cancer were obtained. Vascular nerve invasion, degree of differ entiation and lymph node metastasis were obtained. In the results there were significant differences in arterial phase 40 keV VMI. Results or Findings: DLCT data of arterial phase and venous phase of rec tal cancer were obtained. Vascular nerve invasion, degr ee of differentiation and lymph node metastasis were obtained by histopatholo gical histochemical evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used for statistical analysis. Conclusion: NIC ,40 keV, anhydrous iodine density and Eff-Z of rectal cancer in arteriovenous phase have more clinical value than conventional 120 Kvp PI and VNC in the diagnosis of vascular invasion. It i s concluded that the diagnostic efficacy of portal phase spectral CT par ameters in the evaluation of vascular invasion is higher than that in arterial phase. Eff-Z in venous phase can reflect the neurological invasion, differentiat ion and lymph node metastasis of rectal cancer. DLCT multi-parameter quantitative analysis provides a new non-invasive imaging method for preoperative biological behavior evaluation of rectal cancer.

Je*, S. H. Cho, H. S. Oh, A. N. Seo, S. H. Kim, G. Choi; Daegu/KR (sepia1411@naver.com) Purpose: To investigate the potential usefulness of MDCT bas ed tumour regression grading that evaluates response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer. Methods or Background: In a retrospective cohort study, 53 patients who ha d colon cancer treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analysed for CT tumour regression grade (TRG) and pathologic TRG. T umour volume change was also assessed by a 3D slicer. We assessed the a ssociation between pathologic TRG coefficient. Independent t-test and chi-square test were used to determine associations between pathologic response and charac teristics of the patients. ROC curve analysis was used to compare the predicti on accuracy between CT-based TRG and the volume change model. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 200 Results or Findings: The CT-based in ctTRG (P<0.01, and 0.794 in volume change model (P<0.01, criter ion - 27.1). The difference between the two methods was n ot significant (P=0.53). AUC value to predict pathologic complete remission was 0.908 in ctTRG and 0.964 in the volume change model. The difference between the two methods was also not significant (P=0.45). Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between ctTRG and pathologic TRG. There are no significant differences in perfor mance between ctTRG and volume change model for predicting pTRG and pathologic complete remission. This study suggested a novel tumor regression gradi ng system by using MDCT. Limitations: The number of the patients was too small to study. This study compared only CT imaging and pathologic result, wit hout direct comparison with survival.

Statistical analysis was performed with A NOVA, systematic changes in features were described by linear and polynomial regression models. Results or Findings: ANOVA revealed significant differences in 13 TF between normal tissue and lesions, compared to 9 TF between benign and malignant lesions. Most TF showed significant diffe rences (p <0.05) and in early dynamic and subtraction image datasets, which seem therefore particularly suitable for TA. TF associated with ti ssue homogeneity were suitable to discriminate healthy parenchyma and les ions, whereas run-length features were more suitable to discriminate benign and malignant lesions. Run- length nonuniformity (RLN) was the only feature abl e to distinguish between all three classes with an area under the curve of 88.3 %. Depending on the individual TF, characteristic changes were observed with systematic increase or decrease for most TF with mostly polynomial behaviour. Mean values for the coefficient of determination were higher during subtraction sequences compared of breast lesions show characteristic changes during dynamic breast-MRI creating new biomarkers. Early dynamic a nd subtraction datasets are particularly suitable for texture analysis of l esions. Limitations: This was a single-centre retrospective study. We only analysed the influence of 34 TF.

Methods or Background: We reviewed all digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening examinations between March 2021 and March 2022 that were double read (without consensus) by radiologists concurrently with AI support at our hospital. The AI system used in this study categorises each exam into three categor ies (low, intermediate, elevated) representing the probability of cancer an d highlights suspicious areas (1-100 score). We computed the number of examinatio ns, cancers, recalls and positive predictive value (PPV) of the recalled stu dies globally and in each AI category, as well as the overall cancer detection r ate (CDR) and recall rate (RR) during the study period. We compared these dat a with the same 12 months period one year earlier (CDR 5.5/1000, RR 6. 1%, PPV 9%), prior to the implementation of AI, using the Chi2 test. Results or Findings: 11998 screening examinations were intermediate: 3730 (31%) and 1 (0.9%), intermediate: 32 AI and PPV were 9/1000 (+3.5/1000, (+5.6%, p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion: AI used concurrently in clinical practice is able t o stratify the examinations according to probability of cancer. AI increases cancer detection rate and PPV of the recalled women. Limitations: A longer time frame, including interval cancers, is needed to support these findings. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Cassano; Milan/IT (giulia.signorelli@unimi.it) Purpose: Performance of AI networks to 1. classify and 2. detect microcalcifications in DM to develop a tool for imp roving reading efficiency of DM. Methods or Background: A trained AI system may have clinical value for early detection of cancer, microcalcifications clas sification, lowering of recall rates and for reducing the number of missed cancers and unnecessary biopsies. From 484 patients undergoing DM (2019-2021) and stereotactic- guided biopsies, we extracted 1036 images (486 micr ocalcifications clusters) to train AI networks. Data collection includes a. prep rocessing and segmentation of microcalcifications, b. regions of interest (ROI ) specification, c. feature extraction and classification. ROIs were considered on \"microcalcification\" type patches (MP) regardless of histological outcome. Th e same images were used for obtaining patches without microcalcifications ( nMP). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A validation set, 10% test set. Results were obtained by evaluating t he performance of the networks on a testing set composed for aim 1 by 111 4 patches (517 benign, 597 malignant) and for aim 2 by 2288 patches equall y distributed. Three networks performed differently; the best network showed 81% of accuracy, 89% of AUC for aim 1; and 95% of accuracy, 99% of A UC for aim 2. The increased complexity of the network used doesn't follow an increase in performance in terms of accuracy or AUC. Conclusion: AI networks can be appropriately trained to classif y and detect microcalcifications in mammography. However, AI dev elopment is further required, and the result should be tested in clinic al practice. Limitations: Not applicable.

Lenaers, H. C. Woodruff, M. S. A. Keek, R. potential of radiomics models based on different post- contrast phases of pretreatment dynamic contrast-en hanced (DCE) MRI for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer patients. Methods or Background: A dual-centre cohort consisting of triple-negative patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy that underwent pretreatment DCE-MRI between 2011-2020 was retrospectively collected. After manual tumour segmentation, MR images were preprocessed to homogenise the data. A total of 100 quantitative features were extracted from each phase using pyradiomics. Random forest prediction models were d eveloped for each post- contrast phase separately. Because of our limited s ample size, a nested cross- validation strategy was used for model development. The performance regarding pCR prediction was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results or Findings: A total of 66 patients with 69 tumours were included from two centres. For each model, three potentially predictive features were selected. Radiomics models based on pretreatment MR images of the first, second and third post-contrast phase yielded AUC values from pretreatment DCE- MRI may be associated with pCR in triple-negative breast cancer. This association appears to be higher for our model based on delayed post-contrast phase pretreatment DCE-MRI compared to the models based on early post-contrast DCE-MRI. Future radiomics studies should include mi d- and post-treatment DCE-MRI from larger cohorts for further improvement of pCR prediction. Limitations: Additional research on a larger multi-centric datas et is needed to further establish the predictive performance of our models.

C. Guner*\u00b9, Purpose: Evaluate performance of two different versions of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for predicting risk of dev eloping interval cancer (IC) within 6 to 24 months after negative screening exam . Methods or Background: This retrospective study was performed with a data cohort between 2016-2019 derived from women between 40-69 who attended a national screening programme. Negative screening exams of 323 women who developed IC before the next screening round were collected. The pathological outcome was retrieved from the national cancer registry. All mammograms were processed by an AI cancer detection system (Transpara, ScreenPoint Medical v1.6and v1.7.1), assigning a sc ore between 1-10 to the exam. The performance of the AI system for detectio n of IC on negative screening exams was estimated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and sensitivi ty at 90% and 95.0% specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results or Findings: More than half of all IC (56.6% and 65.9% respectiv ely for versions 1.6 and 1.7.1) were flagged by the highest AI score 10. The AUCs of AI to detect signs of IC on negative screening e xams were 0.86 and 0.81 and the sensitivity was 65.9% and 56.6% at a specif icity of 90.0% for versions respectively (p<0.01). Highest performance of AI was found for cases that were diagnosed within six months after screening (AUC: 0.82), compared to cases diagnosed 6 to 24 months after screening (AUC: 0.57). Conclusion: AI has the potential to reduce the stable high rate of interval cancer in case AI is applied as a second or third i ndependent reader within a national breast cancer screening programme. Moreove r, further developments of AI promise increasing performance towards predic tion of interval cancer. Limitations: The limitation is the study's retrospective design.

Landsmann*\u00b9, C. M. Ruppert\u00b9, J. To investigate whether features derived from textur e analysis (TA) can distinguish breast density (BD) in spiral breas t-computed-tomography (BCT). Methods or Background: 10000 were categorised using a four-level density-scale (A-D). After definition of regions of interest (ROIs), 19 texture features (TF) were calc ulated to analyse the voxel grey-level distribution in the included image area. Data was statistically evaluated using ANOVA and cluster analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the potential of TA for B D assessment. A human readout then was performed on a subset of 60 images to evaluate reliability of the proposed feature set. Results or Findings: Of the 19 features, four first-order features and s even second-order features showed significant correlation with BD and were therefore selected for further analysis. Multinomial logistic regression revealed an overall accuracy of 80% for BD assessment. The m ajority of features systematically increased or decreased with denser breast tissue. Skewness (- 0.81), as a first-order feature and grey-level nonuniformity (GLN, - 0.59), as a second-order feature, showed the strongest correlat ion with BD and appeared to be independent of other TF. Mean values of skewness, and GLN decreased linearly from density-level A to D. Run-length nonuniformity (RLN), as a second-order feature, showed moderate correlation w ith BD, but was considered redundant because of its correlation wit h GLN. All other TF evaluated showed only weak correlation with BD (range - 0.49 to 0.49, p- values <0.001) and were therefore neglected. Conclusion: TA in BCT examinations might be a useful approach i n the assessment of BD and may serve as an observer-independent, objective tool. Limitations: This was a retrospective single-centre study. We only examined the influence of 19 TF. Ethics committee approval: In this study, patients signed informed consent.

It is crucial to detect aggressive IBC tim ely, while overdiagnosis of indolent lesions could be reduced. As breast cancer molecular subtypes are widely used in prognostication, we investigated if these subtypes could be predicted by radiomic features using the screening mammograms of women diagnosed with IBC. Methods or Background: In this consecutive cohort study, screening mammograms of 743 women diagnosed with screen-detec ted IBC were used. Using information from pathology reports, tumours w ere considered indolent if they were hormone receptor-positive, Her2-negative and well B-like\", \"Her2-enriched- like\",\"basal-like\") were aggressive. Tum ours annotated in both mammographic views. Using pyradiomics, 2,748 radiomics- features were extracted from intra- and peritumoral regions. After feature reduction, an extreme gradient boosting classifier was trained to predict whether a tumour was indolent or aggressive. The model performance was validated using the area under the receiver operati ng characteristics curve (AUC), using 10 fold, 100x repeated nested cross-validation. Results or Findings: The mean cross-validated AUC was 0.67 (SD\u00b10.04) to distinguish indolent (N=302) from aggressive IBC (N =430). For each cross- validation fold, the model was trained based on 30 features to prevent overfitting. 19 features were selected during more than 50% of repeats. They were related to pixel intensity, shape and texture of both the intra- and peritumoral regions. Conclusion: Radiomic features on screening mammograms show a mo dest performance in distinguishing indolent from aggress ive IBCs. To assess precisely their prognostic value, external validati on and investigating other endpoints (e.g. breast cancer-specific survival) ar e required.

CA/US Purpose: To assess the added value of using a commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) tool in the detection of traumatic radiological findings in emergency settings. In particular, we investigat ed the role of this tool in case of discrepancies between the emergency physician an d radiologist reports. Methods or Background: We retrospectively analysed 2580 consecutive musculoskeletal radiological studies (not including the spine or skull). All patients were admitted to the emergency department (ED) at Centre Hospitalier de Valenciennes between 07/2020 and 10/ 2020. All images were processed anonymously using the Chest|MSK AI tool ( Arterys Inc.) to classify each patient according to the presence/absence of a ny of the following imaging findings: fracture, dislocation, and elbow fat pad. ED clinical reports were analysed to independently classify each patient acc ording to presence/absence of such findings, while the radiol ogist clinical report was used as a reference standard. We compared the AI tool, ED, and radiologist classifications to investigate the added value of using this AI tool to mitigate disagreements among physicians. Results or Findings: In 1716/2580 (67%) patients, both ED and radiologic al reports were available. In 1519/1716 (89%) cases th e physicians agreed on the patient classification. In 1351/1519 (89%) pati ents this result was confirmed by the AI tool. The ED classification did not match the radiologist one in 197/1716 (11%) patients. Notably, 178/197 (90%) of disagreements would have been resolved by the AI model, which agreed wi th the radiologist. Conclusion: The AI model showed promising potential in mitigati ng image misinterpretation in ED settings. Future studies wi ll focus on confirming these results in multiple centres and prospective patient cohorts. Limitations: Binary classification; single centre.

Chung\u00b9, J. Lo uis, MO/US Purpose: We evaluate the agreement between AI and expert rea ders for bone age (BA) assessment according to the Greulich & Pyl e method on a cohort of children from the clinical workflow. Methods or Background: The radiological determination of bone age (BA) from a left-hand x-ray continues to be the referenc e standard for skeletal maturity assessment related to short- or long statu re, premature or delayed puberty, and underlying conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are becoming more prevalent due to the subjectivity and time-consuming nature of BA assessment. Radiographs of 342 patients were analyzed retrospectively (178 males years, 165 females aged 2 to 16 years). Sampling was performed across multiple sites in the USA associated with Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) School of Medicine. Three US board certified pediatric radiologists who were blinded to chronological age made reads of BA using the Greulich & Pyle (GP) method independent of each other and an AI-software. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 203 Performance of AI to readers was assessed using of Bland-Altman limits of agreement (LOA), orthogonal linear regression and i nterchangeability. Results or Findings: Bland-Altman assessment revealed a mean difference between readers and AI of -0.72 (95% CI -1.46; 0.02 ) months. Orthogonal linear regression revealed no significant proportional bias across ages (slope = 1.02 [95% CI 1.00; 1.03]). AI was found to be inter changeable with readers based on an equivalence index of -5.8 months. Conclusion: A fully automated AI software shows agreement with expert readers in BA assessment on a multi-site cohort of US children and adolescents, suggesting AI integration into the radiology workflow is possible and could lead to more efficient bone age reading.

I. Erne*\u00b9, P. \u00b2Leipzig/DE Purpose: The accurate assessment of lower limb alignment from X-rays is essential for therapy indication and postoperative quality control, but suffers from time-consuming manual measurements. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate a fully automated, artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm for measuring lower limb alignment. Methods or Background: In total, 50 preoperative, weight-bearing, anterior - posterior full-leg radiographs were manually measur ed by two expert human raters (R1 and R2) and twice by one of these raters (R1a, R1b). Additionally, 47 postoperative images (total knee arthroplasty) w ere measured twice by R1. All radiographs were analysed by the AI-algorithm ( R-AI) consisting of five convolutional neural networks, which were trained t o determine between the anatomical femur axis and mechanical tibia axis. Agreement between human raters and AI was analysed by mean errors (95% confidence interval [C I]) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for absol ute agreement (ICC>0.75 considered as excellent). Results or Findings: ICC values for intra- (range 0.97-0.99) and inter-r ater reliability (0.88-0.98) between human raters reflec t excellent agreement. The AI algorithm can determine all parameters in 96% of pre- and 94% of postoperative images with excellent ICC values (Pre OP-range: 0.82-0.99; PostOP: 0.86-0.99). Exemplary for R1a fully automated AI algorithm determines lower limb alignment pre- and postoperatively with excellent r eliability and accuracy.

M. Schwarz, S. Simon, B. Frank, Dominkus, J. radiographs (LLR) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is highly dependent on expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology may help automate and standardise this process and allows analysis of large datasets. The aim of this study was to develop an A I-software which automatically evaluates limb alignment following TK A. Methods or Background: The AI-system was trained on over 15,000 LLRs. In the evaluation cohort 200 calibrated LLRs of eight different common unconstrained and constrained knee systems were analysed. Accuracy and reproducibility of the software were compared to ex pert readers regarding the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) and femoral and tibial c omponent angles. To assess the software's ability of handling big data 1460 LLRs were evaluated in our testing cohort and the distribution of HKA angl e values were investigated. Results or Findings: The AI-software was reproducible on 96 % of LLR and showed excellent reliability in all measured angles (ICC > 0.90). Excellent results were found for primary unconstrained TKAs. In constrained TKAs landmark setting on the femoral and tibial component failed nine times (12.5%). The mean HKA angle in our testing cohort w as 0.3\u00b0 \u00b1 3.1\u00b0 (n=1460). Conclusion: The AI-software allows for accurate automatic measurement of implant alignment following primary and revision TK As and is capable of handling large datasets. Visual inspection of resul ts detected that poor AI performance on constrained TKAs was due to the hinge pin, suggesting that the AI requires further training with more representative images. Limitations: Although the AI-software was trained on LLRs from different sites, radiographs in the evaluation and testing cohort or iginated from only one institution.

Iuga*\u00b9, Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate cl inical feasibility for combining compressed SENSE (CS) with a newly developed deep learning- based algorithm (CS-AI) using Convolutional Neural Networks to accelerate 2D imaging of the knee. Methods or Background: In this prospective study, 20 healthy volunteers were scanned with a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Ingenia, P hilips, Best, The Netherlands). All subjects received a standard fat saturated sagittal 2D proton density (PD) sequence without any acceleration (CS1) four additional acceleration levels: CS2, CS3, CS4 and CS6. Images were reconstructed with the conventional CS and the new CS-AI algorithm for all acceleration factors. Two independent, blinded readers rated all images using a 5-point-Likert scale. Additionally, signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to -noise ratio were calculated. The Friedman and Dunn\u00b4s multiple comparisons test w as used for ordinal data while ANOVA and the Tukey Kramer test was applied f or continuous data. Cohen\u00b4s kappa was calculated for interrater reliabi lity. Results a 64% reduction in scan time compared to the fully unaccelerated sequence (CS-AI3). Except for artifacts, the subjective rati ng was significantly higher for CS-AI than conventional CS for at least one acceler ation factor. Sequences reconstructed using AI were rated better than the t ime-equivalent conventional CS for almost all acceleration factors. Signal-to-n oise and contrast-to-noise were significantly better for all CS-AI reconstruct ions (all p<0.05). Conclusion: The AI-based reconstruction outperformed the conventional CS in all criteria for all tested acceleration factors resulting in faster imaging with unchanged image quality (-64%). Limitations: The study sample size was small and included only h ealthy volunteers. This work didn't analyse the feasibilit y of CS-AI to accelerate 3D imaging of the knee.

Methods or Background: Thirty-one healthy volunteers underwent 1.5T MRI examination of lumbar spine from April to September 2021. Protocol acquisition comprised sagittal T1- and T2-weighted and axial T2-weighted images . All sequences were acquired with both DLR and standard protocols. The quantitative image analysis with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contr ast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was performed by a radiologist drawing regions of inter est (ROIs) on the fourth lumbar vertebral body and in the intervertebral dis c (L4/5); the qualitative image analysis between the two protocols was perfor med by two radiologists in blind. Scanning times were also recorded and compar ed. Results or Findings: The SNR of DLR algorithm was higher in all sequences in the vertebrae and discs compared to standard ima ges (all p<0.001). The CNR of the DLR algorithm was superior to conventional T2-weighted images (p<0.001), whereas no significant differences were reported for T1-weighted (p=0.67) and STIR images (p=0.40). Qualitative anal ysis showed that DLR had greater overall quality in all sequences (all p<0.001), with an inter-rater agreement of 0.69 (0.63-0.76). Total protocol scanning time was lower in DLR compared to standard protocol (average acquisition time 6.33 vs 13.06 minutes, p<0.001), resulting in acquisition time of 49%. Conclusion: DLR algorithm applied to 1.5T MRI is a feasible met hod for lumbar spine imaging providing morphologic sequences with a higher SNR, CNR and image quality, compared with standard proto col with a significant scanning time reduction.

Wo a Compressed-Sensing Artificial Intelli gence Framework (CSAI) to accelerate MRI acquisition of the ankle. Methods or Background: Ankles of thirty patients were scanned (15 female, age 19-84 years) C-SENSE only (12:44 min), CSAI with an acceleration factor of 4.6-5.3 (6:45 min, CSAI2x), and CSAI with an acceleration factor of 6. 9-7.7 (4:46 min, CSAI3x). Moreover, a high-resolution axial T2-w sequence was obtained using CSAI with the same scan duration of the C-SENSE sequence. Readings were performed independently by two radiologists grading the depiction and presence of abnormalities. Signal-to-noise and cont rast-to-noise were calculated. The Wilcoxon-signed-rank test and Cohen's Kappa were used to compare CSAI with conventional C-SENSE sequences. Results or Findings: The correlation between the two sequences was perfect for C-SENSE and CSAI2x ( = 1.0) and excellent for C-SENSE and CSAI3x (=0.86-1.0). No significant differences were found f or the depiction of structures between C-SENSE and CSAI2x and the same abnormalities were detected in both sequences. For CSAI3x the depiction was graded significantly lower (p<0.05) compared to C-SENSE, though most abnormalities were also detected. For CSAI2x contrast-to-noise fluid/muscle was higher compared to C-SENSE (p<0.05), while no differences were found f or other investigated tissues. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise were significantly higher for (p<0.05). The high-resol ution axial T2-w sequence specifically improved the depiction of ten dons, bone and the tibial nerve (p<0.05). Conclusion: Acquisition times can be reduced by ~50% using CSAI without decreasing diagnostic image quality. Reducing acqui sition times by ~66% is feasible, but should be reserved for specific patie nts. The depiction of specific structures is improved using a high-resolution axial T2-w CSAI sequence.

Axial T2w images of the thoracic spine were evaluated and graded by subspeciality radiologists (training set) using dichotomous class ification (low vs high-grade). A two-step DL model was developed with the training set. Firstly, Faster R- CNN with Resnet101 detects a region of interest (RO I). Secondly, a convolutional network with Resnet50 projects ROIs i nto a high-dimensional embedding space (ES). Class prototype of Bilsky scores are assigned in the ES and the model learns with distance-based cross-e ntropy loss. The test set was labelled by the DL model, a radiation oncologis t (RO), spine surgeon (SS) and a neuroradiologist (NR). Gradings were then com pared against a musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologist with 10 years experience (reference standard). Results or Findings: The DL model had 95.5% accuracy in identifying high - grade Bilsky ESCC, with sensitivity of 88.9% and sp ecificity DL model for Bilsky grading was successfully buil t with accuracy comparable to specialists. Limitations: Cervical and lumbar regions have degenerative changes, contributing to stenosis in addition to metastatic disease.

Pizarro*\u00b9, D. G\u00f3mez-Andr\u00e9s\u00b2, J. Diaz\u00b9, L. Suazo Purpose: Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by mutations in genes involved in muscular s tructure and function. They are clinically characterised by muscle weaknes s and dystrophic changes in muscle histology. MRI has been used to support t he diagnosis of MD because of its sensitivity to detect muscle oedema and fat infiltration. Random Forest (RF) has been used to characterise fat infil tration patterns in MD, however, no studies have compared different supervi sed machine learning (ML) models for MD prediction. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, we compared different supervised ML models trained on a published Europea n database, and then tested them on a small convenience series of geneti cally confirmed patients with calpainopathy. Nine hundred and seventy-two European patients corresponding to ten different muscular dystrophies , and six Latin American patients with calpainopathy were included. Linear D iscriminant Analysis, Logistic Regressions, Random Forests, Support Na\u00efve Bayes (KN) were compared. Results or Findings: Random Forests outperformed the other models in the European database (96% accuracy), however, it failed to predict the diagnosis in Latin American patients. Even if KN and NB didn' t reach the same accuracy as RF in the European database, they outperformed t he other models in Latin American patients (83% accuracy). Conclusion: ML models are suitable tools to aid in the diagnosi s of MD, however, real-world use requires more robust and generalisable models. Limitations: Our preliminary data show that KN and NB seem to be more robust methods compared to RF, at least in this sma ll series of patients with calpainopathy.

R. Ardon; Paris/FR Purpose: To evaluate an automatic and generic technique to v isually explain the decisions of deep learning classifiers trained to identify healthy from pathological cases on knee MRI problems. Methods or Background: Binary classifiers were respectively trained on 23538 and 4458 knee MRI studies to detect meniscal tear and identify pathological cartilages. On test data sets of 5090 and 764 these classifiers achieved 0.84 and 0.85 AUCs on meniscal and cartilage pathologies respectively. On the same training sets, we trained visual explainers to highlight relevant regions for the classifiers on a given input image. For evaluation, we first assessed if the visual explain er can localise relevant regions matching clinician expectations. One expert clinician annotated 71 (respectively 38) test images with boxes tightly bo unding pathological regions for meniscal (respectively cartilage) pathologies. We measured the distance between centres of the ground truth and a derived b ox from visual explanation respectively. We also reported the localisation acc uracy defined as the success rate of this explanation to contain the ground truth centre. To solely evaluate visual explanation fidelity to classifiers , we assessed if pixels with the highest values in explanation maps had also the gre atest impact on the classifiers when their value was changed. Results or Findings: We reported respective localization accuracies of 0.845 and 0.705 and distance between centres of 5.61+/-4. 56mm and 8.21+/-5.9mm. Regarding visual explanation fidelity to classifier s, our method outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in 99% of our tests. Conclusion: Our visual explanation method accurately highlights crucially important regions for classifiers. It thus contributes to classifiers evaluation by non experts and create confidence in their clinical use. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Vernuccio; Padova/IT RPS 1001b-2 Is there any role for multiparametric MRI of the li ver in follow-up of liver- patients? Follow-up of liver-transplant patients is a complex process in which many purposes should be fulfilled. Imaging mainly plays a role in detecting malignancy with ultrasound being the method of choi ce. There are surprisingly little data on the most effective method of follow- up. Our study aims to evaluate multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) of the liver as a tool in follow-up of transplant recipients. Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 237 liver-transplant recipients (169 male, 68 female; 54.4 years mean age). 91/237 patients had multiple mpMRI scans resulting in a total of 336 MR I investigations being evaluated in this study. All patients received mpMR I for follow-up consisting of Gd-EOB-DTPA contrast-enhanced imaging, MR-elastography, quantification of liver iron (R2*), fat (PDFF) and liver function wit h relative liver enhancement (RLE). These parameters were calculated and documented. Further, all examinations were re-evaluated with regard to pathological findings with a special focus on malignancies. Results or Findings: 65/336 showed steatosis of the transplant (PDFF>5.6%). In only two patients mild iron overload (R2*>160, i.e. >75umol/g iron) was detected. Fibrosis stage F1 or higher was found in 58/336 with 27/58 showing relevant fibrosis stage F2 or higher. In only 1/27 F2 fibrosis patients concomitant steatosis was found. RLE had a very weak correlation with MRE (r=0.16) and PDFF (r=0.04). In only three cases mal ignancy detected MRI: HCC, metastasis of a neuroendocrine tumour and cholangiocellular carcinoma. three were also detected during routine sonography. Conclusion: mpMRI is an over-the-top method for liver-transplant patients concerning detection of malignancy. Nevertheless, t he quantification and diagnosis of fibrosis or steatosis of the transplant are relevant features that could influence management in this patient cohort. Limitations: The limitation is the study's retrospective character. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Reading DCE-MRI data is time- consuming and error-prone since images at different time points need to be evaluated. The aim of this study is to condense contrast agent behaviour of liver lesions in a simple, quick-to-grasp way. Methods or Background: Experiments were conducted on GRASP-MRI scans after the application of gadoxetate disodium contrast agent (CA). The mean temporal resolution was 6.5 - 10.5 s with larg er intervals towards the end. 7 patients with previously untreated, hypervas cularised hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; LI-RADS 4 - 5) and 5 patients with benign, late-enhancing lesions were analysed. Using custom-made software, the contrast signal of each voxel was normalised using the signal of surro unding liver tissue to find voxels with aberrant signal behaviour. Within HCC l esions, the mean normalised signal in the early arterial and portal- venous phases was extracted to derive a template signal for early enhancement. To find voxels with similar contrast behaviour, a heatmap was generated by corr elating each voxel with the early enhancement template signal. For lesions with late enhancement, an analogous procedure was employed. Results or Findings: Preliminary results of our experiments show that hypervascularised, early-enhancing lesions and late-enhancing, CA-retaining lesions demarcate respective heatmaps . By thresholding the heatmaps, accurate masks of homogenous lesions may be generated. Early experiments with other types of lesions (e.g. cysts , lesions with CA-washout) showed promising results. Conclusion: Using simple methods, distinct and potentially diag nostic patterns of contrast behaviour as well as areas with aberrant spatiotemporal signal behaviour may be visualised in GRASP-DCE-MRI. Limitations: The limitations are the experimental design and preliminary results. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Garcovich*, L. Riccardi, M. A. Zocco, M. E. Ain ora, F. Pizzolante, De Matthaeis, A. Gasbarrini, M. Pompili; Rome/IT (matteogarcovich@yahoo.it) Purpose: In recent years various ultrasound (US) techniques, such as attenuation imaging (ATI), have been developed to q uantitively assess the hepatic fat content. The aim of the study was to as sess technical feasibility and reproducibility (both intra- and inter-observer) of ATI with QAI (Esaote) in healthy volunteers and in patients with suspected s teatosis. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation of QAI with hepatic steatosis assessed by standard US and to assess diagnostic accuracy for s teatosis quantification. Methods or Background: This prospective study included two different study groups, composed of healthy volunteers (group 1,n=25) and patients with suspected hepatic steatosis (group 2,n=61); among t hem 28 patients also underwent liver biopsy. In group 1 two operators performed both US and two sessions of ATI respectively. Intra-class correlati on coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the intra-observer and inter-observe r reproducibility in group 1. In group 2, QAI values were correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Temptativ e cut-off values for steatosis were calculated with ROC analysis as compared to liver histology. Results or Findings: For the intra-observer reproducibility ICC was showed an ICC of 0.902 (95%CI,0.793-0.955). QAI measurements showed a significant correlation with the visual grade of hepatic steatosis (rho 0.860;p<0.001). ATI enabled the identification of mild steatosis (great er than 0) with an AUC of 0.97 with an optimal cut-off of 0.60 dB/cm/MHz. Conclusion: ATI imaging with QAI showed high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility in healthy volunteers. Correlation between QAI and hepatic steatosis assessed by standard US is very good. Our study identifies for the first time normal values of QAI in healthy voluntee rs and preliminary cut-off thresholds for steatosis staging in NALFD patients.

Methods or Background: Sixty-one patients were included in this retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2021, patients were divided into a PH group (n=37) and a non-PH group (n=24) ac cording to the history of portal hypertension. Patients in the PH group under went the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure f or the transjugular PVPG measurement, which was used as the reference standa rd for the diagnosis of PH and the CFD simulation. All participants in the two groups underwent CT angiography. The model of the portal venous system was reconstructed using 3D-slicer software, afterwards, vPVPG was computed with the reconstructed three-dimensional model and the CFD simulation. Results or Findings: The ratio of vPVPG was identified statistically sig nificant for discriminating the PH group from the non-PH group (p<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) of vPVPG in the diagnosis (95% confidence interval[ CI]: 0.728, 0.93), with a sensitivity of 81.08%, and a specificity of 83.33% when using a cut-off value of 0.659. The inter-observer's agreement was 0.88, suggesting the good reproducibility of vPVPG measurements. Conclusion: The computational model of virtual portal vein pres sure gradient (vPVPG) may have the potential for the noninvasive diagnosis of portal hypertension, which may serve as a surrogate of the invasive transjugular PVPG measurement. Limitations: The data processing of this study is relatively tim e-consuming, the average time for the vPVPG calculation was 1 hour.

J. Erickson; Rochester, AL/US (yashbir143@gmail.com) Purpose: This study aims to develop a tool of a machine lear ning-based combination of topological and radiomics feature to predict hepatic decompensation status using the Body Composition mo del. Methods or Background: A total of 24 patients were included: 8 had hepatic decompensation, 8 were allocated to the no hepatic decompensation group during 5-fold cross-validation, and 8 were left out for the external validation set. A body composition model was used to segment subcut aneous adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, visceral adipose tissue, and inter muscular adipose tissue. Using the pyradiomics library, and using persistenc e homology, we extracted both features, and we trained a logistic regression model using these derived features as input. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 207 Results or Findings: The AUC was calculated for both the training data s et and the validation data set. The logistic regressio n classifier obtained an average AUC of 0.8 from 5-fold cross-validation. Then the best performance of AUC =0.8 was calculated for hepatic decompensation in the external validation data set. Conclusion: Using PSC as an example, we demonstrated the potent ial utility of combining radiomic features and topological feat ures for predicting disease progression and have shown for our case that an approach involving both radiomics and topological features gives improved performance compared to using either type of feature alone. Limitations: We used a much smaller number of patients with hepatic decompensation. The study's inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of PSC, and the availability of an abdomen CT acquired during the p ortal venous phase.

Wan*, Y. Wei, X. Zhang, B. Song; level of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG ) is related to patient's outcome, which is invasive and considered the gold standard for evaluating portal hypertension. We aimed to evaluat e whether texture features from computed tomography (CT) images could be used as a predictive biomarker of outcome in patients with portal hypert ension noninvasively. Methods or Background: A total of 65 patients with portal hypertension wer e included in this retrospective study and divided in to progression-free survival (PFS)(n=14) or non-PFS group (n=51) based on rebleeding or death after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT and the laboratory data were recorded, texture features of liver or spleen were extracted in the portal venous phase. Cox proportional-hazards model and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine PFS-related features and C-index was used to determine the diagnostic capabilities. Results or Findings: We found that only the RobustMeanAbsoluteDeviation feature from liver was the significant prognostic predictor obtaining a C-index of 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.89), the KM curve was plotted w ith high- and low-risk groups based on a cut-off value of 4.15 (p<0.05,log-rank test). The median survival time was 20.5 (interquartile range IQR 10. 25-39.75) months and 37 (IQR 32.5-41.5) months for high- and low-risk groups, respectively, the 1-, 2-, 3-year survival probabilities were 66.7%, 50%, 33.3% and 93.2%, 91.5%, 84.4% for high- and low-risk groups, respectively. Clinical variable of international normalised ratio (INR) also indicated a moderate prognostic ability for the high-risk group, with a C-index of 0.68 (95% CI 0.54-0.82) when using a cut-off value of 1.36. Conclusion: CT texture feature from liver and INR may be used as effective biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in patients with portal hypertension.

Methods or Background: The MRCP-score was developed based on the extent and severity of cholangiographic changes of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (range this review-board-approved retrospective, multice ntre study, three pairs of radiologists (each pair from a national tertiary center) applied the score independently on MRCP-examinations of a total of 220 consecutive patients (103, 52, and 65, respectively) with large-duct PSC from a prospectively collected cohort, with a median follow-up of 7.4 ye ars. Interreader and intrareader agreement was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). After consensus reading, the prognostic valu e of the score was assessed with Cox-regression analysis and outcome-f ree survival rates with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and a 10- fold cross-validation was performed. Results or Findings: 41 patients developed outcomes (i.e., liver transplantation and liver-related death). Interreader agreement for radiologists from two centers ICC=0.81, 95%CI: 0.70-0.87, ICC=0.87, 95%CI: 0.80-0.92, respectively). had 7.5 times higher risk (HR=7.5; 95%CI:3.6-15.8) for developing outcomes, and signif icantly lower survival rates (p<0.000), compared to those with MRCP-score 0-4. A UC for the MRCP-score was 0.82. After cross-validation, the results did n ot change. Conclusion: The novel MRCP-score is reproducible and strongly associated to outcomes which indicates its value for the prognosis of PSC patients. Limitations: The limitation is that there is no external validat ion.

M\u00fcller, S. J. Early Tumour Shrinkage (ETS) has been identified as a promising imaging biomarker for patients undergoing immunotherapy in several cancer entities. This study aimed to validate the potential of ETS as imaging biomarker for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing immunotherapy. Methods or Background: All patients with HCC treated with immunotherapy in first or subsequent lines at our tertiary care c entre between 2016 and 2021 were screened for eligibility. ETS was calculated as the size reduction of the target lesions between initial imaging and first FU . ETS was compared to the radiologic response according to mRECIST. Furthermo re, the influence of ETS on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response was calculated. Results or Findings: A total of 39 patients with available cross-sectional imaging at baseline and within 8-14 weeks after the baseline of immunotherapy treatment were included in the final analysis. Medi an ETS was 5.4% in our study. ETS significantly correlated with the response according to mRECIST and with the AFP response. Patients with an ETS 10% had a significantly longer survival after the first FU (15.1 months vs 4.0 months, p=0.008). Additionally, patients with disease control accordi ng to mRECIST and an ETS 10% had a longer PFS after the initial FU as well ( 23.6 months vs 2.4 months, p<0.001). Conclusion: ETS was strongly associated with survival outcomes in patients with HCC undergoing immunotherapy. Thus, ETS as an easily assessable imaging biomarker has the potential to timely ident ify HCC patients benefitting from immunotherapy. Limitations: The limitation was the single-centre and retrospect ive design.

M. Cebula*, A. methods and formulas based on biom etric data are used to calculate the liver volume. To date, it has not been established which of these methods is the best, and the search for new assessment methods continues. The main objective of this work is to compare the various methods of liver measurement with semi-automatic vo lumetric liver segmentation based on computed tomography. Methods or Background: Eight investigators independently performed a series of liver measurements on one hundred and fiv e computed tomography examinations of the abdominal cavity. Another resea rcher performed liver segmentation with the liver analysis model of syngo.via software, and the result was taken as the gold standard in the study. The pa tient's sex, age, weight, and height were noted, then BMI and BSA were calcul ated. Based on the data obtained, the liver volume was calculated using twelve established methods, then compared with each other and the segmentation result. Results or Findings: A significant difference was observed between all b ut one method and liver segmentation results. No singl e measurement made it possible to estimate liver volume reliably. Using s tepwise regression, we proposed our model to estimate the liver volume bas ed on the collected biomedical data. Conclusion: Reliable determination of liver volume remains a ch allenge. Despite the time-consuming nature of volumetric segmentation, it seems to be the optimal solution. Limitations: A retrospective character, number of evaluated CT s tudies, and no re-evaluation to assess repeatability limits the study.

M\u00fcller, S. J. and splenic volume (SV) increase has been described for patients with various cancer entities. Furthermore, SV and SV increase have been proposed as prognostic factors towards patients' survival. This study aimed to evaluate SV, its chan ges, and its prognostic influence on survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under immunotherapy. Methods or Background: All patients with HCC treated with an immunotherapy agent in first or subsequent lines at our tertiary care centre between 2016 and 2021 were included. SV was assesse d at baseline and follow-up using a fully automated AI-based tool for spleen segmentation and normalised to body-surface-area. SV was correlated with overall survival (OS) and clinical/laboratory parameters. Results or Findings: In the 50 patients included in this analysis, the m edian SV prior to treatment was 532ml (IQR 270-784ml). Th e median OS of patients with high SVs (SV above the median of the patient p opulation) after treatment initiation was 5.1 months, while patients with low SVs had a median OS of 18.1 months (p=0.01). Moreover, patients with a high SV had significantly lower albumin levels, significantly higher bilirubin levels, and significantly lower number of thrombocytes. Increase in SV between trea tment start and first follow-up was observed in 28 out of 37 patients (76%) with available follow-up imaging. Change/Increase in SV was no additional pr ognostic factor for median OS. Conclusion: SV at baseline prior to immunotherapy was a signifi cant prognostic factor and correlated with parameters of liver function. Although a large proportion of HCC patients showed a further i ncrease in SV after immunotherapy, this immuno-modulated SV change did not significantly influence OS in our cohort. Limitations: The limitation is the study's single-centre and ret rospective design.

Methods or Background: Patients with histologically confirmed HCC and treated with the immune-HAIC were retrospectively r ecruited between June 30, 2019, and July 31, 2021. CT-based estimations of bo dy composition parameters were acquired from the baseline unenhanc ed abdominal CT images at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) and were applied to evaluate its role in predicting the probability of OR. Associations among predictors and gene mutations were also examined by correlation matrix analysis. Results or Findings: Fifty-two patients were recruited to this study coh ort, with 30 patients having a OR status after immune-HA IC treatment. Estimations of myosteatosis parameters, like SM-RA (skeletal muscle radiation attenuation), were significantly associated with the probability of predicting OR (P=0.007). The SM-RA combined nomogram model, including serum red blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, and the mean CT valu e of visceral fat (VFmean) improved the prediction probability for OR disease with an AUC of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95). Conclusion: The CT-based estimations of myosteatosis could be used as an indicator to predict a higher risk of transition to the non-OR disease state in HCC patients treated with immune-HAIC therapy. This study demonstrated the therapeutic relevance of skeletal muscle compositio n assessments in the overall prediction of treatment response and prognosis in HCC patients. Limitations: First, it was a single-centred retrospective study that might involve the case selection bias. Second, the number of cases with non-OR was relatively small.

Thompson; Vernon Hills, IL/US (xzhan@mru.medical.canon) Purpose: Recent studies have demonstrated that semiconductor -based photon counting CT (PCCT) has the potential to prov ide better contrast and noise performance compared to conventional scintill ator-based systems. With multi-energy threshold detection, it can provide ad ditional spectral information and enable material decomposition to better differe ntiate different materials. With much smaller detector pixel size, the system c an be configured at different pixel summing modes, and generate images with different spatial resolutions. Methods or Background: To explore PCCT system benefits and limits, an engineering prototype is designed and built based on a Canon Aqilion ONE ViSION system. The CdZnTe-based photon counting de tector array populates the full 50cm FOV in the fan angle. A 3x3 macro-pixel grid size is used for standard resolution image reconstruction, and generate equivalent resolution images as the conventional system. Each micro-pixel can output up to 6 energy bins of counting measurements starting from 20keV. Scans were acquired using axial protocol with 120kVp, 1s per r otation, and tube current between 50 - 400mA. Different sizes of phantoms wer e scanned and reconstructed at different dose levels. The countin g images were generated based on the events with photon energy >30keV, and the spectral images were generated using 5 energy bins with threshold settin g of 30/45/55/65/80keV respectively. Results or Findings: In this work, comprehensive IQ evaluations including noise, resolution, HU uniformity are presented for both counting and spectral images for various phantoms. Some preliminary resul ts on the high-resolution imaging studies are also presented and compared wit h the standard mode images. Conclusion: We have designed and built a full-size photon count ing CT prototype system, and performed counting and spectr al imaging evaluations with various phantoms. The generated images prove i ts capability to scan at clinical dose levels with excellent quantitative ac curacy. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Becce\u00b9, \u00b2Zurich/CH reconstru ction algorithm (Quantum Iterative photon- counting detector CT (PCD-CT) on noise texture and diagnostic performance for the detection of low-contrast liver lesions. Methods or Background: An intermediate-sized anthropomorphic abdomen phantom (QRM, Germany) with a liver insert containi ng two different 5 x 7.5mm cylindrical iodinated liver lesions (contrast of +3 0 HU and -30 HU) was imaged on a clinical dual-source PCD-CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Si emens Healthcare GmbH) using a routine abdominal CT protocol at three dose levels (CTDIvol of 5, 2.5 and 1.25mGy). Virtual monoenergetic images ( VMI) were reconstructed at two energy levels of 50 and 60keV. Each of those VMIs were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off) and with QIR at four strength levels and noise texture was characterised by the Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) . Lesion detectability was assessed using a channelised Hotelling (CHO) mo del observer with ddog channels. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was us ed as figure of merit. Results or Findings: At each dose level, increasing QIR-levels substanti ally decreased noise magnitude (from 19% to 64%) while preserving a comparable noise texture to QIR-off. Lesion detectability incr eased when increasing QIR- level and radiation dose. At 2.5 mGy, detectability was equal to 0.89, 0.90, 0.91, 50keV 0.97, for to respectively higher detec to at 5, 2.5 and 1.25mGy. Conclusion: In abdominal PCD-CT, high levels of QIR in combinat ion with VMI at 60keV decreased image noise and improved les ion detectability without compromising image texture. This holds the potential for radiation dose reduction while preserving diagnostic performance. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

In this study, we compare a full-s ize CdZnTe-based engineering prototype PCCT system with conventional EID-CT systems at similar scan conditions and evaluate image quality in multiple aspects. Methods or Background: The prototype PCCT system is built based on a Canon AquilionONE ViSION system, which provides coverage of 50cm in fan angle. Summation of 3x3 micro-pixels is used fo r normal resolution reconstruction, which produces image resolution equivalent to that of conventional EID-CT, while high resolution image is reconstructed using 1x1 micro-pixels. In this study, scans were acquired in axial mode at 120kVp with 1sec rotation and tube current from 50 to 400mA. Ph antoms of various sizes, contrast levels, and material concentrations were s canned. CT number consistency, noise, spatial resolution, and material quantification accuracy were evaluated and compared. Results or Findings: PCCT images show consistent CT number across different mA levels at multiple phantoms. At compar able spatial resolution, PCCT reduces noise significantly as compared to EID -CT, especially at low dose. Improved spatial resolution is achieved by PC CT in high resolution mode. PCCT and EID-CT have comparable material quantification accuracy for contrast materials. Conclusion: Quantitative image comparison between a prototype f ull-size PCCT and conventional EID-CT shows, PCCT reduces im age noise considerably as compared to EID-CT at similar spati al resolution, while PCCT also allows for higher image resolution. Limitations: The beam width is different in scanning conditions between CT systems. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. This presentation is a phantom study.

Decker\u00b2, photon counting CT (PCCT) in the assessment of stent visibility using an in vitr o phantom with and without the presence of iodine contrast. Methods or Background: Scans were performed on a Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha PCCT. A phantom was created with stent sizes from 2.5mm-9mm diameter, placed within silicone tubings to simulat e vessels. The tubings were placed in a water tank and filled with increasing c oncentrations of iodine (I_conc) to provide 0, 200, 400 and 600 HU attenuat ion. Data were reconstructed using 2 kernels as virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 70 keV (pixel size=0.4 mm), and a polyenergetic image in ultrahigh resolution (UHR) of 0.2mm. Conventional CT scans were also reconstructed at 0.4mm and 0.6mm. Spectral data was post-processed to examine removal of contrast using a virtual non-iodine (VNI) algorithm. Stent lumen vis ibility was calculated for all images. Results or Findings: Bv60 reconstruction demonstrated 3-10% higher stent visibility for all values of Iconc compared to a Bv 40 kernel. Stent visibility was 5-10% higher for a conventional CT scan at 0.4mm th an 0.6mm over all I_conc. VNI images demonstrated successful removal of iodine for all I_conc, with HU equivalent to that of the water only tubings (-6.8\u00b113.9 HU). Stent struts were better distinguished on the UHR scan, includin g in one case a damaged 2.5 mm stent. Conclusion: PCCT demonstrated excellent imaging characteristics for in vitro imaging of stents in a phantom setup. The best stent lumen visibility was achieved in UHR mode (0.2 mm). Spectral data allowe d added processing steps unavailable with conventional CT systems. Limitations: Simulated setup only. Influences such as patient si ze/thickness, stent direction, presence of calcium, exposure parameters and motion were not evaluated. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Van Der \u00b9Leiden/NL, \u00b2Rotterdam/NL, \u00b3Amsterdam/NL (irene.debroglie@gmail.com) Purpose: To objectively assess and compare the performance of imaging lung vasculature by photon-counting detector (PCD) and energy-integrating detector (EID) CT-scanners in both high and ultra-high resol ution (HR, UHR) imaging, combining an anthropomorphic phantom and an automat ed lung vessel detection algorithm. Methods or Background: A 3D printed, lung-vessel phantom (Visijet_EX-200 material, vessel radii 0.13-4.0mm range), inside a PMMA thorax-shaped holder, was scanned on a PCD-based (Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha) and an EID-based CT (Siemens SOMATOM Force). Two were and UHR (CTDIvol matching Vessels were segmentated (0.25mm radius intervals) by an in-house developed graph-cuts method with vesselness filters, and median pixel values (MPV, impact on attenuation) and inter-quartile range (IQR, noise) calculated. Results or Findings: The vessel-air contrast-to-noise ratio was higher f or PCD- than for EID-based-CT, even at the thinnest sl ices setup (0.2mm vs 0.6mm). In both systems and protocols, noise (IQR) decreased with increasing IR strength. Vessels attenuation remained virtually constant for radii>1.5mm (UHR). For radii<1.5mm, MPVs dropped due to partial volume effect and false positives in air (noise). For HR-scans (1.0mm), ves sels-IQR (noise) did not significantly differ between PCD and EID scanners. For UHR and equivalent IR strenghts, image noise was 30% lower for Thanks to PCD-technology maturity, UHR-chest-CT all ows for improved image quality and lower image noise when c ompared to EID-based- technology in an anthropomorphic phantom study, wit h the potential of dose reduction in clinical protocols. Limitations: Phantom vessels\u00b4 contrast is higher than patients\u00b4 due to parenchyma absence. Future phantoms will mimic more realistically a wider range of patients\u00b4 morphometries and overall attenuations. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Van Der Lugt\u00b2, assess calcium (CAC) quantification for photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) at reduced tube voltages. Methods or Background: An anthropomorphic thorax phantom with low, medium and high density CAC inserts was scanned on a dual-source PCCT (Siemens NAEOTOM Alpha), using five different imagi 120 standard dose 4) 45% dose; and 5) Sn100 kVp standard dose. For each protocol, a robotic arm simulated coronary artery movement of heart rates of 0 and 60 -75 beats per minute (bpm). Each scan was repeated five times. Images were reconstructed according to the clinical CAC protocol, using mono- energetic (monoE) reconstructions at 70keV (equivalent to 120kVp). For each heart rate Agatston scores were compared with the reference. Deviations in Agatston score of >10% were deemed clinically relevant. Results or Findings: Volumetric CT dose index was 4.06mGy for the reference protocol. Protocols 2, 3, 4, and 5 result ed in 27%, 44%, 67%, and 46% dose reduction, respectively. For the low densi ty CAC at 0 bpm, clinically relevant lower median Agatston scores were found for all 90kVp acquisitions. At 60-75bpm, 90kVp at standard dose overestimated t he Agatston score by 15%. For the medium and high density CAC, the used 90 kVp protocols and heart rates revealed no clinically relevant differences in Agatston score based on the 95% confidence intervals. Conclusion: PCCT allows for reproducible Agatston scores at a r educed tube voltage of 90kVp with radiation dose reductions up to 67% for medium and high density CAC. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Two phantoms were scanned using a standard lung protocol (120 kVp, 40 mAs) with SPCCT and DLCT syst ems. Raw data were reconstructed using FBP and 9 iDose4 levels (i1/i2/ computed. Detect ability-index (d') was computed for detection of 4 mm ground-glass nodule (GGN) and solid nodule. Two evaluation ( noise/nodule sharpness/nodule conspicuity/overall IQ) in consens us, and chose the best image for SPCCT. Results or Findings: Noise magnitude was -47%\u00b12% lower on average with SPCCT than with DLCT for iDose4 range from i1 to i6 . Average NPS spatial frequencies increased for SPCCT in comparison with DLCT. TTF also increased, except for the air insert with FBP, and i1/i2/i3. Higher detectability was found for SPCCT for both GGN and solid nodules. IQ for both types of nodule was rated consistently higher with SPCCT than with DLCT for the same iDose4 level. For SPCCT and both nodules, the score s for noise and conspicuity improved with increasing iDose4 level. iDose4 level 6 provided the best subjective IQ for both types of nodule. Conclusion: Higher IQ for GGN and solid nodules was demonstrated with SPCCT compared with DLCT with better detectability using iDose4. Limitations: We did not evaluate the impact of iDose4 depending on the radiation dose: investigations under low and ultra- low dose conditions need to be performed.

Sawall*, L. Klein, C. Amato, J. Maier, Ro tkopf, S. (DSDE) photon-counting (PC) CT for today's conventional energy-integrating (EI) DSDE systems. Methods or Background: Images of an abdomen phantom with different sizes (S, M, L) equipped with vials containing iron solut ions with varying concentrations were acquired at the SOMATOM CounT C T (Siemens Healthineers, Germany), an experimental photon-counting system housing an EI and PC detector. Acquisitions were performed wit h 80kV/140kV+Sn and 100kV/140kV+Sn at a dose of 15mGy (CTDI32cm) by subsequent measurements with the PC detector. Besides conventi onal acquisitions, each source detector thread is capable of acquiring two energy bins simultaneously resulting in a total of 4 bins: [25 keV,Tlow] and [ Tlow,eULow] for the low- energy thread and [25keV,Thigh] and [Thigh,140keV] for the high-energy thread with Tx being the used thresholds. Iron maps were computed in a statistically optimal manner exploiting multiple en ergy bins if available. Reference acquisitions were performed using an ener gy-integrating DSDE CT (SOMATOM Definition Flash) using the same prefilter s, tube voltage combinations and dose levels. The dose- and concent ration-normalized contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRDc) was evaluated as fi gure of merit to compare both technologies. Results or Findings: In acquisitions with only one energy bin per source- detector-thread, DSDE PCCT provides a CNRD increase by a factor of up to 3.3 (S:1.2, M:2.5, L:3.3) compared to EICT. In case of four energy bins and a statistically optimal material decomposition, CNRD is increased by a factor of up to 4.3 (S:2.0, M:3.3, L:4.3) if thresholds Dual-source dual-energy photon-counting CT allows f or a highly significant increase in iron detectability compared to today's energy integrating CT.

Methods or Background: Two CT phantoms were scanned with rapid kV- switching Dual-Energy CT (Canon). Three repeated ac quisitions on each phantom were performed using classical parameters o f abdomen-pelvic examinations and CTDIvol close to 13 mGy. Raw data were reconstructed with two versions of deep-learning image reconstruction algorithm (AiCE V8 and AiCE V10) using three levels (Mild, Standard and St rong). Noise power spectrum (NPS) and task-based transfer function (TT F) were assessed on virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 40/50/60/70/80 keV. A detectability index (d') was computed as function of keV to model the detection of iodine concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/mL. Results or Findings: The noise magnitude decreased for AiCE V10 compared to V8 at all levels particularly between 40 and 60 keV (-34%\u00b11%) and fav shifted towards the high frequencies. The TTF at 50% increased with all levels of AiCE V10 compared to V8 and all energy levels (58%\u00b19% for Mild, 17%\u00b18% for Standard and 31%\u00b111% for Strong). The d' increased strongly for all AiCE V10 and all iodine concentrations between 40 to 60 keV (133%\u00b139% for 2mg/mL, 86%\u00b126% for 1mg/mL and 50%\u00b124% for 0.5mg/mL ). A lower increase was found for 70 and 80 keV (25%\u00b114%, 15%\u00b1 12%, and 22%\u00b116%, respectively). For all AiCE levels and iodine conce ntrations, the highest d' was obtained at 60 keV with AiCE V10 and at 70 keV with AiCE V8. Conclusion: Noise magnitude, noise texture, spatial resolution and the detectability of low iodine concentrations were improved in VMI for all levels of AiCE V10 compared to AiCE V8.

Methods or Background: A multi-energy phantom was scanned on three DECT platforms equipped with three different Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) platforms: GSI, GSI Pro and GSI Xtream. Acqui sitions were performed with a CTDIvol close to 11mGy. For all platforms, r aw data were reconstructed using filtered-back projection (FBP) and a hybrid i terative reconstruction algorithm (ASIR-V at 50%; AV50). A deep learning im age reconstruction (DLR) algorithm (TrueFidelity) was used only for the GSI Xtream. The noise power spectrum (NPS) and task-based transfer function (TT F) were evaluated from 40 to 80keV of VMIs. A detectability index (d') was computed to model the detection task of two contrast-enhanced lesions acc ording to the keV level used. Results or Findings: For all GSI platforms, the noise magnitude decrease d from 40 to 70keV, and using AV50 compared to FBP. T he average NPS spatial frequency (fav) and spatial resolution (TTF50%) wer e similar from 40 to 70 keV and decreased with AV50 compared to FBP. Compared t o AV50, using DLR reduced noise magnitude (-27%\u00b13%) and improved nois e texture (10%\u00b10%) without altering spatial resolution (2%\u00b15%). For the two lesions, d' values peaked at 70keV for GSI and GSI-Pro platforms and at 40/50keV for GSI Xtream, for all reconstruction algorithms. The highest d' values were found for the GSI-Xtream with DLR and the lowest for the GSI platform. Conclusion: Differences in image quality were found between the GSI platforms on low keV VMIs. New DLR algorithm on the GSI-Xtream platform reduced noise and improved spatial resolution and d etectability without changing the noise texture for VMIs at low keV. Limitations: Phantom study.

Rinaldi*, A. Ranghiero, G. Lo Presti, G. /IT (lisa.rinaldi@ieo.it) Purpose: Targeted therapies have improved the management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Non-invasive me thods to assess mutational status are warranted to improve therapy personalisation. This study investigated the association between contrast-enhanced CT radiomic features and tumour mutational status assessed from tissue biopsy. Methods or Background: 261 patients affected by advanced NSCLC, tested for EGFR, ALK and KRAS alterations and imaged with CT within +/- 2 months from biopsy and before starting therapy were retros pectively enrolled. 52 patients were prospectively enrolled as validation set. 1118 radiomic features were calculated from the CT images of lung lesions (Pyradiomics). Clinical data were collected including: age, sex, smoke habit, st age at diagnosis, treatments before CT, lesion lobe, lymph node status, presence of distant metastasis, treatment after CT. Using retrospective data as training set, with mutations as outcomes, radiomic features were included in LASSO- logistic regression models. A radiomic score (RS) was created using the coefficients of the LASSO model. Radiomic, clinical and clinical-radiom ic multivariable models were tested on prospective data (validation set) us ing the area under the ROC curve (AUC), with 95% confidence intervals calculat ed with bootstrap resampling. Results or Findings: The RS was significantly associated with the presen ce of any driver gene alteration versus no alteration, both at univariate and multivariable analysis including clinical variables . The validation AUC increased from 0.71 to 0.84 when adding the RS to t he clinical variables significantly associated with the outcome at univar iate analysis (stage and smoke habit). Conclusion: This study suggests a possible significant role of CT radiomics for the non-invasive identification of patients with advanced NSCLC harbouring actionable gene alterations. Limitations: The limitations are a possible difference between t raining and validation populations and the monocentric study design.

The identification of novel prognostic biomarkers can improve treatment choice and optimisation. This study investigates the association between CT radiomic features of lung lesions acquired before starting therapy, and overall survival (OS). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 213 Methods or Background: 287 patients affected by advanced non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data were collected including: age, sex, smoke habit, stage at diagnosi s, previous treatments, lesion lobe, lymph node status, presence of distant metastasis, mutational status (tested alterations: EGFR, KRAS, ALK). After patients underwent chemotherapy, 20 immunotherapy, 9 chemo+i mmunotherapy, 27 local therapy (surgery and/or radiation therapy), 55 Tyrosine-Kinase-Inhibitors. Data were not available for 50 patients. 261 patients (160 stage IV, 101 stage II-III) with adequate CT were included in the analy sis. 1118 radiomic features were calculated from CT images with Pyradiomics pac kage. Median follow-up of patients was 57.1 [31.4-150.4] months. A Radiomi c Score (RS) for OS prediction was calculated with LASSO-Cox regression model. The accuracy of OS prediction was estimated with the C-index for ra diomic, clinical and clinical- radiomic models, after internal cross-validation. S ubgroup analysis by stage and mutational status was performed. Results or Findings: Among clinical variables, stage and post-CT therapy were independent predictors of OS (multivariable model C-index 0.64). The RS was significantly associated to OS, both taken alone (p<0.001, C-index 0.78) and in the multivariable cl inical variables (C-index 0.80). Conclusion: The significant and independent prognostic role of RS was confirmed both when stratifying patients according to stage (stage IV and stage II-III sub-groups) and according to gene alteration (EGFR versus no-EGFR, KRAS versus no-KRAS sub-groups). Limitations: The limitation is the internal validation. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the institutional Ethical Committee (R784/18-IEO836).

Khoda*\u00b9, (jeeviteshkhoda@gmail.com) see how whole body MRI with background suppressi on (WB MRI) performs in detecting metastatic lesions in ca ses of adenocarcinoma of the lung as compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT. Methods or Background: 70 patients of biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the lung were enrolled consecutively in this prospe ctive study. The patients who had undergone FDG PET/CT examination underwent WB MRI with DWIBS after the PET/CT. In addition to acquiring th e WB MRI diffusion sequence additional T2 haste axial whole body, T1 D ixon axial whole body, T1 Dixon and STIR sagittal sequences of the spine were acquired as well. The lesions were considered true positive only if they were biopsied or showed response or progression on imaging in 6 months foll ow-up while on chemotherapy. The total number of lesions detected on WB MRI and PET/CT were documented and divided into osseous lesions an d non-osseous soft tissue lesions. Results or Findings: Total lesions detected on WB MRI were 279, total lesions on PET/CT 260 and total lesions on standalone WB diffusion only 286. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of WB DWI was 95%, 91.77% and 93.2% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity an d accuracy of PET/CT was 90.8%, 92.6% and 91.5% respectively. The sensitivit y, specificity and accuracy of standalone WB diffusion only was 94.4%, 84.5% an d 90.8% respectively. WB MRI detected more lesions accurately than PET/CT when both diffusion and additional sequences were used together for les ion characterisation. Using WB diffusion only led to poorer performance compared to PET/CT due to higher false positives. Conclusion: WB MRI with additional sequences is more accurate t han PET/CT in detecting metastatic lesions in adenocarc inoma lung. Limitations: The limitations are the small sample size and limit ed histopathology (practically cannot biopsy all lesions). Ethics committee approval: Approved with consent of the patients.

Van Den Berghe, M. for moni toring denosumab therapy of tumours of bone (GC TB). Methods or Background: Twelve patients (8 males, 4 females) with GCTB (4 spine, 8 limbs) were monitored six-monthly alternat ely with CT and (DCE-)MRI imaging studies and (semi-)quantitative measurement s to assess response, relapse and complications. Results or Findings: On CT, good responders showed progressive re- ossification of osteolysis, cortical remodelling and tumour and soft tissue volume reduction. On MRI, first a reduction in cont rast enhancement, surrounding bone marrow oedema and volume were obse rved. Next, focal necrosis, fatty infiltration and progressive re-oss ification of the osteolysis appeared. On DCE-MRI, the time-intensity curve evol ved from a type IV curve with high first pass, high amplitude and steep wash -out rate over an intermediate type III or V to a slow type I or II c urve. A reduction in wash-in slope, maximum signal intensity, area under the cur ve and amplitude of wash- in was observed, along with an increase in arrival time and time to peak. A decrease in Ktrans, initial area under curve and am plitude A was observed, along with increased Ve and Kep (extended Tofts/Bri x models). Patients with poor response or relapse showed the inverse findings of good responders. Three patients showed relapse after initial good re sponse when denosumab was stopped for pregnancy or dental surgery. Regarding evolution in time, one patient with initial good response showed a new cor tical breakthrough and extensive bone marrow oedema. Biopsy revealed a highly cellular high-grade conventional osteosarcoma with small interstitial s pace. Conclusion: Denosumab is effective in inoperable GCTB and in op erable cases with large morbidity. CT and (DCE-)MRI allow adequate evaluation of early/late response and detection of therapy failur e and malignant transformation. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

D. Dragan*, K. Boyd, for restaging m ultiple myeloma (MM) patients. New pain does not always indicate progression, particularly in the absence of biochemical progress ion, in patients under active surveillance and/or ongoing therapy. This study aim s to assess whether targeted MRI scans (as opposed to WBMRI) are an appropriate method of investigating new pain in patients with known MM, w ithout biochemical progression. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of sequential targeted MRI scans performed over 2 years to investigate new pai n in MM patients without biochemical progression at a tertiary referral cent re. Patients with nonsecretory/oligosecretory disease or other metast atic cancers were excluded. Results or Findings: 137 encounters/scans were included, from 109 patien ts. 55 (40%) of scans were performed during active surv eillance. 115 (84%) covered a single area (e.g. spine, pelvis etc), whi le 22 (16%) covered 2 anatomical areas. 100 (73%) of scans showed no acti ve lesion, half (50 scans) showed degenerative changes, 39% vertebral fracture s etc. Only 3 of these patients progressed to the next treatment line in t he subsequent 3 months. 37 (27%) of all scans reported presumed active disease. Of these, 21 demonstrated new lesions; 6 however also developed biochemical progression Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 214 around the time of the scan. Of the 21 scans with new lesions, a WBMRI was requested in only 11 cases (8% of total), 10 confir ming progressing disease. In 61 cases, patients had no recurrence to date (average follow-up of 24 months, min 2, max 41). Conclusion: In myeloma patients presenting with new pain but no biochemical recurrence, targeted scans are an appropriate method of investigation, rather than full restaging WBMRI. This reduces capacity pr essures on MRI and the time that patients in pain spend in MRI scanners. Limitations: The limitation is the single-centre retrospective s tudy design. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the local institutional review board. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Neubauer; Freiburg/D E Fatty infiltration of skeletal muscle, also known as myosteatosis is associated with increased frailty, decreased muscle and mobility function, which seems fairly prevalent in multiple myeloma (M M) patients. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of myosteat osis progression-free and overall survival (OS). Methods or Background: This IRB-approved cohort study included patients with newly diagnosed MM who were treated at a singl e university hospital and received CT at baseline. Geriatric assessment was performed via international myeloma working group (IMWG) score and revi determined measurement of paravertebral skeletal muscle radiodensity. The myeloma outcome was defined via PFS and OS assessment. Statistical analyses inc luded uni- and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models and Ka plan-Meier-method. Results or Findings: A total of 226 newly diagnosed MM patients (median age: 65 years [range: 29-89], 63% males, mean BMI: of myosteatosis was 60%. M uscle radiodensity was significantly decreased in individuals with international staging system stage III vs. I (p<0.001), indicating higher amounts of inter muscular adipose tissue in patients with advanced disease. Median PFS and OS of the whole population were 3.4 years and 7.6 years, respectively. In univ ariable analysis, myosteatosis was a statistically valuable predictor of in multivar iable analyses. Conclusion: Myosteatosis seems highly prevalent in patients wit h newly diagnosed MM and associated with impaired overall s urvival. Limitations: The main limitation of the present study is its ret rospective design. Prospective clinical trials are required to confirm our findings.

Gruber-Rouh; Frankfurt/DE (vitali-koch@gmx.de) Purpose: and compare free-breathing DOT sequences (day optimising throughput) with conventional breath-hol d examinations in whole- body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods or Background: This prospective study included 20 healthy study participants and 6 patients with multiple benign pa thologies who had undergone whole body 1.5-Tesla MRI. Image quality, diagnostic confidence, and image noise were evaluated by two experienced r adiologists. Diagnostic performance for the overall detection of pathologie s in both sequences was determined using the area under the receiver operat ing characteristics curve (AUC). Additionally, study participants were asked to rate their experience in a satisfaction survey using a 5-point Likert scale. Results or Findings: MRI free-breathing scans were rated as at least equivalent to conventional MRI scans in more than 90% of cases, showing high overall diagnostic accuracy (95%) and performance (AUC 0.968, 95% CI 0.939 to < 0.0001) for the assessment of pathologies. Interrater agreement was excellent both, free-breathing ( = 0.93 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00]). Ratings for image quality, image noise, and diagnostic confidence differed not significantly between the two types of MRI acquisition (all P > 0.05). The mean examination time of whole-body MRI was 56 \u00b1 4 minutes (range, 52-70 minutes) using DOT free-breathing and 73 \u00b1 6 minutes (range, 64-84 minutes) using conventional MRI sequences with breath-hold commands (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: MRI images generated with free-breathing sequences yielded similar diagnostic performance at equivalent image quality and noise levels compared to conventional breath-holding algorithms. Limitations: The limitations are the single-centre study design, the impact of contrast agent, and the patient number.

Moderator O. F. Donati; Zurich/CH RPS 1107-2 value of PI-RADS for cli significant negative predictive value (NPV) of 3TmpMR I in patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) and to identify clinical factors that predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in patients with negative mpMRI. Methods or Background: In this IRB approved, HIPAA compliant study, the cohort of 609 patients underwent 3TmpMRI between 2016 to 2020 with all lesions scored as PI-RADS 2 followed by 12-14 core systematic biopsy (SBx) within six months. Mann-Whitney test and chi-square test were used to analyse significance of differences in results. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify fact ors significantly associated with csPCa. Results or Findings: Of the 609 patients, 59 (9.7%) and 111 (18.2%) pati ents had csPCa and clinically PCa, respect ively. The NPV of 3TmpMRI for csPCa and PCa was and 72.1%, respectively . Patients with biopsy proven csPCa were older (p=0.016), had higher prost ate specific antigen density (PSAD, p=0.003), lower prostate volume (PV, p<0.001) and greater family history of PCa (p=0.028) compared to Benign + csPCa patients. Univariate analysis showed PV (p=0.002), PSAD (p=0. 010), age (p=0.031) and family history of PCa (p=0.031) to be significantly associated with csPCa. Multivariate analysis revealed PV (p<0.001) and age (p=0.001) to be independent predictors of csPCa. Conclusion: In patients suspected of having PCa, 3TmpMRI can be used to reliably predict the absence of csPCa and is a reli able tool to rule out csPCa before biopsy, possibly eliminating the need for bi opsy. Prostate volume and age were found to be independent predictors of csPC a in men with negative mpMRI. Limitations: A retrospective analysis, unintended selection bias could have existed. The NPV was calculated to a systematic bio psy standard by necessity since no higher standard such as WMHP was available .

Methods or Background: One hundred and forty consecutive patients scanned for clinically significant prostate cancer (3T) with systematic transperineal biopsy as reference standard are anal ysed retrospectively in a single-centre study. After volumetric segmentation of the transition zone and peripheral zone in T2w normalisation of signal intensities is achieved through comparison with standardised representative volumes of muscle and fat tissue. Field bias is reduced by N4ITK-correction. Radiomic signatures are then derived from the volumes and fit in a overall regression model analysing the correlation with PSA-level elavations and biopsy results. Results or Findings: A preliminary of a subcohort with non- normalised T2w signal intensities (only N4ITK-corrected) consisting of 36 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia showed si gnificant correlation of a subset of radiomic signatures with PSA-levels (r: 0 ,53-0,69, p < 0,05) suggesting that larger areas of high signal intensi ties correlate with elevation of PSA-levels. Application of regression models to a c ontrol group of 11 patients with csPCa suggested a trend for positive correlati on of radiomics phenotypes with malignancy. Conclusion: Initial results suggest that radiomics signatures of the transition zone can explain elevated PSA levels in patients wi thout PCa in a subcohort and may predict prostate cancer in the transition z one. Application of the model with normalised signal intensities to the whole col lective consisting of patients with BPH and TZ-PCa may additionally enable differentiation of glandular and stromal hyperplasia from malignant genesis based on image features and PSA-levels. Confirmation of these preliminary findi ngs may enhance diagnostic accuracy of MRI examinations in both malignant an non-malignant settings. Limitations: Preliminary results of subcohort.

Messina*, Rome/IT (emanuele.messina@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To investigate the role of MRI with a bi-parametric approach (without injection of paramagnetic contrast medium), as a secondary prevention test for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer, comparing i t with the serum PSA test. Comparison of the different combination of screening tests in terms of carcinoma detection rate, non-clinically significant and clinically significant cancer detection rate. Methods or Background: Monocentric, prospective, interventional randomised controlled trial. 221 men have been enrolled and blindly randomised in two different arms: A)113 patients pe rformed MRI with a bi- parametric approach (without contrast medium) regar dless their PSA value; B) 108 patients performed MRI with a bi-parametric approach (without contrast medium) due to elevated PSA (>4 ng/ml or 2.5 ng/ml if positive family history). Furthermore, 110 patients were enrolled as control group. Patients with positive MRI defined as bPI-RADS 3, have undergone targeted prostate biopsy with the TRUS-MRI image fusion technique. St atistical analysis was performed using both bPI-RADS 3 and 4 as cut-off for clinically significant prostate cancer. Results or Findings: We found that about 15% of patients from arm A had a bPI-RADS 3 and were directed to prostate biopsy, among thos e 71% had clinically significant prostate cancer. Among patients in arm B about 40% were directed to biopsy. The difference in accuracy betw een arm A and arm B was statistically different (p<0.05). Specificity, sens itivity, PPV and NPV were calculated for both arms and MR-directed biopsy was considered as the gold standard. Inter-reader agreement was excellent (k=0.863). Conclusion: Prostate MRI without contrast media injection showe d promising results compared to PSA as screening tool in men be tween 49-69 years of age.

Mohamed Ali Khalil Elhendy*, H. M. Farg, M. A. El-Adalany, T. El-Diasty; Mansoura/EG Purpose: The aim of this work was to assess the diagnostic c apability of biparametric MRI (bpMRI) and multiparametric MRI (m pMRI) of PI-RADS V2.1 in detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods or Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered to be the commonest cancer among males. Early and precise diagnosis of PCa is essential for adequate treatment. Multiparametric M R imaging (mpMRI) is actually the most precise imaging technique used for early diagnosis of PCa. This prospective study was carried out on 60 male p atients with high PSA. BpMRI and mpMRI were performed for all patients usi ng a 3-T MRI scanner. The diagnostic performance of bpMRI of PI-RADS V2.1 was compared to that of mpMRI of PI-RADS V 2.1. The diagnosis of Pca was confirmed by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and the result s of open prostatectomy specimens. Results or Findings: When considering PI-RADS categories 1, 2, and 3 as benign and categories 4 and 5 as malignant, mpMRI had higher sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy when compared with bpMRI (sensi tivity was 88.6% for mpMRI versus accuracy was 91.7% for mpMRI versus 75% for bpMRI). When considering PI-RADS cat egories 1 and 2 as benign and PI-RADS categories 3, 4 and 5 as maligna nt, the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of bpMRI and mpMRI were comparable (sensitivity was 94.3% for both bpMRI and mpMRI and diagnostic accur acy 86.7% for both bpMRI and mpMRI). Conclusion: Considering PI-RADS scores 4 and 5 as malignant, mpMRI had higher sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy when com pared with bpMRI; however, when considering PI-RADS scores 3, 4, and 5 as malignant, both bpMRI and mpMRI had similar diagnostic accuracy.

Methods or Background: Patients undergoing a 3T MR study for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer or active surveillance were retrospectively enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: presence of at l east one PI-RADS 4 and/or 5 lesion (PI-RADS v2.1 criteria), adequate diagnostic imaging, available histopathological data. Pathological results utilis ing MRI-targeted biopsies or prostatectomy specimens were used as reference. Conventional clinical (age, PSA, PSA density, prostate volume) and MRI paramete rs (mean ADC in circular 2D ROI) were collected. Lesions were manually contoured with ITK- SNAP on axial T2-weighted images and on ADC maps. R adiomics features were extracted with Pyradiomics. Clinical and radiomics features best Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 216 correlating with histopathological results were sel ected and assessed with a balanced cross-validation approach over 200 repetit ions using Youden thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity were assess ed on validation samples. Results or Findings: 103 patients were included. At pathology, 70 PI-RAD S 4/5 lesions were identified as clinically significant cancers (Gleason score [GS] 7). Features best correlating with histopathology w ere: PSA-density selected in 78% of trials with a sensitivity of 35% and a specificity of 78% at validation; T2-glszm_SmallAreaLowGrayLevelEmphasis selected in 45% of trials with a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 57% at vali dation; T2-shape_Sphericity selected in 41% of trials with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 45% at validation. Conclusion: PSA-density appears to be the feature with the best specificity while T2-shape_Sphericity the one with the best sensitivity in correlating with histopathology.

Mercatelli*\u00b9, E. Bertelli\u00b9, C. Marzi\u00b9, \u00b2Pisa/IT Purpose: To investigate the potential role of different AI a pproaches in predicting PCa aggressiveness from mpMRI. Methods or Background: 85 patients underwent prostate mpMRI (PIRADS: 3-5) and free hand transperineal MRI/US fusion guid ed targeted biopsy (103 peripheral zone PCa lesions: 76 with ISUP GG<=2 and 27 with ISUP GG>=3). The lesions were segmented on T2w images and ADC ma ps. We used several ML algorithms and DL architectures, properly trained, validated and tested: 90% of the PCa patients were considered as the development set, and the remaining 10% as the test set. Results or Findings: The results were computed at the lesion level. Employing only the T2w images, the best-performing ML model provided an AUROC of 75%, while the best DL architecture achiev ed an AUROC of 75.8%. Otherwise, for the ADC maps the AUROC values were 52.3% and 66.7% for the selected ML algorithm and the optimal DL model, respectively. Eventually, for the combination of T2w and ADC the best-perform ing ML classifier achieved an AUROC of 69.0%, whereas the most succes multimodal network yielded an AUROC of 72.7%. Although PI-RADS is attributed to PZ lesions by simultaneously looking at T2w images and ADC maps, the best performance was obtained using only the information extracted from T2w images, probably due to the fact that ADC maps have a much lower spatial resolution and the quantitative information extract ed from them is less relevant and perhaps confounding, especially for ML algorithms. Conclusion: Applying AI in the clinical practice is still a big challenge. However, our results are encouraging, especially those on T2 sequences. ML and DL models could be a valid aid in the diagnosti c pathway of PCa. Limitations: Small number of cases. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board.

Methods or Background: The retrospective study enrolled 204 patients with histologically verified PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In 102 cases of PCa and 70 cases of BPH there was no prior treat ment with finasteride; in 20 cases of PCa and 12 of BPH treatment with finast eride due to the LUTS before histological diagnosis was conducted. In all cases multiparametric MRI of prostate was performed using 1.5T machine and b- values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2. Results or Findings: The was no difference in mean ADC values between subgroups with PCa previously treated and untreated with finasteride due to LUTS: 0.69\u00b10.15 vs 0.74\u00b10.11 \u00d7103 mm2/sec accordin p=0,633. Significant in mean ADC values in subgro ups with BPH treated and untreated with 0.84\u00b10.12 \u00d7103 mm2/sec respectively, p<0.001. There was no differe nce in mean ADC values between subgroup with BPH treated with finasteride and subgroups with clinically significant and clinically insignificant PCa without finasteride prescription history: 0.84\u00b10.12 vs 0.70\u00b10.05 vs 0.8 8\u00b10.13\u00d7103 mm2/sec correspondingly, p>0.05. No observed difference bet ween mean ADC values in subgroups with BPH and insignificant PCa where finasteride was previously prescribed (p>0.05). There was strong inverse correlation between the duration of finasteride use and the ADC value in subgroups o f patients with PCa and BPH (r=0.657 and r=0.721 accordingly; p<0.05). Conclusion: Treatment of LUTS with finasteride caused an overlap of mean ADC values in subgroups with BPH and PCa, the resul t of which is hindering of ADC application in differential diagnostics of PCa.

Methods or Background: We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients admitted to two institutions for radical prostatectomy for PCa with available records of mpMRI performed between Januar y 2015 and December 2020. Data from one institution was used for invest igating diagnostic performance of each mpMRI EPE features, using radic al prostatectomy specimensas benchmark. The results were implemented in a comprehensive grading system, labelled EPE-score, based on or tumour-capsule interface> 1.0 cm: 4; 2 of the previous three parameters or measurable EPE: 5. The performance of mpMRI features was evaluated using the five diagnostic pa rameters and ROC curve analysis. Results or Findings: A total of 200 patients were enrolled at site 1 and 76 at site 2. MpMRI features had poor sensitivities rangi ng from 0.08 (0.00-0.15) to 0.71 (0.59-0.83), from 0 .68 (0.58-0.79) to 1.00. EPE-score showed excellent discriminating ability ( AUC>0.8) and sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.77 with a threshold of 3. had AUC comparable to ESUR-score (p=0.59), higher than early-and-late-EPE (p<0.0001). There were no signif icant differences between readers of different expertise with EPE-score (p=0. 32) or EPE-GRADE (p=0.45), but there were significant fo r ESUR-score (p=0.02) and early-versus-late-EPE (p=0.03). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 217 Conclusion: The individual mpMRI features have low sensitivity and high specificity. The use of EPE-score allows for consis tent and reliable assessment for EPE.

Agrotis*\u00b9, M. \u00b2Skien/NO (g.agrotis@hotmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the appare nt diffusion coefficient (ADC) and apparent diffusion coefficient ratio (ADCratio) relationship between different histological grades of prostate cancer (PCa) and High-Grade Prostatic (HPI N) lesions. Methods or Background: 3T mpMRI was performed for 46 patients and at least one suspicious lesion was identified and hist opathologically confirmed with targeted fusion guided mpMRI-TRUS biopsy. Axial diffusion-weighted sequence (DWI) was performed with b-values of 0, 50 0, 800, 1000 and 1600 s/mm2. Patients were categorised into Group A: 6; lesions. ADC and ADC ratio were correlated with Gleason score and HPIN. A threshold value for ADC and ADCratio were obtained to differentiate between Group A, B and C. Results or Findings: For distinction between Group A and Group B, an ADC threshold value of 1.2*10-3 mm2/s and ADCratio of 0.75 were calculated. The mean value of ADC and ADCratio were statistically s ignificant between Group A and B (p=0.03 and p=0.008 respectively). For dist inction between Group B and Group C, an ADC threshold value of 1.33*10-3 mm 2/s and ADCratio of 0.82 were obtained. The mean value of ADC and ADCratio were not statistically significant. The mean ADC value for G leason score 6, 7, 8 and 9 was calculated with a weak inverse correlation, not statistically significant. Conclusion: ADC and ADCratio are promising variables to differentiate histological grades in patients at risk for PCa, es pecially between Group A and B. Limitations: More patients need to be added for statistically si gnificant results between Group B and C. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was obtained: No. 4861.

Results of \u00b2Istanbul/TR (ahmetkaya.md@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate whether the white matter integrity i n the brain is impaired in macronutrient deficiency in geriatric p opulation with DTI technique. Methods or Background: Geriatric patients who had a mini-nutritional assessment (MNA) test and had brain MRI including D TI sequence were included in the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the MNA test result: those without malnutrition (gr oup 1), those with malnutrition risk (group 2), and those with malnutr ition (group 3). DTI indices (FA, ADC, AD, RD) of white matter tracts were measu red by ROI-based method using Syngo workstation (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Results or Findings: There were 112 geriatric patients who met the inclusion criteria (group 1= 12, group 2= 50, group 3= 50). I n group 3, there was significant increase in FA, and a significant decre ase in RD in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and in the right cingulum c ompared to group 2. In the left superior longitudinal fasciculus lower ADC and RD values were noted in group 3 compared to group 2. Left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus showed significantly increased FA, and decreased ADC and R D values in group 3 compared to group 2. In the right anterior limb of the internal capsule FA was significantly higher, and RD was significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1. Moreover, ADC was significantl y decreased in the same tract in group 3 compared to group 1. ADC values in the left medial lemniscus were increased significantly in group 2 compared to group 1. Conclusion: The findings revealed a better white matter integri ty in the setting of macronutrient deficiency, and might indicate a c orrelation between calorie restriction and improved microstructural integrity in brain. Limitations: The limitation is the retrospective cross-sectional study design. Ethics committee approval: Institutional ethical committee approval was obtained.

Mambrin*\u00b9, E. Cavedo\u00b2, N. Pizzini\u00b9; \u00b9Verona/IT, \u00b2Paris/FR Purpose: To compare the accuracy of imaging markers measured by QyScore\u00ae, an FDA and CE marked medical device, and radiological assessment in distinguishing parkinson disease (PD) from progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients. Methods or Background: 3D T1 MRI images of 18 PD, 9 with PSP and 25 controls (HC) were: (i) radiologically assessed by two radiologists in consensus, who provided the score of 13 indices used in clinical routine; and (ii) automatically segmented using QyScore\u00ae, providing volumes and population-normed z-scores for 17 brain structures. Radiological indices and QyScore\u00ae markers were compared across groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests, and p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons (Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni methods). The area under the curve (AUC) , sensitivity, specificity and the Youden index were calculated and compared f or all markers that were significant in distinguishing PD from PSD in group comparisons. Results or Findings: PD patients were younger than HC and PSP (PD 65 yrs , HC 71 yrs, PSP 72 yrs) but the sex proportions were not significantly different. The markers that significantly distinguished PD from PSP were, using QyScore\u00ae, indi ces, the midbrain surface (p=0.004) and the MRPI 2.0 (p=0.003). Accuracy results of these markers/indexes plus a composite region including B S+GP+TH showed that the composite volume marker had the highest AUC (0. 97), followed by GP (0.96), TH (0.95), BS (0.94), midbrain surface (0.89) and MRPI2.0 (0.89). Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 218 However, the AUC values for the best QyScore\u00ae marke r and best visual index were not significantly different (p=0.308). Conclusion: There is no statistically significant difference between radiological evaluation and automated markers quantified using Q yScore\u00ae in distinguishing PD and PSP patients. Limitations: The limitation is the sample limit. Ethics committee approval: Retrospective study approved by the IRB of our Institution. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Giancarlo Mansueto: Nothing to to disclose Francesca disclose RPS 1111-5 correlates with gait *X. Wei*; Beijing/CN (weixuan315@163.com) Purpose: study aimed to evaluate the alterations of cin gulate fiber tracts by using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and to explore the correl ation relationship between mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value with cognitiv e behavioural and gait measures. Methods or Background: Twenty-four PD patients and twenty-nine healthy controls (HCs) were included. For each participant, two-shell HARDI and high- resolution 3D structural images were acquired with a MPRAGE pulse sequence on a 3T MRI. Diffusion-weighted data prepr ocessing was performed using Mrtrix3 software, using orientation distribut ion function to trace the main nerve fibre tracts in PD patients. Automated fibre quantification analysis was performed. Clinical characteristics between PD and HC group were compared, and correlation between the FA value and behavioral data were analysed. Quantitative gait and clinical tests were recorded in PD subjects' medication ON and OFF states. Results or Findings: The FA values of 34-58 equidistant nodes in the right cingulum cingulate (rCC) were positively correlated with mini-mental balance scale (BBS)-OFF, B BS-ON scores; and negatively correlated with the MDS-UPDRS-III ON score. In the gait analysis, the FA value significantly correlated with velocity , cadence and stride time of the pace and rhythm domains in both 'ON' and 'OFF' state (P<0.05). Conclusion: We use HARDI data to obtain detailed and accurate w hole-brain fibres tracts in segments, and provide important ne uroimaging information in association with clinical behavioral measures of PD . HARDI combined with neurocognitive and gait metrics may be a valuable biomarker for identifying gait and cognitive impairments in PD.

However, this protocol prov ides complex hemodynamic information, e.g., arrival time, that may affect th e end signal. This is a cross- sectional study on 144 memory clinic patients (72\u00b17 years; 53% women) with mild cognitive A visual rating scale was applied to CBF maps, assessing delayed perfusion levels. Statistical parameters describing whole-brain perfusion included a new measure of hemodynamic quality evaluating the proportion of gr ay matter perfused voxels over their total number (HQIndex). One-way ANOVA analysis was used to compare mean, median, standard deviation(std), maxi mum and normalised mean and median difference of the calculated whole- brain CBF across delayed perfusion levels. Spearman correlation was performe d to study the association of HQIndex with clinical and imaging parameters usu ally correlated with perfusion. Results or Findings: Four degrees of delayed perfusion were identified, namely no delay (or normal,22), mild (29), moderate (53), and severe delay (40). HQIndex revealed a significant reduction (p<0.05) in the number of perfused voxels across the four classes: 90\u00b1 3% in normal, 85\u00b14% in mild, 79\u00b15% in moderate and 67\u00b18% in severely delay ed groups. It was negatively associated with several variables including age(p<0.001), mean(p<0.0001), median(p<0.0001) and std(p<0.0001) of whole-brain associated with age-related white m atter changes or dementia severity. Conclusion: Arrival time severely affects perfusion maps derived from single- timepoint ASL. The degree of this delay can be assessed by a visual rating scale and the HQIndex, possibly improving clinical interpretation of ASL maps. Limitations: Not applicable.

A volume of interest (VOIs) and a voxel-wis e approach were employed to evaluate subject-specific TI-dependent cerebral blood flow (CBF) differences, and grey matter CBF Z-score differences. A visual evaluation was also performed. Results or Findings: CBF was higher for TI 1500 ms in the proximal terri tories of the arteries (PTAs) (e.g. insular cortex and bas al ganglia \u2014 P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 from the VOI analysis, respectively), and for TI 2020 ms in the distal territories of the arteries (DTAs), including the w atershed areas (e.g. posterior parietal and occipital cortex \u2014 P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 from the VOI analysis, respectively). Similar differences were also evident when analysing patient- specific CBF Z-scores and at a visual inspection. Conclusion: TI influences ASL perfusion estimates with a region-dependent effect. The presence of intraluminal arterial signal in PTAs and the longer arterial transit time in the DTAs (including waters hed areas) may account for the TI-dependent differences. Watershed areas exhibiting a lower perfusion signal at short TIs (~ 1500 ms) should not be misinterpreted as focal hypoperfused areas. Limitations: The limitations are a reduced number of enrolled subjects, and a lack of validation through other perfusion modaliti es.

We aimed to investigate the role of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit in W MH and lacune development. Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 219 Methods or Background: Ninety-nine CSVD patients were included. We used post-labelling d 1525ms and 2025ms to measure CBF respectively, and the difference between CBFPLD1.5 and CBF PLD2.0 was recorded as CBF. We performed regression analysis to understand the contribution of CBF, CBF to CSVD imaging markers. Results or Findings: We found that CBF derived from both PLDs was associated with WMH volume and the presence of lacu ne. CBFPLD1.5 was significantly lower than CBFPLD2.0 in CSVD patients , and CBF was correlated with WMH volume but not the presence of lacune. Furthermore, CBFPLD2.0 and CBF were both associated with WMH in multiple regression analyses, suggesting an independent effect of delay ed arterial transit. CBF correlated with venous disruption but not large art ery stenosis. Conclusion: Both CBF and arterial transit were associated with ASL with multiple PLDs could provide additional hemodyn amic information to CSVD related studies. Limitations: First, we included patients at a single institution who had symptoms, and it might not represent the full spect rum of CSVD patients. Second, we only tested the CBFs derived from two PLDs. Verifying our results using ASL with multiple PLDs is needed.

Sun*; Shanghai/CN (cjs1119@hotmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in the normal- appearing white matter (NAWM) with small vessel dis ease (SVD) over 1-2 years using quantitative susceptibility (QS) mappin g and free-water (FW) mapping. Methods or Background: Fifty-one SVD patients were included. QS, FA, MD, FW, FW-corrected FA (FAT), and FW-corrected MD (MDT ) maps within white matter lesions (WMLs) and NAWM were generated for c omparison. We also used the ICBM-DTI-81 label atlas as an anatomic gui de and calculated the NAWM part in each of the WM tracts. Results or Findings: Over 1-2 years, no significant difference was found between baseline and follow-up in the WMLs. In cont rast, the QS values (index of demyelination) increased significantly in the NA WM at follow-up. Among WM tracts, we found the QS values in the NAWM part of the left superior frontal blade (SF), left occipital blade, right uncinate fasciculus, and right corticospinal tract (CST) was higher at follow-up. Results of FW (index of neuroinflammation/edema) analysis revealed that SVD patients at follow-up had increased FW in the NAWM part of the right CST and decreased FW in the NAWM part of the right inferior frontal blade (IF). The right SF and the right IF demonstrated significantly decreased FAT (indices o f axonal loss) at follow-up. The degree of FAT changes in the NAWM part of the r ight IF was positively correlated with MoCA scores changes. Conclusion: The results supported that SVD is a dynamic chronic disease and the NAWM in SVD is still in the progressive injury process. Distinguishing among demyelination, neuronal degeneration and neur oinflammation in the NAWM in vivo may provide a better understanding. Limitations: The limitations are no healthy controls.

Previously, we have revealed the metabolic changes in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of patients with MCI. In this study, using functional MRI we investigated the differences in the correlated activity of the PCC w ith other networks between normal subjects and patients with MCI. Methods or Background: The measurements were carried out on a Philips Ingenia 3.0 T scanner, 29 subjects took part in the study. The subjects were divided into the following groups: 1) 15 patients w ith diagnosed MCI - 13 women and 2 men (mean age = 68.2\u00b1 6.2) and 2) 14 ag e-matched controls - 12 women and 2 men (mean age = 66.1\u00b1 7.5). 3D T1w i mages were acquired. Functional MRI protocol: EPI pulse sequence, TR = 1.5s, TE = 35 ms, 120 dynamic scans. Preprocessing and statistical analys is of the anatomic and functional MRI data were performed with FMRIB's sof tware library tools. To study the resting-state networks, seed-based analys is was used with the PCC serving as the initial region. Statistical maps wer e calculated with Z-threshold of 3.1. Results or Findings: The change in the functional connectivity in the splenium of corpus callosum vs PCC was found in patients wit h MCI compared to the control group. Conclusion: The corpus callosum is an important structure of the brain, and a violation of the activity of this area in MCI can l ead to a change in the interhemispheric transmission. Also, this can be cr itical to the analysis of the incoming information, on which the normal functioni ng of the human brain depends. The revealed changes are promising.

Bao*; Kunming/CN Purpose: The characteristics of brain tissue change dynamically during aging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changing trend of relaxation values in different brain regions during brain agin g by synthetic MRI. Methods or Background: We conducted quantitative MRI tests on 1000 healthy people (aged from 20 to 85 years old) from September 2020 to October 2021. T1, T2 and Pd were simultaneously measured in interest (cerebellar cortex, pons, or Findings: In different brain regions, we found that the T1 va lue of male was slightly higher than that of female, and t he correlation was higher: the T1 value of frontal lobe and semiovale centre i ncreased with age (positive correlation); hippocampal tail and lenticular nucleus decreased with age (negative correlation); frontal lobe and semiovale centre increased with age (positive correlation). Conclusion: We found that the relaxation values of brain regions with differences between different genders in the same a ge group were slightly higher in males than in females, which may be of reference value for the incidence of some neurodegenerative diseases higher than that in females. Finally, with the increase of age, we found that th e relaxation values of different brain regions can be positively correlated, and som e of them are negatively correlated, which can provide a basis for us to ear ly judge brain aging and diagnose neurodegenerative diseases.

Ahn*, S. M. Lee; Seoul/KR Purpose: To investigate the correlation of volume doubling t ime (VDT) of pulmonary metastases with the subsequent appearance of new metastases and survival after metastasectomy in patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma. Methods or Background: Patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma who underwent their first complete pulmonary metastasec tomy between July 2010 and December 2020 were included. Volumetric segment ation for pulmonary metastases was performed on two CT scans, and VDTs were calculated. VDTs were compared in patients with and without subsequent new metastases. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were perfo rmed to determine risk factors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) after me tastasectomy and for post- metastasectomy survival (PS). Results or Findings: The study cohort consisted of 40 patients (21 women; mean age, 51.1\u00b114.3 years). Of these patients, 23 ( 57.5%) developed new metastatic nodules and 10 (25%) died during the fol low-up period. The median VDT was shorter in patients with rather than withou t new metastases after metastasectomy (56 vs. 140 days, p=0.002). The VDT of metastasis was associated with the occurrence of subsequent metast ases. Multivariable analysis showed 4.22; p=0.01), age (HR, 1.06; p= 0.004) were significantly related to a worse RFS. Moreover, age (HR, 1.17; p= 0.005) and independently correlated wi th a worse PS. None of the patients with VDT 140 days died during the study. Conclusion: The VDT of pulmonary metastasis was associated with subsequent new metastases and survival after pulmonary metastasectomy. VDT may be considered when planning pulmonary metas tasectomy. Limitations: Identified limitations of this study were: the smal l population, retrospective nature, and heterogeneity of treatment after the post- metastasectomy occurrence of new metastases.

Methods or Background: 56 NSCLC patients underwent CT, with PET/CT, surgical resection and pathological and follow- up examinations. Then, the solid component within each tumour as a ratio between consolidation and total tumour (C/T ratio) by each method, ADC and SUVmax at all primary lesions were assessed. All indexes were compared between N0 and equal to or more than N1 (N1 ) cases by Student's t test. Multiple regression analysis was performed to deter mine predictors for differentiating two groups among all MR indexes. Then, ROC analysis and McNemar's test were also performed to compare diagn ostic performances among all indexes and combined MR predictors. Results or Findings: There was significant difference of each index betw een N0 and N1 cases (p<0.05). C/T ratio from UTE-MRI Dual and AD C were determined to be significant predictors (p<0.05). A UC of ADC (AUC=0.84), SUVmax (AUC=0.82) or combined MR predictors (AUC=0. 90) were significantly larger than that of each C/T ratio (0 .68<AUC<0.74, p<0.05). Specificity or accuracy of combined MR predictors w ere significantly higher than those of others (p<0.05). Conclusion: UTE-MRI Dual is considered as having the capability to be a significant predictor for lymph node metastasis sim ilar to DWI, and combined MR predictors shows significantly higher capability than CT and FDG-PET/CT in this setting.

Wang, Zhao; Jinan/CN (kongbeixiaobao@163.com) Purpose: To investigate the automatic segmentation and T-staging based on CT images in patients with oesophageal squamous cel l carcinoma (ESCC). Methods or Background: CT datasets from 600 patients (mean age, 63\u00b18 years; 477 male, 123 female) with pathologically confirmed ESCC between July 2014 and February 2021 were retrospectively collected, and the ratio of the T1, T2, T3 and T4 ESCC patients was 1:1:1:1. Th e imaging datasets were randomly grouped (4:1 ratio). Dataset 1 (480 cases) was used to construct the automatic segmentation models based on 2D-UNet and 3D-UNet and the T- staging model based on radiomics. Manual segmentati on of the primary tumours was delineated as ground truth. Then, the s egmentation task and the T-classification task were integrated to construct the artificial intelligence (AI) T- staging tool. Dataset 2 (120 cases) was used for testing, which was unprocessed original DICOM data not exposed in the model training process. Performance of segmentation was evaluated by Dice c oefficient and mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU). Performance of the AI T-staging tool was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve and compared with the junior and senior radiologists. Results or Findings: Experiments showed that the 3D-UNet outperforms the 2D-UNet based segmentation model (Dice coefficient, 0.846\u00b10.007; mIoU, 0.907\u00b10.014 vs 0.885\u00b10.005). The AI T-staging tool reached the areas under the curve of 0.94, 0.76, 0. 74, and 0.88 for T1, T2, ESCC, respectively.

Tahir, M A/US (florianfintelmann@gmail.com) Purpose: To explore the association and predictive value of non-cancerous features on chest CT with overall survival (OS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Methods or Background: This retrospective study included consecutive patients with stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT from 2009 to 2017. We quantified coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, pul monary artery to aorta (PA:Ao) ratio, emphysema, and skeletal muscle at the level of vertebral bodies T5, T8, and T10. We constructed multivariable Cox m odels adjusting for age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) stat us, smoking status, body mass index, gross tumour volume, and imaging f eatures. We used LASSO to derive prediction coefficients and evaluat ed the discriminative ability of models using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Results or Findings: Of 282 consecutively included patients, 168 (59.6%) were females (median age 75 years [interquartile ra nge [IQR] 68-81 years]). 148 patients (52.5%) died after a median survival t ime of 60.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] [CI 5-1.52], P<0.001, per 0.1 unit score 11-399 (HR 0.78-0.99], P=0.03, per 10 cm\u00b2/m\u00b2 increase) were as sociated with OS. At 5- years, models incorporating clinical and imaging fe atures outperformed models with clinical features alone (AUC 0.75 vs PA:Ao and thoracic muscle predict OS in stage I NSCLC treated with SBRT. Limitations: Radiotherapy planning CT scans are not optimized for CAC scoring or emphysema densitometry. External data is needed to validate our prediction models.

Methods or Background: A retrospective study of 48 patients with surgicall y resected BA/CMPT between January 2018 and September 2021 was performed. Clinical and CT data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated CT features. BA/CMPT is a peripheral pulm onary tumour newly defined by the World Health Organization in 2021. H owever, the clinical and radiological characteristics have not been well des cribed. Results or Findings: There were 48 patients (30 women and 18 men; mean age, 59\u00b19 years; range, 32-75 years), including 30 (62.5%) patients with BA/CMPT and 18 (37.5%) patients with BA/CMPT coexis ting with lung cancer. For the patients with only BA/CMPT, 28 of 30 (93.3% ) patients had no obvious symptoms, and the level of lung tumour markers were within the normal range in 21 of 30 (70.0%) patients. All the tumours were located in the subpleural area. 25 of 48 (52.1%) tumours presented as subsoli d nodules (mainly dense or GGNs), 13 solid , 8 nodules, and 2 (4.2%) consolidations. CT showed small size (mean diameter, 10\u00b17 mm; range signs were are, BA/CMPT presenting as solid lesions showed dela yed significant enhancement, accompanied by angiogram sign in the arterial phase. Preoperative follow-up was available in 14 patients , the tumours remained unchanged or grew slowly. Conclusion: BA/CMPT characterised small, nodules with morphological diversity. Limitations: Small sample size. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional review board. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Methods or Background: Fifty-one patients (37 males, 14 females) with a proven diagnosis of central type lung cancer accomp anied by atelectasis in Shandong Cancer Hospital from January to December 2 020 were retrospectively enrolled. Chest images were acquired using DLSCT in three staging examinations (unenhanced, arterial-phase and venous-phase). Two radiologists determined presence/absence of tumours independently. Tumour visualization was compared between conventional images (CI), 40keV VMI, IDI and VM-ID in different staging examinations. Quanti tative image analysis was Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 222 performed by assessing the maximum diameter of tumours in the four-types of images. Results or Findings: Among three staging examinations, venous-phase images showed significantly higher probability of v isualization compared to arterial-phase (x2=52.40, P<0.001) with 4, 5, 5, 6 and 17, 35, 39, 38 tumours detected in CI, VMI40keV, IDI and VM-ID respectivel y, while all unenhanced images showed uncertain diagnoses because of insuff icient contrast. In venous-phase examination, spectral images (40keV VMI, IDI and VM-ID) showed significantly higher diagnostic performances than those of CI (x2=- 0.35, -0.43, -0.41 respectively, all P<0.001) but no significant difference among intra-group comparisons (all P>0.05) was observed. Seventeen tumours were visualized in all four-types of images of the venous phase, while the quantitative image analysis was insignificant among all the types of images (x2=3.61, P=0.31). Conclusion: The venous phase spectral images of DLSCT could improve tumor visualization of central type lung cancer acc ompanied by atelectasis but contribute little to quantitative delineation.

Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 139 patients with surgically resected sMPLCs between December 2011 an d March 2020 from our hospital. CT-imaging characteristics were analy sed using multinomial univariable and multivariable logistic regression a nalysis to identify discriminating factors for LN metastasis. These fac tors were used to develop a novel CT-based multi-parameter decision tree algori thm model (CT-DTA). This model was then combined with other clinicopathologi cal characteristics to further evaluate the performance of the CT-DTA model by multivariable logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Finally, performance of the CT-DTA model was valida ted with a cohort of 96 sMPLC cases from two other hospitals. Results or Findings: Of the CT-derived characteristics of sMPLC, five radiological parameters including lesions with spic ulation, pure solid nodules, long-axis diameters of the solid portions, long-axi s diameters of the lesions and consolidation tumor ratio (CTR) were finally included in the decision tree model. AUCs of the training cohort, the validation cohort, and the entire cohort were 0.905, 0.812 and 0.861, respectively. Multivar iable analysis showed that the CT-DTA model is an independent factor for predi cting lymph node metastasis in a training cohort (OR = 2.09, P = 0.003) and validation cohort (OR = 1.53, P = 0.041). Conclusion: CT-based multi-parameter decision tree algorithm model is potentially a non-invasive and easy-to-use method f or LN metastasis status prediction in sMPLC, which can help with clinical decision making. Limitations: This is a retrospective study and is subject to inh erent limitations associated with retrospective analyses.

Bicci*, E. Busoni, V. Miele; Florence/IT Purpose: The aim of our study is to find a correlation using Radiomics, on images detected with different Computed Tomography (CT) scanners, between texture features of primary lesion of neuroendocrin e (NET) lung cancer subtypes (typical and atypical carcinoids, large an d small-cell neuroendocrine presence of lymph-n mediastinal metastases. Methods or Background: Sixty patients with histological diagnosis of pulmonary NET with known Ki-67 status and metastases who have performed pre-treatment CT in our department were included. A fter segmentation of primary lesions, quantitative texture parameters of first and higher orders were extracted. Statistical non-parametric tests were conducted. Results or Findings: Regarding the relationship between tumour subtypes and Ki-67 values, statistically significant (p-value<0,05) differences were seen in post-contrast enhanced CT in various first-order and in one second-order extracted features (correlation). For direct acquis ition, many second-order features were significant. Concerning the correlati on with metastases in post- contrast acquisitions, some first-order features we re statistically significant (median, root-mean-squared and 90th percentile). Many second-order features were significant in direct acquisitions, including Maximal Correlation Coefficient (MCC), cluster prominence and strength, also signif icant in correlating direct images with tumour the aggressiveness. Conclusion: Some first-order radiomics CT features can be used as a valid and reproducible tool for predicting the subtype of lung NET. CT texture analysis in direct examination is useful in the evaluation of both tumour class and aggressiveness. Limitations: Examinations were performed on different CTs, leadi ng to an inhomogeneous sample which, although a limitation, can be useful in creating reproducible results. Another limitation is the num ber of patients with this rare neoplasm, accurately selected, to obtain a homogeneous sample in twelve years of data collection.

A. Minoiu; Bucharest/RO RPS 1105-2 Exploring automated MR logfile analysis and clinical context to quantify exam changeover time as basis for future workflow o ptimisation *X. Wang*\u00b9, topi c, due to many factors influencing performance. In this study, we explore how MR logfiles and selected information on clinical context can be use d to quantify and even predict workflow elements. Here we focus on the exam changeover time, which typically adds no value to the workflow, and invest igate its influencing factors to assist workflow orchestration. Methods or Background: Data consists of pre-processed logfiles of 19680 exams from three MR scanners across two radiology d epartments and additional context information of 735 exams derived from questionnaires filled out by technologists. All data is de-identified and stored in an in-house database for statistical analysis. Results or Findings: From the logfiles, we quantify the changeover time for various combinations of examined body parts in pair s of sequential exams, revealing their correlations. As an example of the influence of patient characteristics, our analysis identifies that child ren (<10y) have the longest changeover time, 18.1 min, significantly longer (P< 0.01) than other age groups. From the additional clinical context, we conclude t hat (1) exams of patients with limited mobility have significantly longer cha ngeover time than other Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 223 exams, 18.9 min vs. 16.1 min; (2) when communicatio n with patients is restricted, a 7-min delay is observed; and (3) sett ing up pulse oximetry, ECG, or intubation extends changeover time by 8.4 min, 7.9 min and 20.1 min, respectively. Conclusion: Accurate quantification of changeover time reveals different influencing factors that need to be considered in w orkflow planning and orchestration. Our multidimensional dataset is well suited for future AI-based predictions of changeover time or other workflow pa rameters. The feasibility of such predictions will be discussed in the presentat ion. Limitations: Clinical context dataset is limited in size and should be extended in future research.

Author Disclosures: Siva Sustanaibility in radiology: a model of optimisatio n for the development of a green, ecofriendly and a model of optimisation for daily routin e and management of radiology requests, acquisition of wr itten informed consensus, delivery of reports and Dicom image. To analyse the impact of a \"green radiology\" in terms of a cost-efficacy analysis, em phasizing the outcome of this model based on ecofriendly resources. Methods or Background: Four main steps of a radiological work-flow need to be focused: 1) the formulation of a request; 2) the acquisition of written informed consensus by patients; 3) the writing of r adiological reports; 4) the delivery dicom images for patients. These four steps would be virtually assessed by an \"ecofriendly smart radiology\". Results or Findings: In some hospitals, there are still models based on radiology requests edited by general practioners and printed on papersheets: these requests are booked using phone-call services . Eco-friendly models could be based on web-service systems for radiologi cal reservations, emphasising use of dematerialised requests. A great possibility could be achieved using online applications, installed on sm artphones and tablets, to book examinations easily and quickly. Detailed info rmation about procedures and examinations could be prudently sent to patient s through emails and/or web based interviews, informative materials will no longer be printed, avoiding paper waste. Written informed consensus could be ob tained in a dematerialised form, based on a digital signature: this will ensure a more consistent and safe storage. Finally, radiology rep orts could be accurately sent by email using PDF/A files, avoiding unnecessary tr ips to-and-from the hospitals. Images could be easily consulted through online links, without increasing costs of digital versatile discs or other paper-based iconograhic supports. Conclusion: An optimised, eco-friendly and green model of radiology should be adopted, increasing the diffusion of economicall y sustainable and effective models. Limitations: Not applicable.

Polici*, V. Tamburi, F. Pucciarelli, A. Laghi; Rome/IT (policimichela28@gmail.com) Purpose: To explore the rapid response of the radiology unit of an academic hospital in Rome during the COVID-19 pandemic. To a nalyse the ward's governance decisions, almost all made empirically i n the first wave and supported by a dedicated business analytics softwar e with real-time data on imaging workflows in the second wave, then manage b oth acute emergencies and chronic oncologic/fragile patients. Methods or Background: A retrospective review of the imaging volumes and workflows for 2019 and 2020 was performed. Informat ion was collected from the hospital's data warehouse and evaluated using a business analytics software operating since March 2019. Data was aggregated both per week and per quarter, stratified by patient service location (emergency department, inpatients, outpatients) and imaging modality (x-ray, mammography, densitometry, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and interventional radiology). For the emergency radiology sub-unit, we reviewed average number of examinations per hour, CT examination allocation between the pri mary and secondary/backup machine, and CT median turnaround time (TAT), especially for weeks 11-15 and 45-48 of both years. Results or Findings: During the first pandemic peak (11-15w 2019 vs 11-15w 2020) significant drops (P<0.001) in emergency (-73 .2%), inpatient (-35.4%), and outpatient (-66.4%) examinations were registered. In the second pandemic peak (45-48w 2019 vs 45-48w 2020) significant (P<0. 001) drops only in emergency (-41.7%) and inpatient (-10.1%) examinati ons were registered. For the emergency department, the average number of examinations per hour and CT median TAT during the first and the second pandemic peaks (2019 vs 2020) were -24.7%, +37.3%, +3.4%, and +32.8%, respe ctively. Conclusion: Business analytics are extremely powerful in providing precise insight of real-time changing scenarios. When appli ed to a radiology unit it facilitated evidenced-based timely organisational d ecisions during a crisis, controlling infections, minimizing productivity los s, and maximising efficiency.

Methods or Background: 767,256 radiology reports dictated from 01/2013- 12/2019 were included into analysis. During this ti me period structured reporting templates were introduced. Plain report t exts were extracted from the institutional RIS and converted into a 20-dimension number vector using the doc2vec approach. Vectors closer together in vector -space represent higher report similarity, larger vector distance translates into lower report similarity. To allow for two-dimensional data plotting and assessm ent, a t-SNE approach was applied. Finally, data was enriched with RIS at tributes (e.g. modality and body region) to enable in-depth analysis. Results or Findings: With two-dimensional data visualisation, free-text report vectors were spread along the plot's x- and y-axis, overlapping between distinct imaging studies and thus indistinguishable from each other. With structured reporting, document vectors were clearly organised into distinguishable clusters, each representing a disti nct imaging study (e.g. abdominal ultrasound or prostate MRI). Higher linguistic similarity of specific report types with structured reporting was expressed by lower mean x- and y- coordinate distance of individual reports from the cluster's centroid (i.e. elements closer together within clusters; e.g. [x- coordinate spread: 1.36 vs. 16.39;p<.001]). Higher semant ic distinguishability between report types was expressed by larger distan ce between the centroids' coordinates (i.e. clusters further apart from each other; e.g. CT abdomen-pelvis vs abdominal ultrasound [x-coordinate y-coordinate distance: Conclusion: Structured reporting increases linguistic standardi sation when reporting specific types of imaging studies. This m ay allow natural language processing algorithms to identify the reported imaging study based on report content alone. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

This work is part of the INGESA's (Spanish National Institute of Health Management) project for the creation of a national patient dose registry. The objective is the creation of a working method t o establish dynamic diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) based on the dos es registered in diagnostic imaging procedures within the Spanish territory. Methods or Background: DRLs are a useful tool in patient dose optimisation. These are established on the basis of the data generated in different Spanish hospitals. As the DRLs are computed from real patie nt data, the source of information for the project are the different radiation dose management systems, being the anonymisation of these data a key factor for their sharing. The collection of these data has to be carried out through the integration and application of established standards such as DICOM or IHE. The management of the information from a national platform would allow the application of advanced data analysis techniques and, therefore, f acilitate the establishment of dynamic Spanish reference levels. Results or Findings: A proof of concept based on synthetic data generated by virtual dose management systems has been developed, to show the main functionalities of the national dose registry such as anonymisation, normalisation, visualisation of results and especially the analysis through interactive control panels. Conclusion: A platform has been created with synthetic data all owing the generation of diagnostic reference levels, which ar e an effective tool to establish comparisons between different modalities, equipment and territories and to optimise patient doses.

Fitousi*\u00b9, J. Binst\u00b9, T. Szczykutowicz\u00b2, S. Ros has highlighted the repeat rates in CT as a significant source of excess radiation and time loss in radiolo gy. Therefore, as part of quality optimisation activities, the number of repeated scans was evaluated using a commercially available software equipped wi th an automated protocol analyser. Methods or Background: For a period of one year, information on examinations from six CT scanners in a large Europe an university hospital was retrieved with a dose management system (DOSE, Qael um, Belgium). The data were then analysed by a commercial software (F OQAL-CT repeat, Qaelum), which uses a fully automatic algorithm, developed by the University of Wisconsin. The algorithm identifies typical prot ocols and then tracks outliers and performs a further quantification. Repeat rates (RR) were calculated per acquisition type (spiral, axial, localiser) and per protocol. Results or Findings: Out of 58623 analysed examinations (137658 series), 7.0% were ignored due to low occurrence. In 211 ide ntified protocols, 2619 exams contained a repeat, resulting in an overall R R of 4.8%. In the initial pass of the algorithm through the data, clinically accep table repeats were identified reflecting acute stroke (29.7%), high resolution chest (inspiration/expiration) (12.3%) and kidney scans with late excretion phase (6.5%). The FOQAL-CT repeat module allowed to label these protocols with clinically acceptable deviations from the standard, resulting in a \"real\" spiral RR of 1.9%. High localiser RR was found for trauma protocols (overal l 4.4% on trauma protocols). Conclusion: The RR analysis correctly detected that for 3 speci fic protocols radiologists actively adjust the exam to the patient situation. This is considered good practice. The automated tool identified also r eal outliers, meaning protocols that require adjustments or extra trainin g. The new software is a sophisticated option for true optimisation in imagi ng.

Kopp; Erlangen/DE (matthias.may@uk-erlangen.de) Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility patient consent (D- IPC) for computed tomography (CT) and to compare di gitised information with the conventional, paper-based IPC process (C-IPC). Methods or Background: Consecutively 2459 patients were scheduled for a routine CT examination. Several questions were aske d using a mobile tablet device considering general patient history (e.g. pr ior CT examinations, malignant diseases, cardiovascular disease) and pos sible contraindication (Red Flags) for a CT examination (e.g. thyroid hyperfunction, kidney malfunction). First, we compared the age between the patients, who were able and unable ( 4 answered questions) to sufficiently answer the q uestionnaire. Second, we compared the prevalence of Red Flags bet ween D-IPC and C-IPC. Third, we analysed the prevalence of the most relev ant diseases and complications. Results or Findings: A total of 335 (13.6%) patients answered the questionnaire insufficiently. These patients were older (64 \u00b1 13.6 years; p<0.001) compared to the 2124 included patients (58.6 \u00b1 14.2 years). In total 395 Red Flags were detected digitally, but only 47 of these were documented in the C-IPC. The congruency for thyroid hyperfunct ion, kidney malfunction, hemodialysis and claustrophobia was less than 10%. Most prevalent Red Flags were kidney diseases (11.1%), claustrophobia (10%) and allergic reactions against contrast-agents (4.6%). Severe al lergic reactions were rare (0.3%). Conclusion: Patients who are unable to complete D-IPC are signi ficantly older. D-IPC can ensure accurate patient history recordings, which is mandatory to perform CT examinations safely. Paper- based archiving of critical data is error-prone. Limitations: D-IPC requires a technical setup and investment cos ts. Not all patients in a clincal setting can manage D-IPC.

Haanen\u00b9, T. D. L. schi\u00b9; \u00b9Amsterdam/NL, \u00b2Zurich/CH Purpose: Tumour response to in clinical trials is ty pically evaluated with RECIST. These criteria presuppose that the tar get lesions can be objectively identified and measured on CT scans. This study aims to investigate the extent of target lesion selection v ariability in RECIST by means of computer simulation models of clinical trials. Methods or Background: We implemented a model for the simulation of clinical trials, by controlling the effects tumour growth, number of lesions and affected organs for multiple virtual patient cohort s. Each patient was assessed by multiple readers, who randomly selected valid ta rget lesions according to RECIST criteria. The particular conditions under which RECIST is inconsistent, Thursday Abstract-based Programme A B 225 despite being correctly employed, were then analysed. We further validated the results of the simulation model on a retrospective dataset of 96 cancer patients receiving immunotherapy. Lesion measurements were p erformed automatically from expert's segmentation. Results or Findings: Variability increases when the number of measurable lesions is large and when lesion growth borders the thresholds for progressive disease and partial response. For 15.6% of the immunotherapy patients the discordance in the selection of target lesions was sufficiently large to result in distinct response classifications (interreader agreement: = 0.30). Conclusion: RECIST evaluations are inconsistent even in the abs ence of measurement variability. The choice of lesions at b aseline alone has a significant impact on RECIST outcomes. Five target lesions alone might not be sufficient to adequately portray overall tumour bur den and determine response to treatment. Limitations: Only two timepoints (baseline and first follow-up) were simulated and analysed, which can potentially lead to an imbalance of RECIST categories.

Meetschen*\u00b9, K. aims to evaluate the impact of the newly developed Similar Patient Search (SPS) web service, which sup ports reading complex lung diseases on computed tomography, on residents' diagnostic accuracy. Methods or Background: SPS is an image-based search engine that provides rapid access to images with similar patter n from a large database of pre-diagnosed cases matched with corresponding clinical reference content (https://eref.thieme.de). The reference database was created using 13,658 annotated ROIs from chest CT scans of 621 patients, comprising 69 diseases of the lung. For validation, five radiology residents without SPS and three months later with SPS evaluated 50 CT scans. Residents were allowed to submit a maximum of three diagnoses per case. Results or Findings: Without SPS, the residents achieved an average scor e of 17.6\u00b15.0 points. By using SPS, residents increas ed their score by 81.8% to 32.0\u00b19.5 points. The score improvement per case was highly significant (0.35 vs 0.64 p=0.0001). Residents took an average of 205.9\u00b1350.6 seconds per case (21.9% more) when SPS was used. In the second half of cases, after residents were more familiar with SPS, this time in crease was reduced to 7%. Conclusion: Residents' reading accuracy on complex chest CT scans improved by over 80% when AI-driven SPS with integr ated clinical reference content was used. Limitations: No books or Internet sources were available to the residents as sources of information. Therefore, further studies should investigate how SPS compare with other sources of information.

With the remaining 16 animals (96 ex aminations), the GAN was trained for an image-to-image conversion from lowCM to standardCM. Subsequently, ROI-measurements were performed in the abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava, portal vein, liver parenchyma, and autochthonous back muscles, and the CNR was calculated. Furthermore, t he standardCM and the virtual standard dose data (virtualCM) were demonst rated in a visual-Turing- test (VTT) to 3 radiology consultants, who had to decide whether they would have reported images from both examinations identic al and which images originates from the standardCM exam. Results or Findings: Mean CNR significantly (P<0.0001) increased by GAN in all contrast phases and was not significantly different from the standardCM examination (1.4\u00b11.0 lowCM, 5.0\u00b14.8 virtualCM, 5.1\u00b1 5.7 standardCM). In VTT, average, the testers reported that the standardCM and virtualCM images were identical in 93% of the examinations. T esters could identify the standardCM data as such in 80% of the cases. Conclusion: This feasibility study on healthy minipigs demonstr ates that the amount of CM for abdominal CT might be reduced by a bout 71.4% using GAN- based contrast enhancement while maintaining compar able image quality. Limitations: The study was performed under highly standardised l aboratory conditions and the collective consisted only of healthy animals. Ethics committee approval: The animal experiment has been approved by the local state authority. Funding for this study: The study was performed in cooperation with Bayer AG.

Methods or Background: The study included a group of 151 patients qualifie d for medical reasons for CTA of carotid arteries. By randomisation, 50 (33.11%) patients underwent examination using the low-dose p rotocols using the back projection (group I), and 50 (33.11%) with the iter ative reconstruction ASIR 40% (group II). The control group consisted of 51 ( 33.77%) patients examined with the standard protocol (group III). The diagnos tic quality of the obtained images was assessed by 3 medical specialists on the forms prepared for the study. Results or Findings: The radiation dose (DLP) during CTA in group I was 218.4 [mGy cm], while in group II 207.2 [mGy cm]. T hese doses were statistically significantly lower than in the contr ol group III, which was 317.9 [mGy cm], p <0.001. The mean evaluations of the 4 parameters performed by radiologists in each of the 7 segments of the carot id arteries did not differ statistically in the standard and low dose protocol . However, in the iterative protocol (ASIR 40%), the mean scores in individual arterial sections (initial CCA, intracranial ICA, V1 VA, V4 VA) were statistic ally significantly higher than in the group I and III. Conclusion: The radiation doses were reduced by about 31% in gr oup I and by 35% in group II. The low-dose protocol using the iterative reconstruction had the highest mean image quality ratings with the lowest radiation dose. Therefore, this method is recomended if its available. Limitations: Protocol details can depend on various computer tom ographs. Ethics committee approval: Consent of the local Bioethics Committee No. 764/2019 was obtained. Funding for this study: A low-dose carotid CTA protocol with iterative reconstruction (ASIR 40%) has the best image qualit y while enabling a dose reduction of 35%.

Fiebich\u00b9, A. study was to evaluate the contri bution of contrast monitoring techniques to overall dose in a CT exam and to optimise patient dose. Methods or Background: CT retrospective study of 500 patients from a Siemens device (Somatom Definition) were analysed. High dose contrast- monitoring protocols were selected. 170 thoracic-ab dominal CT exams presented high monitoring-dose in comparison to other studies. Exposure parameters were retrieved from the radiation dose s tructure report (RDSR). Two dose optimisation strategies based on parameter settings were implemented and the third is still to be tested in routine exams. Dose and diagnostic quality after each optimisation was assessed. Initial parameter of 120kV and 80mAs was reduced to100kV and 20mAs. Sign al-to-noise ratios before and after optimisation were determined. Finally, the contrast media density curve was also evaluated as a measure to delay the scan start after injection. Results before and after optimisation were compared and discussed. Results or Findings: Average DLP dose of monitoring in thoracic-abdominal CT studies was 35mGy*cm using a standard 120kV and protocol. After optimisation to 100kV and 20mAs, average DLP dose w as reduced to 5mGy*cm for contrast-monitoring scans. Subsequently , minimum Signal-to- noise ratio from initial setting was 4.2\u00b13.3 versus 3.3\u00b11.8 after optimisation. Initial scan start from 12s increased to 15s after injection can be achieved. Conclusion: Despite a short scan length and relatively small DLP, contrast- monitoring techniques set at 120kV can account for 14% of the overall dose from a thoracic-abdominal CT study. By decreasing k ilovoltage, tube current and delaying start scan time of contrast-monitoring component, a significant reduction in overall dose can be achieved without affecting diagnostic quality or timing. Results presented should serve as incentive to include monitoring dose, that is both CTDIvol and DLP, when setting diagnost ic reference levels for CT examinations. Limitations: Flow rate and haemodynamics were absent. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was not sought. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Lilian Abou Assali: Investigator: Student Alexander K\u00f6nig: Occupational Worker patients of high-resolution scan mode (Hi-res) on image quality and radiation dose for cardiac comput ed tomography angiography scanning in patients with stents. Methods or Background: Eighteen patients with coronary stents presenting for cardiac CT were randomly scanned on the Revolut ion Apex CT scanner (GE Healthcare, USA). Three scan protocols were use d according to patient diameters (AP+Lat): 1) Hi-res with 80kVp (39-56.99c m), 2) Hi-res with 100kVp (57-63.5cm), 3) standard protocol with kV assist (< 63.6cm). All images were reconstructed with ASiR-V 50% and TrueFidelity in t hree levels. Image quality was assessed objectively (HU, noise). A cardiologis t subjectively evaluated spatial resolution of each stent on all image stack s, which were randomly displayed and scored from 1 (lowest)-4 (highest quality). Effective dose was calculated. Results or Findings: The mean effective dose for the three protocols wer e 1.35, 1.6 and 3.0mSv, respectively. Hi-res with 80k Vp (n=1) showed a decrease in image noise from ASiR-V 50% to TrueFidelity low (42%), medium (61%) and high (67%). Hi-res with 100kVp (n=11) showed a decrease in noise by 39% from ASiR-V 50% to TrueFidelity low, medium (54%) and high (61%). Standard protocol with kV assist (n=6), noise was r educed by 20% for TrueFidelity low, medium (34%) and high (52%). The difference in noise between the three protocols (89.7HU, 64.5HU, 35.5HU ) showed that the patients scanned without Hi-res had up to 153% less image noise. The stent evaluation showed that the best visualisation of th e stent was obtained at TrueFidelity High, for all but one patient with stent calcifications (TrueFidelity medium). Conclusion: Hi-res scan mode substantially increases image nois e which to some extend can be reduced by applying TrueFidelity . Hi-res did not affect subjective spatial resolution around the stent. Limitations: Limited amount of patients. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

W. Reidy*, W. A. Moynihan, P. Sheehy, J. M. O'B rien, S. Atyani; Limerick/IE Limerick always strives to impr ove patients' experience. This novel streamlined integrated ED pathway is based on validated, peer-reviewed scientific data representi ng best possible clinical practice. Patients are cared for by an interdepartm ental team in a safe, patient- Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 228 focused and cost effective manner. Our aim was to i ntroduce CTCA into ED to facilitate patients who met the criteria of the che st pain pathway in order to reduce admissions and augmenting same day discharge . Methods or Background: This service was first introduced pre-covid pandemic January 2019. We have successfully increas ed our volume of patients scanned year on year. A 40% increase of CT CA eligible patients were imaged after the covid pandemic began than prior. P atients presenting to ED with a strong clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease and met strict inclusion criteria were eligible to undergo CTCA. A ll scans were performed using a 128 slice scanner. Results or Findings: 366 patients were scanned in total since the beginning of first implementation. 351 of these patients had same day discharge representing a 96% success rate. 68% of all CTCA sc ans were performed during the covid pandemic. Radiation reduction dose was found to be 40% when compared to conventional coronary angiography in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. Average cost effectiven ess was found to be 600 euro for CTCA in ED versus 4000 euro for hospital admission and conventional angiography. Conclusion: CTCA has been successfully integrated into the ED c linical decision unit chest pain pathway replacing exercise ECG. CTCA is more accurate, allowing definite identification of coronary artery disease. This initiative is a patient-centred approach that is less invasive, resulting in shorter hospital stays for patients with significant radiat ion dose reduction while also proving to be cost-effective. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Additionally, local statistics of AI find ings were evaluated. Methods or Background: This research consisted of two phases and employed a non-experimental, cross-sectional quanti tative approach. Phase 1 comprised a self-designed data collection sheet to retrospectively determine the occurrence of recalled computed tomography (CT) examinations as a result of AI findings. In phase 2, a self-designed structured questionnaire with anonymised CT scan images (n=30) displayed on ViewD ex was prospectively completed by CT radiographers (n=23). Moreover, the image quality of each CT examination was evaluated to ensure that the image quality was not affecting the radiographers' detection rate. Results or Findings: In phase 1, AIs were present in 1.4% of contrast- enhanced CT (CECT) examinations (n=12 139), out of which, 79.82% were not acknowledged by the radiographers and had to be rec alled for a dedicated adrenal CT examination. In phase 2, a statistically significant relation (p<0.05) between the radiographers' educational level, worki ng hours and years of experience, to the detection rate of AIs was determ ined. Furthermore, no statistical correlation was determined between the image quality and the radiographers' detection rate. Conclusion: Findings suggest that certain socio-demographic cha racteristics of radiographers affected their ability to recognis e AIs. This could have potentially contributed to one of the reasons for r ecalling patients, which in turn results in an added burden to both the patient and the medical imaging department (MID). Limitations: The filtering process used to acquire the data set was limited to specific keywords, commonly used in the radiologist s' reports.

W. Kusk*; Esbjerg/DK (martin.weber.kusk@rsyd.dk) Purpose: To develop a method for introducing motion artefact s and simulate reduced temporal resolution in cardiac CT images. U sing original, artefact-free images as reference standard, such a method could be used to quantify the influence of scanner type, heartrate and respiration on for example cardiac volume measurements. Methods or Background: High-quality functional cardiac CT series were used as input. Image processing was done in MATLAB. Respiration was simulated by spatial shifting of portions of the image stack. Pulsation artefacts were produced by conversion to sinograms, and mixing of data from different phases at discrete positions. Temporal resolution reduction was simulated by mixing sinograms from overlapping temporal phases over the entire scan range. Artificial noise was introduced to compensate for i ncreased data volume. Images were reconstructed using inverse Radon trans form. 20 real and simulated artefact image pairs were evaluated in bl inded fashion by two cardiac CT radiographers. Results or Findings: Simulated artefacts were qualitatively similar to r eal artfacts and could be analysed at clinical workstat ion. Artefact severity could be controlled by parameter adjustment. Radiographer s were not able to distinguish real from simulated artefacts. Conclusion: Motion artefact simulation is a viable alternative to expensive dynamic phantoms, for evaluation on clinical images , allowing for inter-patient variation. Limitations: Phase sampling interval, heartrate and temporal res olution of input images limits the possibility of artefact int roduction in some cases. Some loss of spatial information resulted from the use of the Radon/inverse Radon transform, limiting applicability in high-resolutio n imaging. Ethics committee approval: Danish National Research Ethics Comittee approved the retrospective use of image data without patient consent (approval no. 2015994).

Davis; Dublin/IE (heather-35@hotmail.co.uk) Purpose: determine CT radiographers are at performing paediatric CT traum a scans at two district general hospitals in Wales, and whether teaching sessions on this topic have assisted in improving the radiographers' perceived confidence. Methods or Background: In 2020, trauma was one of the leading causes of paediatric mortality in England and Wales. Use of C T can provide time efficient and accurate diagnosis, increasing chances of survi val, and this has subsequently lead to an increase in the use of CT over the last 25 years. However, whilst the use of CT in assisting in the e valuation of paediatric trauma has been invaluable, it carries a significan t radiation risk, largely because paediatric patients have a greater sensitiv ity with regard to radiation when compared to adults. Although national paediatr ic trauma workload within the UK is proportionately low, the majority of paediatric patients are conveyed to hospitals which predominately scan adults. Indiv idual questionnaires containing qualitative and quantitative aspects wer e used to ascertain the radiographers' initial perceived confidence levels and reasons for this figure. Following this, a teaching intervention was formula ted by the researchers which was delivered to CT radiographers across the two sites. A post-teaching intervention questionnaire was used to determine wh ether the radiographers' confidence levels had improved due to the teaching intervention. Results or Findings: The results will provide useful data on confidence levels regarding CT radiographers performing CT paediatric trauma scans. Conclusion: The results will provide useful data on confidence levels regarding CT radiographers performing CT paediatric trauma scans. Limitations: Small sample size, reporters' bias (as it is radiographers' perceived confidence), information bias (might have been introduced during the collecting and measuring stages as the research er knows some participants).

Criscuolo*, V. E. Siggillino, A. P. Savoldi, S. Casale, L. Caschera, M. Triulzi, G. Conte; Mi lan/IT (stefania.criscuolo@unimi.it) Purpose: To explore superficial white matter alterations (SW M) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and its relationship to cerebr ospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with neurodegenerative dementia (ND). Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled 97 ND patients who had undergone assessment of CSF levels of amyloid- 42 (A42), total-tau (T- TAU), and phosphorylated tau (P-TAU), and brain MRI . They were divided into 55 NDs with abnormal A 42 (A+) and 38 NDs with normal A 42 (A-). Ten healthy controls (HC) were recruited for imaging and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The following DTI metrics of th e SWM were calculated for each lobe: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean dif fusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (L1), and radial diffusivity (RD). Results or Findings: Both A+ and A- showed lower MMSE compared to HC (p < 0.005). A + showed lower FA and higher MD, L1, and RD across all lobes compared to HC. A - showed higher FA and lower MD and RD in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, and lower L1 in the right frontal lobe compared to HC. A 42 showed a positive correlation with FA in all lob es, and a negative correlation with L1, MD, and RD in the par ietal lobe bilaterally, with MD in left temporal and right occipital lobes, with RD in left temporal and occipital lobes. T-TAU showed significant positive correlations with L1, MD, and RD bilaterally in the frontal, parietal, and ri ght temporal lobes and with L1 in the right occipital lobe. P-TAU showed positive correlations with L1, MD, and RD in the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Conclusion: DTI detects and locates SWM alterations, it may be a promising non-invasive biomarker in the preclinical phase of ND. Limitations: Post-mortem identification would be necessary for diagnostic confirmation. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

In this study we aimed i) to apply atlas-derived measurements of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes including hippocampal subfields to identify atrophy patterns in early-stage AD, and ii) to comp are cognitive profiles at baseline and one-year follow-up of those previously identified morphometric AD subtypes to predict disease progression. Methods or Background: From a prospectively recruited multicentre study conducted at four Austrian sites, 120 patients were included with probable AD, a disease onset beyond 60 years and a clinical deme ntia rating of 1. Morphometric measures of T1-weighted images were ob tained using FreeSurfer. Results or Findings: Principal component and subsequent cluster analysis identified four morphometric subtypes including i) hippocampal atrophy patterns that were associated with phenotypes differing predominately in presentation and progression of verbal memory and v isuospatial impairments. Conclusion: These morphologically distinct subtypes are based o n standardised brain regions, which are anatomically defined and freely accessible to validate its diagnostic accuracy and enhance the prediction of disease progression. Limitations: The inclusion of data from different MRI sites intr oduces potential confounds due to different magnetic field strengths and scanner specific parameter setups.

Melazzini*, L. M. Farina, G. Perini, E. Ballante, Bastianello; IT Purpose: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a group of signs and symptoms frequently occurring in patients with dementia. Given the poor evidence available on the neuroimagi ng correlates of BPSD in the literature, the aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between brain cortical and subcortical volumes and BPSD in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and several types of dementia. Methods or Background: Eighty-five cognitively impaired patients were prospectively recruited at our Institute of Neurology between June 2018 and February 2021. Patients underwent a thorough neurol ogical assessment, a 3D T1-weighted 3-T brain MRI scan, a neuropsychological evaluation using the Neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and a lumbar punct ure. Mean cortical thickness and brain subcortical volumes were automatically extracted using FreeSurfer v.7.1.0. Results or Findings: Delusion, hallucination and apathy appeared to be inversely correlated with cortical thickness and volumes in frontal and limbic system areas (p<0.05) in all types of dementia. With regard to dementia sub- types, Lewy-body dementia (LBD) patients showed hig her hallucination scores compared to MCI and Alzheimer's disease patients (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively). Psychosis cluster also displayed hig her NPI scores in LBD with respect to MCI patients (p<0.05). A negative signif icant association among NPI total score and t-tau level (p-value<0.01) was found in a \u00df-regression model after correction for clinical confounding variables . Conclusion: Our study showed that changes in brain volumes in s everal brain areas are associated with varying BPSD, with specif ic associations according to the type of cognitive impairment. Many of the in volved areas are part of the fronto-limbic and para-limbic circuits, thus confir ming the importance of these networks in the processes underlying the behavioural correlates of dementia.

A European task force is defining a diagnostic algorithm where incomplete evidence on biomarker pr ioritisation is filled by expert opinion. This abstract reports the prelimina ry results as of October 2021. Methods or Background: The project started in November 2020. A Delphi panel method was used to create consensus. Eleven p ertinent European scientific societies delegated two panellists each to take part at the Delphi rounds and votes. Four rounds have been completed s o far. Results or Findings: Panellists agreed on the clinical workspace of the algorithm (specialist outpatient service), the stage of application (prodromal and mild dementia), the patient age window (biomark er use strongly encouraged below 70 years and of limited usefulness over age 85), and 11 clinical profiles driving the choice of first-line biomarkers. FDG PET was first line for the clinical profiles leading to suspect f rontotemporal lobar degeneration and motor tauopathies; dopamine SPECT/ PET for those leading to suspect Lewy body spectrum; and CSF biomarkers f or those leading to suspect Alzheimer's disease and in cases with inconsistent neuropsychological and MRI findings. None of these biomarkers is indic ated when clinical profiles suggest vascular cognitive impairment or other neur ological disorders. Conclusion: The task force is currently defining second-line bi omarkers. The project it set to deliver the final algorithm by Oc tober 2022. Limitations: The limitations are linked to the Delphi procedure (e.g. kick-off questions may be driven by the moderator, a subtle phrasing of the questions may drive answers, and 70% threshold for convergenc e is conventional).

The present study quantifies the agreement across different software applications. Methods or Background: Ten individuals with hippocampal volume z-scores <-1.96 as measured by FreeSurfer (FS) based on an i n-house gender and age- adjusted healthy control group, and 10 age-matched healthy controls were chosen, median age: 74 years 66-77). Hippocampal (STEPS), and a commerciall y available software application. MTA scores were manually rated. Volume tric measures of each individual were compared against the mean of all ap plications with intraclass- correlation-coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman-statistics. Results or Findings: Comparing against the mean of all methods, moderate to low agreement was present considering categorisation of hippocampal volumes into quartiles. ICCs ranged noticeably t o 0.86 [FS]). Mean differences between individual methods and the mean of all methods (mm3) was considerable (LH: FS -209, SPM-Neuromorphometri cs 2188). Conclusion: Considerable variability in volumetric measurements between different applications was revealed, even in a coho rt with large spread in data (normal aging vs severe atrophy) and absence of str uctural lesions. Interchangeable use of different volumetric applications is not recommended. Limitations: This pilot study included a limited case number and RRMS cases with minor atrophy. However, the goal was to invest igate the agreement of planimetric and volumetric measures in early diseas e stages. Therefore, high agreement in a small cohort is reassuring.

Statsenko\u00b9, T. Habuza\u00b9, into brain morphometry and psychophysiological performance across the lifespan. Methods or Background: Background: Because of non-specific brain structural and functional changes both in physiological brain ageing and brain disorders, the MRI diagnostics of the latter can be challenging. Establishing a comprehensive definition of normal brain ageing wil l enhance diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We used the publicly available P OBA dataset of 231 subjects (4-84 yo). The exclusion criteria were: or ganic brain pathology, mental disorders, injury to the head, the MRI signs of neu rodegeneration. By using voxel-based morphometry and lesion segmentation alo ng with linear statistics and machine learning, we analysed structural changes of the major brain compartments and modeled dynamics of neurofunctional performance across life. We correlated volumetric changes of major brain compartments with dynamics of psychophysiological performance in age groups. Results or Findings: The percentage of the CSF (CSF%) increases placidly throughout life and its accumulation reflects the atrophy of brain parenchyma. The percentage of the cortical gray matter (cGM%) t o total intracranial volume reduces with advancing age. However, the percentage of the total WM (WM%) rises across the lifespan. Decision-making time is associated positively with the CSF volume (for CSF% r=0.16). There is no associati on between the percentage of WM lesions (WMH%) and psychophysiological performance as well as no correlation is seen between WMH% and age. Conclusion: The strongest correlation between brain structural data and functional outcomes is observed between total CSF% and reaction time in the IRT test which is most cognitively demanding in our battery (r=0.36). As the variables CSF% and age have the highest coefficient of correlation in this study (r=0.8), CSF% can be considered as the most s ensitive marker of age- related brain atrophy.

Methods or Background: In this prospective board-approved study with informed consent, participants with coronary artery disease underwent retrospective ECG-gated CCTA on both systems, following injection of 65-75 mL of 400 mg/mL iodinated contrast agent at 5 mL/s. A prior task-based quality assessment of coronary lesions' detectability index was performed in a phantom study. 1024 matrix and 0.25 mm slice thickness were used for PCCT while 512 matrix, 0.67 mm slice thickness for EID-D LCT. Three cardiac radiologists independently performed a blinded anal ysis using a 5-point quality score (1: insufficient; 5: excellent) for overall q uality, diagnostic confidence and quality of calcifications, stents, and non-calcified plaques. Logistic regression model, adjusted on radiologists, was used to evaluate the proportion of improvement in scores with the best method.

Scores of overall quality and diagnostic confidence were higher with PCCT images with a median (interquartil e range) of 5 (2) and 5 (1) versus 4 (1) and 4 (3), using 255 mAs versus 349\u00b111 1 mAs for EID-DLCT images (p<0.01). Proportions of improvement with PC CT images for quality of calcification, stent and non-calcified plaque were of 100%, 92% and respectively. In phantom study, detectability indic es were 2.3-fold higher for lumen and 2.9-fold non-calcified plaques with PCCT images. Conclusion: Coronary CT angiography imaging with a PCCT system demonstrated in human an improved image quality and diagnostic confidence compared to an EID-DLCT. Limitations: Number of patients was limited. Ethics committee approval: This prospective study has been approved by the institutional review board with informed consent.

Boccalini*\u00b9, S. Si-Mohamed\u00b9, Lacombe\u00b9, Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the image qual ity (IQ) of in- vivo coronary stents between an energy-integrating detectors dual-layer CT (EID-DLCT) a clinical prototype of spectral photon counting CT (SPCCT). Methods or Background: Between January and June 2021 consecutive patients with coronary stents were prospectively enrolled to undergo a coronary CT with an EID-DLCT and a SPCCT. A retrospectively ECG-gated acquisition was performed with optimised matching p arameters and identical injection protocol on the two scanners. Images were reconstructed with slice thickness of 0.67mm, 512 matrix, XCD kernel, iDose 3 for EID-DLCT and 0.25mm slice thickness, 1024 matrix, sharp kernel and iDose 6 for SPCCT. The difference ( S-C) between ROIs drawn inside the stent and the adjacent coronary artery was calculated. Measurements of the outer and inner diameters of the stents were used to quantify bloom ing artefacts. For subjective IQ, three experienced observers graded different parameters with a 4-point scale: coronary wall before stents, stent males; BMI: 26. 2 [IQ=4.2]) with 16 stents were scanned. Five stents were not able to be evaluated due to motion artefacts on the SPCCT. Radiation dose was lower for CTDIvol=25.7mGy vs. CTDIvol=35.7mGy [I Q=13.6]; p=0.02). With SPCCT, external diameters were smaller, intern al diameters were larger and, consequently, blooming artefacts were reduced (p<0.05). The S-C was lower for SPCCT as compared to EID-DLCT-XCD (p<0.05). SPCCT received higher IQ subjective scores than EID-DLCT for all parameters (all p 0.05). Conclusion: SPCCT demonstrated improved objective and subjectiv e image quality as compared to EID-DLCT for the evaluation of coronary stents. Limitations: An identified limitation of this study was that few patients were assessed.

Decker*, F. Risch, P. Wo nicki, F. Braun, S. Bette, C. Wollny, C. Scheurig-Muenkler, T. J. Kroencke, F. Schwarz; A ugsburg/DE (Josua.Decker@uk-augsburg.de) Purpose: To identify the benefit of virtual monoenergetic im aging (VMI) reconstructions for coronary CT a novel photon-counting detector comparison with an energy- integrating detector CT (EID-CT) and to assess the impact of VMI on calcium blooming and coronary artery stenosis. Methods or Background: Twenty-five consecutive patients with clinically indicated CCTA on a PCD-CT (Naeotom alpha, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) were retrospectively identified and matched for tube voltage to a cohort scanned on an EID-CT (Somatom F lash, Siemens Healthineers) using comparable ECG-synchronisation and contrast protocols. Circular regions of interest were placed in the aor ta and 6 proximal coronary artery segments. Contrast-to-noise (CNR) and signal -to-noise ratio 13 ions (range: 40- 120keV). with calcified the de gree of stenosis and area of calcification was measured for different VMI-rec onstructions using profile plots and histograms for or Findings: VMI-reconstructions the compared to EID -CT with a maximum at 40keV. The degree of coronary artery stenosis was l owest at 100-120keV showing an increase of up to ~20% between 60 and 80 keV. Similar, calcium blooming was smallest at 100-120keV increasing betw een 60 and 80keV with a plateau between 40 and 60keV. Conclusion: VMI-reconstructions low and CNR in CCTA compared to EID-CT but might be more susceptible to blooming artifacts than VMI- reconstructions at higher keV levels. We suggest that the optimal keV level has to be selected based on the extent of coronary artery disease. Limitations: Retrospective single-centre study, small sample siz e.

(breidert.isabel@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the clinical applicability of a new prototype virtual non- contrast (VNC) reconstruction algorism based on con trast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (cCTA) to assess calcified coronary plaques by calcium scoring (CaSc). Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 80 consecutive patients suspected of coronary artery disease. All patients underwent a cardiac CT at the same dual-layer spectral detector CT system (IQ on; Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) using a standardised acquisition including unenhanced CaSc onstructions images using a novel post- processing algorism discriminating calcified plaques from contrast medi a and soft tissue in the coronary arteries. Reconstructions were made in 2.5 mm, 2.5 of 0.9 mm and 0.9 mm with the same imaging parameters as the unen hanced CaSc sequence. We compared the Agatston score and classi fications according to CAC-DRS of all VNC-reconstructions with the TNC-dat aset as the gold standard. Results or Findings: In all patients, reconstructions of the VNC-images were performed successfully. We found no significant dif ferences in the Agatston score comparing all VNC-reconstructions with the TN C-dataset (p=0.379). Correlation analysis of the datasets showed a signi ficant excellent correlation of the TNC-results with the different VNC-reconstru ctions with r=0.871-0.891. By classification according to CAC-DRS, the Kruskal -Wallis-Test revealed no significant difference in classification between al l groups (p=0.284). Evaluation of the intra-class correlation coefficient revealed a strong to almost perfect agreement between the two different readers for Agatston scoring of the coronary arteries for all reconstructions. Conclusion: The investigated novel VNC reconstructions algorism of contrast- enhanced routine cCTA allows reliable detection and evaluation of calcified coronary plaques without the requirement for an additional acquisition of an unenhanced CT scan for calcium scoring.

Methods or Background: While CACS and CCTA are well established techniques for the assessment of coronary artery di sease, they are complementary acquisitions, translating into increa sed scan time and radiation dose. Hence, accurate CACS derived from a single CC TA acquisition would be highly desirable. In this study, CACS based on VNI, VNC and TNC reconstructions were evaluated in a CACS phantom (Q RM, Moehrendorf, Germany) and in 32 prospectively recruited patients (59.4\u00b114.1 years; 59.3% male) undergoing CCTA with a first generation PCD-C T system (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens Healthineers, Germany). CACS were quantified for the three reconstructions and compared using Wilcoxon's test. Agreement was evaluated by Spearmen's correlation and Bland-Altmann analysis. Classification of CACS categories (CACS 0, 1-100, 1 01-400 and >400) were compared using Cohen's kappa. Results or Findings: Phantom studies demonstrated strong agreement between VNI and TNC (60.7\u00b190.6 vs 67.3\u00b188.3,p=0.01, r=0.98, mean bias: 6.6), 24.9). In-vi vo comparison confirmed the high correlation, but revealed a slight underes timation of CACS based on correlati on and underestimation p< 0.001, r=0.93; agreement of CACS class ification (kappa=0.93), compared to that of VNC (kappa=0.69). Conclusion: Accuracy of CACS quantification and classification based on VNI reconstruction of CCTA outperforms CACS derived from VNC. Limitations: Single-centre for in-vi vo scans.

Methods or Background: Patients received clinical non-contrast CT on a dual-source CT (FORCE) and were consented to underg o a PCCT (NAEOTOM Alpha, both Siemens Healthineers) with sim ilar acquisition parameters (120 kVp, 3 mm slice thickness, filtered back projection) on the same day. Calcium scoring was calculated and radiat ion dose measurements (CTDIvol and DLP) were documented. Contrast to nois e ratio (CNR) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) were calculated. Agatston scor es, clinical risk category and radiation dose measures were compared using pai red t-tests. Results or Findings: Six male patients were included (age: 68.5 \u00b1 6 year s, BMI of 25.7 \u00b1 3.7 kg/m2). The average Agatston scor e was similar for standard and PCCT: the (1 patient=no risk, 2=mild risk, 1=moderate risk, 2 =severe risk for sex and age). CNR (clinica l CT: 8.1 vs PCCT: 7.8) and SNR (clinical: 2.5 vs PCCT 2.9) were not statistica lly significantly different. All PCCT scans had lower radiation doses than the clini cal scans (CTDIvol clinical: 3.6 decrease of (P=0.039) and a 34% decrease in DLP (P=0.037). Conclusion: This pilot investigation suggests that PCCT affords similar calcium scoring and cardiovascular risk stratificat ion compared to standard CT at a significantly lower radiation dose.

Methods or Background: A dynamic anthropomorphic phantom was scanned using routine clinical CAC protocols on conventional CT and PCCT. Three calcification (equal size [196.3 mm3], but differen t densities) were translated in a horizontal plane at heart rates of 0 and 60-75 bpm. In addition to the clinical protocol standard of 70 keV, PCCT images were reconstructed at monoE Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 233 levels of 72, 74 and 76 keV. CAC was quantified usi ng Agatston and volume scores. PCCT Agatston scores were compared to the C T scores and deviations (95% confidence interval) <10% were deem ed to be not clinically relevant. Volume scores were compared with the phys ical volume. Results or Findings: At 70 keV, static PCCT Agatston scores resulted in clinically relevant deviations for all CAC densities. Increased monoE levels resulted in reduced CAC scores. Low density CAC Agatston scores showed high variability at both increased monoE levels and increased heart rate. For medium density CAC deviations were not relevant at 74 and 72 keV, for 0 and 60-75 bpm, respectively. For static high density CA C, deviations were not relevant at 76 keV, while at 60-75 bpm deviations w ere not relevant at 72-76 keV. For static CAC, the smallest average deviation from physical volume was -37% at 70 keV, 0% at 74 keV, and 65% at 76 keV for low, medium, and high density, respectively. Deviations from physical vol ume increased with increased heart rate. Conclusion: At 70 keV clinically relevant differences were found between CT and PCCT. At 72 keV, relevant differences were abse nt for dynamic medium and high density CAC. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Patients with histopathologically analysed solid renal masses were retrospectively enrolled from two tertiary referral centres in Germany if imaged with CT in arterial and portalven ous contrast media (CM) phase. All renal masses were manually segmented and a total of n=129 radiomics features were calculated on each CM phase. Machine learning models with class-imbalance handling, feature selec tion and cross-validation (CV) techniques were used to predict histological s ubtypes of renal masses. Diagnostic performance was quantified with multiclass area-under-the ROC curve (AUC) for renal mass subtype prediction. Model training was performed on data from one centre. An independent dataset from the other centre was used from model validation. Results or Findings: The training dataset comprised n=173 subtype, the machine learning algorithms reached a multiclass AUC=0.77 in the out-of-bag CV samples of the training dataset. The identification of AML vs. other subtypes showed hig her diagnostic accuracy (AUC=0.84) compared to oncocytoma vs. other subtypes (AUC=0.74). In the independent validation dataset, machine learning algorithm demonstrated a multiclass AUC=0.74. Conclusion: Radiomics and machine learning demonstrate good dia gnostic performance for assessment of renal masses in CT st udies, and robustly perform on independent multicentre data. Limitations: Study limitations include a low number of benign re nal masses and a heterogeneous study cohort.

R. Mostafa, A. u Mansoura/EG the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) ultrasound as a non-invasive tool in classification of lupus nephritis (LN) using histopathologic findings as a gold standard. Methods or Background: Thirty-five systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with renal affection were subjected to SWE ultrasound as well as twenty healthy subjects as a control group. Results or Findings: There was a significant difference in SWE values between the case and the control groups; the mean i n the case group was 37.66 \u00b1 11.692 kpa while the mean in specificity 100%). There was a slight increase in S WE values in classes III and IV compared to other classes, but not statistically significant. Also, there was no correlation between SWE values and the histopathological grade of lupus nephritis (LN). Conclusion: SWE can be used as a reliable non-invasive tool in LN. Increased SWE values at follow-up of LN patients may indicate disease progression and this can provoke an early biopsy before deteriorati on of the renal function in SLE patients. Limitations: The limitations included; the small number in each group, SWE was not widely evaluated in all LN classes and also the follow-up of the renal changes before and after treatment wasn't carried o ut. We recommend a follow-up protocol for the patients for better asse ssment of the role of SWE as a non-invasive parameter for following up on LN pro gress.

Methods or Background: Patients who underwent contrast-enhanced KVS- DECT for an indication other than assessment of uri nary tract disease and had incidental renal lesion with a size of 1-4 cm were included. DE mode was performed during portovenous phase. The slope betwe en virtual monochromatic images (VMI) dataset at different energy-pair and SA curve for pattern assessment (upward, mildly upward and flat) of each renal lesion was created. Final diagnosis was determined by pathology or imaging criteria. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated in cross-vali dated Mann-Whitney U Test. Results or Findings: 78 (24 enhancing and 54 non-enhancing) renal lesions were included. All the quantitative and qualitative SA parameters significantly differentiated enhancing from non-enhancing lesions (p= <0.001).

P. Overhoff*\u00b9, K. Spornitz\u00b9, R. Stoll\u00b9, A. Hess e\u00b2, DE, \u00b2Bonn/DE Purpose: CT imaging is used for treatment planning or follow -up in cases of urolithiasis. Foreign bodies can worsen the diagnos tic quality of the imaging due to artefacts. The aim of this study was to syst ematically investigate the influence of ureteral splints on urinary stone dual -energy CT(DECT) imaging. Methods or Background: N=45 mixed urinary stones were examined ex-vivo SOMATOM Force, S iemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Ureteral splints were inserted into the phantom and scanned (DECT-DJ) with the urinary ston es adjected and then examined without the foreign body (DECT-NAT). As st andard of reference the urinary stone composition was determined by IR spec troscopy and manually measured by water displacement method and caliper. The DECT measurements were each compared with the standard of reference and the Pearson's correlation coefficient or sensitivity/specificity calculated. Results or Findings: All urinary stones could be detected with DECT images. Comparing the maximum urinary stone diameter the st andard of reference showed a median of 6.1mm (range 3.1-11.0mm), in the DECT-DJ 5.7mm (range 1.5-10.3mm; Pearson 0.61,p<0.001). For volum etry, the of reference yielded 80mm3 (range 10-345mm3) in median, 61mm3 (range 4- 363mm3; in DECT-NAT. Urinary stone composition revealed uric acid in 8 stones and 37 non-uric acid stones in the standard of reference. In DECT-DJ one uric acid stone was not detected (Sens 87.5%,Spec 100%), in DECT-NAT all stones were correctly distinguished(Sens/Spec each 100%). Conclusion: DE-CT can reliably measure maximum urinary stone le ngth and volume in comparison to the standard of reference even with adjected urethral splint. Our results suggest that stone composition may be more difficult to determine with the ureteral splint in place. Limitations: The limitation is that the study is ex-vivo.

H. Niehoff*, A. Carmichael, M. M. Woeltjen, J. Boriesosdick, I. Lopez Schmidt, A. Michael, H. Piechota, J. Borgg refe, J. R. Kroeger; Minden/DE Purpose: Purpose of the present study was the evaluation of the image quality and the radiation dose parameters of the novel phot on-counting CT (PCCT, Naeotom Alpha, Siemens Healthineers) using a low dose scan protocol for the detection of urolithiasis. Standard CT scans were used as reference (S40, Somatom Sensation 40, Siemens Healthineers). Methods or Background: In total, 63 patients were retrospectively enrolled in this study (PCCT n=31, S40 n=32). Radiation dose parameters, as well as quantitative and qualitative image parameters, were evaluated. Presence of urolithiasis, diagnostic certainty and perceived im age quality were rated on a 5- point Likert scale by 3 blinded readers. Results or Findings: The PCCT utilised significantly less radiation dose compared mSv vs. 3.4\u00b11.0 mSv; p <0.001). The SNR was significantly better on images acquired with the PC CT (13.3\u00b13.3 vs. 8.2\u00b11.9; p<0.001). Likewise, the perceived image quality off ered by the PCCT was rated significantly better (4.3\u00b10.7 vs. 2.8\u00b10.6; p< 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy for was excellent (PCCT 97.8%, S40 99%). Conclusion: In high contrast imaging, the PCCT allows a signifi cant reduction of radiation dose compared to a standard CT, while maintaining excellent image quality. Further adjustments of the scan prot ocol towards ultra-low-dose CT scans appear feasible. Limitations: The size of the calculi as well as the influence of the image quality on the measurement of the calculi was not a ddressed. The scan parameters of both scanners differed slightly.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether CT radiomic analysis derived from hepatic metastasis can predict immunohistochemistry molecular classification of breast cancer. Methods or Background: 106 patients who underwent abdomen CT with initial or newly diagnosed hepatic metastasis from breast cancer and had immunohistochemistry result within 3 months interval were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned a training set (n=71) and internal validation set (n=35). Each hepatic mass was manually segmented by volume of interest using prototype RADIOMICS (Siemens Healthineers) an d radiomic features were extracted by same software. Best subset of significant features were selected by multivariate analysis. Radiomic classif ication models for each subtype were built using random forest classifier. Results or Findings: Total 1226 radiomic features were extracted from each training object. Performance of training vs. validation yielded AUROC values of 0.71 vs. 0.75, and 0.62 vs. 0.67 in the tasks of di stinguishing between luminal vs. non-luminal, and HER2+ vs. non-HER2+, respectiv ely. Due to small TN population size limitation, performance of discrimi nating TN type in validation was poor (AUC 0.35). Conclusion: Radiomic features extracted from hepatic metastasis are potential predictive tool for molecular subtypes- l uminal vs. non-luminal and HER2+ vs. non-HER2+ in breast cancer. Limitations: The limitation is that the study has an internal validation only. We plan to perform the external validation.

Vats*, (neha.vats@med.uni-heidelberg.de) evaluation and timing optimisation of C T perfusion first pass analysis (FPA) in comparison to maximum slope model (MSM) in pancreatic carcinoma. Methods or Background: 34 dynamic CT perfusion acquisitions were performed at 80kVp in 17 patients with pancreatic c arcinoma. Perfusion maps of blood flow (BF (ml/100ml/min)) were calculated i n regions of interest in both healthy tissue and carcinoma for all patients with both FPA and MSM. FPA requires only two volume scans at baseline and peak of arterial input function (AIF). The first volume scan was retrospectively se lected when AIF CT- numbers exceeded 120 HU. The second volume scan representing the temporal center of the contrast bolus was selected with a delay of half of the injection time plus a dispersion delay, which was i ncremented from 0 to 6s in 1.5s steps. FPA-BF values were compared with MSM-BF values using Pearson's correlation and difference between healthy tissue and carcinoma was evaluated using Student's t-test. Coefficient of variation (COV) was calculated to measure sensitivity of FPA-BF values to acquisition timing. Results or Findings: were healthy respectively. highest agreement for 4.5s dispersion delay. Differences between heal thy tissue and carcinoma were significant (p<0.05) for all 5 time-points. CO V between FPA-BF values were 10.25% for carcinoma and 8.79% for healthy tis sue, respectively. Conclusion: FPA has the potential to differentiate pancreatic c arcinoma from healthy tissue with good correlation to MSM. FPA could allow a decrease in radiation dose required in CT perfusion for diagnos ing pancreatic diseases. Limitations: Prospective validation is still necessary.

Nacci*, Zerunian, M. Polici, Rome/IT is among the most impor tant prognostic factors for patients with colon cancer ( CC). However, CT morphological analysis is not a reliable method to assess nodal status. Thus, we compared morphological and radiomic features ext racted from contrast- enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images, in assessing regional LNs in histopathologically confirmed patients with stage I to stage IIC CC. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 100 patients with CC who underwent preoperative portal-venous phase C T examination and diagnosed as pN0 after surgery. Patients with motio n artifacts or lack of pathology report were excluded. Regional LNs were s cored with a qualitative Likert-scale based on morphological imaging (Node-s core with range 0-7) and divided into two groups: low likelihood (0-2 points ) and high likelihood (3-7 points) of malignancy. Then, 107 radiomic features were extracted from CECT for each LN. T-test and Mann-Whitney were performed to compare radiomic features between the two groups. Correction for mul tiple comparisons was performed with Holm-Bonferroni method. P<0.05 was c onsidered significant. Results or Findings: A total of 337 negative LNs were analysed and divided into 167 with low likelihood and 170 with high likelihood of malignancy based on the node-score. Radiomic analysis showed 92 feat ures (3/13 shape, 14/19 first order and 75/75 second order features) with no significant difference between the two groups, according to histopathology (all P>0.05). On the other hand, 15 features (10/13 shape and 5/19 first order features) were significantly different (all P<0.04). Conclusion: Our preliminary experience showed that status better than CECT morphol ogical evaluation and could be used as a non-invasive preoperative tool i n patients with CC. Limitations: Retrospective nature of the study. Small population sample.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of som atostatin receptor (SSR)- PET/CT to liver MRI as reference standard in the ev aluation of hepatic involvement in neuroendocrine tumours. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, an institutional datab ase was screened for \"SSR\" imaging studies between 2006 and 2021. 1000 NET Patients (grade 1/2) with 2383 SSR-PET/CT studies a nd matching liver MRI in an interval of \u00b1 3 months were identified). Medical reports of SSR-PET/CT and MRI were retrospectively evaluated regarding hepati c involvement and either confirmed by both or observed in MRI but not in SSR -PET/CT (false-negative) or in SSR-PET but not in MRI (false-positive). Results or Findings: Hepatic involvement was reported in 1650 (69%) of t he total 2383 SSR-PET/CT studies, whereas MRI detected hepatic involvement in 1685 (71%) cases. There were 51 (2%) false-negative and 16 (1%) false- positive hepatic involvement. The most frequent reason for f alse-negative results was the small size of lesions (<1.2 cm). Conclusion: This study confirms the high diagnostic accuracy of SSR-PET/CT in the detection of hepatic involvement in NET pati ents with a high sensitivity and specificity using liver MRI imaging as referenc e standard. However, one should be aware of possible pitfalls. Thus, SSR-PET /CT can reduce unnecessary biopsies and optimise clinical patient management. Limitations: This was a retrospectively conducted study and hist opathological confirmation was not given in all patients.

B. Orel*, A. Rykhalsk yi, T. Golovko; Kyiv/UA Purpose: tomogra characterisation of the tumour and the peritumoural tissue in patients with rectal cancer. Methods or Background: Tumour and peritumoural tissues were compared using texture parameters (heterogeneity, entropy, energy, skewness, kurtosis, standard deviation, average brightness) on PET/CT i mages obtained from 22 patients with T3aN1M1 rectal cancer (mean age 61 \u00b1 2 years). PET/CT scans were carried out on a Biograph 64 TruePoint scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). Texture parameters were extracted using MATLAB R2016a (MathWorks, Inc) software. Correlation analysis des cribed the relationship between heterogeneity, tumour size and extramural v enous invasion (EMVI) scores. Statistical analyses were performed with St atistica 12.5 (StatSoft, Inc). Results or Findings: Texture analysis of FDG PET/CT images revealed a 23% difference in the heterogeneity parameter betwe en the tumour and the peritumoural tissue (P < 0.05). Heterogeneity in th e peritumoural tissue showed significant (P < 0.05) correlation with EMVI score (r = 0.64) and tumour size (r = 0.48). Men and women had significantly different correlation coefficients (P < 0.05) due to the anatomical posit ion of the rectum, vascular architecture and tumour metabolism. Conclusion: The heterogeneity parameter provided additional quantitative information for the nonlinear characterisation of differences between the rectal tumour and the peritumoural tissue. Quantification of the heterogeneity phenomenon in malignant tumours and peritumoural ti ssues could be used as a factor involved in metastasising for patient prog nosis and reduce the variability for EMVI assessment. Limitations: Further studies focused on the application of image heterogeneity parameters should use deep learning techniques such as neural networks.

Full-thickness tears may cause medial retraction of the supraspinatus tendon leading to underestimation of muscle volumes derived from the OR. The purpose was to investigate the eff ect of medial retraction in full-thickness SSP tears on the OR. Methods or Background: SSP volumetry was performed using the software mint LesionTM. To verify its accuracy, ten muscle s pecimens were volumetrised ex-vivo using the physical water displ acement method in comparison to the software. The patient cohort incl uded 149 individuals (mean age 55.0 \u00b1 16.0 years, 66 females) with intact SSP tendons, partial and full- thickness tears who obtained MRI scans. OR values w ere determined by three radiologists independently. An alpha .05 was set as the limit of statistical significance. Results or Findings: Excellent correlation for the variables volumetry using mint LesionTM and physical volumetry was demonstrat ed, allowing software- based volumetry to serve as the standard of reference. Interreader reliability was between .89 and .92 for OR estimations. Muscle volumes in patients with intact SSP tendons were significantly higher than i n partial or full-thickness tears with all degrees of tendon retraction (p<.001). Correlation between OR values and muscle volumes was best for intact tendons (.84) and significantly decreased for full-thickness tears with all degrees of tendon retraction (.56- .70). Conclusion: The OR method is appropriate to estimate muscle atr ophy in patients without SSP tendon retraction, tendon retraction it is not reliable. Limitations: Retrospective study design.

Herrmann*, S. Gassenmaier, H. Almansour, A. Oth man, S. Afat; T\u00fcbingen/DE (judith.herrmann@med.uni-tuebingen.de) Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of an accelerated image protocol using turbo spin echo (T SE) imaging with deep learning (DL) reconstruction of the shoulder. Methods or Background: Thirty patients who underwent shoulder MRI at 1.5 and 3 T including standard TSE (TSE_S) and TSE with DL reconstruction (TSE_DL) were prospectively enrolled in this instit utional review board- approved study after obtaining written informed consent between October 2020 and June 2021. Two radiologists independently asses sed image quality and visualisation of anatomical structures using a Likert scale ranging from 1-5 (5 best) as well as the diagnostic performance concerning pathologic shoulder lesions. Results or Findings: Overall image quality was evaluated to be superior in TSE_DL versus TSE_S, with less noise and improved s harpness in TSE_DL versus TSE_S. No difference was found concerning qu alitative diagnostic confidence and quantitative diagnostic performance for pathologic shoulder lesions when comparing the two sequences. The acqui sition time of TSE using DL was reduced (1:10 min vs 2.53 min). Conclusion: TSE_DL of the shoulder is feasible, without limitations concerning the diagnostic performance and allows a reduction o f scan time of more than 50% compared to TSE_S. Limitations: Single centre study. Small number of included patie nts. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the local ethics committee.

We aimed to investigate whether XR, when optimised according to current criteria, is reliable for measuring CSA in comparison to MRI featuring ze ro echo-time imaging (ZTE) that accentuates cortical bone-to-surrounding-soft-tissue contrast with high fidelity. Methods or Background: Patients (age range 25-49 years) with shoulder pain and/or frozen shoulder were prospectively and consecutively enrolled. All underwent XR and shoulder MRI at 3T, which included isotropic 3D ZTE sequence. Acceptability of XRs was established by r atio of transverse-to- longitudinal diameter of lateral glenoid outline (R TL). Unacceptable XRs (RTL 0.25) were repeated. Two observers independently measured CSA on both XR and coronal oblique reformatted ZTE images, the latter including verification of measurement points by cross-referen cing on images from other planes. Results or Findings: Study comprised 65 patients (35 females, 30 males; mean age 40.2 years). Appropriateness of radiographs according to RTL (range, 0-0.20; mean, 0.09) was attained after a mean number of 1.6 exposures (range, 1/4). Interobserver agreement was excellent for radiography (ICC=0.91; 95% XR and ZTE MRI (P=.005). Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference between CSA measurements on ZTE and Grashey views (P=.08). Conclusion: ZTE MRI with anatomical point cr oss- referencing is significantly different than on XR ( even with optimal positioning performed according to latest research), which might necessitate more than one exposures. An RTL <0.1 ensures reliability of X Rs, when other standards of sufficient X-ray exposure are met. Limitations: Small sample size.

Regnard*\u00b9, Lanseur\u00b2, To appraise the performances of an AI trained to detect and localise skeletal lesions and compare them to the routine radiological interpretation. Methods or Background: We retrospectively collected all radiographic examinations with the associated radiologists' repo rts performed after a traumatic injury during 3 consecutive months (Janua ry to March 2017) in a private imaging group of 14 centres. Each examinati on was analysed by an AI (BoneView, Gleamer) and its results were compared t o those of the radiologists' reports. In case of discrepancy, the examination was reviewed by a senior skeletal radiologist to settle on the pres ence of fractures, dislocations, elbow effusions, and focal bone lesions (FBL). Lesi on-wise sensitivity, specificity, and NPV of the AI and of the radiologi sts' report were calculated for each lesion type. Results or Findings: A total of 4774 exams were included in the study. Lesion-wise sensitivity was 73.7% for the radiologi sts' reports vs. 98.1% for the AI (+24.4 points) for fracture detection, 63.3% vs. 89.9% (+26.6 points) for dislocation detection, 84.7% vs. (+6.8 for elbow 16.1% vs. 98.1% (+82 points) for FBL detection. The specificity of the radiologists' reports was always 100% whereas AI specificity was 88%, 99.1%, 99.8%, 95.6% for fractures, dislocations, el bow effusions, and FBL respectively. The NPV was measured at 99.5% for fra ctures, 99.8% for dislocations, and 99.9% for elbow effusions and FBL. Conclusion: AI has the potential to prevent diagnosis errors by detecting lesions that were initially missed in the radiologi sts' reports. Limitations: Performance of the AI was calculated stand-alone. T he concordant examinations between the AI and the radi ologists' reports were not reviewed by the Ground Truth.

Funding for this study: Gleamer funded branch of the ulnar nerve: high resolution ultrasound beyond the Guyon \u00b2Barcel ona/ES Purpose: The aim of the present study was to illustrate high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) findings in patients with ulnar n erve motor branch (UNMB) entrapment beyond the Guyon tunnel. Methods or Background: Firstly, n=3 cadaveric hands were dissected to demonstrate the anatomic course of the UNMB distal to the pisiform. Then, the nerve was examined in a group of n=10 healthy subjects by means of linear 17-5MHz and 18-5MHz transducers at the level of the hamate hook, the pisohamate ligament and within the palm. Finally, a series of n=11 consecutive patients with motor symptoms in the territory of in nervation of the UNMB was evaluated with HRUS. These patients had neurophysiologic, 1.5T/3T MRI and surgical correlations. Results or Findings: HRUS was reliable in depicting the UNMB from its or igin to the midpalm in volunteers. In patients, it provi ded essential preoperative information on the injury level. In n=6 patients the UNMB was squeezed against the outside slope of the hamate hook by gan glion cysts. In n=4 patients the UNMB was entrapped at a more distal level in th e palm by fibrous bands (n=1) ganglion cysts (n=3). N=1 patient had mul tiple neurofibromas affecting the nerve and its divisional branches. In cases of distal entrapment at the level of the midpalm, there was vation of the III/IV dorsal interosseous muscles. Conclusion: HRUS may provide accurate information about the lev el and the nature of UNMB neuropathy, helping the diagnostic w orkup and surgical decisions. In patients with suspected zone 2 syndrome, HRUS should include UNMB assessment at the level of the hamate hook and in the midpalm. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

T. Nevalainen*\u00b9, tendon and related subtendinous bone oedema (BMO) as di agnostic markers for peripheral TFC tears. Methods or Background: 133 patients (age range 21-75; 68 females) with wrist MRI and arthroscopy were included in retrospective case-control study. The presence of TFC tears (no tear, central perforation, or peripheral tear), ECU pathology (tenosynovitis, tendinosis, tears and subluxation) and BMO at ulnar styloid process were determined on MRI and co rrelated with arthroscopy as gold standard. 1.5 T MRI scanners were used, and images interpreted by two experienced fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists. Cross tabulation with chi square test, binary logistic regression and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative pr edictive value and accuracy were used to describe diagnostic efficacy. Results or Findings: On arthroscopy, 46 cases with no tear, 34 cases wit h central perforation and 53 cases with peripheral TF C tear were identified. Using arthroscopy as the gold standard, BMO was seen in 21.7% (10/46) with no tears, in (8/34) with and in 88.7% (47/53) with peripheral TFC tears (p<0.001); the respective numbers (9/46), (4/34), and 84.9% on MRI provided 90.6% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity for detecting peripheral TFC tears. Out of the 53 arthr oscopically proven peripheral TFC tears, 52 had either BMO or ECU pathology (or both), yielding a sensitivity of 98.1%. Furthermore, on MRI 41 case s had both BMO and ECU pathology; 40 of these had peripheral TFCC tear in arthroscopy yielding a specificity of 98.8%. Conclusion: ECU pathology and related BMO are highly associated with peripheral TFC tears, and can be used as secondary signs to confirm the presence of clinically significant TFC tear.

However, in a not negligible subset of patients undergoing surgery, t he carpal tunnel syndrome may persist or recur and in some of them disabling symptoms, not related to median nerve compression, may manifest. We propose an essay of common and uncommon high frequency ultrasound (HFUS) findi ngs in patients with postoperative neuropathic symptoms in hand and wris t. Methods or Background: High resolution ultrasound has gained increasing interest as complementary diagnostic test for carpal tunnel median nerve compression neuropathy. However, in the literature there is no comprehensive report of the sonographic findings of carpal tunnel release complications, despite the valuable information the HFUS can provi de. We enrolled n=25 consecutive patients complaining of relapsing carpal tunnel syndrome, pain in the volar aspect of the hand and thenar eminence weakness at 3 months following carpal tunnel surgery. The wrist of each patient was scanned using linear array 24-5 MHz matrix probe. The median nerv e cross sectional area was obtained at the point of maximum enlargement, t he release of flexor retinaculum was verified and the palmar cutaneous branch and motor recurrent branch of median nerve were systematically evaluate d. Results or Findings: We found n=10 incomplete section of flexor retinaculum, n=2 persistent compression of median nerve, n=3 dam age of palmar cutaneous branch amputation neuroma. In n=4 patients no pathological findings were disclose d. Conclusion: HFUS is accurate in the diagnosis of postprocedural complications of carpal tunnel release and can prov ide additional information compared to electrophysiology.

Klein*\u00b9, C. Liu\u00b2, J. Steidel\u00b9, dose reduction of a pa tient radiation risk-minimising tube current modulation (riskTCM) and to compare it with today's standard of the total mAs-value (mAsTCM). Methods or Background: State-of-the-art TCM methods in CT aim at reducing dose by minimising the total mAs-product a t constant image quality. This minimises the mAs-value but not necessarily th e radiation risk since mAsTCM does not account for varying dose sensitivit ies of different organs. We propose riskTCM, an algorithm minimising a patient-specific risk measure, for example the effective dose Deff, at constant im age quality. It computes the organ dose distributions in real-time using the deep dose estimation (DDE), a convolutional neural network trained on Monte-Carlo simulations, and thereby sets the tube current such that the risk measure is minimised. A total of 20 patient acquisitions are retrospectively evaluated using simulated riskTCM at 70, 100, 120, and 150 kV. The potential Deff reduct ion is evaluated as figure of merit and compared to mAsTCM in the abdomen and hea d with arms over it. Results or Findings: For the abdomen, Deff with riskTCM is lower than mAsTCM by 33%, 29%, 29% and 28% for 70 kV, 100 kV, 120 kV, and 150 kV on average. For the head, Deff is lower by about 16%, 14%, 13%, and 13%, respectively. Conclusion: In excentric body regions mAsTCM does a good job in reducing the patient dose besides the mAs-value. In regions with less attenuation differences, for example the abdomen, riskTCM offer s enormous benefit over mAsTCM. The proposed riskTCM method can be easily a dapted to risk measures other than Deff. Limitations: The proposed method has only been applied retrospec tively on measured, forward-projected, noise-injected patient data since riskTCM is not implemented on commercial CT systems yet.

Pace*\u00b9, C. J. Caruana\u00b9, recommendation that water equivalent di ameter (WED) is evaluated at every CT slice is too time in tensive for manual contouring, prohibiting real-time analysis. Thus an automated approach is desired. Existing studies proposing automated delineation do not explain either the image processing pipeline, or how complex patient anatomy would be handled. This work sought to develop and test an au tomated open-source tool to contour patient areas across the abdominal region that correctly excludes the patient couch for a variety of CT systems. Methods or Background: The tool performs a sequence of Python based morphological operations using multiple CPUs and was tested on abdominal datasets that together covered 17 CT systems. Resul ts were reviewed by three medical physicists. Computational time was investigated for the feasibility of real-time applications. Results or Findings: The tool provided very accurate contours over all systems including complex clinical scenarios and va riety of patient habitus. Imperfect contours occurred in very few isolated sl ices. On six cores the tool contoured a 300 slice study in 8 seconds. Conclusion: A fast, robust, automated tool for determination of patient abdominal outline is presented. The tool is suffici ently fast to achieve the AAPM220 goal in real-time. The use of morphological operators permits easy possibility to tune performance to other CT systems . Limitations: The tool does not omit slices where there is a truncation artefact and does not consider patient anatomy effects in th e z-direction.

Komljenovic*, C. Engert, M. Uder, T. B\u00e4uerle; E rlangen/DE Purpose: The aim of the present study is to test the effects of lipid-lowering drug simvastatin and oral hypoglycemic agent metfor min in lymphocytes in vitro exposed to the diagnostic-range radiation. The amount of radiation- induced gamma-H2AX-positive foci in cell nuclei is a reliable parameter of the rate of the most important DNA lesions induced by t he ionising radiation, the double-strand breaks (DSBs). These findings may elu cidate the radiation profile of imaging modalities relying on ionising r adiation by employing commonly used therapeutic agents with well-studied pharmacokinetics. Methods or Background: Human peripheral blood lymphocytes treated in vitro with simvastatin and metformin as a monotherapy and in combination were subjected to ionising radiation of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mGy. Resulting DSBs were analysed 15 minutes after the onset of radiati on by means of indirect immunofluorescence using the phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX (gamma-H2AX) as a marker and compared to untreated irradiated cells. Results or Findings: The rate of DSBs in simvastatin-treated lymphocytes 15 minutes after the 20 mGy radiation exposure was significantly decreased compared to untreated irradiated lymphocytes (p<0.01). This effect was confirmed after the simvastatin/metformin combinati on therapy (p<0.01). Metformin monotherapy indicated the similar trend y et did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). No conclusive effects of tre atment of lymphocytes on the DSB rate after the 2.5, 5 and 10 mGy radiation exposure were observed. Conclusion: Present study revealed radioprotective effects of s imvastatin as a monotherapy and in combination with metformin in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to ionising radiation at 20 mGy. These results may increase the understanding of biological response of lymphocytes to diagnostic-range ionising radiation and improve the profile of radiation-induced chromosomal alterations in patients undergoing diagnostic X-ray-based imaging procedures.

V. Becker*; Koblenz/DE Purpose: Computed tomography is responsible for the majority of occupational radiation exposure in medical imaging. However, the possible impact on specific biological processes of a single low-dose CT examination remains elusive to some extent. For a better unders tanding of biological effects induced by medical imaging, changes of DNA integrit y, DNA methylation and gene expression profiles after exposure to single- and dual-energy CT in peripheral blood cells were examined. Methods or Background: Blood samples were irradiated ex vivo in a phantom with single- (80 and 150 kV) and dual-energy (80/Sn150kV) tube voltages. Differential gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analysed six hours after irradiation using whole tr anscriptome sequencing. DNA methylation was analysed by means of bisulfite sequencing. DNA double strand break (DSB) frequency was studied by 53BP1+ H2AX co- immunostaining. Results or Findings: Irradiated samples showed a significantly higher rate of DSBs (p < 0.001) and the shared upregulation of fiv e genes, AEN, DDB2, FDXR and No significantly differentially met hylated region specific to CT exposure was identified. Neither the analysis of gene expression, nor DSB frequency, nor methylation profiles provided any ev idence for significantly increased biological effectiveness of dual-energy C T in comparison to single- energy CT spectra. Conclusion: Despite steadily decreasing doses, CT diagnostics s eems to remain a genotoxic stressor with impact on gene regulation and DNA integrity. However, no evidence was found that this damaging effect is aggravated by low energy photons emitted by varying X-ray spectra of CT. In addition, CT exposure did not result in detectable early changes of DNA methylation. Limitations: This in vitro single-centre study focuses on an ear ly time point after low-dose irradiation in a limited study popul ation.

Author Disclosures: Benjamin Valentin Becker: Nothing to disclose RPS 1213-6 Feasibility of using size-specific dose estimate (S SDE) to estimate effective dose of individual patients is to investigate the relatio nship between size- specific dose estimate (SSDE) and a derivative form of effective dose called size-specific effective dose (SED) for individual p atients. Methods or Background: Values of SED resulting from CT scans of six regions over the trunk were estimated for 193 adult phantoms using NCICT software. The phantom library covers a wide range of adult sizes of various heights (150-190 cm) and weights (40-125 kg). The r egions studied were chest, abdomen, pelvis, chest-abdomen, abdomen-pelv is, and the trunk. A MATLAB code developed in-house was employed to calc ulate the patient size in terms of water-equivalent diameter for the same phantom set used in NCICT software. This allowed SSDE values to be calculated for the CT scans investigated. Results or Findings: Good correlations between SED and SSED values were observed for all scan regions studied, except the p elvis. The variations for the regions were all within \u00b18%, but they reached 16% f or pelvis scans due to differences in colon doses. These occurred because sections of the transverse colon lay inside the scan range for some phantoms and outside for others depending on the colon position for the individual. Conclusion: The strong correlations between SED and SSED values suggest that coefficients of the best-fit for the correlati ons could be derived, from which risk of an individual patient could be assessed bas ed on SSED of a given scan Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 240 taking into account the patient size and the gender . This may provide a simple and straightforward approach to assess SED in a man ner similar to that based on k-factors. Limitations: The study has been conducted using a phantom librar y, and may be extended to include data of patients. Ethics committee approval: No ethics approval was needed.

Purpose: a large cohort of patien ts, BMI data might be omitted, at the same time pointing out that anthropology of specific cohorts should be considered. Dose tracking systems provide statistical data usually for whole BMI adult patients distribution. The aim of study is to check the impact of BMI on mean dose and LDRL. Methods or Background: Analysis of total DLP collected by DTS for whole examination: 1st phase without contrast agent (ches t, abdomen, pelvis), 2nd phase after 35s (chest + abdomen), 3rd phase after 60s (abdomen+ pelvis). Cohort consists of 2110 patients divided by 6 relev ant groups of the BMI: 600 patients with 18.5-24.9 48p. B MI>40,0 obesity class 3 and one group of 543 for which BMI data wasn't availabl e. Results or Findings: overweight and obesities class 1-3, respectively. The 75th percentile, for unknown BMI, equal to 1302.7mGy*cm is most similar to overweight group (2.4%-3.5%) difference, while i t is almost double normal weight. Median in this group is equal to 825.9mGy*c m and is 20% lower than for overweight while 50% higher than in normal weight. Conclusion: Calculations provided by DTS, which don't take into account BMI data, are relevant for local dose management. In or der to compare LDRL between hospitals it would be beneficial to recalculate typical doses for given BMI even if large cohort of patent is available. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable due to retrospective analysis of dose data. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

In image radiotherapy (IGRT) based on cone-beam CT (CBCT) with collimations up to 400m m is often used for patient's positioning in highly accurate radiothera py treatments. The literature shows that for collimations greater than 40mm, the 100mm pencil ionisation chamber does not consider a large part of the prima ry and scattered radiation and several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem but because of the limitation of the available tools, dosimetric quality controls are rarely performed on these wide collimations. This s tudy introduces a new method and device in order to overcome these limitations and perform accurate dosimetric quality control on wide collimations and CBCT. Methods or Background: Fibermetrix\u00ae has developed a measurement method and associated device (IVIscan\u00ae: based on a scintillating fiber placed on the CT scan's couch) allowing to integrate the d ose even on wide collimations. The CTDI100, CTDIw and CTDIvol are me asured and calculated on a Siemens definition EDGE and a Canon Aquilion O NE Genesis for thinnest, largest and clinical collimations. The same measurements and calculations are done on the CBCT of a Varian TrueB eam linear accelerator. We compared the results between the ionisation cham ber of 100mm, 300mm and the IVIscan\u00ae the calculated for wide and for CBCT collimations. Results or Findings: IVIscan detector showed comparable performances to currently used methods for small and large collimat ions with differences of less than 5% compared to the reference calculation metho ds for CTDIw and CTDIvol. Conclusion: IVIscan is an easy-to-use tool and can be used rout inely for regulatory quality control including large collimat ions and radiotherapy CBCT. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: PhD scholarship funded by Fibermetrix.

It is subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and the more aggressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH ) that carries a high risk of developing fibrosis and cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability and to assess the repeatability of imaging biomarkers to detect NASH and significant or advanced fibrosis. Methods or Background: Sixty-eight subjects with biopsy proven NAFLD (53 NASH and 15 NAFL) were examined using a wide variet y of MRI techniques, including MR elastography (MRE), MR proton density fat fraction (PDFF), apparent diffusion coefficient, R1 (relaxation rate 1/T2*). Plasma biomarkers (CK18 M30, ALT, and AST) were also measured. Thirty participants underwent a second MR I within 2-4 weeks in order to assess repeatability. Results or Findings: In univariate logistic regression analysis, there w as a significant difference between the NASH and NAFL gr oups in MRE (p=0.028), CK18 M30 (p=0.016) and ALT (p=0.047), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.74, 0.76 and 0.70, respectively. In bivariate logistic regression analysis, a model com bining MRE with PDFF showed better performance in diagnosing NASH (AUROC =0.84), compared with MRE or PDFF alone 0.009, compared with univariate p=0.028 and 0.070, respectively). MRE could differentiate between F2-4 (significant and advanced fibrosis) and F0-1 ( no or mild fibrosis). A bivariate model combining MRE with AST improved the detection of F2-4. The intraclass correlation coefficient for repeatabilit y was 0.94 and 0.99 for MRE and PDFF, respectively. Conclusion: MRE can potentially detect NASH and differentiate between fibrosis stages. Combining MRE with PDFF improves detection of NASH. Limitations: One identified limitation of this study was partici pant numbers.

Tumour response of treated NELM was evaluated according to the RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria by two readers. Using a dedicated software, LETB was measured as the viable tumour tissue having more than two standard deviations of the regions of interest placed in the nontumoral liver parenchyma. Overall survival (OS), time to unTACEable progression, hepatic and whole-body progression-fre e survival (PFS) were evaluated by using the multivariable Cox proportion al hazards analyses, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test. Results or Findings: The study included 119 patients (mean age 59.8\u00b110.7 years old, 61 [51.3%] men) who underwent 161 treatm ents composed of 241 intraarterial procedures. The median LETB change of -25.8% best separated OS curves (log-rank whole-body ves (log-rank p<0.001). change of -10% demonstrated the highest disc rimination according to time analyses, LETB change remained independently associated with improved OS (hazard ratio 0.56), ti me-to-unTACEable progression (hazard ratio 0.49), hepatic PFS (hazar ratio 0.47). Neither RECIST or mRE CIST criteria were retained by multivariable analyses. Conclusion: Response according to LETB change predicts survival outcomes in patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases af ter intraarterial treatments, with better discrimination than RECIST and mRECIST criteria. Limitations: Identified limitations of this study were: the retr ospective design, multiple treatments before IATs, and inclusion of b oth TAE and TACE.

Methods or Background: FLIS derived from hepatobiliary phase (HBP) MRI was associated with graft survival in patients who underwent liver transplantation and linked with first hepatic decom pensation and TFS in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) . 397 patients with CLD who had undergone gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI were included. A FLIS was assigned based on the sum of three HBP features : hepatic enhancement, biliary excretion, and the signal intensity in the portal vein. The SCCD was measured. Patients were stratified into three FLIS for first hepatic decompensation and TFS was investigated. Results or Findings: We observed a strong positive correlation between t he measured spleen volume and the SCCD (Spearman's rho=0.887; p<0.001). In patients with ACLD, 2.38, 95%CI: 1.51-43.76, p<.001). All ocating patients into three groups based on their FLIS and SCCD enabled further stratification of patients according to their risk for mortality (log-rank-tes t: p<.001). The SCCD was further identified as an independent risk factor for first and further hepatic decompensation in patients imaging score derived from gadoxetic acid- enhanced MRI in combination with the splenic craniocaudal diameter identifies patients with advanced chronic liver disease who ar e at increased risk of hepatic decompensation and of mortality.

Methods or Background: Imaging data of 394 patients who had HCC diagnosed and OLT were retrospectively collected, m eeting the following inclusion criteria: age >18 years, cirrhosis, MRI p erformed <45 days before OLT, MRI including DWI and HBP phase. Final study population included 48 patients with a mean age at OLT of 55 years. Pathol ogical examination of the native livers was obtained. MRI studies were perfor med by using 1.5/3T systems. For dynamic vascular study, 0.025 mmol/kg of gadoxetic acid disodium was injected. Results or Findings: At pathology 155 nodules were identified. Seventy-f our were classified as HCC (mean size 24 mm; 11 as well , 27 as moderately, 14 as poorly, and 22 as undifferentiated lesions), 25 as high-grade dysplastic nodules (mean size 15 mm), and 34 as regenerative n odules (mean size 14 mm). DWI signal restriction was observed in 1/11 well differentiated HCC, in 4/27 moderately differentiated dysplastic nodules, of 68% and specificity of 91%. HBP hypo intense appearance without APHE was observed in 5/11 well differentiated HCC, in 4/27 moderately differentiated HCC, poorly of specificity of 92%. Conclusion: Nodules arising in cirrhotic livers with high signal restriction at DWI and HBP hypointense appearance should be consid ered as HCC lesions in absence of typical APHE. Limitations: One identified limitation of this study was the sam ple size. Ethics committee approval: This study received ethics committee approval.

Obmann*, J. Klaus, A. Berzigotti, A. A. Peters, performance of liver MRI extracellul ar volume (ECV) fraction with different blood pool measurements in comparison to the grade of liver fibrosis and MR elastography. Methods or Background: A total of 41 patients planned for liver biopsy wer e prospectively included to undergo multiparametric M RI at 3T, including T1 mapping before, and 15 minutes after, intravenous i njection of an extracellular contrast agent (Gd-DOTA) and SE-EPI based MR elastography. T1 relaxation times were measured in the liver and in different b lood pool locations in the aorta, portal vein and inferior vena cava. Extracel lular volume fraction was calculated ECV=(1-hematocrit)*(1/(T1 liver post- contrast)-1/(T1 liver pre-contrast))/(1/(T1 blood pool post-contrast)-1/(T1 blood pool pre-contrast)). The performance of ECV to predict advanced liver fi brosis (F3-4) in comparison to early fibrosis (F0-2) was analysed wi th an ROC analysis. Combined predictive value of ECV and MRE for advanc ed liver fibrosis was analysed using a multivariate logistic regression a nalysis with ROC analysis. Results or Findings: ECV allowed prediction of advanced fibrosis with an AUC AUC of ( the portal vein and AUC of 0.64 (p=0.12) in the inferior vena cava, while had an AUC of 0.76 (p=0.005). Combination of ECV and MRE yield ed a combined prediction for significant fibrosis with an AUC of 0.77 (p=0.003) in the aorta 0.81 (p<0.001) in the portal vein. Conclusion: MRI ECV has the highest predictive value for advanc ed liver fibrosis when measured in the aorta and in the port al vein, while measurement in the inferior vena cava is not recommended.

J. Herold*, D. Sobotka, L. Beer, N. Bastati-Hub er, Purpose: In chronic liver disease (CLD), early detection is pivotal and a predictive tool for events such as decompensation o r transplant-free survival could change the surveillance and evaluation of tre atment in these patients. By analysing the liver vessel volume ratio (LVVR) and linking this information to clinical data we expected to not only find predicti ve features influencing the patient's treatment and outcome, but also identify phenotypical information that may inform our understanding of the biology, development, and early changes of CLD. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study 250 patients with known CLD, who underwent gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI were included. According to the Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4 scores) and histories of decompensation, patients were separated into 3 groups (non-advanced chronic liver disease (non-ACLD), compensated advanced chronic liver dise ase (c-ACLD) and decompensated advanced chronic liver disease (d-ACLD)). After successful automatic segmentation of the liver and liver vessels, Spearman and Pearson correlation, multinomial regression analysis and on e-way ANOVA analysis were used to assess the association of LVVR with va rious established clinical and imaging parameters such as FIB-4 scores, MELD s core, functional liver imaging score (FLIS) and liver functional parameter s. Results or Findings: The mean LVVR exhibited significant differences between all three groups. In FIB-4 scores non-ACLD could be differentiated from advanced liver disease (p<.001) and in FLIS d- ACLD from c-ACLDs (p<.001). In the multinomial regression analysis LV VR showed a verifiable impact on correct group assignation. Conclusion: Liver vessel volume ratio may be valuable for disti nguishing between non-advanced and advanced chronic liver dis ease.

Y. Choi*; Seoul/KR Purpose: This study was designed to investigate the frequenc y of computed tomography (CT) features indicating progression of portal hypertension and their clinical relevance in patients who experience d acute cellular rejection (ACR) after liver transplantation (LT). Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 145 patients with pathologically diagnosed ACR following LT. Patients were divided into early and late ACR groups according to the time of ACR di agnosis. Two radiologists analysed the interval changes in spleen size and va riceal engorgement on CT images obtained at the times of surgery and biopsy. Aggravation of splenomegaly and variceal engorgement were consider ed CT features associated with the progression of portal hypertens ion. Clinical outcomes, including responses to treatment and graft survival , were compared between patients with and without these features. Results or Findings: The frequency of progression of portal hypertension was 31.7% and did not differ significantly in patients who experienced early (30.8% [29/94]) and late (33.3% [17/51]) ACR (p=0.85). In the ACR group, CT features indicating progression of portal hypertens ion were significantly associated with poor response to treatment (p=0.033). Graft survival in both the early and late ACR groups did not differ signif icantly in patients with and without progression of portal hypertension. Conclusion: CT features suggesting the progression of portal hy pertension were encountered in about one-third of patients who experienced ACR after LT. Progression of portal hypertension was signific antly related to poor response to treatment, particularly in the late ACR group. Limitations: Due to the retrospective nature, there may be selec tion bias in the study populations. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study.

Luetkens; Bonn/DE Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic utility of MRI-derive d hepatic extracellular volume fraction (ECV) for the assessm ent of liver cirrhosis severity as defined by Child-Pugh classes. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 90 participants (68 patients with liver cirrhosis and 22 control subjec ts) who underwent multiparametric liver MRI were identified. Hepatic T1 relaxation times and ECV were assessed. Clinical scores of liver disease sev erity were calculated. ANOVA followed by Turkey\u00b4s multiple comparison test s, Spearman's correlation coefficient, and ROC analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results or Findings: In cirrhotic patients, hepatic native T1 increased p<0.001). EC V was higher in cirrhotic patients compared to the controls (40.1\u00b111.9% vs 25.9\u00b14.5%, p<0.001) and also increased Child-Pugh classes A and B, and Child-Pugh classes B and C with an AUC of 0.785 and 0.944, p<0.001, respectively. The diagnos tic performance of ECV for differentiating between Child-Pugh classes A and B, and Child-Pugh Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 243 classes B and C was higher compared to hepatic nati ve T1 (AUC: with the Child-Pugh score and showed a high diagnostic performance in differentiation between different Child-Pugh cirrhosis classes.

Yeung*; Melbourne/AU (Phoebe.Yeung17@gmail.com) Purpose: To assess the effect of increased utilisation of mobile X-ray units, mobile imaging of non-routine body regions and radi ographer work practice changes for impact on staff radiation dose during t he early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Australia. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of general radiology departments across two metropolitan hospitals was p erformed. Personal radiation monitor exposure reports between January 2019 and December 2020 were analysed. Statistical analysis was conducted using a Mann-Whitney U test when comparing each quarter, from 2019 to 2020 . Categorical data were compared using a chi-squared test. Results or Findings: Mobile X-ray use during the pandemic increased approximately 1.7-fold, with the peak usage observe d in September 2020. The mobile imaging rate per month of non-routine body r egions increased from approximately 6.0-7.8%. Reported doses marginally increased during Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2020 (in comparison to 2019 data), though was not statistically significant (Q2: p=0.13; Q3: p=0.31 and Q4 p= 0.32). In Q1, marginally decreased and were not statistically significant (p=0.22). Conclusion: There was a substantial increase in the utilisation of mobile X- rays following the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, mobile X-ray work practices evolved to reduce infection transmission risk, such as imaging patients in isolation rooms. Despite the increase i n the utilisation of mobile radiography, there was no statistically significant increase in radiation exposure to radiographers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations: These findings are the experience of one Australian health service and may not be generalisable to other healt h services. Staff rostering also varied leading to many radiographers being exc luded.

The change in the number of visits by imaging modality in the years 2018-2019 compared to the years 2020-2021 is studied. Methods or Background: The statistics of care in 10 imaging services of the main public hospitals in Chile from 2018 to 2022 ar e analysed. The changes in the number of cares by the modalities of general ra diology, CT, MRI, mammography and ultrasound are studied. Results or Findings: It was found that in the 10 main public hospitals i n Chile, care imaging services reduced between 5% and 31%, w ith an average reduction of 21% in care in the different modalities of imaging examinations. The most affected modality turned out to be the ult rasound, which registered a drop of between 3% and 56%, with an average of 32%. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic generated an average reduction of 21% in care in the 10 imaging services of the main public hospitals in Chile, with ultrasound being the most affected modality and general radiology the least affected. An effort by the state will be need ed to recover the levels prior to the pandemic and resume the growth of the system in pre-pandemic years.

Brydon, To profile the professional quality of life (PQL) of medical radiation and imaging professionals (MRIPs) during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Methods or Background: PQL is defined as the quality an individual feels i n relation to their work as a helper. It is influence d by the positive (compassion satisfaction) and negative (compassion fatigue) asp ects encountered in one's job. Compassion is a feeling of empathy towards another's suffering combined with the motivation to help. In healthcare, compass ion is associated with increased trust in therapeutic relationships, improved outcomes for patients, increased job satisfaction, and retention of staff. Understanding the influence of ongoing crisis situations on aspects of PQL is important for identifying areas needing support and ensuring sustained contribution. This study explores aspects of compassion in MRIPs willing to work duri ng the COVID-19 Pandemic. A self-report survey of MRIPs was conduct ed in Fall, 2020. PQL was measured using ProQOL-5 (compassion satisfactio n and compassion fatigue). Compassion fatigue was assessed by subscales: Burnout and Secondary Trauma. Results or Findings: Of 162 MRIPs, 99% reported having moderate (58%) or high (41%) compassion satisfaction. For burnout, 26 % of MRIPs reported low levels and 74% reported moderate levels. For second ary trauma, 52% reported low levels and 48% reported moderate levels. Compas sion satisfaction was associated with age (p 0.021) and years in practice (p=0.019), but not gen der, education or job role. Burnout was not associated w ith demographic factors. Secondary trauma was associated with gender (p=0.02) and age (p 0.041). Conclusion: Compassion satisfaction influences motivation to help. 99% of MRIPs reported moderate-high levels of compassion s atisfaction despite moderate levels of burnout and secondary trauma. Compassion satisfaction may prove to be a dominant factor in willingness to work during the pandemic.

L. Murphy*, M. McEntee, N. Moore, A. England; C ork/IE (michellelauramurphy@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the wellbeing of interventional radiographers (IRs) prior to and dur ing the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods or Background: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the wellbeing of IR's. An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach, using both questionnaires and interviews, was used to explore and evaluate IR wellbeing. An electronic self-administered questionnaire was completed by forty IRs and a semi-structured interview was condu cted with two IRs. Results or Findings: Physical, mental and social wellbeing of IRs has deteriorated since the onset of COVID-19. All forms of wellbeing were negatively impacted with mental wellbeing being the most impacted (82.5%), closely followed by physical wellbeing (the impact of which increased to 75%) and social wellbeing (50%). Half of IRs were \"highl y stressed\" while working during COVID-19. Physical activity levels decreased, caffeine consumption increased, and consumption of a healthy diet decreased. Most IRs (95%) had anxiety about passing the virus onto family or friends, they had a reduced level of sleep and IRs (60%) noted a deterioration in their relationships with friends. Three key themes were identified including the impo rtance of teamwork, physical demands and the mental impact of work. Conclusion: COVID-19 has subsequently had a negative effect on the wellbeing of IRs in Ireland. The implications of st aff having a diminished sense of wellbeing is that productivity could reduce and subsequent burnout could lead to illness. Further work is needed to focus on and contribute to improving the wellbeing of IRs. Limitations: Further research is needed to identify methods of addressing the shortcomings in support services and identifying the specific wellbeing needs of IRs.

Dias\u00b9, Radiology, for pulmonary computed tomography (CT) applied in suspected COVID -19 infection, an adjustment of the image acquisition variables (prot ocol) is recommended, which determines the radiation dose received by the patient. The International Atomic Energy Agency found wide variation in protoc ols, within and between different countries. The aim of this study was to a nalyse whether imaging departments have adapted their routine chest CT protocols in relation to the COVID-19 infection. Methods or Background: Through records of examinations in CD-ROM, 5 protocols of chest CT in suspected COVID-19 patient s in 4 imaging departments were randomly selected. The parameters which impact the CTDIvol and DLP were analysed: thickness, pitch, kV , mA, time rotation and gap. The effective and cumulative dose were calcula ted for each protocol. The Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the values of DLP and CTDIvol and to compare the dose descriptors of the protocol the (Kruskal-Wallis test) was used. Results or Findings: There were no significant differences between the 5 protocols of the 4 imaging departments (p=0.406) in the evaluation of the effective dose measured in (mSv). However, it was f ound that the lowest value was obtained in department B (2.94mSv) and the highest value in department C (6.68mSv). The differences between the protocol t hat presented the lowest effective dose, and the others, were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The high differences found were not statistically s ignificant regarding the dose descriptors of each protocol. Compared to the previous ones, the different imaging departments adapted their chest CT protocols for COVID-19 patients, however there is latitude for further rigorous optimisation adapted to this clinical situation. Limitations: The small sample of protocols was an identified lim itation. Ethics committee approval: This study received ethics committee approval.

L. F. Soares\u00b9, S. Buttigieg\u00b2, B. Bak\u00b3, *J. G. Co uto*\u00b2, of radiation therapists (TR/RTTs) regarding circular economy (CE) practices relevant to the professional practice across the European Union and identify the relevant green skills. Methods or Background: An electronic survey (Google forms) was distributed to TR/RTTs across the EU. Convenience sampling was used since the population is ill-defined; as such, participants we re recruited by all SAFE EUROPE partners covering all of Europe and via soci al media to include as many participants as possible. This survey was open from 1st October 2021 to 30th November 2021. Data analysis was performed wit h the aid of SPSS version 22. Results or Findings: Sixty-seven responses were received. 40.3% (n=27) and 47.8% (n=32) of TR/RTTs were not aware of CE and gr een skills, respectively. 70% (n=47) of the TR/RTTs did not receive training in CE practice. 82% (n=55) agreed that green skills should be included in RTTs education. Environment- friendly procurement, waste management and energy r eduction/efficiency were the most relevant topics to be developed. Conclusion: TR/RTTs have a lack of knowledge regarding CE and green skills. Further development of green skills is required to enable the implementation of CE into radiotherapy practice. Limitations: The survey was in English so may have excluded non- English speakers from participating. Lack of knowledge on C E may have decreased the number of responses. The length of time to complete the survey was a further limitation. Ethics committee approval: Ethical permission was sought and obtained from Ulster University, Belfast, UK.

Mets\u00e4l\u00e4*\u00b9, S. compare breast cancer patients' opinions about mammography and radiation therapy services to what health care staff thought to be success factors for these services. Methods or Background: Patient data was collected from breast cancer patients (n=14) by using open-ended online questionnaires via the websites and social media of national breast cancer patient organisations in four countries. In addition a web-based open-ended quest ionnaire was sent to breast care hospitals located in four different cou ntries, focusing on four professional groups: diagnostic radiographers, radi ation therapists, breast cancer nurses and biomedical laboratory scientists (n=23). Both data sets were analysed using deductive thematic analysis. Results or Findings: In regard to both services, patients emphasise competent staff, good information and smooth-flowing, comfortable and individual services. Staff tend to put more emphasi s on patient characteristics and the technical performance features of the process. Common aspects for both patients and staff are understanding the impor tance of aftercare and follow-up, and the fact that the patient should be given a chance to keep in close contact with care and treatment staff even af ter their active treatment process has finished. Conclusion: Patients and health care staff view mammography and radiation therapy services somewhat differently. Patients put more emphasis on non- clinical issues and staff focus more on patient rel ated and technical factors. Both patients and staff should be involved in planning services for breast cancer patients. Limitations: Limitations associated with self-reporting instruments apply to this study.

Larosa, L. M. Minordi, *A. Bevere*, L. L. Manfredi; Rome/IT (antonio.bevere1@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study is to assess the capability o f radiomics to predict the need for surgery in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). Methods or Background: A cohort of 30 patients with CD that had undergone one or more CT-enterographies between 2009 and 2011 was retrospectively selected. A total of 44 CT scans were examined by an expert radiologist who generated a region of interest (ROI) segmentation f or each pathological intestinal tract found, obtaining 93 lesions overal l for radiomic analysis. A dedicated software extracted 217 radiomic features from each ROI. Patients charts were reviewed to evaluate if patients underw ent surgery in a 10-year follow-up for a binary classification. A logistic r egression model was built with the selected features and evaluated by computing the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC ) curve. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of the model were calculated. Results or Findings: Two radiomic features were found to be statisticall y significant in predicting the need for surgery in t he fitted logistic regression model (p < 0.0001): grey level histogram variance and grey level non- uniformity. This model presented an AUC of 0.83, wi th a confidence interval of 95% in predicting surgery. Mean values of the model performance metrics over the cross-validation iterations were: accuracy 0.78 (0.02), sensitivity (0.09). Conclusion: Radiomics could be a helpful tool to identify high risk for surgery patients. Early identification of such patients may influence their treatment choice during the course of the disease, avoiding u nnecessary medical therapy. Limitations: Further studies are required to obtain larger and e xternal validations of this model. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable Funding for this study: There is no funding to report.

This study aimed to develop a machine learning model incorporating computed tomography body composition features to improve prediction of mesalamine treatment response in Croh n's disease. Methods or Background: 107 patients with confirmed Crohn's disease who were treated with mesalamine were retrospectively i ncluded and separated randomly into a training and a validation group. Th e prediction models were developed using machine learning methods (least abs olute shrinkage and selection operator, random forest, and support vect or machine [SVM]) using just clinical/laboratory values (SVM-Clinic-Labtest composition (SVM- Combined), or using multivariable logistic regressi on (LR). Results or Findings: After incorporating body composition features, the SVM- Combined model showed good discrimination between t he responder and non- responder groups, with an area under the curve of 0.953 (95% CI: 0.883 to CI: 0.957 to 1.000) in the validation group. This was significantly higher tha n for the SVM-Clinic-Labtest model (area: training group, performance and clinical applicability of the machine learning model were observed using calibration and decision curve analysis. Conclusion: We developed a machine learning model incorporating computed tomography body composition features along with cli nical/laboratory values, which could aid in predicting mesalamine treatment response in Crohn's disease patients.

Methods or Background: Eighty-two Crohn's disease patients with terminal ileal involvement, who underwent magnetic resonance enterography, were retrospectively analysed. Magnetic resonance variables included bowel wall Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 246 thickness, relative wall edema, water-fat ratio, ap parent diffusion coefficient value, mucosal ulceration, enlarged lymph nodes, fi stula, comb signs, abscesses, and stenosis. We used logistic regression analysis to identify magnetic resonance imaging indices independently as sociated with Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) scores (reference standard). Results or Findings: Logistic regression analysis showed that bowel wall thickness, water-fat ratio, apparent diffusion coef ficient value were independently associated with MaRIA scores, the m-C lermont index was constructed as follows: 21.219 - 0.295 4.239 \u00d7 ADC value (R2 = 0.783). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analysis of our model showed high accuracy for disc riminating inactive and active Crohn's disease with 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity (area under the curve 0.964). For each patient, there was a good correlation between m- Clermont scores and MaRIA (R = 0.747, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The accuracy and simplicity of the magnetic resonan ce inflammatory activity index for detecting disease activity may render it an alternative to endoscopy in the evaluation of Crohn's disease. Limitations: First, the sample size is relatively small, and the data are from a single centre, so there may be selection bias. Seco nd, the model was not externally validated to test its clinical usefulnes s, which is also a pity.

Wu*; Nanjing/CN Purpose: To predict Crohn's disease activity by radiomics analysis of magnetic resonance enterography contrast enhancement. Methods or Background: 82 patients with terminal ileal involvement with CD who were divided into the non-mild and the moderate-severe activity group according to the magnetic resonance activity index. The model was established in the training set and verified in the test set. We used the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the diagn ostic efficacy of conventional imaging results (London index) and the radiomics model for distinguishing non-mild and moderate-severe active inflammation in CD. Results or Findings: We finally got the model was 0.953 (sensitivity: 90.3%, (sensitivity: 84.6%, specificity: 81.2%) in the test set. The diagnostic efficacy of visual interpretation was 0.848 (sensitivity 80.6%, specificity 77.8%) in the training set. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model in differentiating non-mild and moderate-severe Crohn' s disease activity was significantly higher than that of the radiologists' visual interpretation (AUC = 0.953 vs 0.848, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The radiomics model based on contrast enhanced magn etic resonance enterography is effective in the diagnosi s of active inflammation of the small intestine in Crohn's disease. Limitations: The sample size is relatively small, and the data i s from a single center, so there may be data bias. This study only investigated the non-mild and moderate-severe activity of the terminal ileum, but not the whole intestine.

Holalkere; Boston, MA/US (kalkhalili1@tuftsmedicalcenter.org) Purpose: To evaluate the utility of DWI in evaluation of acute flare of Crohn's disease. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of MRE exams was performed for 39 patients with established Crohn's disease with acute symptoms. MRE sequences included DWI (highest b-val ue of post-gadolinium Two s qualitatively analyzed 3 groups of studies: 1) DWI/ ADC maps, 2) Post-contra st T-1 3) combination of T1, T2, DWI, and post-contrast image s. Receiver operating characteristic analysis (AUC) and descriptive stati stics were performed. A p- value of <.05 was considered significant. Results or Findings: A total of 156 segments/areas were evaluated for each set of sequences. Active inflammation was seen in 43 segments of small bowel, 10 of colon, and 12 of mesenteric involvemen t. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative pr edictive value, and accuracy in identification of acute flare were 97%, 77%, Post for DWI, 0.956 for Post Gd-T1, for combination of all sequences with p<0.05. DWI alone failed to identify 11/12 cases of penetrating mesenteric disease. However, w ith combination of post contrast images, all 12/12 cases of penetrating dis ease were identified. Conclusion: DWI/ADC maps offer a comparable diagnostic sensitiv ity to contrast enhanced images in detecting acute flare of Crohn's disease, however, they provide a limited assessment of penet rating mesenteric disease. The utility of contrast enhanced sequences can be optimized by the addition of DWI sequence, particularly when motion artifact is encountered. Limitations: The qualitative approach used during interpretation of DWI/ADC imaging, the retrospective approach, and the small sample were identified as limitations in this study.

Paredes; Valencia/ES Purpose: to investigate the US features that allow us to sus pect the presence of submucosal fat deposition (SFD) in the intestinal wall of patients with Crohn's disease. Methods or Background: CT examinations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2020) were reviewed for the presence of the SFD in the bowel wall. A measurement of less than -10 HU was regarded as indicative of fat. We included only patients who had undergone US examina tion 3 months before or after CT. The study cohort group comprised 67 patients, 43 men and 24 women. Wall and submucosal thickness were measured on longitudinal US sections; an average of 3 measures was used for analysis. Measurements were made on images where a continuous and similar thickness of the submucosa was seen. A ROC curve was constructed to determine the best cut-off of US submucosal wall thickness for predict ing SFD in the bowel wall determined on CT. Results or Findings: The SFD was present in 25 of the 67 patients (37,3% ) on CT. There were significant differences between s ubmucosal thickness of patients with SFD and patients without SFD (25,5 versus 39,4 mm). From the ROC curve, a threshold value of 31mm of submucosal thickness had the best sensitivity and specificity to suspect SFD (84% and 88,1%, respectively) (AUC, 0.902), with an odds ratio of 38,85. All patients w ith a submucosal thickness > 39mm had HSF (n = 16). Conclusion: Based on our results, US may suspect the presence of SFD on the wall and therefore recommend its confirmation w ith other techniques. Limitations: It is important to note that ultrasound cannot diag nose SFD in the submucosa, it can only suggest it.

Y. Faiz, A. Rana, *R. (raanakanwal@hotmail.com) Purpose: This study aims to describe the typical radiological findings in patients with Crohn's disease to aid in the diagnos is of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in daily practice. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 247 Methods or Background: After IRB approval, a retrospective study was performed at a single institution. 30 patients with Crohn's disease with magnetic resonance enterography were included in th e study. Data was reviewed from the electronic system. Results or Findings: 9 patients (30%) were female and 21 patients (70%) were male, who underwent magnetic resonance enterography showing characteristic Crohn's disease characteristics. Amo ng these patients, post- contrast enhancement was reported in 64% of patient s, whereas 60% of patients had mural wall thickening. Another common feature seen among these patients was lymphadenopathy. This was seen i n 20% of the study population. Other features of lesser percentages in clude mural thickening (7%), 6.6% had ulceration and 5% showed DWI restric ted diffusion. None of these patients had extra-intestinal manifestation o r any complications at the time of presentation. 60% of the patients underwent biopsy, whereas 3 (10%) patients had ASCA positive associated Crohn's. The remaining 7 patients had neither biopsy nor a blood test to confirm the diag nosis. Among the biopsy proven cases, our study revealed 61% diagnostic acc uracy for Crohn's disease. This study was limited by its small sample size, its retrospective nature, and loss to follow-up in some patients. Conclusion: Magnetic resonance enterography was found to be an effective, non-invasive imaging modality for the accurate diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Limitations: The small data set was a limiting factor in this st udy. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics commitee.

HRCT lungs: comparison of image quality and diagno stic impact *V. Van Ballaer*, A. Coolen, W. De Wever; Leuven/BE Purpose: To compare clinical image en ultra-high- resolution photon-counting CT (PCCT) and conventional visual grading analysis (VGA) scores. Methods or Background: Thirty-five patients with a PCCT (Naeotom Alpha, Siemens) between Nov 2021 and Jan 2022 and with a p revious conventional HRCT in the last 14 months were included. Central a nd peripheral airways, lung vasculature, lines, were evaluated on PCCT (0.4mm) versus conventional HRCT (1mm) via side-by- side reference scoring using a 5-point Likert scale (-2 to +2). Visibility and possible impact on diagnosis were assessed by three radiologists using a visual grading analysis (VGA). The median VGA scores were compared and test ed using one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with hypothesised median values of 0 (same visibility) and 2 (better visibility and diagnostic impact) at a 2.5% significance level. Results or Findings: Almost all lung structures had significantly better visibility on PCCT compared to HRCT (p<0.025), with the highes t VGA scores for peripheral airways (1.06), intralobular lines (1.10 ) and centrilobular emphysema (1.20). A positive trend, though seen was better, no signi ficant impact on diagnosis (VGA-score 2) could be demonstrated. Conclusion: All lung structures had superior clinical image quality on PCCT versus HRCT, being most pronounced for peripheral airways, intralobular lines and centrilobular emphysema. A significant impact on diagnosis, however, could not be demonstrated. Limitations: Small population sample, of which the majority had interstitial lung disease.

M. Woeltjen*, J. H. Niehoff, A. E. Michael, C. M\u00f6nninghoff, J. Borggrefe, J. R. Kr\u00f6ger; Minden/DE Purpose: This study aims to investigate the qualitative and quantitative image qualities of low dose high resolution (LD-HR) thora x CT scans with the first clinical approved photon counting CT (PCCT) scanner and its radiation dose compared to a conventional scanner with an energy-i ntegrating detector (EID- CT). Methods or Background: a LD-HR CT scan with dual-source PCCT for suspicion of interstitial lung disease and had previously undergone a LD-HR CT scan with an EID-CT scanner were retrospectively identified. In 29 of these patients no change in pu lmonary changes were noted in the clinical report and these patients were incl uded in our study. For the PCCT images were reconstructed with and without quantum iterative reconstruction (QIR). Magnified images were rated b y 3 senior radiologists, blinded to clinical information and the CT scanner, for qualitative image quality parameters using a 5-point Likert-scale. Moreover, the effective dose was calculated. Results or Findings: Overall image quality was rated valued better in PC CT images with QIR compared to EID-CT images (4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 3.4 \u00b1 1.1, p<0.001). Imaging quality was also higher in PCCT images with QIR compared to PCCT images without QIR (4 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 3.7 \u00b1 0.8, p<0.001) . Effective radiation dose was significantly lower in PCCT examinations (1.41 \u00b1 0.5mSv) compared to EID-CT scans (1.9 \u00b1 0.52mGy) (p Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 248 Conclusion: PCCT LD-HR chest examinations provide better image quality with significant dose reduction compared to EID-CT scans. QIR significantly improves image quality for lung examinations with t he PCCT. Limitations: Low patient number.

Bipat\u00b9, Stoker\u00b9; \u00b9Amsterdam/NL, \u00b2Haarlem/NL (inge.van.den.berk@suerte.nl) Purpose: It has been suggested that pattern recognition on C T aids in identifying the aetiology of pneumonia. We retrospectively studied the diagnostic accuracy at ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT). Methods or Background: In the OPTIMACT trial 1,208 patients with suspected non-traumatic pulmonary disease underwent ULDCT at the emergency department. All 276 patients with a definite clinical diagnosis of pneumonia were selected, of which 96 (35%) had a positive microbiology result. 60 had viral pathogens; 48 had bacterial pathogens; one had a fungus; and there were multiple pathogens in 13. Two chest radiologists independently evaluated the corresponding ULDCT for pneumonia pat tern (lobar, interstitial or bronchopneumonia) and most likely pathogen. Results or Findings: In the patients with bacterial pathogens a bronchopneumonia pattern was observed by both radiologists in 14/48 (29%) and by only one in 17/48 (35%); a lobar pneumonia pattern was observed by both in 15/48 (31%) and by one in 11/48 (23%); and an interstitial pneumonia pattern was observed by one in 5/45 (11%). In the patients with viral pathogens a bronchopneumonia pattern was observed by both in 23/60 (38%) and by one in 23/60 (38%); a lobar pattern was observed by bot h in 6/60 (10%) and by one in 6/60 (10%); and an interstitial pneumonia patter n was observed by both in 1/60 (2%) and by one in 12/60 (20%). In the patient s with bacterial pathogens this was suggested by both radiologists in 34/48 (71%) and by one in 8/48 (17%). In the patients with viral pathogens this was suggested by both in 6/60 (10%) and by one in 18/60 (30%). Conclusion: Although a lobar pneumonia pattern is associated wi th a bacterial infection and the bronchopneumonia and interstitial pneumonia patterns are seen more often with a viral infection, overall the cause of pneumonia cannot reliably be determined at CT.

Colombi*\u00b9, M. Petrini\u00b9, N. To assess the association between interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) and worse outcomes in patients affected by CO VID-19 pneumonia. Methods or Background: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT at an emergency department between Februar y 29th 2020 and March 31st 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Pat ients with CT findings indeterminate or typical for COVID-19 pneumonia, wi th positive nasal-pharyngeal molecular swab for SARS-CoV-2, who had obtained a chest CT before the pandemic were selected. Pre-pandemic CT scans were reviewed for the presence of ILA. ILA were also assessed accordi ng to the Fleischner Society diagnostic criteria. The outcome was either death from COVID-19 or intensive care unit (ICU) admission (death/ICU). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to test the independent association between ILA and death/ICU admission. Results or Findings: 121/1391 (9%) patients were years-old; males 87/12, 72%). Prior CT was within a median time of 14 months (IQR 5-35 months) . ILA were identified in 13/31 (42%) ILA displayed fi brotic CT features. A significant association between fibrotic ILA and de ath/ICU admission (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.11-4.34, p=0.024) was found. Conclusion: CT scans obtained before the diagnosis of COVID pne umonia are to carefully review for the presence and charac terisation of ILA. Indeed, fibrotic ILA are independent risk factors for worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Limitations: Retrospective analysis from a single hospital. Smal l number of patients included, particularly with ILA. Ethics committee approval: The study is approved by the local ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding source.

Methods or Background: Contextflow is an AI-based CBIR application which identifies lung-specific patterns on chest CTs and identifies cases with identical or similar patterns in its repository to support an objective image assessment. The pilot enables STATdx to present differential di agnoses to the users, which are adopted to the automatically analysed patterns. Theses differential diagnoses then serve as a case-fitted reference book. This solution overcomes the traditional \"black-box\" problem related to AI by leaving the final decision to the radiologist. Nine radiologists (7 trainees and 2 specialists) with different levels of experience in thoracic imaging evaluated this pilot based on a pre- reading and a post-reading survey while each analys ing 5 cases of lung diseases with different levels of difficulty. The s urveys were recorded in a questionnaire on a Likert scale from 0-5 and analys ed in a descriptive manner. Results or Findings: All participants agreed that it is important to hav e references available while using computer assistive technology, and 66.6% (6 out of 9) of the radiologists reported increased us er confidence. Overall positive feedback was given by all participants rep orting a potential role of this integrative technology for training purposes (44.4% rating as high and 55.6% rating as very high). Conclusion: The combination of an AI-based CBIR presenting cases with similar patterns and a linked comprehensive radiology knowledge system like STATdx can increase user confidence and help young radiologists in establishing diagnoses.

In this study we propose a new diagnostic criteria. Methods or Background: In this multicenter retrospective study we included non-oncohematologic patients admitted in four different hospitals (3 in Spain and 1 in Italy). Different IPA criteria were used according to the baseline conditions of the patients. Patients were divided i nto three immunosuppression groups : 1) neutropenic (non-oncohematologic), 2) s evere non-neutropenic (mostly solid organ transplantion), and 3) intermediate non-neutropenic patients. Pulmonary X-Rays and CT findings were rev iewed in each group, describing bronchoinvasive and angioinvasive signs. Results or Findings: 146 patients were included: 9 (94.5% vs. 45.2%, p= 0.023). Invasive airway signs were equally distributed in (88.9% vs 94.3 vs (58%) were the most common findings. Bronchoinvasive signs were observed more frequently in patients with less immunosuppression (0% vs 41.9% vs uncommon in less immunosuppressed hosts. Conclusion: Bronchoinvasive signs are more common in less immunosuppressed hosts with IPA, whereas angioinvas ive forms are most frenquently seen in neutropenic and severe non-neut ropenic patients. Therefore, in less neutropenic patients such as non-oncohematological patients, early recognition of bronchoinvasive signs can contribute to a prompt diagnosis in the initial stages of the disease.

J. P rokop; Nijmegen/NL (luuk.oostveen@radboudumc.nl) Purpose: To investigate the impact of additional silver filt ration (Ag) in the X- ray beam for ultra-low dose (ULD) chest CT acquisit ions. Methods or Background: Acquisitions with and without Ag were taken at CTDIvol = 0.9 mGy (low-dose chest (LD)) and CTDIvol a 320-row detector CT (Aquilion One PRISM edition, Canon Medical), all with 120 kVp, pitch 1.4, rotation 0.5 seconds, and hybri d-iterative reconstruction with lung kernel. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) f or air ( -1000 HU), Delrin (350 HU), and Nylon ( 100 HU) inserts, standard deviations (SDs) and nois e power spectra (NPSs), and modulation transfer funct ions (MTFs) of a Delrin rod edge, all in a water background, were determine d. The beam-hardening artefact in the shoulder region of a chest phantom was quantified with an artefact index (AI), calculated by subtracting the mean HU value in a region of interest in the artefact from the background. Results or Findings: With Ag, SDs were 1.3-1.5x lower and CNR was 1.5- 1.8x higher than without. Average NPS frequency wit h Ag was 14% lower. 20% MTF frequencies for ULD and LD were 2.5 lp/cm and 3.4 lp/cm with Ag, and 2.8 lp/cm and 3.5 lp/cm without Ag, respectively. A I for ULD and LD was 31 HU and 57 HU with Ag, and 105 HU and 86 HU without Ag, respectively. Conclusion: Acquisitions with additional silver filtration have lower noise, higher CNR, less sharpness and less beam-hardening artefacts compared to normal filtration. CT acquisitions with an Ag filte r can be expected to be especially suited for (ultra) low-dose chest examin ations. Limitations: Phantom study only.

Oostveen: Prokop: Research/Grant Systems RPS 1304-10 Comparison digitally reconstructed radiogr aph models for ultra- low-dose CT images radiograph (DRR) construction method from scans. Methods or Background: An ULDCT scan takes more time to interpret clinically than a CXR but is a more sensitive and s pecific modality. To aid the interpretation of a ULDCT scan, fake CXRs, or DRRs, can be generated. These offer a quick overview of an ULDCT scan in a format that is highly familiar to radiologists. Three methods of construc ting DRRs ('Softmip', 'Tomogram' and 'DeepDRR') were identified using a s ystemic literature review. DRRs were constructed for six cases with a known absence of pathology for which both an ULDCT as well as a chest radiograph ( CXR) were available. Three radiologists with 3, 8 and 12 years of experi ence reading CXRs reviewed the DRR and the original CXR and scored the diagnostic quality of the DRR as a whole, soft tissue, bone, mediastinum and lungs on a scale from 1 to 6. The DRRs were also presented with the origi nal CXR to determine which method best matched the original CXR. Results or Findings: 'Softmip' scored (standard deviation) 3.3 (0.9), 4. 3 (1.3), 3.4 (1.3), 3.9 (0.9), 3.3 (0,9); 'Tomogram' scored 3.4 (0.9), 4.4 (1.2), 3.6 (1.1), 3.9 (0.9), 3 (1.2); and 'DeepDRR' scored 3.2 (1), 4.2 (1.2), 3.5 (1.2), 3.7 (0.9), 3.4 (0.9) for the evaluation as a whole, soft tissu e, bones, mediastinum and lungs, respectively. The methods 'Softmip', 'Tomogr am' and 'DeepDRR' were elected as best matching the original CXR eight, fi ve and five times, respectively. Conclusion: The 'Softmip' DRR was preferred in cases with a kno wn absence of pathology. Limitations: Small reader size and case number size. Ethics committee approval: Approved by METC Leiden-Delft.

Dixit; imaging manifestations of pulmona ry tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV and its varying pattern based on the l evel of immune compromise leads to challenges in the early diagnosis of PTB. Our study aims to determine the spectrum of CT findings of PTB in HIV seroposit ive patients and to study the association of various CT findings, i.e. the ra diological pattern of PTB with the level of immunosuppression. Methods or Background: Relevant clinico-demographic details and CD4 counts were noted in 100 HIV seropositive patients with suspected PTB, following which chest radiograph and contrast-enhanced CT were performed. Data obtained was analysed statistically. Results or Findings: A total of 71/100 cases were found to have PTB. A primary pattern of PTB with predominant extra-pulmonary involvement and miliary nodules was found in 42/71 (59.15%) cases, of which 32 (76.19%) cases had a CD4 count < 200 and only 10 (23.81%) cases had a CD4 count > 200. A typical post-primary pattern of PTB was foun d in the remaining 29/71 (40.85%) cases, of which 22 (75.9%) cases had CD4 > 200 and only 7 (24.1%) cases had CD4 < 200. A statistically significant as sociation was found between the radiological pattern of PTB and the level of im munosuppression (p-value <0.0001). Conclusion: CT proved to be an excellent imaging modality for t he early and prompt diagnosis of PTB in HIV seropositive patient s. The extent of immune compromise greatly influenced the imaging findings of PTB in HIV patients, showing a predominant primary pattern in the immunosuppressed group and a re-activation pattern in the immunocompetent group. Limitations: The study also included a few patients on antiretroviral (HAART) treatment; however, the independent effect of HAART on imaging manifestation has not been studied in detail.

Chung*; Seoul/KR Purpose: To evaluate the MRI findings of the craniocervical junction ligaments and compare the 2D TSE sequence and isotropic 3D SP ACE sequence on cervical spine MRI. Methods or Background: Eighty cervical spine MRIs were retrospectively analyzed, including 2D TSE and 3D SPACE sequences. The transverse ligament (TL) and alar ligament (AL) were evaluated by two readers using a three-point grading scale for visibility (0 = compl ete visualization from the odontoid process to the insertion site, well-defined margin, 1 = complete visualization, indistinct margin, 2 = incomplete vi sualization of ligament) and a four-point grading scale for morphology (0 = homoge neous low SI with normal thickness, 1 = high SI with normal thickness, 2 = r educed thickness, 3 = full- thickness rupture or indistinguishable from surrounding structures). The grades of the two sequences were compared. Intra-reader and inter-reader agreements were measured using Cohen's kappa and the percentage of exact agreement. Results or Findings: The visibility grades of TL were significantly lower in 3D images in all reading sessions (p < 0.001), indicat ing better visualization. The morphological grades of TL were significantly lower in 3D images, and AL was significantly higher in 3D images (p < 0.05). The exact agreements of visibility and morphological grade of TL in 3D tended to be hi gher than in 2D. The agreement of the morphological grade of AL tended t o be lower in 3D than in 2D. Conclusion: The utilization of 3D sequences significantly improves the visibility of TL and could potentially reduce false -positive diagnoses of ligament injury.

N. Bashkov*; Moskow/RU (abashkov@yandex.ru) Purpose: To develop a methodology for determining the muscle mass index (MMI-L) at the Th12, adjusted for the length of the thoracic spine based on the chest CT, and to estimate the impact of MMI-L on th e outcome of patients with pneumonia as a prognostic factor. Methods or Background: The medical data and computed tomography of the chest of 247 patients with confirmed SARS-Cov2 pneumonia were used. A correlation analysis of MMI-L and MMI adjusted for the height (MMI-H) as generally accepted was performed. A ROC analysis was made among male and female patients in different age groups in order to find cut-off values of MMI-L associated with lethality. Results or Findings: A strong correlation was found between the MMI-L and MMI-H (r = 0.861, p <0.001). The age threshold, whi ch was associated with an increase in the likelihood of death, was 60 years i n men (AUC=0.728) and 65 years in women (AUC=0.734). MMI-L = 3.37 cm2/m2 is a cut-off value, below which the probability of death in male patients und er 60 years increased 26.3 times (95% CI: 4.8-143.0). In female patients, ther e was no statistically significant threshold value of MMI-L which would be associated with a higher risk of death. Conclusion: MMI-L can be used to estimate sarcopenia-associated muscle loss, if the patient's height is unknown, as many p atients are in bed condition. An MMI-L less than 3.37 cm2/m2 is a strong predictor of death in men under 60 years of age. Further work is needed to study th e association between MMI- L and the outcome of pneumonia in female patients. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

J. Mowlem\u00b9, B. (Dho202@exeter.ac.uk) X-ray referrals from general practices (GPs) can be over-requested, particularly for degenerative change in the lumbar spine (L-spine). The Pan- Dorset L-Spine Imaging Guidelines were introduced t o reduce unnecessary radiation exposure. A recent audit of all GP X-ray requests at one hospital in East Dorset (UK), revealed several L-spine examinat ions were rejected. This prompted further investigation into the compliance with the imaging guidelines for justified and rejected L-spine requests. Methods or Background: A retrospective audit of all L-spine x-ray requests between September and December 2021 inclusive were extracted from the radiology information system and identified 92 referrals. The Pan-Dorset L- Spine Imaging Guidelines were used to determine if the clinical information was justified or unjustified. The reasons for cance llation and rejection and the report findings were collated and analysed using Mi crosoft Excel 365. Results or Findings: Of the 92 L-spine requests evaluated, 30 (32.6%) we re not performed; 18 (60.0%) of these were cancelled, and the remainder were rejected. Of the remaining 62 examinations performed, 30 (48.4%) of these had both justified and unjustified clinical indicat ions; 15 (24.2%) had justified clinical indications; and 17 (27.4%) had no justifi ed clinical indications. The most common unjustified indication was lower back pain (67.7%); however, the location (69.0%) and duration (50.0%) were frequent ly not specified. Of these, degenerative change was mostly reported (61.9%). Conclusion: Unjustified L-spine examinations are being performe d, thus contributing to the unnecessary increase in patient dose. More diligence is required when radiographers justify or reject L-spi ne X-ray requests. The Pan- Dorset L-Spine Imaging Guidelines require revision to become more specific in terms of pain location and duration. In addition, t he guidelines should be recirculated to GP surgeries in East Dorset to impr ove compliance. Limitations: Only one hospital in Dorset was sampled.

We aimed to assess the sonoelastographic findings of 82 patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathy and their relationship with clinical findings. Methods or Background: A total of 82 patients [78 with ankylosing spondyli tis (AS); 2 with juvenile psoriasis + AS] [mean age: 46.1 \u00b1 14.8 years, 56 male (68.3%)] were enrolled. Demographic data, clinical data [including presence of active enthesitis, synovitis, dactylitis and active systemic phase] and laboratory data were evaluated. Grey-scale and shear- wave elastography were performed by a Siemens [ACUS ON] machine [probe 7-14 MHz] and color mapping in regions of interest were determined. A sonographic assessment of the Achilles was performed on 3 parts, the Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 251 myotendinous [proximal], middle were measured. Results or Findings: A total of 50 patients were in systemic active phas e [61%]; 23 [28%] showed enthesitis active phase; and 41 [50%] current or previous history of enthesitis. Homogeneous echogenicity, peritendinous fluid and calcification were seen in 71 [86.6%], 4 [4.9%] and 2 [2.4%] of patients, respectively. Color-mapping grade was homogeneous r ed in 56 [68.3%], heterogeneous red in 15 [18.3%] and heterogeneous g reen in 7 [8.5%] of patients. The mean tendon thickness was 3.7 \u00b1 1 [2. 3-7.4], 4.5 in myotendinous junction, midportion and tendinotubercle junction. The mean velocity was 15. 3 \u00b1 2.9 [7.2-19.1], 15.6 \u00b1 2.5 [7.2-19] and 15 [7.1-18.8] in the myotendinous junction, midportion and tendinotubercle junction. There was no statisti cally significant relationship between imaging findings and positive clinical findings and severity of disease.

To be applicable as a tool for evaluating the moduli of normal and abnormal articular cartilage It would ne ed to be able to reliably measure elastic moduli of around 1MPa. This study i s designed to test the upper limit of elastic moduli that can be reliably measured using the Siemens S3000 elastography software Virtual touch Quantific ation (VTQ) and the new Virtual touch Image Quantification (VTIQ). Methods or Background: A series of aqueous gels were made with concentrations of gelatine ranging from 6% through to 18%. These gels were mechanically tested using an Instron to obtain a reference elastic modulus for each gel. The results were then compared with the m ean elastic moduli measured using both the VTQ and VTIQ software on the Siemens S3000 machine. The standard error of each set of readings was calculated. Results or Findings: We found that both the VTQ and VTIQ elastography settings were reliable at measuring a gel with an elastic modulus up to around 30kPa (10% gel) and VTIQ could measure the elastic moduli of gels up to 60kPa (14% gel). Higher concentration gels were not reliably estimated using either VTQ or VTIQ, however, but VTIQ performed bet ter and had a smaller standard error. Conclusion: The new VTIQ technology improved the range of elast ic moduli measured by the S3000 and has less measurement error than the VTQ software. Limitations: The limitations of this study include the potential for inhomogeneity in the gels, which may have added to measurement errors.

B. (Demir)*, ; Malatya/TR (nebedr@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the performance of Dixon magnetic reson ance imaging (MRI) sequences for the detection and assessment of active and chronic sacroiliitis compared with standard protocol. Methods or Background: Active and chronic sacroiliitis findings were evaluated in 107 patients on 3-T MRI, including T1- weighted (W) and T2W Dixon sequences. Signs of active sacroiliitis were evaluated on water-only T2W Dixon images by comparing with fat-saturated (F S) T2W images and signs of chronic sacroiliitis were evaluated on in- phase, out-phase and fat-only T1W-T2W Dixon images by comparing T1W images. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of bone marrow oedema and fat deposition were measured for quantitative assessment. Results or Findings: There were no statistically significant differences for the detection of bone marrow oedema, enthesitis and capsulitis between water- only T2W Dixon and FS T2W sequences (p 0.05) and for the detection of erosion, fat deposition, backfill and ankylosis bet ween T1-T2W Dixon and T1W sequences (p 0.05). SNRs and CNRs were significantly higher on T 2W Dixon for bone marrow oedema and fat deposition and also lower on T1W Dixon for fat deposition than the standard protocol (p 0.05). Conclusion: The single T2W Dixon sequence can be used instead o f the standard protocol for the diagnosis of active and c hronic sacroiliitis. Limitations: The study was planned as single centre and non-rand omised. Although the number of patients was sufficient, sta tistical comparison couldn't be made for some rare findings.

Dibenedetto\u00b9, M. has been introduced in order to overcome both the D XA and peripheral QUS limitations. REMS is the first radiation-free techn ique directly applied to the anatomical reference sites for osteoporosis diagnos is (spine and femur), the same sites investigated by the DXA. The aim of this study is to assess REMS state-of-the-art features and basic principles. Methods or Background: A review of the available literature was performed, including published papers, reviews and abstracts. Results or Findings: REMS has been recently included in the Italian ministerial guidelines to improve the diagnosis of osteoporosis in routine care. It is implemented in the EchoS device (Echolght SpA , Italy), and it is very easy to use. The echographic scan of L1-L4 lumbar vertebrae is performed by placing the transducer in a trans-abdominal positio n for 80 s. Similarly, femoral scans are performed by placing the transducer paral lel to the head-neck axis of the femur, in order to visualise the typical proxim al femur profile. This lasts 40 s and is guided by the software. REMS is able to automatically collect both the sequence of B-mode images and the related raw, unpr ocessed ultrasound signals that are automatically processed after the scan. This process allows it to retain the maximum information about the charact eristics of the investigated tissues, which are normally filtered out during the conventional process of B- mode image reconstruction. The bone health status i s assessed through the comparison of the analysed signal spectra with reference spectral models, and the BMD, T-Score and Z-Score values, together with the fragility score for bone quality assessment, are estimated. Conclusion: REMS is a valuable approach for fast and accurate e arly osteoporosis diagnosis and fracture risk assessment . Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Lian\u00b9, Y. has become the leading cause of cancer- related mortality worldwide, and predicting patient survival to provide better medical treatment can improve disease outcomes. Although cu rrent methods have produced accurate predictions, the majority of them are designed for specific datasets and cannot be easily adapted to other cases. In this study, we proposed a graph representation of CT images in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and used a graph convolutional neu ral network (GCN) model to predict overall survival in a multi-institutional dataset. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, a total of 558 patient s with lung cancer (stage II and III) were included. The dataset was randomly separated into a training set with 418 patients (18 2 survivors and 236 deaths), a validation set with 70 patients (26 survivors and 44 deaths), and a test set with 70 patients (26 survival and 44 deaths). The airways, lung lobes, and tumours were segmented automatically from the origi nal CT. Four critical parts of airway segments, five lung lobes, and tumours we re assigned as nodes in a graph, and were connected according to their struct ural relationships. A pre- trained convolutional network was used to produce nodes' features, followed by a principal component analysis. A three-layer GC N model was then trained to predict survival using the lung graph as input. We also trained a radiomics model using only tumour information as a comparison . The AUC values were reported, along with the Wilcoxon rank test. Results or Findings: The GCN models were significantly predictive of 5-y ear overall survival with an AUC of 0.7020 (p-value=0.02), compared to the radiomics feature predictor p-value=0. The proposed achieves state-of-the art pe rformance, outperforming conventional radiomics models in our study.

The purpose of this study is t o adapt this idea to the reading of unremarkable chest radiographs in radiol ogy. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included a consecutive series of unremarkable chest radiographs from a uni versity hospital (time period: Feb.-Apr., 2021). The PA views were process ed by a deep-neural- network (ResNet34). It detects ten findings such as pneumothorax and infiltrates with excellent sensitivity (AUROC > 0.9 for all finding categories). For training, a multi-center dataset of 205k chest radiographs had been used. In this study, (1) the proportion of radiographs co rrectly categorized as \"unremarkable\" was determined. (2) Time needed to r ead chest-X-rays in clinical routine was determined using time stamps f rom the Radiology- Information-System. (3) The time taken by two radio logy residents (PGY-3=R1 and PGY-5=R2) for single-click confirmation of the status \"unremarkable\", with AI-results available, was recorded and compared to step (2) with independent t-tests. Results or Findings: Of 150 unremarkable chest radiographs, 146 (97.3%) were correctly classified by the algorithm. With AI , R1 needed R2 needed 14.1s (SD: 13.2s) for status confirmation. Significantly more time was needed in clinical rout ine: 77s on average (SD: 46s, p<0.01 for both comparisons). Conclusion: Reliable identification of unremarkable chest radiographs with AI is feasible. A Batch-wise interpretation of those c ases seems to be time- efficient. Further research on the impact of a batc h-wise reading of pre-sorted chest-X-rays on report quality are needed. Limitations: Major limitations of this study are its single-cent re setting and limited number of readers.

De Grauw*\u00b9, B. Van Ginneken\u00b9, B. , E. (max.degrauw@radboudumc.nl) Purpose: Automating aspects of RECIST evaluation can save ti me and potentially reduce inter-observer variability. We t rained a 3D Universal Lesion Segmentation model (ULS) to estimate long and short axis diameters in CT exams based on a single click inside the lesion. Methods or Background: We used the nnUnet framework to train the ULS using 3213 lesions from 1481 studies collected from eight public challenge datasets. We fine-tuned the model using masks predi cted for lesions from a subset of the public DeepLesion dataset. A reader s tudy was conducted with 128 separate DeepLesion scans. Four radiologists ma nually measured long- and short-axis of lesions on axial CT slices and as sessed whether a lesion was eligible as target lesion. Results or Findings: For 85 out of 128 scans, all readers agreed that it contained a valid RECIST target lesion. For those l esions, the relative difference between the DeepLesion measurements and the radiologists was - 4.2% \u00b1 14.2 and -0.3% \u00b1 13.2, for the long and shor t axis respectively. For ULS these measures were 6% \u00b1 17 and -5.8% \u00b1 18.9. T he mean absolute differences were 2.5 \u00b1 3 mm and 1.9 \u00b1 2 mm for radi ologists. For ULS these measures were 4.1 \u00b1 5.8 mm and 2.8 \u00b1 2.7mm. For 78. 8% of lesions the absolute difference between DeepLesion and ULS meas urements fell within a standard deviation of the inter-radiologist variabi lity. Conclusion: Single-click measurement using ULS shows RECIST evaluation in circa 80% oncological CT exams. Limitations: This study used a small number of lesions in the test set, and readers measured long and short axis in all lesions , which is not required by RECIST.

Hamm, T. J. Vogl, T. Penzkofer, A. M. Bucher; Frankfurt/D E Purpose: Lung lobe segmentation in chest CT is relevant to a wide range of clinical applications. Proposed pipelines tend to b e vulnerable to perturbations and face performance degradation on external data s ets. Therefore, we systematically analysed the combination of novel machine learning techniques (self-supervision (SSL), data augmentation (DA), at tention (A)) to improve generalisability. Methods or Background: We analysed three techniques (SSL, DA, A) to train a fast and fully-automated lung lobe segmentation m odel based on U-Net and specifically collect an in-house dataset that cover s a wide range of challenging cases. As part of the RACOON project it contains 100 CT chest scans of patients with bacterial, viral or covid infection ( 25, 25, 50). Furthermore, we evaluated common external datasets (LUNA, IEEE). Th e segmentation results of our method are compared to a baseline U-Net model, trained on the same dataset and a publicly available state of the art s egmentation pipeline (SOTA). Results or Findings: Our model improves the baseline (Dice-Score of 92.8% vs 82.3%, p<0.001) and achieves state of 92.8% vs 90.8% for SOTA, p=0.102) while using less training examples (69 vs. 231) and a leaner neural network model (4.1 + 2 s per scan). The performance varied among the different techniques (SSL: 0.841, DA: 0.878, A: 0.842). The usage of DA with expert knowledge showed the bigges t impact on performance (+0.056 Dice-score). Conclusion: The considered design choices manage to improve segmentation accuracy on diverse datasets without an increased c omputational overhead. They are not specific to lobe segmentation and can be further integrated in other medical imaging segmentation tasks. Limitations: Our approach should undergo further multicentric validation. Ethics committee approval: IRB approval for this multicentre study was obtained. Funding for this study: RACOON is funded by the network of university medicine (BMBF grant-number: 01KX2021).

Baudot, *C. M. Voyton*, D. Francis, A. Baili-Lay a, V. Liu, A. Iannessi, B. Huet; Valbonne/FR (charles.voyton@mediantechnologies.com) Purpose: Lung cancer screening has gained adoption worldwide following the success of the NLST and NELSON trials, although wit h the guidelines and tools currently available the number of indeterminate nodules and unnecessary scans endangers patient enrollment and the economic viability of screening programmes. We present the development and verification of a machine learning based computer aided diagnostic device (CA Dx) designed to characterise pulmonary nodules in lung cancer scree ning patients. Methods or Background: The malignancy prediction algorithm was trained on 1,224 patients from the NLST dataset with 11,392 no dules annotated by radiologists in a multi-read approach. Reference st andard data for the nodules were based on histology for cancerous findings and on stable patient follow-up (>12 months) for benign findings. The verification set contained 472 patients (330 benign, 142 cancerous) with 4,716 nodules. Results or Findings: The developed AI a specificity of 90%. When used for management of a screening popula tion similar to the NLST population, assuming the same performance, thi s algorithm could help reduce unnecessary scans and missed cancers by 57% and 67% respectively compared to using Lung-RADS to inform patient management. Conclusion: The algorithm demonstrates robust performance for t he characterisation of pulmonary nodules already detec ted by radiologists. When deployed in a screening program, high performant characterisation tools stand to drastically improve patient management. With suc h AI tools, unnecessary scans and invasive procedures, and missed cancers w ill be decreased, which is critical if patient adherence and screening adoption is to increase to numbers like those of the successful screening efforts in prostate and breast cancer. Limitations: This study includes only parenchymal solid or part solid lesions, with biased imbalance due to partial non-cancer pat ient sampling.

Jungblut*\u00b9, C. Bl\u00fcthgen\u00b9, M. Polacin\u00b9, \u00b9Zurich/CH, \u00b2Forchheim/DE Purpose: To evaluate the image quality and performance of an artificial- intelligence (AI)-based computer aided detection (C AD) system in photon- counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) for pulmonary nodule evaluation at different low dose levels. Methods or Background: An anthropomorphic chest-phantom containing 14 pulmonary nodules of different sizes was imaged on a PCD-CT and on a conventional energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT ). Scans were performed with each the three vendor-specific scanning-mod es (QuantumPlus [Q+], Quantum [Q] and High Resolution [HR]) at decreasing matched radiation dose levels by adapting image quality (IQ) levels. Image noise was measured manually in the subcutaneous fat at eight different locations. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two readers in consensus. Nodule detection and volumetry were performed using a commercially avail able AI-CAD system. Results or Findings: Subjective image quality was superior in PCD-CT compared to EID-CT (p<0.001) and objective image noise was similar in the Q+ and Q mode (p>0.05) and superior in the HR mode (p=0.01). Overall, the AI-CAD-system delivered comparable results for lung nodule detection and volumetry between PCD- and dose matched EID-CT (p=0.08-1.00), with a mean sensitivity of 95% for PCD-CT and of 86% for d ose matched EID-CT. The HR-mode showed a sensitivity of 100% with a fal se positive rate of 1 even at the lowest evaluated dose level (IQ5; CDTI vol 0.41 mGy). Conclusion: matched EID-CT in subje ctive image quality while showing lower objective image noise by comparison. Fully automatized AI-aided nodule detection and volumetry are feasible in PCD-CT, but attention has to be paid to false positive find ings. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Methods or Background: A Deep Neural Network (DenseNet121, trained on MIMIC-CXR and NIH datasets) was used to select 100 cases with a high suspicion of (typical) chest pathology and 100 cases supposedly without pathological findings, derived from a dataset of 24 ,829 frontal-view chest X-ray images acquired at our hospital. A baseline (random mix) and stratified worklist were created, both consisting of 50 \"normal\" and 50 \"abnormal\" CXR images. Two radiologists independently reported on the two worklists in a simulated radiology reading environment while being blinded f or the AI findings. The overall and per-case reading times were measured an d compared. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 254 Results or Findings: For the mixed baseline worklist the averaged total reading time was 87min 7s, with an averaged per-cas e reading time of 52s. For the worklist stratified by AI the averaged total reading time was 67min 48s, with a per-case reading time of 41s. An overall rea ding time reduction of 22,1% was found using the stratified worklist. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence can be used to positively i mpact the reporting workflow. We demonstrated how increased r eporting efficiency can be achieved through stratification of the worklist into \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" cases, leading to reduced reporting times. Limitations: This is a proof of concept. To evaluate if this tim e reduction will hold, a larger number of imaging studies with different ratios in normal/abnormal exams is needed, while being read by radiologists of different expertise levels.

Purpose: Chest y for diagnosing thoracic pathologies. Diagnostic accuracy may be dr astically reduced due to technical limitations resulting in poor image quali ty and thus leading to incorrect diagnosis. Methods or Background: We collected 6955 frontal and lateral Chest X-rays (CXRs), performed in the supine or standing position, labelled by 7 radiologists from the radiology department of Cochin University hospital (AP-HP, Paris, France). Frontal CXR quality criteria included full anatomical coverage, lack of rotation or scapula projection, deep inspiration an d optimal exposure. Lateral CXR quality criteria included full anatomical cover age, lack of rotation and lack of superimposition by the arms. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify CXRs as technically correct or incorrect. The model predictions were compared to a ground truth set of 1000 CXR, labelled by two chest radiology experts. Results or Findings: There were no significant differences regarding age, sex, and classification for each criterion between the test, validation and training datasets (p>0,05). We first evaluated the inter-rater reliability and found good correlation for each criterion (Cohen's kappa > 0,6). The model performance was evaluated and compared to that of e ach observer with expert annotation as ground truth. The model performance w as close to the radiologists' performance, (accuracies 80-90% compa red to 83-95% for radiologists) except for the rotation criteria. Conclusion: The trained model to detect quality-deficient CXRs could be used by technologists in real-time to ensure high-qualit y images.

Hertgers*\u00b9, K. Hergaarden\u00b9, S. Renisch\u00b2, Purpose: To evaluate the usability of uncertainty computed f rom an AI model for automated diagnostic image quality verification. Methods or Background: We trained a neural network model that outputs both pneumothorax status of chest radiographs (CXRs ) and the uncertainty associated with this classification. The model was trained in two stages. During the first stage we used solely the outputs produced by the model predictions branch and optimized their accuracy using the cross -entropy loss. Consequently, we optimized both the model prediction output, as well as the model uncertainty output using the (Kendall and Gal , NeuIPS 2017) loss function. The model training was done using the publicly available NIH CXR dataset. We validated the model uncertainty results using a dataset of 599 representative CXRs from the PACS system of our aca demic hospital over the period of two years. Two resident radiologists anno tated pneumothorax status (present, not present, uncertain, unable to assess) and image quality (insufficient, moderately sufficient, sufficient). In the study we considered that a CXR is of insufficient diagnostic quality when both annotators marked its pneumothorax status as uncertain or unable to asses s and image quality insufficient or moderately sufficient. In total, 55 out of the 599 CXRs were of insufficient diagnostic quality. Results or Findings: We used the area under the curve to validate whethe r the uncertainty estimated by the AI model assigns higher uncertainty scores to the 55 scans of insufficient diagnostic image quali ty. We obtained an AUC score of 0.964 with estimated 95% confidence interv al of [0.949-0.977]. Conclusion: The uncertainty score of our pneumothorax model is a strong predictor for annotator confidence. AI model uncert ainty can identify CXRs with insufficient diagnostic quality. Limitations: Single-site validation was a limiting factor in thi s study.

Lamb: Nothing to disclose RPS 1305-11 Impact of a content-based image retrieval system on the interpretation of chest CTs of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease *S. R\u00f6hrich*, B. H. image systems (CBIRS) are a relatively new and potentially impactful tool for radiological reporting, but their clinical evaluation is largely missing. This study aimed at assessing the impact of CBIRS on the interpretation of chest CT scans from patients with suspected diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). Methods or Background: Eight radiologists (four residents, four attending, median years reading chest CT scans 2.1\u00b10.7 and 12\u00b1 1.8, respectively) created 430 reports from 100 chest CT scans with 22 unique, clinically- and histopathologically-verified diagnoses. Reporting w as done at a radiological workstation to simulate clinical routine. 216 repor ts were done without CBIRS and 214 with the additional support of the CBIRS. Results or Findings: Reading time decreased by 31.3% (p<0.001) despite t he radiologists searching for additional information m ore frequently when the CBIRS was available (154 [72%] vs. 95 [43%]). There was also a trend towards higher overall diagnostic accuracy (42.2% v s 34.7%, p=0.083) when the CBIRS was available. Conclusion: Summarized, the CBIRS' impact on the interpretation of chest CT scans from patients with DPLD included significant improvements in reading time despite increased engagement with informational resources. Results also show a trend towards increased diagnostic accuracy. Limitations: No clinical data or previous examinations were avai lable to the participants. As we encountered delays as a result of the ongoing SARS-CoV- 2 pandemic, time between the two phases ranged from 9 and 15 months for individual participants. Thus, increasing experienc e between phases constitutes a potential bias. However, the results for radiology residents and attending radiologists were similar, even though the latter had a markedly less pronounced relative increase in years of professional experience and finished reports.

Johri\u00b9, detection (CAD) algorithm on radiologists' accuracy for pulmonary nodules in thoracic CTs when using CAD as concurrent 1st reader (Mode-1) and 2nd reader (Mode-2). Methods or Background: A dual-arm MRMC study included 232 retrospectively collected multivendor chest CTs from screening and diagnostic examinations. 20 radiologists reviewed all cases tw ice with one-month washout, randomly doing either Mode-1 followed by \" non-aided + Mode-2\" or vice versa. Readers were asked to identify solid, part-solid and ground-glass nodules in the range of 3 mm to 30 mm. The consolid ated marks, blinded to their source, were then reviewed independently by f ive expert thoracic radiologists. The reference standard was determined following final adjudication by an expert thoracic radiologist. AUC s at lobe level, sensitivities at nodule level and specificities at lobe level wer e computed for unaided- reader, Mode-1 and Mode-2. Results or Findings: 268 nodules (182 solid) were identified in 130 cases (202 lobes). The lobe-level AUCs were (95% [-0.041,-0.013]). (standard-deviation) false positive rates were 0.44 (1.04), 0.55 (1.13) and 0.65 (1.34), changing by CAD either as concurrent first reade r or second reader significantly improved readers' accuracy in detecting solid, part-solid and ground-glass nodules with a very small increase in false positives.

CUP patients only receive empir ical treatment, and until a definitive diagnosis could possibly be reached, the prognosis remains poor. We aimed to use AI-based methods to non-invasively dis tinguish between primary and metastatic lesions based on their morphology, i n a pan-cancer setting. Methods or Background: Lesion segmentation and radiomic feature extraction were performed on baseline CT scans from two cohorts. Cohort A consisted of 1630 routine cancer patients (n=11227 lesions) with a histopathologically-proven diagnosis. This cohort w as divided into a training/finetuning set (80%, 9050 lesions) and an unseen independent validation set (20%, 2177 lesions) to evaluate the model performance on unseen data. For further validation, Cohort B was f ormed of real-world CUP patients (n=74 patients, 303 lesions) who later rec eived a definitive diagnosis. We explored different machine learning classifiers and hyperparameters on the training set and validated separately on the unseen data from Cohorts A and B. Results or Findings: AI algorithms were able to distinguish between prim ary and metastatic lesions across all tumour types both in the unseen routine cohort (AUC=0.93, 95%-CI=0.91-0.95, p<0.001) and in the real-world CUP cohort (AUC=0.82, We could also colorectal lesions (AUC=0.69, in our cohorts. Conclusion: AI-detected quantitative morphological differences between primary and metastatic lesions and between different tumour types may help non-invasively diagnose the primary tumour in patie nts with CUP, facilitating more efficient treatment strategies.

Methods or Background: 57 patients (25f) with advanced melanoma underwent PET/CT and PET/MRI on the same day. Two blinded readers evaluated independently the CT and MRI (T1VIBE, DWI , T2HASTE) scans. A third blinded reader analysed both PET/CT and PET/MRI including pre- and follow-up examinations to define a reference standard. Results or Findings: All patients had confirmed metastases. Among these, comparison of lesion-based detection rates revealed higher sensitivity of CT for lung (0.90 vs. 0.68) and abdominal lesions (0.89 vs . 0.77), whereas MRI showed higher or equal specificity (0.93 vs. 0.86 and 0.88 vs. 0.88). MRI was superior in the detection of bone metastases regard ing both sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.61) and specificity (0.93 vs. 0.88). For lymp h nodes and soft tissue metastases, comparable sensitivity resulted from CT and MRI analysis (0.88), but specificity was higher for CT (0.76). Conclusion: WB MRI could serve as an alternative to CT with com parable specificity for lung and abdominal metastases and equal diagnostic accuracy for bone and lymph node metastases. Advanced MR-tec hniques of the lung might increase the sensitivity for lung metastases. Limitations: Overall inter-reader reliability was good, but disagreements in detection rate between the 2 readers analysing CT and MRI scans appeared most of all for lymph nodes and soft tissue lesions .

Winkelmann*, V. Blumenberg, V. receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy with patient-derived T cells against tumor cells are approved for relaps ed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Anti-tumour activity differs from conventional treatment strategies or even checkpoint blockade wi th so far undefined response patterns. We assessed volumetric tumour bu rden 30 days after transfusion to identify early predictors of respons e at 3 months as well as progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods or Background: Consecutive r/r DLBCL patients with CT imaging at baseline (BL), CT at 30 days (FU1) and PET/CT at 3 months (FU2) after CAR T-cell transfusion were selected. For all patients, up to 6 target lesions were 3D-segmented using Mint Lesion at all time points. The sum of target lesion volume (STLV) was used to represent tumour burden. Percent change in STLV indicated depth or response (DoR). The prognostic v alue of DoR-FU1 was tested for treatment response at 3 months and for s tratification of PFS and OS. Results or Findings: 26 patients were included (median age: 62 years, 58% male) with median BL-STLV of 84.6 ml. A positive correlation between DoR- FU1 and DoR-FU2 was observed (r=0.87; p<0.05). For patients with DoR 50% in FU1, no significant differences in PFS or OS were detected (p=0.60 and p=0.34). OS was numerically longer in patients with DoR 50% in FU1. Conclusion: An early reduction in tumour burden at FU1 after CA R-T cell therapy showed a good correlation with the DoR-FU2. Conventional end points at early interim staging have limited prognostic value regarding OS. Future studies may explore the value of radiomic analysis as early response markers. Limitations: Since CAR T-cells represent a new form of therapy, there is a lack of data on long-term follow-up. Ethics committee approval: Ethical committee approval was obtained.

H. Cha*, N. Y. Han, K-W. Kang, Y. Cho, D. J. Su ng, B. J. Park, K. C. Sim, Y. E. Han; Seoul/KR (seunghacha@gmail.com) Purpose: To residual CT masses (PnRCM) can predict relapse-free survival (RFS) in lymphoma patients showing complete metabolic response (CMR) after first line chemotherapy. Methods or Background: A total of 247 patients who showed CMR after completion of first line chemotherapy for PET-avid lymphomas were recruited. Patients with PnRCM were selected in accordance wit h the Lugano criteria and 3-D segmentation was done on contrast-enhanced CT. Radiomics features for masses were extracted and radiomics scores were constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) a nalysis. Cox regression was performed with radiomics and clinical parameter s (IPI score, sex, lymphoma aggressiveness, and transplantation histor y). The efficiency of the model was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Results or Findings: Among the patients included, 76 patients (30.1%) ha d PnRCM. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients w ith PnRCM had significantly shorter RFS (p=0.009) than those with out PnRCM. In Kaplan- Meier analysis using the cut-off value generated by maximally selected rank statistics, the high radiomics score group showed s ignificantly shorter RFS (p=0.0016). In the Cox regression test, radiomics s core (hazard ratio [HR]=3.01; p=0.002), IPI score (HR=2.00; p=0.13) and transplantation history (HR=2.46; p=0.075) were related factors for RFS. Th e combined model and radiomics model showed an AUC of 0.80 and 0.74 respectively, in estimating RFS. Conclusion: The combined model that incorporated both clinical parameters and CT based radiomics score showed good prognostic efficacy in lymphoma patients with PnRCM. Limitations: The predictive model was not validated with a separ ate test set due to the limitations of a small study group.

There is a statistical dependence between the radiological variable and the haematological one only in Pz in either cle ar remission or progression of the disease (the Fisher exact test statistic val ue is 0.0964, p<0,1). There is statistical independence in radiologically doubtful subjects (Fisher exact test statistic value is 0.09285, p < 0.10,p<0.05, p<0,01 ). Conclusion: Having a subgroup of Pz with an outcome, some hypot heses can be advanced: first, the \"probably in remission\" Pz v alue (VPP) than MCF; second, that WB-MR could be more sensitive than MFC in the early diagnosis of disease recurrence. The panoramic view, the addi tion of functional data to the morphological data (DWI) of the WB-MRI go well with the intrinsically heterogeneous character of multiple myeloma: heterogeneous for spatially and also temporally differentiated localisations. Limitations: The study was limited by the size of the patients s ample and its status as a pilot study. Ethics committee approval: Consent to the execution of the study was requested from the ethics committee of the hospital ASST \"Spedali Civili\" in Brescia, which gave a favourable opinion.

Tore*, A. Depaoli, O. Rampado, C. Guarnaccia, A . the first-choice imaging technique in patients with suspected plasma cell di sorder (PCD) to assess the presence of osteolytic lesions. We investigated the performances of an optimised protocol, evaluating diagnostic accuracy and patient effective dose reduction with a latest generation scanner. Methods or Background: Retrospective study on 212 patients with PCD performed on a 256-rows CT scanner. First WBLDCT ex aminations were performed using a reference protocol with acquisiti on parameters obtained from the literature. A phantom study was performed for protocol optimisation for subsequent exams to minimise dose while maintai ning optimal diagnostic accuracy. Images were evaluated by three readers fo r image quality and to detect lesions. Effective doses (E) were evaluated for each patient considering the patient dimensions and tube current modulation. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 257 Results or Findings: A very good image quality was observed for both protocols by all readers with a good agreement at r epeated measures ANOVA test (p>0.05). An excellent inter-rater agreement f or lesion detection was achieved obtaining high values of Fleiss' kappa for all districts considered (p<0.001). The optimised protocol resulted in a 56% reduction of median DLP (151 mGycm vs 345 mGycm,), of 60% of CTDIvol, (2.2 mGy vs 0.9 mGy). The median E was 2.6 mSv for standard protocol and 1.5 mSv for the optimised one. Dose reduction was statistically significant w ith p<0.001. Conclusion: Protocol optimisation makes ultra low dose WBLDCT f easible on latest generation CT scanners for patients with PCD with effective doses inferior to conventional skeletal survey while maintaining excellent image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Dose reduction is crucial in such patients as they are likely to undergo multiple WBLDCT during f ollow-up. Limitations: This study was limited by its monocentric nature.

Methods or Background: 44 patients who received examinations on three different DECT scanner types during cancer follow-up between 01/2016 and 09/2020 were included. The scanner types were a dual-source (dsDECT), a rapid DECT (dlDECT). Patients with interval increase/newly developed dis ease between examinations were excluded. Iodine concentrations were obtained ROI-based in the liver, pancreas, kidney, aorta, portal vein, muscle, gallbladder, and retroperitoneal fat. Absolute iodine concentration (IC) and three different normalised iodine concentrations were included: NIC(aa): NIC(all): normalised to overall iodine load. IC and NIC were compared between scanner types and median inter-scanner variability was calculated. Results or Findings: IC was significantly different between scanner type s in all tissues except for the kidneys and the aorta. T he median inter-scanner variability of IC was highest the approach that decreased inter-scanner variability of the pancreas and kidneys for all inter-scanner comparisons, whereas for the liver, normalisation only was partly mitigated by normalisation, yet variability in the liver remained on a high level. Large-scale studies validating iodine concentration as a longitudinal DECT imaging biomarker in a multivendor setting should be encouraged. Limitations: The small, retrospective sample was identified as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: Consent was waived by the IRB.

S. Brendlin*, H. Almansour, S. Afat; T\u00fcbingen/D E Purpose: To investigate to which extent simulated low-dose C T data sets resemble their real-dose counterparts. Methods or Background: At 120 and 80 kV, fourteen veterinarian-sedated alive pigs were scanned with the same 3rd generation dual-source scanner at 300 mAs (100%), and with mAs reduced to 50%, 25%, 1 0%, and 5%. Additional data sets at 50%, 25%, 10%, and 5% were simulated from the 100% images. Weighted filtered back projection (wFBP) was used for reconstructions. Objective image quality (Hounsfiel d units stability, noise, signal-to-noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio) was a nalysed by topographically matched regions of interest (ROIs) using ANOVA. A s tructural similarity index (SSIM) quantified the voxel-wise similarity of the volume histograms. Five blinded readers independently rated subjective over all image quality using a 5- point-Likert scale (1 = poor to 5 = excellent). An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to quantify agreement. Results or Findings: Image quality was stable down to 25% mAs in both kV groups, but image noise was overestimated at 10% an d below in the simulations. Datasets 25% mAs had a structural similarity of 96 \u00b1 2% to their real dose counterparts. Subjective image quality correlated almost perfectly (ICC0.89, p<0.001) in real vs. simulated datasets acros s all readers. Conclusion: Simulated low dose CT datasets are subjectively and objectively indistinguishable from their real-dose counterparts down to 25% mAs, making them an invaluable tool to highlight the effects of radiation dose reduction on image quality in this range safely. Limitations: First, we performed an animal study to avoid increased radiation exposure in humans. Second, we used wFBP to rule out confounding factors. A confirmation study using more modern reconstructi on methods might be helpful. Lastly, this study was performed on a high-end 3rd generation dual- source CT scanner, so generalisability may be limit ed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the IRB. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Bette, *J. A. Decker*, P. Wo nicki, J. Becker, F. Risch, C. Wollny, Kroencke, Purpose: To identify the keV-settings for the detect ion of hypovascularized liver metastases using virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) reconstructions novel photon-count ing detector CT (PCD- CT). Methods or Background: 20 consecutive patients with hypovascularized liver metastases who had undergone CT of the abdomen in p ortalvenous phase on a PCD-CT were retrospectively identified. VMI-reconstructions were performed at different keV levels (40-190 keV). Regions of interest were placed in liver metastases and liver parenchyma and in defined anat omical regions (e.g. aorta, portal vein). Mean and standard deviation of CT values (HU) were reported. Radiation dose (CTDI), image noise, tumor -to-liver ratio and contrast- to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Subgroup analys es for patients with higher and lower BMI values were performed. Results or Findings: Image noise was significantly higher at keV levels 70 keV (P<0.001). Tumor-to-liver ratio was significant ly lower at lower keV levels ( 70 keV) (P<0.001), resulting in better demarcation of the metastases. CNR was significantly higher at lower keV levels ( 70 keV) (P<0.001). The highest CNR was observed at 40 keV. Patients with lower BMI values (<24.8) showed significantly lower tumor-to-liver ratios and signi ficantly higher CNR's (P>0.001). Noise was BMI values. CTDI was 8.51 (\u00b13.93) mGy and significantly higher in patients with higher BMI values (24.8) than in patients with lower BMI values (P=0.0 07). Conclusion: These first experiences with VMIs on a novel PCD-CT strongly suggest improved delineation of hypovascularized li ver metastases at lower keV levels ( 70 keV), regardless of BMI. Whether this translates into overall improved diagnostic accuracy is currently under inv estigation. Limitations: This study was limited by a small cohort and its st atus as a retrospective single-centre study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Tore, Fonio; Asti/IT (DCE) whole-liver CT perfusion protocol with acceptable r adiation doses in patients with metastatic cancer on a latest generation wide detector CT scanner. Methods or Background: Prospective monocentric study on 25 consecutive patients with liver metastases. Exams were acquired on a 256-rows CT scanner (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). The protocol consisted in an unenhanced upper abdomen acquisition followed by a free-breathing DCE study after injecting 50 ml of contrast with serial low-dose axial acquisitions on the upper abdomen (gantry rotation time 0.28 s, 256 x 0.625 mm collimation, 80 kV, 270 mA, total scan time 230 seconds). The st udy was completed with a helical thoraco-abdominal acquisition after injecti ng 50 ml of contrast. 36 standard quadruple-phase CT exams with thoraco-abdominal portal-phase acquisition were considered as a control group. Radiation dose was evaluated with total dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED), considering k (mSv/mGycm) 0.014 for ( 26\u00b14,24 26,8\u00b14,28 kg/m2, p=0,44). Radiation dose was not si gnificantly different as mean DLP for DCE exams was and 20.5\u00b13,58 mSv i n DCE group and 23.03\u00b16.55 in control group (p=0.11). There were no significant differences in the volume of contrast infused (100 ml vs 105\u00b117,2, p=0,052). Conclusion: Latest generation CT scanners allow DCE liver CT perfusion imaging with radiation doses comparable to standard quadruple-phase CT scans. Limitations: This study was limited by its status as a prelimina ry study on a limited patient population. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the ethics committee.

Sipos*\u00b9, T. medical images, radiographers get i n close contact with patients, therefore they are exposed to possible infection by COVID-19. Methods or Background: Cross-sectional, descriptive study was carried out by purposeful, non-random sampling. We used the email addresses of nearly 3,500 radiographers registered at the Society of Hungarian Radiographers. Effort-Reward Imbalance, Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaires with our self-designed questionnaire were available from Jan uary 2021 to March 2021. Descriptive statistics, two-sample t-test, ANOVA Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed at 95% probabili ty level. Results or Findings: 439 responses were included in the statistical anal ysis, mean age 42.01 (SD=10.90) years. Male respondent (t =2.42; p 0.05) between 20-29 and 30-39 years (F=2.81; p 0.05) working in the healthcare system for 1-9 and 10-19 years (F=8.67; p 0.05), who were in quarantine during COVID- 19 pandemic had significantly higher stress values. Male respondents (t=6.86; p0.05; t=5.23; p 0.05), radiographers age (F=17.19; p 0.05; F=8.30; p 0.05), working in the healthcare system for 1-9; 10-19 years (F=18.30; p 0.05; F=6.58; p 0.05), who have been examining confirmed COVID-19 infected (t=3.93; p 0.05; t=2.08; p 0.05) or COVID-19 suspected patient (t=2.02; p 0.05; t=5.62 p 0.05) and also worked at the emergency departments (t=4.48; p 0.05; t=4.77; p 0.05) tend to be more attached by depersonalisation and emotional exhaust ion. Being in quarantine raised emotional exhaustion (t=2.11; p 0.05) and lowered personal achievement values significantly (t=-3.79; p 0.05). Conclusion: Male radiographers below 40 years of age working in the healthcare system less than 20 years at the emergency departments are exposed to depersonalisation and emotional exhausti on. Examinations of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients and quara ntine obligations also negatively affected emotional exhaustion level.

Skelton*, G. Harrison, M. Rutherford, S. Purpose: To explore obstetric sonographers' experiences of p erforming pregnancy ultrasound scans during the pandemic, and to assess the impact on burnout, role satisfaction and clinical practice. Methods or Background: An online, anonymous cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of obstetric sonographers (n=89, 96% female, 49% in full- time NHS employment) was completed using the Oldenb urg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) to evaluate burnout, CORE-10 to measure psyc hological distress, with additional questions to capture sonographers' exper iences. Parametric statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. Results or Findings: Of those who completed the OLBI, 92% and 91% met the burnout thresholds for exhaustion and disengagement, respectively. Sonographers with higher total OLBI scores perceive d that Covid-19 had a greater, negative impact on their practice (p<0.05) . The mean CORE-10 score of 14.49 (SD7.99) suggests mild psychological distr ess of respondents. A significant decrease in role satisfaction was repor ted from before to during the pandemic (p<0.001), associated with higher OLBI and CORE-10 scores (p<0.001). Change in role satisfaction was signific antly correlated with sonographers' perception of safety the pandemic (R2=0.148, p<0.001). Sixty-five sonographers (73%) responded positively to considering leaving the profession, changing their area of practice or working hours within 5 years. Conclusion: Job-specific interventions are required to mitigate sonographer burnout and its consequences on workforce shortages and service provision beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. Limitations: Participants self-selected and self-reported which may skew the results. Conclusions of causality cannot be drawn because of the cross- sectional design. Results cannot be widely generali sed because of Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 259 convenience sampling and due to the homogeneity of participant characteristics.

O'Donoghue*\u00b9, N. Moore\u00b9, L. A. Walton\u00b2, imaging and radiation female-dominated professions. During the Covid-19 pandemic, MIRT aca demics continued to teach academically and clinically while leading res earch. Whilst systematic reviews evaluated the impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers, the gendered effects on MIRT academics is unknown. This work aims to determine the gendered impact of the pandemic on the physical and mental health of MIRT academics and researchers. Methods or Background: A mixed-methods electronic survey was designed on Qualtrics in English and distributed via email and online platforms to radiography academics and researchers around the wo rld. The survey was divided into four sections: demographics, the CORE10 questionnaire for evaluating mental health, and questionnaires for physical health and general well-being assessment. The survey was open between March and May 2021. Quantitative analysis was carried out using SPSS. Results or Findings: The survey reached 32 countries and 412 participant s; 24.5% were male (n=97) and 76.5% were female (n=315). Females reported worse sleep quality than males and a much lower preference for remote work. A higher percentage of males (73% versus 40.5% of f emales) reported reduced outdoors activities. The CORE10-questionnai re found that 10.3% of males and 2.7% of females experienced severe psychological distress the week immediately before the survey was conducted. Conclusion: The study has identified gender differences in the impact of Covid-19 on the mental and physical health of MIRT academics. However, males and females have experienced notable deterior ation in health and well- being due to the pandemic. Limitations: Due to social distancing and lockdowns, it was not possible to carry out face-to-face focus groups or interviews, which may have been beneficial for the study.

Roletto*\u00b9, M. Zanardo\u00b9, A. ilanese/IT Purpose: To evaluate the impact of the first two waves of th e COVID-19 pandemic on the radiology department of a universit y hospital in Northern Italy. Methods or Background: The numbers of all radiological exams performed at the radiology department of a university hospital f rom March 2019 to March 2021 were collected and compared, subdividing them according to time periods, imaging modality, and setting. Results or Findings: Comparing the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to February 2021) with the previous 12 months (March 2019 to February 2020), there was an overall 26% decrease in examinations (from 127,998 to 94,550). The most affected modalit y was dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (from 4,706 to -36%), radiography (from 6 6,050 to 47,374, -28%), and magnetic resonance imaging (from 13,332 to 10,140, -24%). Volume surges were observed for standard chest x-ray (CXR) in out patients (from 3,032 to 7,536, +131%), in (from 11,317 to 11,823, +4%). Further subanalysis according to pandemic waves highlighted an overall 65% decrease of radiological examination during the first wave (Mar ch to May 2020), curtailed to only -3% during the June-October 2020 period, then reaching -23% during the second wave (November 2020 to February 2021). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a marked decrease in radiological examinations during the first two pand emic waves, limited to -26% by a relatively increased activity during the inter -wave period and by the implementation of safety protocols during the secon d wave.

Diagnostic radiographers have been on the frontline, dealing with an unprecedented situation. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of diagnostic radiographers working during the pandemic. Methods or Background: This study used an interpretative phenomenological approach to explore the experiences of diagnostic r adiographers using virtual focus groups as a method of data collection. Results or Findings: Data was analysed independently by four researchers and five themes emerged from the data. Adapting to new ways of working, feelings and emotions, support mechanisms, self-protection and resilience, and professional recognition. Conclusion: The adaptability of radiographers came across strongly in this study. Anxieties attributed to the provision of PPE , fear of contracting the virus and spreading it to family members were evident. Th e resilience of radiographers working throughout this pandemic came across strongly throughout this study. A significant factor for coping has been peer support from colleagues within the workplace. The study highlighted the lack of understanding of the role of the radiographer and h ow the profession is perceived by other health care professionals.

The survey investigated RSM demographics, of radiographers, imaging modalities and sub- Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 260 specialties managed, the effects of the pandemic on the diagnostic imaging workflow (including the number of radiographers who tested positive for SARS- CoV-2), and any subsequent reorganisation of their services (including the timeframe of partial/total suspensions of activities). Results or Findings: Twenty (52%) RSM from different Italian regions completed the questionnaire. Overall, 70% of respondents reported that more than 50% of radiographers of their service had at l east a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the investigated period. 70% of respondents had implemented service reorganisations in terms of space, equipment, and pathways dedicated to COVID-19-infected patients. Changes in exam sche duling and tailored extensions of the allocated time-per-exam were reported by 90% of respondents. All respondents reported a suspension of activity in at least one imaging modality or sub-specialty, dual-energy x-ra y absorptiometry (55%) and breast modalities (50%) were the most impac ted areas. Conclusion: Among the 20 diagnostic imaging services across Italy whose RSMs answered this survey, 70% had high rates of ra diographers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent a workflow reorganisation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% reporting changes in exam sc hedules to allow room and equipment disinfection.

Pradella; Florence/IT RPS 1403-2 Background phase correction in compressed g 4D flow *G. Reiter*\u00b9, correction is considered to be an important preprocessing step in cardiac magnetic resonance four-dimensional (4D) flow imaging improving the precision of flow volume meas urements and \"mass conservation\" comparisons. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if background phase correction in compr essed sensing (CS) 4D flow imaging has similar impact on derived aortic and pulmonary flow volumes as in conventional 4D flow imaging. Methods or Background: 27 prospectively recruited cardiac patients without known or suspected shunts underwent 3T (Magnetom Sk yra, Siemens Healthcare), ECG- and navigator-gated whole-heart 4D flow imaging with and without CS employing a prototype sequence, retrospectively. Repetition/echo times as well as resolution were matched in the 4D flow protocols. For both data sets, aortic (Qa) and pulmonary (Qp) net flow volumes with and without stationary-tissue-mask-based background phase correction were evaluated using prototype software (4D Flow, Siemens Healthca re). Relationships between results were investigated by correlation an alysis; means were compared employing t-test. Results or Findings: Background phase correction improved the correlation between Qa and Qp from r=0.96 to r=0.98 for convent ional and from r=0.95 to r=0.97 for CS 4D flow. All flow volumes decreased a pplying background phase correction (Qa: 77\u00b122 ml vs. 72\u00b120 ml, for CS flow; p<0.0001 in all cases). Aortic and pulmonary non-corrected-to- corrected flow volume differences correlated strongly between conventional and CS 4D flow imaging (r=0.94 in both cases). Conclusion: Background phase correction behaves similarly in co nventional and CS 4D flow imaging. Therefore, its application can be recommended also for CS 4D flow imaging. Limitations: Flow volumes were only checked by mass conservation. Ethics committee approval: Approval was obtained.

Purpose: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterised by an elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). There is a piec ewise linear relationship between mPAP and the duration of vortical blood flow along the main pulmonary artery as visualised by magnetic resonanc e four-dimensional phase-contrast imaging (4D-flow MRI). The aim of th is study was to investigate the accuracy of an automated PH-related vortex detection method to non- invasively diagnose PH and estimate elevated mPAP. Methods or Background: 32 subjects with known or suspected PH (male/female 7/25; age 62\u00b115 years) and regular hea rt rhythm underwent right heart catheterisation (RHC) and 4D-flow MRI of the main pulmonary artery at 3T. Pre-processing of velocity data was performed by prototype software (4DFlow, Siemens Healthcare). Automated detection a nd tracking of the PH- related vortex and mPAP estimation were performed by in-house software. The relationship between estimated mPAP and mPAP measur ed by RHC was analysed by correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. The diagnostic Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 261 performance of automated mPAP estimation was invest igated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results or Findings: PH was diagnosed by RHC in 19 subjects. The area under the curve for PH diagnosis from automated mPA P estimation was 1.00 [0.89,1.00]. The cut-off mPAP=20 mmHg resulted in a 1.00 [0.82,1.00] and a specificity of 0.92 [0.64,1.00]. For all subjects with PH, automatically estimated mPAP and mPAP measured by R HC correlated strongly (r=0.94); they yielded no bias (p=0.79), a nd the standard deviation of differences between them was small (5 mmHg). Conclusion: Automated PH-related vortex detection from 4D-flow MRI allows accurate diagnosis of PH and estimation of elevated mPAP. Limitations: Small subject number; no arrhythmic patients.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the scan-rescan repeatability of these measurements derived from 4D flow imaging with and without CS. Methods or Background: 23 prospectively recruited cardiac patients without known or suspected shunts and regular heart rhythm underwent two consecutive 3T Siemens Healthcare) retrospectively ECG- and navigator-gated whole-heart 4D flow imaging scans with a prototype sequence. For 15 subjects a CS 4D flow protocol (ac celeration-factor=7.6) was employed twice, 8 subjects twice underwent a protoc ol without CS (parallel acquisition factor 3). Background phase corrected a ortic (Qa) and pulmonary (Qp) net flow volumes were evaluated using prototyp e software (4DFlow, Siemens Healthcare). Relationships between the firs t and the second acquisition were investigated by correlation and Bl and-Altman analysis. Scan- rescan repeatability was quantified by coefficients of variations (CVs). Results or Findings: For all subjects net flow volumes from first and se cond scans correlated strongly (r=0.96 for Qa and Qp) and did not demonstrate a significant bias. Differences in cardiac intervals between scans were strongly correlated with scan-rescan differences of Qa (r=0. 72) and of acquisitions (Qa: 6%, 5%) were sl ightly smaller than acquisition without CS (Qa: 7%, Qp: 7%).

The purpose of the present study was to investigate if acceleration of 4D flow imaging by compressed sensing (CS) can be employed to derive LV flow components. Methods or Background: 20 prospectively recruited cardiac patients with regular heart rhythm underwent two consecutive 3T ( 4D flow imaging scans with prototype sequence. For 5 subjects a 4D flow protocol (parallel acquisition factor 3) was employ ed twice, for 15 subjects whole-heart 4D flow and a matched CS protocol (acceleration-factor=7.6) was used. LV direct, retained inflow, delayed ejection, and residual volume flow components were evaluated for all data sets using dedicated software (cvi42, Circle CVI). Relationships of the LV flow component s from paired measurements with and without CS were investigated by means of correlation and Bland-Altman analysis; repeatability of LV flow component measurements was determined from paired 4D flow measurements wit hout CS. Results or Findings: Scan times were significantly shorter employing CS (301\u00b186s vs 535\u00b1158s, p<0.01). LV flow components f rom CS measurements (direct=29\u00b17%; retained=29\u00b16%; delayed=26\u00b16%; residual=16\u00b14%) exhibited no significant bias compared deviations of differences between LV flow components from measurements with and without CS (direct=2%; retained=3%; delayed=3%; residual=3% ) were similar to component measurements (direct=3%; residual=3%). Compressed sensing allows acceleration of 4D flow i maging without significant impact on the evaluation of LV flow components. Limitations: Small sample size.

F. Secondary flow patterns deviating from main flow have been described after aortic valve replacement (AVR). The impact of the surgical procedure, i.e. aortotomy, on postoperative haemody namics as compared to the impact of the valve itself remains unclear. The refore, we introduce an ex- vivo model for comprehensive evaluation of haemodyn amics after different types of AVR. Methods or Background: 6 fresh swine aortas were anastomosed to an in- house developed piston pump pumping blood-mimicking fluid at 3l/min and 60bpm. 4D Flow MRI was acquired at 3T prior to surg ery (PreSur, n=6), after sham surgery, i.e. aortotomy without valve replacem ent (ShSur, n=6), and after AVR: 2 mechanical valves (MecV; Standard Masters, S t.Jude Medical, USA), 2 biological valves (BioV; Perimount MagnaEase, (AVneo). Peak velocity was analysed with GTFlow (GyroTools, Switzerland). Secondary flow patterns deviating from main flow were assessed visually in comparison to PreSur. Results or Findings: Normal systolic haemodynamics without secondary flo w patterns could be observed before surgery. Secondar y flow patterns developed after sham surgery in the ascending aorta. They wer e notably more pronounced after valve replacement. Most extensive secondary flow patterns were induced by BioV. They were associated with inc reased peak velocity in the ascending aorta compared B 262 Conclusion: With this ex-vivo model, we were able to evaluate t he effect of AVR and surgical pathway on aortic haemodynamics. P ostoperative flow changes can be attributed not only to the implanted valve but also to the aortotomy. In future studies, we will determine the influence of setup-related valve insufficiency on systolic haemodynamics. Limitations: The model did not allow analysis of diastolic flow patterns due to setup-related valve insufficiency. Ethics committee approval: No ethics approval was required.

Methods or Background: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) may evaluate the morphologic and functional parameters of cardiac valves, identifying strucural abnormalities and characteris ing the severity of valvulopathy. The assessment of AR by echocardiogra phy may be difficult sometimes and CMR may be a complementary technique in patients with inadequate echocardiographic image quality or discordant results. Several studies show that four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI and echocardiography presented good interobserver correlation, with good agreement in assessing AR. Results or Findings: The 4D flow in the AR has the advantage to be acqui red during free breathing with or without gadolinium injection. It has the ability to evaluate qualitatively any flow type (laminar, heli cal, vortical) in any direction and precise its eccentricity. Visualisation of the turbulent flows helps optimal positioning of the plan to perform flow measurement s. It enables also comprehensive assessment of aortic flows. Quantitat ive evaluation is based on conventional parameters such as velocity, forward and backward flows rate, regurgitation fraction. As a quality check control the forward flow will be compared to the left ventricular stroke volume and the net flow to the pulmonary artery flow. Optimal choice of velocity encoding (Venc) and measurement pitfalls will be discussed. New markers such as wall shear stress and energy loss due to turbulent flow will be explained. Flow eccentricity and increased wall shear stress provide a better unders tanding of the development of aortic dilations. Indirect predictors of severe AR such as holodiastolic backward flow in the descending aorta will be discussed. Conclusion: CMR using 4D flow MRI has a growing and promising r ole for grading AR. Few parameters and pitfalls are to cons ider for optimal assessment of AR in the routine clinical practice. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Reiter, diastolic functi on comprises the assessment of blood and tissue velocities as well as the maximal left atrial (LA) volume. Although magnetic resonance (MR) four-dimensional phase-contrast (4D-flow) imaging allows accurate determination of these velocities, the derivation of the LA volume directly from the same 4D-flow data remains unknown. The aim of this study was to compare maxim al LA volumes derived from 4D-flow data and two-dimensional cine imaging. Methods or Background: 58 subjects without signs of heart failure (male/female, 34/24; age, 75\u00b114 years) underwent ree-precession (bSSFP) in 2- and 4-chamber views under breathing. End-systolic LA areas and lengths were determined from multiplanar reformatted 2- and 4- chamber 4D-flow magnitude as well as bSSFP cine ima ges. Maximal (end- systolic) LA volume and LA volume index (LAVI) were calculated employing the area-length method. 4D-flow and cine results were compared by correlation analysis and paired t-test. Results or Findings: significant differences. Derived maximal volumes (4D-flow 85\u00b122 ml vs cine 84\u00b121 45.6\u00b111.7 ml vs cine 44.5\u00b19.8 ml, p=0.11) exhibited no and correlated strongly (r=0.95 and 0.89, respectively). Conclusion: Maximal LA volumes and LAVIs can be directly evaluated from 4D-flow data without the need of additional acquisi tion of bSSFP cine series. Limitations: Few subjects with enlarged atria; only area-length method was investigated. Ethics committee approval: Approval was obtained (Medical University of Graz, 24-126 ex 11/12).

Coakley*, M. McEntee, N. Moore, R. Young; Cork/ IE (s.coakley@hotmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this work was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and expectations of a sampl e of radiographers towards the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) int o medical imaging and determine the current state of AI education within the Europe an radiography community. Methods or Background: An online survey targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted over a ten-week period. Captur ed data included demographic information, data relating to participa nt's perceptions and understanding of AI, and AI-related educational bac kgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results or Findings: A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64% correctly identified the correct definition of AI, but fewer (37%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine-learning and deep-learning. The majority of participants (83%) were excited about the advancement of AI, yet, despite this, a level of apprehension remained among 29%. A severe lack of education on AI was apparent, with only 8% of participants having received AI teachings in their primary qualification. Conclusion: A positive attitude towards AI implementation into the radiographic role was noted, though concern remains amongst a minority of radiographers. Hesitation may stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and the absence of AI-training within the community. Enhancements to educational programmes are required, focusing on AI principles to help boost European radiography workf orce engagement and involvement in AI technologies.

J. T. O'Regan*\u00b9, Y. McQuinlan\u00b9, A. England\u00b2, efficient, and effective clinical i maging services for the future, radiographers need to engage with Artif icial Intelligence (AI). Work was undertaken to provide baseline guidance; to det ermine and summarise current recommendations and priorities for UK radio graphers. Methods or Background: The Society of Radiographers (SoR) AI working party undertook a six-month review of articles and resources related to diagnostic and therapeutic radiography and AI. Priorities and recommendations were formulated and presented for consultation with SoR member advisory groups, the SoR director of professional policy, and an external expert. Amendments were made and final consensus reached by the SoR working party. Results or Findings: Guidance was produced and intended for use by multi - professional clinical imaging and therapeutic radio graphy teams. Recommendations were themed across 4 areas: 1. Educ ational provision is needed to build knowledge, skills, and competences for radiographers: to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be c entral to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. 2. Radiography-led research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable radiographers to co- design services. 3. The fostering of stakeholder partnerships is key to ens uring maximal contribution of radiographers, patients, and service users. 4. Clinical practitioners must be involved in the co-construction, development, implementation, validation, and audit of AI. Conclusion: SoR guidance offers baseline recommendations. Prior ities include a need to update educational curricula and research foci, and to forge strong clinical-academic-industry-patient partnerships. Limitations: Radiographers should proactively develop AI-enabled healthcare to ensure gains of AI technologies are maximised while risks and challenges are minimised. The guidance will therefore need to be updated regularly, with repeated reviews, given the fast-changing pace of A I development and innovation.

Students p erform radiographs on inanimate objects, while they practice positioning on other students without acquiring X-ray images. Conversely, internships expose students to live situations, which, however, cannot be controlled fr om a pedagogic perspective. This study investigates the development of a simulator using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect human positioning and g enerate artificial yet realistic radiographs. Methods or Background: Using a real but rayless radiography device, student radiographers position a subject playing th e role of a patient. Our system leverages deep learning (DL) markerless appr oaches to detect human pose with calibrated video cameras. Using a collect ion of computed tomography volumes, ray casting techniques quickly produce artificial radiographs considering subject limb positioning and operator settings. Radiograph realism is enforced by a DL approach sim ulating polychromatic X- rays, image noise and scattering. Results or Findings: Simulated radiographs for chest and pelvis were rat ed by experienced and student radiographers as suffici ently realistic to assess the impact of technical parameters (e.g., mAs) and huma n positioning (e.g. correct internal rotation of femurs). A survey on 53 studen ts reported that the use of AI for teaching is welcomed (73%) and that the simulat or could be valuable to boost skills and confidence before internships (81% ). Conclusion: AI opens up some new perspectives in the simulation of radiographic practice in controllable conditions (e.g. type of pathologies, implant presence), paving the way for new teaching approaches. Limitations: Further development of the AIRx simulator is necess ary to improve stability and user experience, as well as t o support additional exams, such as shoulder radiographs, which were requested by surveyed students.

Skelton\u00b2, J. Matthew\u00b2, G. arroni\u00b2, S. \u00b3Manchester/UK Purpose: evaluate how students and educators experienced a novel postgraduate introductory artificial intelligence m odule for radiographers. Methods or Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in clinical imaging services. Different workforce s urveys highlight AI training as vital for AI implementation, so radiographers can provide safe, effective and efficient care to patients. Despite radiography bei ng one of the most technology-enabled professions, it has not yet prop ortionally invested in introducing AI training in radiography curricula. U sing a participatory action research design, semi-structured interviews and a f ocus group, we evaluated the experiences of students (n=7) and lecturers (n= 6) involved in the first running of an introductory module in AI for radiogr aphers. Data was recorded using Microsoft Teams and analysed using a data-dri ven, inductive coding process to generate themes. Results or Findings: Three themes were generated which revolved around the module delivery, content covered and amendments for future delivery. Participants were satisfied with the delivery and t he content they had access to. But, participants have suggested amendments to the teaching and learning strategies, learning pathways and mode of delivery. Conclusion: Developing educational provisions in AI for radiogr aphers should be a priority. Module content should consider context-specific requirements for every cohort and delivery should allow flexibility to accommodate different learning styles. Limitations: We recognise that these experiences are context-specific and may not necessarily be transferrable to other cultu res or countries; it still remains an important evaluation of a \"first-of-its- kind\" programme. Testing these ideas on a bigger sample size when these prov isions are available to a larger audience would be important for future resea rch.

Zerunian, D. assess the reliability of radiological multimodality preoperative study in the identification of the correct pelvic t ilt necessary for a medical device for patient-specific (PSI) preoperative plan ning, intraoperative delivery and postoperative analysis in Total Hip Arthroplast y (THA). Methods or Background: Eleven patients from January to May 2019 were prospectively included; they underwent a specific r adiological preoperative assessment including x-ray and CT scan for the dynamic assessment of pelvic tilt. CT scan protocol included total hip bone to distal femur bone, knee joint and ankle joint bilaterally. All CT scans were perf ormed with a 64--slice MDCT (Revolution-EVO, GE healthcare, WI, USA) including the slice thickness 1.25mm, pitch 0.516, ro tation -tube 1 sec. Reconstruction filter used was Bone Plus with W/L of 2500/500 HU. Four radiographic projections were performed including hip bone (antero-posterior e orthostatism projections) and Lumbar spine (latero- lateral projection), in different dynamic positions: standing, step -up and flexed -seated, to simulate dynamic position. All patients also performed a pos t-operative CT scan for the assessment of THA. Results or Findings: According to the preoperative protocol, all the acq uired images per patients (11/11) were suitable for perso nalised pelvic tilt assessment. Mean inclination preoperative planning does not differ significantly from postoperative imaging assessment (38\u00b0[44\u00b0-32\u00b0] vs 37.5\u00b0[51\u00b0-28\u00b0]) as well as from the mean absolute deviation for preoperative inclination and anteversion planning and post-operative measurement (all P>0.05). The mean absolute deviation from the planned patient--specific level of osteotomy (1.6 mm [-3/+4mm]), showed no signific ant differences between preoperative osteotomy planning and post-operative measurement (P>0.05) as well as mean deviation offset (3.3 mm[-6/+8mm], P>0 .05). Conclusion: Specific radiological assessment for PSI preoperati ve planning of pelvic offset resulted reproducible and accurate wi th surgical management. Limitations: The small cohort of patients as well as the fact th at there was no control group were recognized as limiting factors.

Kusk*; Esbjerg/DK (martin.weber.kusk@rsyd.dk) Purpose: To develop cheap and accurate 3D printed heart phantoms from clinical CT data, in sufficient detail to facilitat e automated measurements of left ventricular volumes, based on anatomical landmarks. If succesful, such phantoms could be used to explore dose reduction potential in CT-based ejection fraction measurement. Methods or Background: Two high-dose cardiac CT-series from the same patient (1 systolic and 1 diastolic) were obtained from PACS. Active contours technique was used in ITK-snap to segment myocardium, vessels and ventricles. STL-files were exported and 3D-printed using an FDM 3D-printer. Printing material was selected based on literature, to target enhancing myocardium HU values. Cavities were filled with a m ix of gelatine and contrast media, targeting 400 HU at 120 kVp. The models were placed inside an anthropomorphic lung phantom and scanned at differe nt kVP and mAs values, using synthetic ECG. Volume measurement was done us ing Syngo.via Cardiac Function (Siemens Healthineers). Results or Findings: At all parameter combinations, the clinical softwar e was able to automically detect the mitral and aortic valve planes and delineate the LV cavity. Hounsfield values of phantom myocardium corresponded to live enhancing myocardium. Measured phantom LV volumes i n both systolic and diastolic phases differed less than 5% from the cli nical source scans. Costs were 350 for the printer and under 40 Euro in mater ials per phantom. Conclusion: Cardiac cavities and myocardium HU values can be ac curately reproduced, using cheap 3D-printing technique, maki ng phantom studies feasible. Limitations: K-edge effects on enhancing myocardium could not be simulated. Right-sided hear chambers were not modelled. Moveme nt artefact influence could not be quantified.

M\u00f6nch, *D. M. Mehr ens*; Study demonstrated that endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a safe treatment option for p aediatric stroke patients with large vessel occlusions with high recanalisati on rates. Our aim was to determine the long-term cost, health consequences a nd cost-effectiveness of EVT in this patient population. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, a decision-analytic Markov model estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Early outcome parameters were based on the entire S ave ChildS Study to model the EVT group. As no randomised data exist, t he Save ChildS patient subgroup with unsuccessful recanalisation was used to model the standard of care group. For modelling of lifetime estimates, pa ediatric and adult input parameters were obtained from the current literatur e. The analysis was conducted in a United States setting applying healt hcare and societal perspectives. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set to $100, 000 per QALY. Results or Findings: The model results yielded EVT as the dominant (cost - effective as well as cost-saving) strategy for paed iatric stroke patients. The incremental effectiveness for the average age of 11 .3 years at first stroke in the Save ChildS Study was determined as an additional 4.02 lifetime QALYs, with lifetime cost-savings that amounted to $169,982 from a healthcare perspective and $254,110 when applying a societal perspective. Acceptability rates for EVT were 96.60% and 96.66% for the healthcare and societal perspectives. Conclusion: EVT for paediatric stroke patients with large vessel occlusions resulted in added QALY and reduced lifetime costs. Based on the available data in the Save ChildS Study, EVT is very likely t o be a cost-effective treatment strategy for childhood stroke. Limitations: The study design was retrospective with the inherent limitations of this type of design. Ethics committee approval: IRB waived requirement for informed consent.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of superior cerebellar artery occlusion (SCAO) on f inal angiography after mechanical thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusio n (BAO), to determine baseline and procedural factors associated with SCA O, and to examine clinical outcomes of SCAO. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 265 Methods or Background: We retrospectively analysed clinical and angiographic data from 116 patients who underwent m echanical thrombectomy for BAO. Characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with SCAO and those without SCAO. The clinical outcomes included malignant SCA infarction, in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, and 90- day functional outcome. Of the SCAO patients, delay ed recanalisation of occluded artery was assessed with follow up CT angi ography. Results or Findings: Occlusion of the SCA ostium was found in 10 patient s (8.6%) on final angiography after thrombectomy. Two patients had bilateral SCAOs. SCA infarction on post-treatment DWI occurre d more frequently in patients with SCAO than those without it (100% vs 5 0.9%, P=0.002). Of 10 patients with SCAO, malignant infarction or in-hosp ital mortality did not occur. There were no significant differences in hospital l ength of stay and the rates of malignant infarction, in-hospital mortality, and 90-day functional outcome between the two groups. Of the 12 lesions of SCAO, nine showed delayed recanalisation of the occluded superior cerebellar artery. Conclusion: SCAO was not uncommon after mechanical thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion. In our study, untreated SCAO after endovascular therapy did not show significant effec t on clinical outcomes. Thus, leaving an occlusion of the SCA might be a re asonable treatment option after successful recanalisation of the basilar arte ry. Limitations: This was a retrospective single centre design. Ethics committee approval: The institutional review board approved this study. Funding for this study: There is no funding to disclose.

Little is known regarding MR perfusion packages (MR PP) in predicting final infarct volume (FIV) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We aimed to assess the of (A: RAPID\u00ae; B: OleaSpher e\u00ae; C: Philips determine whether expert correction may improve FIV prediction. Methods or Background: HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort includes acute ischemic stroke patients referred to our Stroke Center, treated with MT following admission MRI and undergoing follow-up MR I at Day 6. Admission MRI were post-processed using three MRPP to retriev e ischemic core and PDV. These outputs were corrected by an expert to provide corrected volumes. Uncorrected and corrected volumes were compared bet ween all packages as well as to the FIV according to the recanalisation profile. Results or Findings: 94 patients were included of which 67 (71.28%) had successful recanalisation. In patients with success ful recanalisation, ichemic core volumes did not differ signicantly between MRP P and FIV (all P > 0.15). In patients with unsuccessful recanalisation, uncorrec ted PDV provided by packages A and B overestimated FIV to a lesser degr ee compared to package C (P=0.03 for A, P=0.12 for B) while there were no differences after correction (P0.99). When applying DEFUSE 3 trial criteria, corrected volumes would have led to MT in 51 patients with package A, 63 wi th package B and, 64 with package C. Conclusion: The MRPP assessed have limited differences in ischemic core quantification but substantial differences for PDV that may impact patient selection.

We further investigated whether ICAC subtype modified the association betwe en collateral status and functional outcome. Methods or Background: We used data from 2701 patients with ischemic stroke undergoing EVT. Presence and subtype of ICAC was assessed on baseline non-contrast CT. Collateral status was ass essed on baseline CT angiography using a visual scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). We investigated the association of ICAC subtype with collateral sta tus using ordinal and binary logistic regression. Next, we assessed whether ICAC subtype modified the association between collateral status and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, 0-6) using a multiplicative interaction term . Results or Findings: Compared to patients without ICAC, we found no association (or variable). When collateral grades were dichotomised (3 versus 0-2), we found that intimal ICAC was significantly associated with good collaterals in comparison to patients without ICAC (aOR, 1.41 [95%CI:1.06-1.89]) or with medial ICAC (aOR, 1.50 [95%CI:1.14-1.97]). The association between higher collateral grade and better functional outcome was significantly modified by IC AC subtype (acOR, 1.62 [95% CI: 1.36-1.94]) Conclusion: Patients intimal ICAC are more likely to have good collaterals and benefit more from an extensive coll ateral circulation in terms of functional outcome after EVT.

Previous studies reported substantial differences in quantification of penumbra depending on the MR perfusion software package used suggesting that optimal Tmax threshold may be variable. We performed a pilot study assessing perf usion deficit volumes (PDV) with different Tmax thresholds used MR packages OleaSphere\u00ae) in (FIV). Methods or Background: HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort includes anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy after baseline MRI. Mechanical thrombectomy failure was defined as mTICI score of 0. Admission MR perfusion were post-proces sed using two software packages with increasing Tmax thresholds ( 6s, 8s and 10s) and compared to FIV provided by follow-up MRI at Day 6. Results or Findings: Eighteen patients were included. Lengthening of the threshold from 6s to 10s led to significantly smaller PDV for both packages (A: p=0.01, B: p=0.05). For Tmax 6s they closer to FIV (mean absolute differences -17.44mL and, -8.39mL) and had narrower ranges of agreement while Tmax 10s underestimated FIV (mean absolute difference 4. 78mL). For package B, Tmax 10s was closer to FIV 31.54mL). Conclusion: Optimal y across MR perfusion software packages. Limitations: This study was limited by its nature as a small pop ulation study.

Author Disclosures: Alexandre Bani Sadr: Nothing to disclose Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 266 RPS 1511-9 Value of CT perfusion imaging in outcome prediction in *M. P. Fabritius*; Munich/DE Purpose: Basilar artery (BAO) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Optimal imaging and treatment strategy are still controversial and prognosis estimation challenging. We aimed to deter mine the predictive value of CT perfusion (CTP) parameters for functional out come in patients with BAO in the context of endovascular treatment (EVT). Methods or Background: Patients with BAO who underwent EVT were selected from a prospectively acquired cohort. Ischemic changes were assessed with the pcASPECTS on non-contrast CT, CTA source images, and CTP maps. Basilar artery on CTA score, posterior-ci rculation CTA score, and posterior-circulation collateral score were evaluat ed on CTA. Perfusion deficit volumes were quantified on CTP maps. Good functional outcome was defined as mRS 3 at 90 days. Statistical analysis included binary logistic regressions and receiver operating characteristics analyses. Results or Findings: Among 49 patients 24 (49.0%) achieved good outcome. In multivariate analyses, Basilar artery on CTA score, pc-ASPECTS (OR range, 1.31-2.10 [95% CI, 1.00-7.24]), and perfusio n deficit volumes on all CTP maps (OR range, 0.77-0.98 [95% CI, 0.63-1.00]) remained as independent outcome predictors. Cerebral blood flow deficit volume yielded the best performance for the classification of good cli nical outcome with an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84-0.99). Age an d admission NIHSS had lower discriminatory power (AUC, <0.7). Conclusion: CTP imaging parameters contain prognostic informati on for functional outcome in stroke patients due to BAO an d may identify patients with higher risk of disability at an early stage of hospitalisation. Limitations: Manual segmentations of CTP deficit volumes, the sm all number of patients, the retrospective nature of the study as well as patients receiving EVT and results therefore not being generalisable w ere identified as limitations.

Author Disclosures: Matthias Philipp Fabritius: Nothing to disclose RPS 1511-10 Comparison of cerebral blood flow quantification us ing multi- and single- delay arterial spin labelling in ischaemic stroke Van Der Lugt, Warnert; Rotterdam/NL Purpose: To compare cerebral blood versus single-delay arterial spin labelling (ASL) i n ischaemic stroke patients. Methods or Background: We used data from patients with ischaemic stroke due to anterior large vessel occlusion and of whom follow-up MRI imaging (3T, GE Healthcare) at 24 hours was available. Hadamard- encoded pseudocontinuous ASL was acquired using 7 post-labelling delays (PLDs) ranging from 0.8 to 3.5s. We estimated CBF and arterial transit time (ATT) by fitting a kinetic model to all 7 PLD images and to the image with a PLD of 1.8s only, fixing the ATT to 1.3s in the latter. Mean \u00b1 SD CBF and ATT values were extracted from the infarct area delineated on diffu sion-weighted imaging and a contralateral grey matter (GM) mask. We stratified patients according to recanalisation status (successful versus unsuccessf ul). Paired t-tests were used to compare CBF and ATT quantified from multi-P LD images, and to compare CBF quantified using multi- vs single-PLDs. Results or Findings: We included 43 patients (37 successfully and 6 unsuccessfully recanalised). ATT was significantly shorter in the infarct area compared to contralateral GM (1146\u00b1157 vs. 1222\u00b182. 5 CBF in the infarct area was significantly higher when estimated using 7 PLDs compared to a single PLD of vs. 52.6\u00b115.8 ml/100g/min; p=0.65). After unsuccessful were between CBF estim ates calculated with multi- or single-PLDs in the infarct area nor the contralateral GM. Conclusion: ATT varies across brain regions after successful re canalisation and may result in underestimation of CBF when using single-PLD ASL.

Early diagnosis is difficult due to its non -specific symptoms. The search for prognostic predictors and treatment indications implies a challenge due to the small volume of studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the CT scales proposed in the literature to predict the functional result in our environment. Methods or Background: We selected all patients over 18 years of age who received endovascular treatment for posterior circulation stroke in our hospital within the space of three years. Two readers (an ex pert and a resident) independently analysed the multimodality CT studies . Scores on the different tomographic scales were statistically correlated wi th the mRS scale at 90 days. Results or Findings: 61.8% of the patients were men, the mean age was 69 \u00b1 13, 74.4% had hypertension. The median PC-ASPECTS w as 10 and 90.4% had a favourable value (> 8). The means of BATMAN and PC-CS were 6 for both, 39.7% had a favourable BATMAN (> 7) and 60.3% had a \"good\" value in the PC-CS. The PC-ASPECTS scale showed statistical significance with the mRs at 90 days in its two versions (p = 0.003; p = 0.005) as well as the quantitative PC-CS (p = 0.027) and qualitative BATM AN (p = 0.009). The interobserver correlation was good for PC-CS (0.778 very good for BATMAN (0.823). Conclusion: Multimodality tomography is a useful tool in predic ting the functional outcome of posterior circulation strokes (PC-ASPECTS, PC-CS quantitative and BATMAN qualitative). PC-CS and BAT MAN showed good interobserver correlation. In contrast, PC-ASPECTS shows a greater dependence on the reader's experience.

G. Moser*\u00b9, critical complicat ion associated with ischaemic stroke and has been associated with contrast media administration. The objective of our study was to use real-world in-hospital data to evaluate the correlation between contrast media type and transformation from ischaemic to haemorrhagic stroke. Methods or Background: We obtained data on inpatient admissions with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke and a record of either iso-osmolar or low osmolar iodinated contrast media for a stroke related diagn ostic test and a treatment procedure (thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or angioplas ty). We performed multivariable regression analysis to assess the rel ationship between contrast media type and development of haemorrhagic transfor mation during hospitalisation, adjusting for patient characterist ics, comorbid conditions, and procedure type. Results or Findings: Inpatient visits with exclusive usage of either low osmolar (N=38,130) or iso-osmolar contrast media (N =4,042) were included. We observed an overall risk reduction in haemorrhagic transformation among patients who received iso-osmolar compared with low osmolar contrast media with an absolute risk reduction of 1.4% (p=0.032), relative risk reduction of 12.5%, and number needed to harm of 70. This outcom e was driven primarily by patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy, i n which iso-osmolar contrast media was associated with absolute risk reduction of 4.6%, and number needed to harm of 22, compared with low osmolar contrast media. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 267 Conclusion: Iso-osmolar contrast media was associated with a lower rate of haemorrhagic transformation compared to low osmolar contrast media in patients with ischaemic stroke.

Methods or Background: Ultrasound-guided PRB is an invasive procedure performed on native and transplant kidneys. Clinical data were obtained from the electronic records for consecutive paediatric p atients who underwent a PRB from the 1st of January 2012 to 31st of July 20 21. Complications were separated into minor and major depending on further engagement. Quantitative data were presented by descriptive statistics and analysed using Pearson's chi-squared test. Results or Findings: This study consisted of 223 PRB in 156 children wit h slight male predomination (55.77%) and average age 11.59\u00b1 5.24 years, ranging from 111 days to 19 years old. 23.71% of children had more than one biopsy. PRB of the transplanted kidney was performe d in 17 children (10.89%). No complication after PRB was recorded in 75% of children. Minor complications, which required no treatment, were perinephric haematoma, haematuria, and intraparenchymal bleeding. Most com mon minor complication was haematuria. Only one child (0.6%) had a major c omplication; high-flow arterio-venous fistula was created which was treated conservatively and resulted in nephrectomy. Two core samples were take n in 62.32%, three only in 2.7%. Conclusion: There was no statistical correlation between the number of core samples and complications (p>0.1931). When two core samples were taken quality sample for interpretation was reached in 100% of the cases, while in one core samples it was reached in 94.87%. There wa s no significant statistical difference between one or two samples r egarding minor complications (p=0.875).

Zafirovski*\u00b9, M. study aims to investigate if the number of renal core samples has an impact on the post-biopsy compl ications and compare their proportion of patients who develop a complication after ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) in the same medical center in two different time periods. Methods or Background: PRB is an invasive procedure performed in native and transplant kidneys. Clinical data were obtained from a published article for the first time period (1994-1999) and from electronic data for the second time period (2012-2021). Number of core samples and complications were examined. Quantitative data were presented by descr iptive statistics and analysed using Pearson's chi-squared test. Results or Findings: Two core biopsies were needed to yield satisfactory pathological material in 93.82% of cases in first period, one core biopsy was never performed. On the other hand, in the second p eriod, single core biopsy was performed in 35% of total biopsies and yielded satisfactory pathological material in 94.87% of cases. Two core biopsies were performed in 62.32% of cases and yielded satisfactory material in all 139 (100%) cases. 63.2% minor complications were noted in the first period, without any major complication. 20 years later 26.9% instances had minor complications and only one child (0.6%) had a major complication that resulted in nephrectomy. Conclusion: There is a reduction of minor complication rate by 36.3% between the two time periods, due to better PBR pro tocol, more experience, and due to reduced number of core samples. One core biopsy has become increasingly common and yields better satisfactory material than two core biopsies did in the first period. Limitations: Different physicians performing the biopsy, different protocols and technological advancements in radiological equipment.

Methods or Background: This prospective cohort study evaluated children with known or newly-diagnosed ileocolonic CD starti ng or changing therapy. Children underwent ileocolonoscopy, scored with sim ple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD), and MRE with DWI on the s ame day at two different time points (Week 0 and 12). Accuracy of MaRIA and Clermont relative to ileocolonoscopy in detecting disease change was assessed through correlational coefficients (r). Interreader agreeme nt was calculated for both imaging scores through intraclass correlation (ICC) . Results or Findings: 16 children (mean age 11.5 \u00b1 2.8) were evaluated. Global MaRIA and global Clermont strongly correlate d with SES-CD in detecting the degree of mucosal healing following t reatment (r=0.676 and r=0.677, p<0.005, respectively). Correlation for pooled timepoint SES-CD MaRIA/global p<0.005 and r=0.570, p<0.001 respectively). Interrater reliability for global MaRIA and global Clermont for pooled timepoint assessments was good (ICC=0.809 and global scores correlate with endoscopic i ndices and may be used to monitor mucosal healing in children with CD undergoing treatment. MRE with DWI may represent a favourable alternative to colonoscopy and contrast-enhanced MRE in children due to its greater tolerability. Limitations: First, the modest study sample size introduced an i nnate level of variability in the data. Second, all MRE examinatio ns were performed under the colonoscopy bowel preparation protocol, which i s not a common practice and may thus not be reflective of MRE and DWI asses sments that occur in regular practice.

Methods or Background: This is an ancillary analysis of a prospective coho rt study where children with CD underwent endoscopy an d MCE-MR with DWI on the same day. These were repeated 12 weeks later. S emi-quantitative DWI assessment, ADC, and RCE were assessed in five intestinal segments. The correlation between Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD) and MR parameters was evaluated through correlational coef ficients (). Multiple line mean graph of RCE in six acquisition phases (8-128 seconds) was constructed to assess enhancement in pathologic and normal bowel. Results or Findings: 156 ileocolonic segments from 16 children (mean age 11.5 \u00b1 2.8) were included. A moderate correlation emerged between semi- quantitative DWI assessment and SES-CD ( =0.521, p<0.001). between SES-CD ( =-0.232, p=0.005), and RCE segments showed a quicker pattern of enhancement than normal bowel in MCE-MR, with the greatest significance within 40 seconds of contrast administration. Conclusion: Semi-quantitative DWI assessment shows a more robus t correlation with degree of CD activity compared to ADC and RCE. This may indicate the futility of acquiring post-contrast im ages in MRE and measuring ADC values in paediatric CD. Limitations: The modest sample size and extensive bowel preparat ion protocol may have introduced variability in the dat a and over-represented MR assessments.

Methods or Background: This retrospective multicentre study included grayscale US images from paediatric patients who vi sited ER and underwent US examination for suspicion of ileocolic intussusc eption. 40783 dataset consisted of images from Hospit al_A, and was split into training, tuning, and internal test sets in a ratio of 7 : 1.5 : 1.5. External test set consisted of images from Hospital_B. The precision, recall, average precision (AP), F1-score were calculated to evaluate the perf ormance of our model. The optimal cut-off values of confidence scores were determined using internal dataset and performance was evaluated with external dataset through per- lesion and per-patient-based analyses Results or Findings: The AI model showed AP of 0.952 and 0.932 in the internal and external test set. We determined two c onfidence thresholds, CTopt and CTprecision as 0.557 and 0.790, from internal t est set. The former yielded maximum value of F1-score, and the latter yielded m aximum value of F1 score while yielding precision over 98.0%.

Prakash*, V. K; Bengaluru/IN (drarjunprakash@gmail.com) Purpose: This study investigates role of antenatal foetal main pulmonary artery (MPA) Doppler in predicting the subsequent d evelopment of clinical Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in neonates. Methods or Background: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2019 to October 2020 on 729 pregnant women between 34 to 39 weeks of gestational age, who came for routine thir d trimester ultrasound examination to Bangalore Medical College & Research Institute, India. The standard foetal biometric parameters, gestational a ge and estimated foetal weight were first obtained. The MPA Doppler indices like PI, RI, PSV, S/D ratio and Acceleration Time/Ejection Time (At/Et) were recorded. The pregnant women were followed up till delivery to look for de velopment of RDS in the neonate. Correlation was carried out using Pearson' s moment correlation equation. Determination of the optimum cut-off value for pulmonary At/Et ratio in predicting neonatal RDS was done using ROC analy sis. Results or Findings: Of the 729 foetuses, 342 were eligible for final analysis, of which 47 developed neonatal RDS. These fetuses h ad significantly higher PI and RI values, whereas At/Et ratio and PSV were sig nificantly At/Et ratio, PSV, RI and PI showed significant correlatio n with gestational age, of which At/Et ratio showed the most statistically sig nificant ratio predicted the development of RDS in late preterm and early term i nfants respectively. Conclusion: Foetal MPA indices, especially At/Et ratio is a pro mising non- invasive tool in identifying fetuses at risk of neonatal RDS. Limitations: Pregnant women with co-morbidities like hypertension and diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. Cor relation with Lecithin/Sphingomyelin ratio could have been done, thus warranting further studies. Ethics committee approval: Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained.

Author Disclosures: Arjun Prakash: ultrasoun COVID- 19 Soewondo; Surakarta/ID (yusufnawawi@unsyiah.ac.id) Purpose: Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been introduced as the mo dality of choice with high accuracy in diagnosing pneumonia. This study focuses on the potential use of LUS in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in children by conducting a scoping review of the literature to comprehensively explore the current evidence. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 269 Methods or Background: This scoping review compiled published results from various relevant studies. Studies using LUS wi th experimental or observational design and case series of paediatric patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are included in this study. Summ ary of the data and narrative approach were performed to describe the f inding. Results or Findings: This scoping review includes 33 articles from vario us countries. Of the 24 studies with primary data, thr ee studies are multicentre- based, and the remaining 21 studies are based on a single centre. The number of study subjects ranged from 3 to 74 patients. The quality of the included studies was relatively low; however, LUS certainly appears to be a highly sensitive and fairly specific test for COVID-19 in paediatric. There may be LUS findings and patterns, predominantly interstitial a bnormalities, that are relatively specific to COVID-19, despite the other factors may vary. Conclusion: Almost all identified studies positively recognise the role of LUS as a sensitive and relatively specific modality in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia in children. Limitations: Our iterative search on the role of LUS in the paediatric population with COVID-19 discovered limited number of publications than in the adult population. Even with a careful and systematic search of the literature, it is possible that not all publications can be identified due to publication bias and exclusion of publications in non-English languages.

Methods or Background: The SHIP-CT study was an international multicentre randomised controlled trial that compar ed the effect of inhaled HS vs isotonic saline (IS) on lung structure as measur ed by chest CT in pCwCF. The manual PRAGMA-CF showed less airway-related abn ormalities including bronchiectasis in the HS group over 48 weeks. An al gorithm was recently developed and validated to quantify dimensions of v isible AA pairs on CT. LungQ (v2.1.0.1, Thirona) automatically segments identifies segmental (G0) and distal (G1-10) airway generations. For each AA- pair, the following dimensions are quantified and a nalysed by a mixed effect model: diameters of airway outer wall (Aout), airway lumen wall (Alumen), airway wall thickness (Awt), artery and AA-rat ios were computed: AoutA, AlumenA, and AwtA. Results or Findings: 113 baseline and 103 48-week CTs of 115 pCwCF (55 HS, 60 IS) were analysed (4 excluded due to inconsi stent slice spacing). 13,205 AA-pairs in the HS group and 13,480 in the I S group were detected. Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups. At 48 weeks, AwtA was higher in the IS group than for the HS (mean di fference 0.02; 95%CI 0.004-0.04; p=0.02). AlumenA and AoutA were not significantly different between groups. Significant changes from baseline t o 48 weeks in AwtA and AlumenA between groups were observed, favoring HS ( all p<0.001). Conclusion: The automated AA-analysis was able to detect a large number of AA-pairs and quantified AA-dimensions on chest CT i n pCwCF. A positive effect of inhaled HS at 48 weeks and the progression of airway wall thickness was observed, in line with the PRAGMA-CF results. Limitations: This was a retrospective analysis.

C. Doyle*, Purpose: Chest radiography, after peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion, is the gold standard for confirming catheter tip location. The utilisation of ultrasound in catheter placement confirmation amongst the neonatal and paediatric population has been the focus of many recent studies. This work sought to establish the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for the confirmation of PICC tip position amongst patients within the neonatal intensive care unit, compared t o the gold standard of conventional radiography. Methods or Background: A PRISMA methodology was used, searches included four (Pubmed, CINAHL, Embase, and MEDLINE) databases. Diagnostic accuracy measurements and study characteristics were extracted from all studies eligible for inclusion. The QUADAS -2 tool was employed to assess the methodological quality of the included s tudies. The meta-analysis used the primary outcomes of sensitivity and specif icity. Results or Findings: Eight studies were included, with 421 patients receiving a PICC line. The estimated pooled ultrasound sensit ivity was CI: 5 9.38%-81.60%). No significant differences between operator experience were noted. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a sensitive, specific, and timel y imaging modality for confirming the position of PICCs in th e neonatal intensive care unit when compared with chest or abdominal radiography. Results of this systematic review study support the use of US as th e first line imaging test to confirm PICC tip position.

Gohla, K. Nikolaou; Purpose: To evaluate the potential of native T1 IR imaging f or delineation of liver lesions in interventional MR without the appl ication of contrast agent. Methods or Background: A total of 48 liver lesions in 41 patients with kno wn malignancies (hepatocellular carcinoma or metastases) were treated with thermoablation between March 2020 and Februa ry 2022. T1-VIBE sequence was acquired as part of the standard imagi ng protocol. Additionally, T1 mapping look-locker images were acquired with ei ght different inversion times (TI) between 148 ms and 1743 ms. Lesion-to-li ver contrast (LLC) was compared between VIBE and IR-images for each TI. Wi lcoxon signed-rank test was conducted for analysis of data, statistical significance was set for p 0.05. Results or Findings: Mean LLC in T1-VIBE sequences was 0.3\u00b10.1. In IR images mean LLC was 0.9\u00b10.8 at TI 148 ms (p<0.001), 1.1\u00b11.1 at TI 228 ms (p<0.001), 0.7\u00b10.7 at TI ms (p<0.001), 0.7\u00b10.2 at TI ms (p<0.001), 0.5\u00b10.2 at TI ms (p<0.001), 0.4\u00b10.2 at (p=0.037), 0.3\u00b10.2 1743 ms Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 270 Conclusion: IR imaging is promising to provide improved visuali sation compared to standard T1-VIBE sequence when using specific TI with best LLC between 148 and 628 ms. However, there is greater v ariance of contrast compared to T1-VIBE. Limitations: Not applicable.

Y. Avital, Spenkelink, *J. J. Fu accuracy of image guided percutaneous ablations and biopsies may be enhanced by using robotic systems for needle guidance. In this technical feasibility study, we evaluated the perfo rmance of a novel needle- guiding robotic system (ANT-C) during percutaneous CT-guided procedures in an abdominal phantom in comparison with free-hand t echnique. Our primary end point was the technical feasibility of the robo tic system to perform accurate needle guidance. Our secondary end points were its accuracy, i.e., 3-D deviation from target centre, the number of CT scan s needed to reach the target (determining radiation exposure and overall procedural duration) and the duration of needle manipulation. Methods or Background: 18 gauge needles were used to target 8 fiducial markers (diameters: 8, 10 and 12 mm; median depth 6 3.5 mm). Our operators (an experienced interventional radiologist with over 10 years of experience, and a novice interventional radiology fellow) perfo rmed 12 robotic guided punctures and 12 free-hand punctures. Results or Findings: Compared with the free-hand technique, the robotic system was more accurate with a statistically signi ficant reduction in needle deviation from the target centre 3.63; manu al: 4.93 mm; p- CT scans needed to rea ch the target was significantly reduced (robot: 1.0 \u00b1 0.2; manual: 2. 7 \u00b1 0.9; p-value<0.001) and a significant reduction in needle manipulation time w as recorded to use the ANT-C roboti c system for needle guidance during percutaneous procedures, res ulting in more accurate needle placement, shorter needle manipulation time and reduced radiation exposure, compared with the free-hand technique. Limitations: As a technical feasibility study, the number of per cutaneous punctures was limited. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Thirty-four patients with type 3 and 4 Klatskin tumours who underwent PTBD were included. A 50% decrease in total bilirubin level within 2 weeks was considered effec tive drainage. The total liver volume, and 3 main hepatic sector volumes (right an terior, right posterior and left), were calculated separately using computed tomography volumetry. According to the Bismuth type and the sector in whi ch the drainage catheter was placed, the drained liver volume was determined by virtually cutting the liver. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) anal ysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value of liver volume for effective drainage. In addition, the relationship between liver function s tatus before the procedure and effective drainage was investigated. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of effective dr ainage. Results or Findings: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed were factors for effective drainage. In the ROC analysis , the cut-off value of liver volume to be drained for effective drainage was 37% . The sensitivity and specificity were 81% and 73%, respectively. In the group of patients who developed cholangitis after the procedure, the drai ned liver volume was significantly lower than in the group without chola ngitis (29% and 50.7%, respectively, p=0.003). Conclusion: volume 37%, high albumin and low INR values, which are indicators of better liver function, are factors that positively affect effective drainage. Limitations: The retrospective design of this study, and the small number of patients, were identified limitations. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Abrishami Kashani\u00b9, M. J. retrospectively compare the incidence of persist ent air leak (PAL) following cryoablation or microwave ablation (MWA) of lung tumours with ablation zones encompassing the pleura. Methods or Background: This bi-institutional retrospective cohort study evaluated 305 lung tumours treated with cryoablation or MWA in 146 consecutive patients between 2006 and 2021. PAL was defined as air leak for more than 24 hours after chest tube placement or an enlarging postprocedural pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. The ex tent of the pleural surface encompassed by the ablation zone was quanti fied on CT using semiautomated segmentation. A parsimonious generali sed estimating equation model was developed using purposeful selection of predefined covariates to estimate PAL incidence by ablation modality. Local tumour progression (LTP) was compared between ablation modalities using Cox proportional-hazard models, with death as a competing risk. Results or Findings: A total of 260 tumours (mean diameter, 13.1 mm +/- 7.4; mean distance to pleura, 3.6 mm +/- 5.2) in 116 pat ients (mean age, 61.1 years +/-15.3; 60 women) and 173 sessions (112 cryoablations, 61 MWA) were included. PAL occurred after 25 of 173 (15%) sessio ns. The incidence was significantly lower following cryoablation compared to MWA (10 [9%] vs 15 [25%]; p=.006). The odds of PAL adjusted for the number of treated tumours per session were 67% lower 0.14-0.82]; p=.02) compared to MWA. There in LTP between ablation modalities (p=.36). Conclusion: Cryoablation of peripheral lung tumours bears a low er risk of PAL compared to MWA if the ablation zone encompasses the pleura, without adversely affecting LTP. Limitations: The findings of this study are limited by the retro spective design. Ethics committee approval: The IRB of both institutions approved this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study.

Methods or Background: Thirty patients (18 females, mean age 56y, range 32-76y) with 35 benign non-functioning thyroid nodules 26.8\u00b17.6 range for CT-US fusion RF Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 271 ablation. Nodules' volume was evaluated before treatment and during 12- months follow-up. Complications' rate was also eval uated. The nodules were treated using US-CT fusion imaging and real-time needle virtual tracking system with the \"moving shot\" technique, inserting the RF electrode in the distal part of the nodule and then moving the RF el ectrode backwards and upwards with steps of 5-10 s. Results or Findings: US-CT fusion imaging with VT system was feasible in all cases (feasibility 100%) and it was always possible to complete the procedure as planned (technical success 100%). Minor complications occurred in 2/30 cases (6.6 %). No major complications occurred. 50% volume reduction (technique efficacy) was achieved in 93% cases, wit h a significant mean volume reduction at 12 months follow-up (68.7\u00b110.8% ), (p<0.001). VAS compression score and cosmetic score significantly improved at 12-months follow-up from 8\u00b12 ely (p<0.05). Conclusion: The VT system could be useful in thyroid nodules ablation procedures assistance being able to track the RF el ectrode tip even when this is obscured by the bubbles produced by the ablative process. The combination of fusion imaging with VT assisted RF ablation repr esents a safe, non-surgical treatment option for patients with large substernal benign thyroid nodules.

Methods or Background: Men with lower urinary tract symptoms and in need of a surgical intervention were enrolled in this pr ospective, investigator- initiated, single-centre study. Patients were followed for at least 3 months. Efficacy outcomes included: uroflowmetry, PSA, and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires including EPIC-26, IPSS, and IIEF-5. MRI imaging was performed at baseline and 3-months. Adverse events (AEs) were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo scale. Any medicatio n use pre- and post- TULSA was also monitored. Results or Findings: A total of 17/20 patients have completed their 3-mo follow-up. At 3 months, the following median values were reported: prostate volume reduced by 25%, PSA reduced by 55%, post-voi d residual volume decreased by 24%, average flow rate increased by 100%, Qmax increased by 109%, voided volume decreased by 19%, IPSS improved from 16 to 6, IPSS QoL improved from 4 to 1, IIEF-5 improved from 17 t o 21, EPIC-26 urinary incontinence domain improved from 86-97, and the EP IC-26 irritative/ obstructive domain improved from 63-95. Improvement s were observed in every measure despite the discontinuation of LUTS m edication after TULSA. Median ablation time was 43 minutes, hospitalisatio n time was 24 hours and catheterisation time was 16 days. Six AEs were repo rted, including six grade 2 and one grade 3 event, including urinary tract infection, urinary retention, and epididymitis (grade 3), which all resolved by 3 months. Conclusion: TULSA appears to be a promising surgical option for the treatment of BPH. Limitations: A limitation of this study was the small sample siz e.

Methods or Background: In this prospective study (NCT03350529), patients underwent either whole-gland or partial sTULSA, dep ending on their tumour characteristics and patient preferences. Patients w ere followed every 3 months and adverse events (AEs, Clavien-Dindo scale), func tional status questionnaires, uroflowmetry, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were assessed at every study visit. Disease control was assessed at 3 months (mpMRI) and 12 months by mpMRI, PSMA PET-CT, and pr ostate biopsy covering the treatment area plus areas suspicious on imaging. Results or Findings: A total of 29 patients (median age 72 years) underw ent sTULSA and 19 have completed their 12-monoth follow -up. Median baseline PSA was 3.8 ng/ml. AEs included two grade 3 events (2J stent and urethral stricture), two grade 2 events (osteitis pubis and IV antibiotics), seven grade 1 events (infection or urinary retention). Median PSA at 12 months post-TULSA for 18 available records was 0.19 ng/ml, with 5 pat ients having undetectable PSA. Three patients out of 30 have been diagnosed w ith biochemical recurrence, who also have extraprostatic disease on imaging. At 12-month biopsy follow-up, 14/16 (88%) patients were free of any PCa in the treatment region, with two out-of-field recurrences. Conclusion: TULSA is a safe salvage therapy option with encouraging 12- month oncological outcomes. Limitations: Limitations included the small sample size, only early-stage oncological and safety outcomes after treatment. Patients also had a diverse disease history prior to undergoing TULSA.

Methods or Background: This study retrospectively collected patients with kidney and liver tumours treated with ablation from January 2020 to April 2021. The ablation modality was decided depending on the tumour characteristics. Subfrenic and subcapsulary lesions or tumours locat ed less than 1 cm away from the bowel or gall bladder were categorised as high-risk. Major and minor complications were recorded. Median follow-up was 9 months after treatment. Results or Findings: A total of 97 lesions were treated in 67 patients, with mean size of 18.9 mm (range 5-40). The majority (77 .6%) were male, with a mean age of 66.5 years (range 20-88). 67.2% (45) we re hepatocarcinomas, 20.9% (14) were liver metastases from colonic cance r, and 11.9% (8) were renal carcinomas. In total, 89 liver lesions were t reated and 42% (38) of them were in high-risk locations. 91% (41) of hepatocarc inomas were treated with radiofrequency, all liver metastases with microwave and all kidney lesions with cryotheraphy. A total of 94% had a complete respons e within the first month, and 98% after a second ablation. Four major complic ations (2 active bleedings, 1 hepatic abscess and a pneumothorax) and 10 (8 studies and/or with high risk locat ions. This reduces the number of complications regardless of radiologist experience and allows ablation as a valuable therapeutic option to many m ore patients.

In addition, we aimed to investigate if different thermal sources influence the efficacy of the proce dure. Methods or Background: In this retrospective multi-institutional study, 194 renal cancers in 165 patients were treated with per cutaneous image-guided thermal ablation over the period 2015-2020. All pat ients were staged according with TNM classification and only T1, N0, M0 were in cluded prior to the procedure. The imaging modalities used for guiding were divided into three groups: CT (CT and CBCT), US (US and CEUS) and combined US-CT. Mean tumour size was 25 mm (range 4-56 mm). RF and MW pr ocedures were labelled \"heat\", while procedures based on cryoablations were labelled \"cold\". Results or Findings: Primary effectiveness rate, considered as the absence of residual or recurrent disease during follow-up, was: 83,5% in the CT group; 68% in the group, and 100% in the combined US-CT group (p=0,004). Major and minor complications were, respectively: 1 and 11 in the CT group, 1 and 4 in the US group, and 0 and 3 in the combined US-TC group (p = 0,04). The mean rise in serum creatinine level was similar among the three groups. Primary effectiveness was similar among the group \" heat\" and the group \"cold\". Conclusion: CT and combined US-CT guide showed a lower rate of residual or recurrent disease compared to US. US guide showed a lower rate of procedural complications. Limitations: In this study, differences in general health condit ions between the three groups were not investigated.

Aviram; Tel Aviv/IL RPS 1503-2 Coronary CTA versus functional testing for the diag nosis of obstructive coronary artery disease: results from the effectiveness of computed tomograp hy angiography (CTA) and functional stress testing for diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in stable chest pain. Methods or Background: 2920 patients from the international COME-CCT consortium were enrolled, in order to compare CTA w ith exercise electrocardiography (ECG) and single-photon emissio n CT (SPECT) for diagnosis stenosis) by invasive coronary angiogr aphy. Generalised linear mixed models were used, including non-diagnostic results as dependent variables, in a logistic regression model. Covariates were invasive coronary angiography, type of diagnostic m ethod and their interactions. Results or Findings: CTA showed significantly better diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 94.6% (95% CI: 92.7-96) and s respectively. The PPV of CTA was 50% in patients with a clinical pre-test probabilit y of 10% or more, compared to ECG SPECT at pre-test probabi lities of 40% and 28%, obstructiv e CAD with a post-test probability 15% in patients with a pre-test probability 74%. Conclusion: In patients with stable chest pain, CTA is more eff ective than functional testing for the diagnosis as well as for reliable exclusion of obstructive CAD. CTA should become widely adopted i n patients with an intermediate pre-test probability. Limitations: Functional testing was not available in all patient s (55%; n=2920).

RPS 1503-3 therosclerotic plaque characteristics and their dyn amics assessed by CT angiography in patients with acute syndrome *A. Semenova*, Merkulova, M. Shariya, (alina.sema.147@mail.ru) Purpose: Assessment of coronary atherosclerotic plaque (ASP) features and their changes for more than 1 year in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods or Background: This study included 40 patients aged 61.9\u00b111 years with ACS. All patients underwent coronary CT angiog raphy (CTA) (320-row CT scanner) 3-6 days after coronary inter vention for culprit lesions and after 17\u00b16.2 months. We analysed the degree of stenosis, plaque type, size and signs of ASP instability (napkin-ring sign , positive remodelling of the artery, spotty calcifications, rough contour). Results or Findings: There were 68 (66.7%) soft and 34 (33.3%) combined ASPs. In summary, 6 (5.9%) of plaques transformed i nto another type (4 from soft to combined and 2 from combined to calcified). At the end of the observation period all size characteristics of the plaques increased: stenosis degree from 58.3\u00b116.3 to 60.4\u00b116.1% (p=0.049), om 10.0 [7.2; Programme A B 273 0.25 [0.00; 1.00] mm (p=0.008). Mean and minimal pl aque density and the remodelling index were not significantly changed. T he baseline incidence of various CT signs of instability in non-culprit plaques was 17-45%. Subsequent appearance or disappearance of at least one of thes e signs was observed in 24 plaques (24.2%). A relationship between appearance of positive remodelling and napkin-ring sign (U=0.236, p<0.001) was found, as well as between disappearance of rough contour and positive remodelling (U=0.102, p=0.008). Conclusion: Changes in plaque features in the observation perio d reflect natural atherosclerotic lesion progression. The app earance or disappearance of at least one instability sign in non-culprit pla ques was noted in a quarter of them. The relationships between appearance or disappearance of the above- mentioned instability signs reflects the processes of plaque 'destabilisation' and 'stabilisation'. Limitations: An identified limitation was the small cohort of patients. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

S. represents a non-invasive approach to analyse coronary plaques. The principal aim of this study was to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes (death, necessity of percutaneous angioplasty or by-pass procedure) of patients with different plaque compositions. The secondary aim was to analy se the correlation between the plaque density and peri-coronary-fat-at tenuation-index (pFAI). Methods or Background: Patients who underwent CCTA for evaluation of ischaemic heart disease in our facility were retros pectively recruited from 03/2016 to 06/2021. CCTA was done ONE (Toshiba Systems, Otawara, Japan); calculat ed with Aquarius Workstation (version Inc., Foster City, CA). Exclusion criteria: age <18 years; history of coronary-stenti ng, cardiac surgery, coronary dissection, congenital-heart-disease, coronary anom alies. 372 patients were finally included (237 male, 57\u00b115 years). Patients were divided into 3 groups: 37 (9.9%) with high attenuation plaques - HAPs (>60 137 (36.8%) with low attenuation plaques - LAPs (<29 HU and a volume 15 mm3 and/or 30-59 HU with a volume > 52 mm3) and 198 (53.2%) without plaques. Clinical, haematochemical, pharmacological, EKG echocardi ographic parameters were collected. Results or Findings: LAPs were more numerous in elderly male patients (p<0.001). Dyslipidaemia and diabetes positively correlated with LAPs (p<0.001). Patients with LAPs had higher pFAI and m ore plaques (p=0.005). The overall volume of LAPs was greater than HAPs (p=0.009). A favourite localisation of LAPs in the anterior descendant art ery with higher stenosis (p <0.001) was also noted. Follow-up demonstrated that LAPs independently predisposed to outcomes (p=0.04). Conclusion: Plaque analysis is effective in identifying \"at ris k\" plaques. LAPs are related to higher pFAI, supporting the hypothes is that inflammation plays a role in the plaques' composition. Limitations: Identified limitations of this study were the retro spective design and the fact that a heterogeneous population was us ed.

Whether the use of a super resolution dee p learning reconstruction (SR-DLR) algorithm could better discriminate minimal coronary atherosclerosis or not is unknown. Our objective is therefore to compare the number of abnormal coronary segments diagnosed on CCTA when using iterative reconstruction (IR), standard deep learning 0-2 CCTA with absence of kinetic artifacts, coronary enhancement above 350 HU and Agatston score <500 acquired on a 4th generation 320-row scanner were retrospectively included and reconstructed using IR , DLR and SR-DLR. Three readers analysed all reconstructions in a random or der and graded 11 coronary segments per reconstruction in a binary fashion (normal/abnormal), in addition to the global CAD-RADS. Variations in numb ers of abnormal segments were compared at a patient level and at a population level. Results or Findings: The average Agatston score was 29 \u00b144. The mean DLP was 68 \u00b124. Ten CCTA were classified as CAD-RAD S 0, 10 as CAD- RADS 1 and 10 as CAD-RADS 2 using IR and DLR. With SR-DLR, 1 CCTA was upgraded from CAD-RADS 0 to 1 and 1 downgraded from CAD-RADS 2 to 1. The overall number of abnormal coronary segme nts was higher using SR- DLR (2.4 \u00b12.7) compared to DLR and IR (1.9 and 2.1 \u00b12.3, respectively, p<0.05). Per patient, the number of abnormal corona ry segments was increased by a mean of 0.7 \u00b11.2 when using SR-DLR. Conclusion: SR-DLR better identifies minimal non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis IR and DLR, which could better stratify patient's cardiovascular risk. Limitations: One identified limitation was the fact that this wa s a retrospective preliminary study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Szilveszter; Budapest/HU Purpose: Laboratory parameters of patients with suspected co ronary artery disease (CAD) may yield the potential of adding inc remental value to the cardiovascular (CV) risk prediction of patients wit h chest pain even if acute myocardial infarction has been excluded. The level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T has demonstrated promising results in the setting of chronic coronary syndrome and it is plausible that it may provide valuable information regarding plaque burden in patients with chest pain and low to intermediate CV risk. Methods or Background: Overall, 243 consecutive patients referred for coronary computed tomography angiography due to sus pected coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled in a tertiary referral centre. Segment stenosis score (SSS) was calculated to characterise overall plaque burden. For each coronary segment, an estimate of worst diameter ste nosis per segment was performed, scored as minimal (<25%; score: 0), mild (25-49%; score: severe ( 70%; score: 3). The SSS was calculated as the sum of the individual segment scores. Uni- and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify pr edictors of SSS. Results or Findings: In the recruited 243 patients (mean age: 57.3\u00b111.8, 44.0% 70.0% had CAD. 3.94-12.62], p=0.048). Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 274 Conclusion: It is plausible that elevated troponin levels are t he result of clinically silent plaque ruptures and subsequent mi croembolisations in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. The measurement of troponin may potentially allow for a more precise CV risk stratification of patients with stable chest pain. Limitations: The fact that only low to intermediate cardiovascul ar risk patients were enrolled was an identified limitation.

Huang*; Wuhan/CN (304527885@qq.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognosti c value of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to p redict the risk of all- cause mortality in cancer patients in a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Methods or Background: A total of 331 patients who previously had cancer and underwent coronary CTA from January 2015 to Dec ember 2019 were included. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and propensity-score matching analysis were performed. The primary endpoint was all-cause of mortality. Results or Findings: In total, 125 patients with obstructive coronary ar tery disease (CAD) and 206 with non-obstructive CAD duri ng a median follow-up of 3.3 years were included in this study. After PSM, age (HR, 1.040; factors for all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Obstructive CAD evaluated by coronary CTA was found to be at higher risk for developing all-cause mortality in c ancer patients. Limitations: A number of limitations were identified. Firstly, this study was a retrospective study with potential for selection bi as and missing values. To overcome these limitations we performed Cox multivariate analysis and propensity-matching analysis with adjustment for po tential confounders, but we could not adjust for unmeasured potential confounders. Secondly, there was a lack of information on duration between CAD diagnos is and cancer diagnosis. Finally, the follow-up duration was relatively shor t to assess the long-term all- cause mortality. Nevertheless, this study suggests that coronary CTA will be instrumental in risk stratification of cancer patients. Further studies are needed to better define these observations.

Vignale*, A. Palmisano, C. Colantoni, V. Nicole tti, Esposito; Acute pain with mild troponin rise represents a diagnostic conundrum. A recent study (doi:10.1148/radiol.211288) demonstrated the diagnostic value of a late contrast enhancement (LC E) scan in addition to coronary CT angiography (CTA) in patients with non- obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the value of LCE in patients with obstructive CAD is undetermined. Methods or Background: Prospective study on 36 patients (men=20 [58%], median age 64 [IQR48-77] years) presenting to emerg ency department with acute chest pain or anginal equivalent with troponi n rise (median 154 [IQR45- 510] ng/L) undergoing CTA (to evaluate CAD status a nd wall motion abnormalities) with LCE for myocardial tissue characterisation. Results or Findings: Fourteen (39%) patients had negative CTA: at LCE, 9 (64%) had myocarditis, 3 (21%) and 2 with obstructive CAD (stenosis >50%) involving one v essel in 16 (73%) and two and three vessels in 3 (13.5%) each. Among these, 12 (55%) had ischaemic LCE, mostly with transmural distribution (10 [83%]) involving a median of 4 [IQR: 3-5] segments, with microvascular obstruction (MVO) in 3 (30%). Two (17%) had subendocardial LCE involving two segments . LCE was always in the territory of obstructive lesion in one-vessel C AD (9 [75%]) and in the territory of worse stenosis in multi-vessel CAD (3 [25%]). Ten (45%) patients with obstructive CAD had preserved wall thickness and no LCE, with hypokinesia in 6 (60%), and were diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Conclusion: This study confirms the value of LCE in patients wi th negative CTA. Furthermore, it shows that in patients with ob structive CAD, LCE can detect loss of viable myocardium and predictors of worse prognosis (MVO and transmurality) and helps in identifying the culprit lesion, especially in multivessel CAD, thus guiding revascularisation.

Arunachalam; Jodhpur/IN (drsmilysharma@gmail.com) The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluat e the prevalence and extent of mitral annular disjunction (MAD) in a normal population without any evidence of arrhythmias. Methods or Background: Using CT coronary angiography scans of patients referred to our institute, a comprehensive 3D morphometric analysis of the presence and circumferential extent of MAD was cond ucted from August 2021 to January 2022. A total of 50 consecutive patients each from age groups <40 years, 40-50 years, 50-60 years, and >60 years were selected, making a total of 200 patients. Patients with evidence of arrhythm ias and mitral valve disease were excluded. Systolic datasets were evaluated for the presence of fibrous separation between the posterior mitral leaflet and left ventricular myocardium by rotating the view plane around the centre of the mitral valve. The maximum degree of disjunction was recorded, if present. Results or Findings: MAD was present in 122 patients (61%) with the most frequent involvement of P1 (n: 94) and P3 (n: 74) s callops to age-wise distrib ution, MAD was present in 53% of the patients with age <40 years, 60% of the patients with age 40-50 years, 46% of the patients with age 50-60 years, an d 66 % in age >60 years. The mean distance of MAD involving P1 was 1.1+/- 1. 3 mm, P2 was 0.78 +/- 1.3 mm and P3 was 0.97 +/- 1.3 mm. Conclusion: MAD is a common finding in CT coronary angiography with maximal involvement of P1 and P3 scallops of the posterior mitral valve leaflet. There is no significant statistical difference in t he prevalence of mitral annular disjunction in different age groups. Limitations: The following limitations were identified: this was a single-centre study; patients with coronary artery disease were not excluded from the study.

Priyadharshinee*, P. A, K. Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu/IN (atypicaldoc@gmail.com) Purpose: To study the spectrum of findings in additional car diac screening during evaluation of acute multiphasic CT angiograp hy (CTA) in ischemic stroke patients of suspected embolic aetiology, on a dual energy CT scanner. Methods or Background: Cardioembolic stroke requires early detection due to differences in antithrombotic management. Curren tly, they are mostly detected in the subacute phase using echocardiography. This single-centre, observational prospective open pilot study included stroke patients with suspected cardioembolic aetiology who underwent CT cardiac screening as part of the initial CTA and findings w ere noted. Multiphasic CT cerebral angiography was carried out with dual sour ce DECT with bolus- tracking method, followed by venous phase cardiac s creening with retrospective ECG-gated DE acquisition and half-rot ation reconstruction. DE perfusion blood volume (PBV) application was used t o identify potential sources of embolism. A total of 37 patients were included in the study. Results or Findings: Out of the 37 patients, 14 patients had abnormal cardiac findings on CT: Clot detection CT angiography was 5 out of 37 (13.5%). Conclusion: Including ECG-gated cardiac screening in multiphasi c cerebral CTA of acute ischemic stroke patients enhances the diagnostic yield of detecting cardioembolic causes. ECG-gated cardiac s creening as a part of routine cerebral CTA during the acute phase may be a promising adjunct in cardiac thrombi detection in patients with ischemic stroke of suspected embolic aetiology. Limitations: An identified limitation was the small sample size. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Diagnosis (Dementia/MS) and reading time were documented. Additionally, the system's subjective influence on the radiological report was surveyed. Results or Findings: The median assessment time was significantly reduce d by 25% when mdbrain was used (p < 0.001) equivalent to 1:56min. This reduction was significant for both diagnoses, and m ore pronounced for dementia (-57%) compared to MS cases (-13%). We fur ther observed a strong correlation between years of experience in radiology vs reduction of reading times (R=0.76, p=0.05). Radiologists reported that mdbrain had a diagnostic impact in 118/128 AI-aided assessments. Among these cases, radiologist reported that mdbrain \"reinforced their original as sessment\" in 76 cases, \"enabled a clearer diagnosis\" in 25 cases, \"reported anomalies that could have been missed\" in 7 cases, and \"lead to confusion or less clear diagnosis\" in 9 cases. Therefore, mdbrain had a positive diagnostic impact in 108 out of 128 cases (84%). Conclusion: In the majority of cases (84%) the AI-based system had a positive qualitative impact on the diagnostic process. In terms of efficiency, we observed a clear drop in reading times (median -25% ) whereas the effect was more pronounced in dementia (median -57%). Limitations: There was limited control of the length of personal experience with the AI-system and the sample size was rather l ow with distribution of dementia and MS cases uneven across participants.

Methods or Background: We retrieved 84 CT-scans acquisition of 29 patients acquired at the hospital CHUGA (Grenoble, France). We automatically segmented intraparenchymal (IPH), extra-axial (EAH) , intraventricular hemorrhage (EAH) CNN B LAST-CT [Monteiro, 2020], pre-trained on 184 scans. We then manually c orrected these segmentations to obtain a ground truth. Then, we ev aluated the performance of 3 deep learning models (DeepMedic-based architec ture) to perform a multiclass CT-scan segmentation: i) a new model trained from scratch, ii) the pre-trained model from BLAST-CT and ii) the pre-trained model from BLAST- CT fine-tuned on our data set. Performances on the test data set were measured as mean Dice score for each lesion type. Results or Findings: On our test data set, BLAST-CT provided Dice scores of 0.351, 0.295, 0.140, 0.108 on HIP, EAH, oedema and IVH respectively. The new model trained from scratch provided better results (0.425, 0.417, 0.510, 0.459) 0.593, 0.493). Conclusion: Based on our results, it seems more efficient to fi ne-tune a pre- trained model in order to perform a multiclass CT-s can segmentation of traumatic brain lesions. Limitations: BLAST-CT was trained on manual segmentations and CT -scans which may be different from ours because of inter-observer and inter- acquisition variabilities. Other metrics beside the Dice could be used to evaluate the segmentations.

Methods or Background: We developed a deep learning method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) using Unet as generator network to upsample MRSI by a factor of 4. Neural networks wer e trained on simulated metabolic images from 75 glioma patients. The performance of deep neuronal networks was evaluated on MRSI data measured in 20 glioma patients and 10 healthy controls at 3T with a whole-brain 3D MRSI protocol optimised for detection of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). To further enhance the structural details of metabolic maps we used prior information from high resolution anatomical MR imaging. Super-resolution MRSI was compared to ground truth by Mann-Whitney U-test of peak SNR (PSNR), structur e similarity index measure (SSIM), feature based similarity index meas ure (FSIM), and mean- opinion-score (MOS). Results or Findings: proposed PSNR by 17%, by 5%, FSIM and MOS by 30% compared to conventional interpolation methods. In mutant IDH glioma patients the proposed method provided the highest resolution for 2HG maps that delineate clearly tumor margins and tumor heterogeneity. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the proposed deep learning methods are effective in enhancing the spatial resolution of metabolite maps. The results for the MRSI data acquired in glioma patients suggest t hat the proposed methods have great clinical potential for image guided ther apy of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy to deliver precision oncology.

This study aims to evaluate a DL im plementation for the automatic detection of intracranial head studies. Methods or Background: The DL algorithm was trained and externally validated on open-source, multi-centre retrospectiv e data containing radiologist-annotated NCCT head studies, from research centres across Canada, the United States, Brazil and India. To imp rove model performance, all input NCCT images were preprocessed, using CT i mage windowing and neural network-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) f ramework was used, instead of a single CNN alone. The area under the r eceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was used to evaluate model performance. To increase explainability, the developed model also output heatmap images which highlighted input image pixels which contribu ted most significantly to the model's final predictions. Results or Findings: The training and test datasets contained 21,744 and 491 NCCT head studies, respectively, with 8,882 (40.8%) and 205 (41.8%) positive for intracranial haemorrhage. For the detection of any intracranial haemorrhage, and the subtypes of EDH, ICH, IVH, 0.966, 0.971, 0.983, 0.991, 0. 949, and 0.953, respectively. Additionally, the generated heatmap i mages showed potential benefit in helping to rationalise the predictions ( both correct and incorrect) produced by the model. Conclusion: The DL model accurately detected intracranial haemorrhage and its subtypes, demonstrating clinical potential as a decision support tool and an automated system to improve radiologist workflow ef ficiency.

Purpose: Early recurrence of glioblastoma after standard treatment makes patient care challenging. This study aimed to asses s preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics for predicting early recurrence of glioblastoma. Methods or Background: A total of 122 patients (training cohort: n = 86; validation cohort: n = 36) with pathologically conf irmed glioblastoma were included in this retrospective study. Preoperative brain MRI images were analysed for both radiomics and the Visually Access ible Rembrandt Image (VASARI) features of glioblastoma. Models incorpora ting MRI radiomics, the VASARI parameters, and clinical variables were developed and presented in a nomogram. Performance was assessed based on calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Results or Findings: The nomogram consisting of the radiomic signatures, the VASARI parameters, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN ) values showed good discrimination between patients with early recurrence and those with later recurrence, with an area under the curve of 0.85 (9 5% CI, 0.77-0.94) in the training cohort and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71-0.97) in a v alidation cohort. Decision curve analysis demonstrated favourable clinical application of the nomogram. Conclusion: This study shows the potential usefulness of preope rative brain MRI radiomics in predicting the early recurrence of glioblastoma, which should help in personalised management of glioblastoma. Limitations: This study had several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study at a single institution, limiting the general isability of our study results. In addition, our sample size was still modest for a radiomic study, given the heterogeneous nature of GBM. Lastly, we used 2D tex ture features of the brain MRI images. A 3D approach for textural features may offer more information about the entire tumor, which may improve predictiv e model performance.

Galijaevi *, N. Gruber, M. Regodic, R. Steiger, A . E. Janjic; /AT (malikgalijasevic@icloud.com) Purpose: To access differences the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) myelination between very preterm neonates wi th favourable and those with poor motor outcome scores using convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach. Methods or Background: 498 very preterm neonates received an MRI at term-equivalent age and were included in the study. Training data consisted of 100 T1 weighted images with the PLIC manually segmented by an expert. Another 398 images were segmented automatically usi ng an in-house developed CNN. To extract morphometric parameters o f PLIC on one specific level we employed a CNN performing a smoothed versi on of slice selection. The motor outcomes were determined using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development at 1 year of age. Infants with motor sc ores above 85 were regarded to have a normal motor outcome, the infant s with scores below 85 were considered to have delayed outcome, whereas infants with motor scores below 70 were considered to have impaired outcome. Results or Findings: On the chosen level at the boundary between the mid dle and upper third of the thalamus, the PLIC was signi ficantly larger in neonates with the normal motor outcome than in the neonates with the impaired outcome (p<0.0001 for right side, and p<0.01 for left side) . Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 277 Conclusion: Our preliminary results could indicate a significantly larger PLIC in neonates with the normal motor outcome than thos e with impaired motor outcome. Our research group is currently conducting further studies to evaluate prediction possibilities of CNN-based algorithms regarding outcomes in very preterm neonates.

Deprest*\u00b9, L. Fidon\u00b2, F. De Keyzer\u00b3, M. To evaluate a novel automatic segmentation algorithm for the segmentation of different fetal brain structures by using a set of exclusively abnormal brains. Methods or Background: Background: Fetal brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is clinically used to characterise fetal br ain abnormalities. Recently algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct high r esolution 3D fetal brain volumes from 2D-slices. Using these reconstructions , convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been developed for automatic im age segmentation to avoid labour-intensive manual annotations, usually trained on data of normal fetal brains. Herein, we test the performance of an algorithm specifically developed for brain anomalies. Methods: Single centre retrospective study on MR-im ages of sixteen randomly selected fetuses with severe central nervous system anomalies (gestation: 21- 39 weeks). T2-weighted 2D-slices were converted to 3D-volumes using a super-resolution reconstruction algorithm. The acquired volumetric data was then processed by a novel CNN, trained using distri butionally robust optimisation, to perform segmentations of white mat ter, ventricular system and cerebellum. These were compared to manual segmentat ion using Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance and volume difference. Using interquartile ranges, outliers of these metrics were identified a nd further analysed in detail. Results or Findings: The mean Dice coefficient was 96.2, 93.7 and 94.7% for white matter, ventricular system and cerebellum res pectively. The Hausdorff distance was 1.1, 2.3 and 1.6 mm respectively. The volume difference was 1.6, 1.4 and 0.3 ml respectively. Of the 126 parameters there were sixteen outliers among five fetuses, discussed on a case-by-case bas is. Conclusion: We obtained excellent results on archived brain MRI s of fetuses with severe brain abnormalities. Analysis of the ou tliers shows the need to include pathologies underrepresented in the current training set. Quality control to prevent occasional errors is still needed. Limitations: The fact that the number of cases for each pathology is rather small was identified as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Steiglechner, B. Purpose: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people. Especially early stratification of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into patients who will convert to AD remains a challenging task. We aimed to predict automatically whether MCI patients will develop the disease (MCIc) by following subjects over time and quantifying spatial atrophy rates (AR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods or Background: 3D T1w MRIs at 3T from 276 MCI patients participating in the first period of Alzheimer's Di sease National Initiative (ADNI- 1) with at least two MRIs more than 60 days apart w ithout evident artifacts were segmented by a deep-learning-based 3D-UNet int o 30 anatomical regions. Z-scores of TIV-adjusted volumes were calc ulated compared to a normal reference population, and AR of these z-scor es were calculated longitudinally per subject (AR=0 normal aging). Rol ling AR were calculated as the mean AR over a half-year time window (mRAR). A 80:20 train-test-partition was used to train a logistic regression to discrimi nate MCIc vs MCInc. Results or Findings: We found regional mRAR in MCIc. The temporal cortex and hippocampal regions showed the most striking mRAR. On the test set, of 34 MCIc, the classifier predicted 27 as true positive with a median of 1.7 Y (Q1/3=2.0/0.6Y) before conversion ( sensitivity=0.79), specificity=0.77, AUC ROC=0.81). Conclusion: Our method provides reliable results due to a stabl e specificity that can be obtained well before previous clinical diagnoses for conversions to disease. Therefore, it is suitable for use in subse quent studies. Limitations: Validation in an independent sample is missing. Ethics committee approval: This study has been approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: AFI project #18052 Author Disclosures: Tobias Lindig: Research/Grant Steiglechner: Grant Recipient: AFI project #18052 Benjamin Bender: Founder: CTO and Co-founder of AIR Support: AFI projec prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high mortality and long-term morbidity and thus has a significant over all health-economic impact. The overall outcome is especially poor if the onset of ICH is unknown, but reliable radiological methods to determine this exactly do not exist. Therefore, the aim of our work was to investigate a machine learning (AI)-based age- prediction of ICH. Methods or Background: First, we selected 7421 CT-datasets with proven ICH and trained an automated ICH-segmentation-algor ithm. Afterwards, for 622 datasets (bleeding age<48h) a comparison of our AI-based age-prediction with the anamnestically known onset-times of ICH was performed. Additionally, we performed manual age-prediction by two radiologi sts from 117 datasets and compared the results with the AI-based approach. Results or Findings: Age-prediction by both AI and radiologists was only partially accurate with a mean absolute error (in h ours) of 9.77 (95%CI significantly inferior (p=0.0067 rater1; p=0.0453 rater2) to the AI. However, the performance of the AI was equal (with no significan t difference, p=0.3104) to simply taking the mean bleeding age of the dataset (15 hours) as prediction. Conclusion: To our knowledge, such an AI-based approach has nev er been performed. Nevertheless, our results confirm the as sumption that, in principle, no data on ICH-age can be extracted exactly from the image information of a CT-dataset. Possible therapy decisions (blood-press ure regulation, drug- therapy approaches) can thus only be derived to a l imited extent. Limitations: Limitations include the relative imprecision of the ICH-onset-data (history only) and the relatively small dataset for an AI-based study. It is possible that follow-up-studies with a significantl y larger data set can provide further relevant information.

Methods or Background: We included a total of 295 subjects (143 clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD), 152 Cognitively normal (CN) subjects) who had 3D T1-weighted images. The included AD pati ents and CN controls were matched with gender, age, education years (p-v alue=1.00, 0.69 and 0.18, respectively). All included subjects (n=295) structural MRI (sMRI), amyloid PET (AV45) and FDG-PET (FDG), and majority of the subjects (n=260) underwent total tau (tTAU) and phosphorylat ed tau (pTAU) PET. A previously developed deep learning-based AD predict ion algorithm which was trained with 100 sMRIs of AD and CN subjects using Inception-v4 architecture (sMRI-based AI algorithm), was utilised for the analysis and prediction of AD using sMRI. The diagnostic performances of the sMRI -based AI algorithm and other imaging biomarkers are assessed and compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC. Results or Findings: The accuracy and sensitivity and specificity of sMR I- based AI algorithm, for 45, 83.7, 84.6 and 82.9 for FDG, 73.5, 78.1 and 68.9 for tTAU and 74.6, 82.8 and 66.6 for pTAU, respectively. AUC 0.95 for sMRI-based for tTAU and 0.82 for pTAU. From the comparison of ROC curves, the sMRI-based AI algorithm exhibited signi ficantly better diagnostic (p<0.00 1). Conclusion: The sMRI-based AI algorithm demonstrated significantly superior diagnostic performance in distinguishing AD patient s from CN, compared to other imaging biomarkers. Limitations: This was a retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review boards have approved this study. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: prediction of AD progression from MCI usi ng deep learning D. S. Lee, H. Oh, J. Sung, K-H. Jung, *W. Jung*; Se oul/KR (wooseok.jung@vuno.co) Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the prediction performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting conversion of MCI to dementia. Methods or Background: This study included 284 MCI patients (144 early MCI (EMCI) and 140 late MCI (LMCI) patients) who un derwent 3D T1-weighted MRI. Among them, 52 MCI patients went through conve rsion from MCI to AD within 3 years from being diagnosed with MCI. A pre viously developed deep learning-based AD prediction model was utilised for the analysis of structural MRI. The output of the model was presented as an AD score. AD scores from the deep learning model were compared between EMCI vs. LMCI patients and patients who converted to AD vs. those who did not. Thereafter, the performance of AD score in predicting conversion of MCI to dementia was analysed and compared with that of amyloid PET. Results or Findings: The average AD scores were 0.38 for EMCI and 0.60 f or LMCI (p<0.001) and 0.69 for patients who converted to AD and 0.41 for patients who did not (p<0.001). When a cut-off of 0.38 was applied for AD score, accuracies and AUC were 0.83 and 0.77 for AD score and 0.92 and 0.82 for amyloid PET in predicting dementia conversion from MCI (p= 0.140 and 0.270 for difference). Accuracies of AD score and amyloid- PET were 0.73 and for EMCI (p=0.280), 0.85 and 0.93 for LMCI (p=0.292). There was no statistically significant difference in prediction performance between the two modalities. Conclusion: A deep learning-based AD prediction model using MRI showed comparable performance in predicting conversion of MCI to dementia in both EMCI and LMCI patients to amyloid PET. Limitations: This was a retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: Institutional review boards have approved this study. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author Disclosures: Research Presentation Session: Breast RPS 1502 Early diagnosis and breast lesions RPS 1502-2 Simultaneous multiparametric cancer Clauser*\u00b9, L. \u00b3Milan/IT (clauser.p@hotmail.it) of simultaneous multiparametric [18F]-fluoroethylcholine (FEC) PET- MRI of the breast. Methods or Background: This is a prospective single-centre study. Lesions classified as BI-RADS 3, 4, 5 on mammography, tomos ynthesis and/or ultrasound no contraindications to [18F]-fluoro ethylcholine PET-MRI were included. Histology reference sta ndard. Hybrid [18F]- fluoroethylcholine PET-MRI of the breast was perfor med in a prone position with a dedicated 16-channel MRI breast coil. Two br east fellows (R1, R2) evaluated contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI using BI-RADS, measured the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and qualitativ ely evaluated FEC-uptake using a four-point scale. A nuclear medicine specialist measured the maximum standardized FEC-uptake vale (SUVmax) of the CE-MRI findings. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for quantitati ve measurements. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using t hree reading methods: CE- MRI, CE-MRI+ADC, CE-MRI+ADC+PET-FEC. Results or Findings: 101 patients (mean age 52.3 years, standard deviati on 12.0) with 122 lesions were included (38 benign, 84 malignant). AUC for PET- FEC was 0.859; AUC 1 (R2, P>0.101). Sensitivity ranged from 92.9% to 98.1%, with no significant difference between reading methods. Specificity improved from MRI to M RI+ADC P=0.172). P ET-FEC did not influence the performance of R2. Conclusion: Breast MRI has a very high sensitivity. Simultaneous multiparametric [18F]-fluoroethylcholine PET-MRI of the breast can improve the specificity of CE-MRI.

Tsai*; Taipei/TW Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the combi nation of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imagin g (DCE-MRI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weigh ted imaging (DWI), and pathology factors for predicting the risk of breast cancer recurrence as given by four gene assays. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 289 women (mean age, 49+10 years) with biopsy-proven breast c ancer undergoing 1.5T DCE-MRI and IVIM between January 2014 and August 2017. Included patients were assigned into two groups: the training dataset consisting of 202 (70%) patients and the testing dataset consisting of 87 ( 30%) patients. Subgroup analysis of 158 oestrogen-positive, progesterone-positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer patients also was conducted. Thirty-s ix DCE-MRI and IVIM parameters and 7 pathology factors were obtained. A NOVA and Chi-square test were used for feature selection. Multiple linear regression (of the training data) was used for each risk scores prediction model. Log rank test was used for the comparison of survival risk groups. The res earch versions of PAM50, Mammaprint, OncotypeDX and EPClinic recurrence risk scores based on microarray data were used. Results or Findings: For patients in the testing dataset, the radiomic- pathology models had high accuracy and area under t he curve (AUC) values in distinguishing between high dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, int ravoxel incoherent motion imaging, and pathology features p redicted breast cancer recurrence risk with high diagnostic performance.

Methods or Background: From a retrospective 2015-2019 series of ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies performed by four board-certified breast radiologists using six ultrasound systems fr om three vendors, we collected 821 images of 834 suspicious breast masse s from 819 patients (806 women and 13 men), resulting into 404 malignant and 430 benign lesions at histopathology. A balanced image set of biopsy-prov en benign (n=299) and malignant (n=299) lesions were used for training an d cross-validation of ensembles of different machine learning algorithms, using histopathology as the reference standard. External testing was perfor med on two further datasets including a total of 236 lesions. Results or Findings: Based on the majority vote of the classifiers (>80% of the votes for a valid prediction of benign lesion), the ensemble of support vector machines showed a reduction in the biopsy rate of benign lesions of 15- 18%, when tested on the two external datasets: 1) 1 23 lesions (51 malignant and 72 benign) obtained from the same ultrasound sy stems used for training, resulting into a 45.4% positive predictive value (P PV) (95% sensitivity (95% CI 86.5-99.5%); 2) 113 lesions (54 malignant and 59 benign) obtained from two ultrasound systems different from those used for training, resulting into a 51.6% PPV (95% CI 40.4 Our model can support radiologists towards decision of follow-up versus biopsy for suspicious breast lesions, providing an over 15% reduction in the biopsy rate while still guaranteeing very high sensitivity.

Li*\u00b9, R. Ouyang\u00b9, X. Lin\u00b9, J. CA/US (LL_smu@163.com) Purpose: To explore the value of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of breast asymmetrical lesions in mammogr ams and its comparison with junior radiologists. Methods or Background: The mammograms of 100 patients with asymmetrical lesions confirmed by mammography were retrospectively analysed. According to the criteria in the fifth edition of BI-RADS, two senior radiologists specialising in breast imaging diagnos is manually segmented the area of the asymmetrical lesions. A deep learning-b ased AI system was trained to detect asymmetrical lesions. We evaluate the per formance of the AI system on these mammograms and compare it with the interpr etation of a junior radiologist, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and the accuracy of lesion detection and suspicious malignancy classification. Results or Findings: Of the 400 mammogram images, 157 were positive and 243 were negative of asymmetrical lesions. The results of the AI system, in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, wer e 0.65, 0.82 and 75.3% respectively. The junior radiologist achieved 0.84, 0.98 and 92.5% respectively. Of the 33 asymmetrical lesion cases, 8 needed biops y tests to identify the malignancy of the lesions. For this suspicious mali gnancy classification task, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the AI were 0.75, 0.92 and 88.8%, while the junior radiologist's were 0.50, 0.64 and 60.6%. Conclusion: The current AI model is inferior to the junior radi ologists in detecting breast asymmetrical lesions (p<0.05). How ever, for malignancy classification of suspicious asymmetrical lesions, the AI exceeded the level of the junior radiologist in diagnostic sensitivity, s pecificity and accuracy (p<0.05). In particular, the AI's superior specificity rate i ndicates that AI is exceptionally good at identifying those benign asymmetrical lesio ns. Limitations: The size of the database is limited and this is a s ingle-centre research. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this work.

Methods or Background: MD of 297 BC-affected women was measured using BI-RADS and LIBRA. The association between MD phenotypes and histopathologic features of BC was assessed. A set of 33 global radiomic features were extracted from the ipsilateral mammogram, and receiver- operating characteristic curve analyses were perfor med to assess the abilities of these features to predict BC characteristics. Ka plan-Meier analysis and Cox- proportional hazards models were used to assess BC- specific survival due to MD. Results or Findings: MD showed no association with histopathologic features of BC. Tumours were commonly found in dense breast regions of patients with higher medians of percent density (PD) (p=0.001), d ense area lower medians of non-dense area (p<0.001). MD (BI-R ADS 4) was associated with 5-fold increased odds of tumours developing wi thin dense areas (OR, 4.99, 95% CI: 0.93-25.9). Tumours in dense regions exhibited HER2+ and in- situ characteristics (p 0.05). Histogram-based features predicted progester one status and tumour size (AUC 0.65-0.71 and 0. 65-0.67) respectively. GLRLM-based am ong younger women (AUC range: 0.710-0.863), and fractal features predicted tumour PD (AUC: 0.704). The 5-year cance r-specific survival for low MD (<20%) was 0.35 (95% CI :0.13 - 0.97) compared to those with high MD (0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 - 0.96). Low MD increased the death from BC (HR, 5.17, 95% CI: 1.97-13.5). mammogram predict lymph-node status and tumour size, and low MD is associated with poor BC-specific survival. Limitations: Our sample size was small due to the small number of cancer events.

Weaver*, M. E. Scoggins, B. E. Adrada, that is s usceptible to superimposition artefacts, which can affect both lo w energy (LE) and subtracted contrast images (SCI). Benign enhancing findings (BEF) on SCI can create artefacts and mimic malignancy. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) may resolve some artefacts and reveal BEF in both c omponents of CESM. Methods or Background: Bilateral diagnostic CESM/DBT combination studies were performed for patients enrolled in four IRB-ap proved research protocols, using a full-field digital 2D/3D mammography system with CESM capabilities (Senographe Pristina, GE Healthcare). CESM and DBT exposures were done in quick succession under the same compression in s tandard views. The instances of DBT resolving artefacts and BEF on SCI were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analysed for the types of BEF, their imaging characteristics, and the anatomic cause. Results or Findings: Among 73 consecutive patients imaged with CESM/DBT, DBT resolved 18 BEF on SCI in 12 patients . The BEF imaging features on SCI were mass enhancement (44%, 8/18), view only. The anatomic structures mimicking pathology on SCI were vascular structures and enhancing skin lesions exact correlation of 2D, DBT, and CESM findings. This can improve the specificity of CESM and avoid additional imaging and biopsies by resolving artefacts and BEF on SCI. Yet the addition of DBT increases the radiation dose by ~66%. Further combined efforts of clinical researchers and equipment manufacturers ar e needed to investigate the CESM/DBT combination, and to minimise the radiation dose.

M. of breast lesions' borders is significant since determining the malignancy of a lesion is criticall y reliant on the lesion's morphological features. Therefore, accurate detecti on of the lesion boundaries can assist in automated breast tumours' classificat ion. So, this study has utilised the Mask R-CNN model as a practical approach to segment breast lesions. Methods or Background: In this study, we used Mask R-CNN architecture to segment breast lesions in ultrasound images automat ically. Mask R-CNN is a deep neural network for object instance segmentation that separates objects in an image and has two stages. The first stage propos es candidate object bounding boxes. The second stage predicts the objec t's class, refines the bounding box, and generates a binary mask on each r egion of interest (RoI). For training and evaluating the model, we utilised the combination of four datasets (public and private datasets). We selected 410 images per class. We used 90% of the dataset in the training stage and 10% in the testing stage. Results or Findings: This model was tested with 82 images. Dice coeffici ent (DC), Jaccard coefficient (JC), and mean squared er ror (MSE) are used to evaluate the network performance. We achieved 0.88 of DC, 0.81 of JC, and 0.018 of MSE on the test dataset. Conclusion: The attained results demonstrate that the Mask R-CN N can precisely delineate the borders of breast lesions. Consequently, it can help the radiologists and other automatic algorithms have a brighter view of lesions' morphology. Limitations: No limitations were identified in this study.

Uematsu*; Shizuoka/JP Purpose: To assess reader performance artificial computer- aided detection enhanced synthesised mammograms (AI CAD SM) versus original full-field digital mammograms (DM) are used alone or in combination with digital breast tomosynthesis images (DBT). Methods or Background: AI CAD SM has enhanced various structural patterns detected and extracted by AI CAD like tech nology from DBT images. A retrospective reader study compared the performance of multi-reader (n=4) reading multi-case (n=388) with 84 cancer cases, 83 benign cases, and 221 normal or benign cases with negative 1-year follow- up results. Each reading was independently interpreted with four reading modes: DM, AI CAD SM, DM with DBT, SM with Accuracy of proba bility of malignancy ratings and five-category forced breast imaging reporting and data system ratings were evaluated by using areas under the rec eiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the random-reader analysis. Results or Findings: Probability of malignancy based mean AUC values for DM, AI CAD SM, DM with and The mean AUC of AI C AD SM was significantly Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 281 higher (P=.002) than that of DM. The mean AUC of AI CAD SM alone and DM with DBT did not differ significantly (P=.264). The mean AUC of AI CAD SM with DBT was higher than that of DM with DBT and it approached significance (P=.066). Conclusion: AI CAD SM alone was superior to DM alone. AI CAD SM with DBT was also superior to DM with DBT although not s tatistically significant. AI CAD SM can replace DM in both screening and clinical setting. Limitations: This was a preliminary single-site retrospective st udy with a single manufacturer.

Vanhoenacker; Antwerp/BE RPS 1614-3 Role expansion in ultrasound: radiographers in European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS) countries G. Harrison\u00b9, M. R. V. Pedersen\u00b2, radiographer performed ultrasound in EFRS countries has been previously reported. In 2019/2020 several EFRS surveys evaluated radiographers working in ultrasou nd. These results aimed to investigate the prevalence of radiographer extended and advanced practice ultrasound roles and explore priorities for future career development. Methods or Background: Participants were recruited to an online cross- sectional survey by national societies of the EFRS and social media. Mixed questions were included, with some Likert scale opt ions to explore opinions. Descriptive statistics, chi square test and theme a nalysis were used to assess the results. Results or Findings: Radiographers from 58% of EFRS countries responded to the survey (n=561), predominantly the UK, Ireland and Spain (81%). Most undertook teaching (83.4%), fewer engaged in resear ch, audit and leadership. UK sonographers were more likely to communicate findings to patients (83.4%) and/or doctors (94.6%) than other respondents. Smal ler numbers refer for further examinations (UK=45.6%, non-UK=12.5%). A si gnificant difference (p<0.0001) was seen between those that do and do no t perform ultrasound in their country when asked if radiographers should pr ovide the final report on scans they perform. Commonly radiographers reported working in ultrasound to challenge themselves, increase knowledge, skills , responsibility and independent working. Most enjoyed ultrasound, but m any reported feeling undervalued. Future priorities varied between the U K, Ireland and other countries. Conclusion: Whilst many radiographers are independently perform ing ultrasound examinations, few outside the UK independently report and communicate the results to patients. Advanced pract ice skills including audit, research and leadership were less common amongst radiographers in ultrasound than teaching others. Priorities highlig hted in this study reflect previous work: legislation enabling independent reg ulated ultrasound practice, additional training opportunities and support from clinical colleagues to develop the role. Limitations: Limitations will be discussed, including survey lan guage. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Santos\u00b9, G. The practice of ultrasound by radiographers in Euro pe is well documented. Detailed individual radiographer involv ement in ultrasound needed further exploration, therefore, as part of a suite of surveys the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS ) this study investigated the examinations performed, extent of the role and legal responsibilities of radiographers performing ultrasound. Methods or Background: EFRS national societies (n=38) disseminated an online survey to members, along with social media r ecruitment of participants. The survey, included a mix of closed questions, free text options, and scale responses. Results or Findings: Responses were received from 561 radiographers: mean age 33.5 years, with 13.5 years ultrasound exp erience. Radiographers performed ultrasound in most respondent countries ( 92%). Reasons for not undertaking ultrasound included lack of available e ducation or legislation and/or limited/no support from medical colleagues. Academic level 7 education (diploma or master's) were most frequently cited fo r radiographers working within ultrasound. Common ultrasound examinations p erformed by radiographers were general medical, gynaecological, vascular and obstetrics. Of those undertaking ultrasound, 97.4% work indepen dently; 70.4% provide full interpretative reports, whilst 52% of those, predom inantly in UK and Ireland, give advice on further investigations. Over 50% of radiographers take responsibility for the report. 72% had professional indemnity insurance. Conclusion: Radiographers are involved in a wide range of ultrasound examinations, however ultrasound education, level of reporting and support for independent practice vary across countries. Recommendations to support radiographer career development in ultrasound, in c onjunction with legislative and radiology support, include team working, co-dev elopment of educational programmes, clear clinical protocols, up-skilling existing practitioners and auditing practice. Limitations: There was self-selection bias, inter-country differ ences and the survey was written in English, leading to potential for misinterpretation. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

P. G. Pissarra*\u00b9, L. P. V. Ribeiro \u00b2, S. I. Rodrigues\u00b9, R. P. P. Almeida\u00b9, A. are one of the most c ommon overuse injuries in sports. Ultrasound is a well-establishe d technique that has proven to be an ideal choice to characterise and evaluate thi s tendon. The aim of this study was to evaluate PT dimensions in sports pract itioners (SP), namely cyclists and volleyball players (VP), and non-sport s practitioners (NSP). Methods or Background: A sample of 115 individuals was recruited, of which 37 were cyclists, 38 VP, and 40 NSP. Length, thickness, and width of the PT were bilaterally measured using a longitudinal and transverse probe approach. The individuals were placed in supine with a 30\u00ba fl exion of the knee. Results or Findings: Results obtained demonstrate that cyclists and VP present increased values for PT length and thicknes s, since that statistically significant differences were found in length and thickness bilateral measurements between SP and NSP (p<0.003). Concerni ng physical activity level, significant differences were found, mostly between low and high levels, in the three dimensions measured bilaterally (p<0.004) . PT length, thickness, and width dimensions of both limbs' present correlations with gender and height, highlighting moderated to strong intensity values i n the PT length (0.520<r<0.601). Positive correlations of weak to m oderate intensity between the length and thickness dimensions with physical activity level in both limbs were valid (0.281<r<0.422). Conclusion: Physical activity stimulates the development and st abilisation of the patellar tendon, preventing associated pathologies. The evaluation of the PT through ultrasound is reliable and allows its me asurement and characterisation in several clinical situations, hi ghlighting the radiographer's fundamental role in the musculoskeletal field.

Purpose: We propose a method to optimise cancer detection th rough identification of key RAP characteristics that enha nce mammographic interpretation. A database of performance levels wi ll also be provided to act as a benchmark for interpretation standards. The objec tives are to: i. identify reader characteristics that promote optimal image i nterpretation; ii. create an evidence-base from which standards for interpretati on can be proposed. Methods or Background: The performance of 50 UK-based RAPs reading, a cloud-based test set of 60 mammographic cases with known results, will be assessed. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to record their characteristics. Sensitivity, specificity and recei ver operating characteristics (ROC) values will be established for each RAP and c orrelation techniques will be used to explore associations between characteris tics and image interpretation accuracy. Percentile values on performance levels for each of the three metrics will be provided, serving as init ial benchmarks for future evaluations. Results or Findings: This project is ongoing. The aim is to present prel iminary data on factors that promote optimum performance of RAPs. Collaborators are invited to be a part of this study which should for m the basis for optimising image interpretation. Causal agents linked to best performance will be identified as well as baseline values for diagnosti c efficacy. The author will also present a framework for the ongoing assessment of s tandards, available to all mammographic readers through the cloud. Conclusion: An exploration of casual agents that impact optimal interpretation as well as RAP-based standards will be developed to promote breast screen reading efficacy.

Azzopardi, *J. L. Portelli*, S. M. Mercieca; Msi da/MT (jonathan.portelli@um.edu.mt) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate radiographers' perception about their role in identifying and prov iding psychosocial support to cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Methods or Background: The study comprised of a prospective, non- experimental design that involved the distribution and collection of a paper questionnaire to all radiographers working at a radiotherapy department in Malta. The self-designed questionnaire contained 19 questions, including a few that were incorporated from other research studies following respective authors' permission. Results or Findings: Twenty one from twenty six radiographers completed the questionnaire anonymously, resulting in a response rate of 80.7%. All participants perceived the provision of psychosocial care to be highly important (71.4%, n=15/21) or important (28.6%, n=6/21). The majority of radiographers (85.71%, n=18/21) saw their primary role as care coordinators, linking patients to the right support resources. Participants felt m ost confident in providing counselling and support for treatment-related sympt oms and least confident in delivering psychosocial support. Lack of training ( 95.2%) was identified as the most common obstacle to providing psychosocial supp ort, followed by a lack of use of a screening tool (85.7%), an absence of envi ronmental space (76.2%), and a limited understanding in the field (61.9%). Conclusion: Despite radiographers acknowledging that the provis ion of psychosocial support was an important part of their role, this study identified various barriers that may be restricting them from doing so. In this regard, adequate training, the use of a psychosocial screening instrument and the implementation of clear referral process are recomm ended so as to enhance radiographers' ability to provide psychosocial support to their patients. Limitations: Small sample size restricts generalisation of the s tudy findings. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the University of Malta Research Ethics Committee.

Following on a previous presentation at ECR 2019, w e present part one of a longitudinal study examining the need for further CT postgraduate programmes. Two further factors are examined: professional body graduate attribute requirements for non-contrast CT head imaging, and the length of time taken for graduate radiographers to undertake CT scanning post- qualification. Methods or Background: This study set out to identify training requirement s for UK CT radiographers by investigating whether social and/or academic factors have an influence on students' approach tow ard CT dose optimisation both before and after qualification since the variation in CT doses across countries are primarily attributable to local choic es regarding technical parameters. In-depth interviews were analysed in a systematic and rigorous manner through thematic analysis following the Braun and Clarke qualitative data analysis framework. Results or Findings: Three themes were identified: education, dose optimisation, and culture. Student comments from the three themes respectively are shown: \"(...) if you get stuck doing one thing one way you think it is the only way to do this thing\"; \"Would like to have had protocols explanation of why they change\"; \"students just hel ping patients getting on and off table, hard to learn anything\". Mind maps of th emes can be seen in figures. Two years post qualification, a third of the students hadn't worked in CT. Conclusion: Whilst participants may have been aware of how to optimise dose from theory, many did not have the experience to do so in practice, with many not ever being allowed to optimise parameters under direct supervision. The question arises: is it reasonable to expect final y ear students to scan CT heads? Limitations: Part 1 of a longitudinal study.

A. C. Igwegbe*, F. B. Nkubli; Maiduguri/NG (igwegbea@gmail.com) Purpose: To highlight the lessons learned and experiences gained from previous attendance of the European Congress of Radiology (ECR) as an \"Invest in the Youth\" and \"Shape your Skills\" progr amme recipient. To highlight how the experience gained has been transferred to t he young generations of radiographers in Nigeria, thus building bridges acr oss the globe. Methods or Background: Realist review of series of activities and events embarked upon based on experience from previous ECR attended both onsite and online will be presented. Results or Findings: Talk shows and awareness creation to student radiographers during special days like student heal th week world radiography day celebrations have resulted in growing interest in ECR related activities. Series of side events held with the Nigerian Associ ation of Radiography students (NARS) during the General conference in 2019 and 2020. Interest among young generation of radiographers including s tudents in \"Invest in the youth\" and \"Shape your skills\" programme has increa sed over the years. This is evident by the current number of applications fr om Nigeria. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 283 Conclusion: In conclusion, the efforts of the sponsors of the \" Invest in the youth\" and \"Shape your skills\" programmes in buildi ng the next generation of radiographers are highly commendable. However, we w ould like to make a passionate appeal to the sponsors that the quota fo r the \"Shape your skills\" be increased for young professionals in resource poor settings especially those affected by armed conflict and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations: Extensive empirical data was not collected from par ticipants at our events to get their opinions. This does not how ever negate the relevance of this presentation.

Author short-ter m sequelae of COVID- (QCT) has been implemented to predict the prognosis of patients affected by COVID-19. In this prospective monocentric trial performed during the first wave of the Italia n COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed the evolution of respiratory symptoms at s hort-term follow-up and correlated them with abnormal QCT results. Methods or Background: From March to May 2020, all patients hospitalised for COVID-19 pneumonia received a non-contrast ches t CT upon admission and a clinical-radiological follow-up after 30-60 d ays. A quantitative analysis of segmented CT structures was performed, subdividing the total lung volume into hyperinflated, normally aerated, poorly aerated (%PAL), and non-aerated (%NNL); volume (%CL=%PAL+%NNL) was additionally computed. Results or Findings: Our study included 282 patients with complete clini cal and radiological data. Median lung QCT parameters w ere: 11% %CL and 9% 5 %CL and 4 %PAL at follow-up. T he median differences were 5% delta%CL and 3% delta%PAL. At control, 6 (2%) patients lamented residual dyspnoea, 13 (4%) reported generalised che st pain and 3 (1%) had residual uncontrollable coughing. After binomial logistic regression (OR<-0.01) correlated with %deltaPAL (OR=1.11). Conclusion: We reported a correlation between changing lung abnormalities measured by QCT, and residual symptoms at short-ter m follow up after COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT was able to quantify the ex tent of residual lung damage and may be used as an objective metric for t he measurement of COVID-19 sequelae. Limitations: Relatively small cohort of patients with short-term follow-up, lack of an established treatment regimen in the early pandemic phase, lack of instrumental pulmonary function tests at follow-up.

Cozzi*, E. Cavigli, S. Luvar\u00e0, A. Bindi, C. Mor oni, E. Comin, V. Miele; Firenze/IT (dilettacozzi@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim is to evaluate the characteristics of post- COVID-19 interstitial lung changes, with the unique opportunity to evaluate radiologic- pathologic correlations using HRCT and transbronchi al lung cryobiopsy specimens. Methods or Background: These are preliminary results of HRCT features of post-COVID-19 ILD. Authors collected data of hospit alised patients at baseline, then at 6 (+/-1) and 12 (+/-1) months after dischar ge. HRCT changes at 6 months involving more than 5% of the total lung vol ume were considered significant. Patients with significant HRCT changes underwent BAL and/or cryobiopsy and a subsequent follow-up with HRCT and lung function evaluation at 18 (+/-1) months. Results or Findings: At the time of the present interim analysis, 139 patients from our university hospital were enrolled (enrollm ent is still ongoing). Median age was 67 years (range 18-87), 85 were males (61.1%). After 1-year follow- up, HRCT significant changes (both fibrotic-like and non-fibrotic) were detected in 53 subjects (38.1%): of them, only 2/53 (3.8%) patients have parenchymal progression of the disease, stability in 33/53 (62. 3%) and improvement of lung involvement in 18/53 (33.9%). Cryobiopsies were per formed in 6 patients, showing some discordance with radiological appearance. In particular, biopsy find 2 cases of histological UIP/early-UIP where HR CT demonstrate an NSIP/OP pattern. Cryobiopsy confirm 1 case of HRCT UIP-probable pattern and 3 cases of NSIP/OP/HP pattern. Conclusion: This preliminary analysis confirms that after COVID -19 infection a large minority of patients develops interstitial lung changes mostly with NSIP/OP or (early) UIP pattern. The hypothesis is t hat the infection could be a trigger for a possible underlying latent interstiti al disease, in predisposed subjects. Limitations: Small simple size; patients with fibrotic-like chan ges (without histologic confirm), may need a longer follow-up to determine whether the fibrotic-like changes are permanent, progressive, or reversible.

Residual computed tomography (CT) lung ab normalities have been reported in COVID-19 pneumonia survivors. The study aim was to evaluate the association between inflammatory burden during COVI D-19 and short- and medium-term residual abnormalities on or Background: Follow-up CT scans, performed 2-3 and 6-7 months after COVID-19 pneumonia by survivors who experienc ed respiratory failure or had baseline CT extent of disease >40%, were retros pectively rmalities. C-reactive protein (CRP) curves describing inflammatory burden during the clinical course were built, and CRP peaks, velocities of increase, and i ntegrals were calculated. Other putative determinants were age, sex, mechanic al ventilation, lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio, D-dimer peak, and length of stay. Results or Findings: Out of the 259 included patients (median age 65 yea rs; 30.5% females), 202 (78%) and 100 non- fibrotic, CT at 6-7 months, age- and sex- adjusted models, best CRP predictors for residual abnormalities were CRP peak (odds ratio [OR] for one standard deviation [S D] increase=1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.23-2.62) at 2-3 integral (OR for one SD increase=2.24; CI=1.53-3.28) at 6-7 months. Conclusion: Mechanical ventilation and LOS were mediators of th e relationship between CRP and residual abnormalities . D-dimer, though associated with outcomes, was not a mediator of CRP .

Mercanzin*\u00b9, P. A. Bonaffini\u00b9, A. Corsi\u00b9, A. Ca To assess clinical status, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and radiological findings evolution from 3 to 12 months post-discharge in patients surviving severe COVID-19 pneumonia. To investigate the relation between functional and radiological findings. Methods or Background: Severe COVID-19 survivors, admitted between February 25th and May 2nd, 2020 and then undergone repeated pulmonary assessment and chest CT scans at 3 and 12 months post-discharge, were prospectively included. Patients with chronic pulmonary disease or COVID-19- unrelated complications were excluded. The pulmonar y assessment included PFT, laboratory testing, and symptoms. Pathological patient-reported outcomes were also registered. Unenhanced CT were a nalysed quantitatively (% compromised lung volume) and qualitatively (main pattern: ground-glass opacity/GGO, consolidation, reticular configuration). Patients were subsequently divided into groups based on their radiological trends. Results or Findings: Seventy-one patients were included. At 12-month pos t- discharge, all showed significantly improved laboratory tests and PFT. D-dimer values were low in patients with normal CT and higher in improved or stable abnormal CT (median values 213 vs 329 vs 1000 ng/mL , respectively). Sixty- three patients underwent CT: 14/63 The compromised lung volume reduced compa red with 3 months post-discharge (12.3 vs 14.4 %, p < 0.001). The CT pattern changed, with GGO reduction and reticular configuration increase. Conclusion: PFT were normal in most COVID-19 survivors 12 months post- discharge. CT structural abnormalities persisted (although mostly improved over time) and were associated with higher D-dimer values. Limitations: Limited sample size; acute and follow-up CT data no t available for a few patients; no patient-reported outcomes at 3 months post-discharge; no pre-COVID structural and functional findings.

I. Kuplevatskaya*, V. . Kuplevatsky, N. Berezina, M. Cherkashin; Saint Petersburg/RU Purpose: To assess the features of COVID-19 lung injury regr ession and to work out an algorithm of monitoring patients in dif ferent time periods after the disease. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of 1759 low-dose control CT scans was conducted in patients with a previous confirmed SARS-CoV-2 lung injury. All control CT studies were distributed to periods (pr), according to the time of primary study: Ipr-3-9 weeks after the prim ary CT, IIpr-3-4 months, IIIpr- 5-7 months, IVpr-8-12 months. The degree of involvement of each lung in addition to overall extent of lung involvement was also evaluated according to generally accepted CT score (CT1-CT4). Results or Findings: The follow-up CT changers were distributed by sever ity of lung injury: grade I (Igr), abnormalities with g round-glass opacity (GGO) low intensity; grade II (IIgr), scattered low intensity GGO with liner and reticular III of follow-up CT abnormalities remained aft er the COVID-19 lung injury. In patients with lung injury CT3 and CT4 in 33,25% of follow-up CT IIIgr and were observed in the IIpr. and CT2 37,03% of residual changes the IIpr, while in 41,66% of such patients IIgr persisted in the IIIpr. Significant differences were found in the severity of changes in the lungs depending on the primary CT (p=0.00225). Conclusion: The follow-up CT showed the necessity of dynamic CT in patients with COVID-19 CT3 and CT4 lung injury. Monitoring of lung abnormalities will allow timely rehabilitation and possibly prevent th e manifestations of lung fibrosis. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Monelli*\u00b9, G. Besutti\u00b9, S. pneumonia reported a variably high prevalence of residual chest CT abnormalities including fibrotic-like changes, heterogeneously defined. Our aim is to describe fol low-up chest CT features in a prospective cohort of severe COVID-19 survivors. Methods or Background: All consecutive COVID-19 survivors who received a follow-up CT scan 6-7 months after severe COVID-19 pneumonia in two Italian hospitals (Reggio Emilia and Parma) were enrolled. Individual chest CT findings collected by two expe rienced radiologists, categorised residual fibrotic When available, 12 months follow-up CT scans were also reviewed. Results or Findings: Of 405 included patients (234 from Reggio Emilia an d 171 from Parma), 225 (55.6%; 57.9% and 53.8% in the two cohorts) had complete resolution at 6-7 months, 152 (37.5%) had residual non-fibrotic abnormalities, while residual fibrotic and post-ven tilatory abnormalities were found in 18 (4.4%) and 10 (2.5%) patients, respecti vely. In the prevalent findings ground-glass opaciti es (GGO) (n=130/152), mainly barely visible (n=110/130) overt (n=20/130), and bronchiectasis (n=52/152). In the fibrotic group, h oneycombing was found 2 patients subpleural reticulation bronchiectasis (16/18) post-ventilatory group, respectively. Of the 25 pat ients with available 12 month follow-up CT scans, 14 had complete resolution, 7 had persistent non-fibrotic and 4 persistent fibrotic abnormalities. Conclusion: Residual abnormalities 6-7 months after severe COVI D-19 pneumonia are frequent (approximately 45%), but lar gely predominantly non- fibrotic, suggesting a slow resolution rather than persistent fibrotic changes. Limitations: An identified limitation is that there was scarce data at 12 months follow-up. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was received from AVEN Ethics Committee (855/2020/OSS/AUSLRE).

Wassipaul*, D. Kifjak, F. Prayer, R-I. Milos, M . Winter, M. Weber, H. Ringl, H. Prosch, B. H. Heidinger; Vienna/AT Purpose: To prospectively assess the diagnostic accuracy of ULDCT compared to LDCT for post-COVID-19 lung changes. Methods or Background: We included 155 consecutive post-COVID-19 patients referred for LDCT of the chest until Janua ry 2021 into this prospective study. All participants received both an LDCT and an unenhanced ULDCT. CT examinations were performed with a 3rd-generation 2 56-row MD-DSCT system with tin-filtration and tube current modulation enabled. LDCTs were performed with standard imaging parameters of 110kV/66ref.mAs and ULDCTs at 100kV/50ref.mAs. All CT images were evaluated by four radiologists (two expert radiologists, two residents) with regard to subjective image quality, the presence of residuals from COVID-19 pneumonia. Sens itivity and specificity were calculated. Results or Findings: 47 of the 155 participants (30.3%) showed lung abnormalities consistent with post-COVID-19 changes . Sensitivity and specificity of ULDCT compared to LDCT for detecting post-COVID-19 changes were 88.6% and 93.3%, respectively. The mean total dose length product (DLP) for ULDCTs was 13.7 mGy*cm (range 5.6-54.5) a nd one tenth of LDCTs with 138.2 mGy*cm (range 53.7-499.2). Mean effective dose of ULDCTs was 0.23 mSv, corresponding to approximately twice the mean effective dose of CXRs in two views (0.1 mSv). Conclusion: ULDCT has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting post- COVID-19 lung changes at about twice the mean effec tive dose of a CXR. Therefore, ULDCT might be a viable alternative to LDCT in the follow-up of COVID-19 patients. Limitations: Objective image quality was not evaluated.

Methods or Background: Consecutive patients with clinically indicated low- dose CT were scanned on the PCD-CT and compared to an EID-CT-cohort matched for BMI. Radiation dose, noise (standard deviation [SD] of CT values) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were measured for each patient. Additionally, image quality and conspicuity of four defined abdom inal structures (adrenals, mesenteric 5=excel lent Findings: Twenty patients (mean age 46.2 [range: 19-77]; 13 m en) were included. There was no significant difference in radiation dose between PCD-CT and EID-CT (1.61 vs. 1.45 mGy; p=0.21). Nois (24.89\u00b13.30 HU vs. p<0.001) and SNR significantly higher (2.08\u00b10.28 vs. 1.48\u00b10.35; p<0.001) on the PC D-CT. Subjective image quality was substantially higher (4.02\u00b10.28 vs. 3.0 8\u00b10.59; p<0.001) and conspicuity better for the renal pelvis, ureters an d mesenteric vessels on the PCD-CT. There was no significant difference in the conspicuity of the adrenals. With increasing BMI (1st to 4th BMI quartile), nois e increased and SNR decreased more strongly on the EID-CT than on the CD-CT vs. PCD-C T, respectively) while radiation dose increased comparably (70 vs. 59%). Conclusion: Low-dose CT scans of the abdomen performed on a nov el PCD- CT exhibit reduced noise, higher SNR, increased subjective image quality and superior conspicuity of abdominal fine structures c ompared to scans in comparable patients on an EID-CT.

Bastati-Huber, A. Ba-Ssalamah; Vienna/AT Purpose: To evaluate the effect of dilution and slow injecti on of gadoxetic acid (GA) using automated fluoroscopic triggering on the frequency of arterial- phase artifacts. Methods or Background: Three independent readers evaluated 1985 Liver MRIs routinely done with a fixed bolus of 10 ml GA diluted with 10 ml saline, Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 286 injected at 1 mL/s using automated fluoroscopic tri ggering on a 3T MR machine. All readers graded severity of artifacts a nd their impact on diagnostic performance on a 5-point-scale system. Two readers assessed the type of artifacts: Gibbs, TSM or both. One reader evaluated arterial-phase acquisition timing and the presence of ascites, pleural effusio ns and cirrhosis. Results or Findings: 1793 exams (male =852 (49.7%), female =863 (50.3%); with a mean age of 56.3 years), were inclu ded. In 366 (20.4%) exams there was ascites, in 319 (17.8%) pleural effusions and liver cirrhosis in of diagnostic qualit y included 1163 (64.9%) images without artifacts, 415 (23,1%) with minimal, and 171 (9,5%) with moderate artifacts. The exams were only non-diagnos tic in 44 patients (2,5%), 39 (2,2%) with severe arterial-phase artifacts and 5 (0,3%) uninterpretable images. The inter-rater agreement (Kappa =0.670, p< 0.001) was substantial. Acquisition timing for AP imaging was optimal in 15 67 (87,4%) exams. The number of artifacts found was significantly higher in the presence of ascites (p=0.002) and pleural effusions (p=<0.001), as well as in advanced age (p=0.006). A higher BMI (p=0,022) was found in subj ects with moderate artifacts, as compared to no artifacts. Conclusion: The combination of a diluted and slowly injected bolus of gadoxetic acid using MRI fluoroscopic triggering pr ovides properly-timed arterial phase imaging, and reduced severe or non-diagnostic artifacts in the arterial phase to only 2.5%.

Methods or Background: Eleven patients with pancreatic carcinoma (3 women, age: 63\u00b116 years) who underwent contrast-enhanced CT scans on were retrospectively analysed. Dark-blood images in late arterial phase were derived from spectral based images using a two-material decomposition met hod, where the first material was defined as the content of a region of interest placed in the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery for each pati ent. Two abdominal radiologists with 7 and 12 years' experience independently determined the tumour-vessel anatomy: 1. the type of involved vess els (intact, irregular or deformed) according to the tumour-vessel relationship; 2. the degree of tumour-vessel interface (abutment: 180\u00b0; 180\u00b0) involved, a third senior radiologist with 18 years' experience in abdominal radiology made the final diagnosis in the case of any disagreement s. Results or Findings: 48 involved arteries (18 abutment, 30 encasement) of 11 pancreatic cancer patients were detected in both CI and dark-blood images. The vessel walls of all abutment arteries were determined as intact in CI, while in dark-blood images 5 abutment arteries of 18 (27. 8%) were determined as contour irregularity, which would influence the diagnosis as \"borderline resectable\" instead of \"resectable\" according to NC CN criteria. In 30 encasement arteries, there were 28 deformed, 1 inta ct and 1 irregular contour in dark-blood images, compared with 25 deformed and 5 intact in CI. Conclusion: Dark-blood material decomposition method, which enhanced the visibility of vessel walls, could potentially improve diagnostic performance for preoperative staging of pancreatic cancer.

Grosu*\u00b9, Z. J. Wang\u00b2, M. \u00b2San Francisco, CA/US To different image reconstructions at dual -layer spectral- detector CT for reducing intestinal peristalsis-rel ated streak artifacts on the liver. Methods or Background: We retrospectively evaluated 220 contrast- enhanced abdominal dual-energy CT scans in 131 cons ecutive patients (mean age: 68\u00b110 years, 120 men) who iodine images). Two independent readers evaluated bowel peristalsis streak artifacts on the liver qualitatively on a five-poin t Likert scale (1=none to 5=severe) and quantitatively by depth of streak art ifact extension into the liver and measurements of Hounsfield Unit and iodine conc entration differences from normal liver. Artifact severity between image reconstructions were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank and paired t-tests . Results or Findings: Streak artifacts on the liver were seen in 51/208 ( 25%) CT scans and involved the left in 49/51 ( 96%), the right liver lobe and both liver lobes in 2/51 (4%) scans. Artifact frequency was lower in iodine than in 120kVp images (scans 18/208 vs. 51/208, p<0.001). Artifact severity was less in iodine than in 120kVp images (median score 1 vs. 3, p<0.001). Streak artifact extension into the liv er was shorter in iodine than 120kVp images (mean length 2\u00b14 vs. 12\u00b15 mm, p<0.001 ). ROI measurements differed significantly between bright streak artifacts and the neighboring unaffected liver parenchyma in 120kVp, 40keV, 200keV and VNC images (p<0.001, each), but not in iodine images (p=0.23). Conclusion: Iodine image reconstructions at dual-layer spectral -detector CT substantially reduced peristalsis-related streak ar tifacts on the liver.

T. J. \u00b2Forchheim/DE To assess the accuracy of virtual non-contrast images (VNC) of the abdomen acquired on clinical dual-source photon-counting detector CT (PCD- CT). Methods or Background: Seventy consecutive patients (mean age 73\u00b111, 20 female) undergoing a triphasic examination on a dual-source PCD-CT (Naeotom Alpha, Siemens) were included. VNC images from the arterial and portal venous phases were reconstructed. CT attenuation was measured in the liver, spleen, para vertebral and spongious bone. Attenuation of the VNC images was compared to the true unenhanced images (reference s tandard). Absolute error of attenuation (HUerror) was computed. Image noise texture was assessed by measuring the noise power spectrum (NPS) in a cylindrical water phantom. Results or Findings: NPS showed similar noise texture among VNC and true unenhanced images. Mean HUerror was less than 10HU for all regions except subcutaneous fat and spongious bone. Smallest HUerr or was found in the liver (2.4\u00b12.3HU) for the arterial and in the spleen (2.4\u00b11.8HU) for the venous VNC images. For liver and spleen, HUerror was less than 5HU in 86% of the cases. Highest HUerror was 24.3\u00b13.0HU/23.5\u00b13.1HU fat Conclusion: imaging of PCD-CT from arterial and portal venous phase demonstrated high accuracy with small error ranges compared with true unenhanced images in parenchymal organs of the abdomen. Limitations: A limitation of this study was that the impact of l esion detection and classification was not assessed. Ethics committee approval: This study was IRB approved.

Euler*\u00b9, Mergen\u00b9, \u00b2Erlangen/DE, Purpose: investigate the image quality and the optimal st rength level of a novel iterative reconstruction QIR (quantum iterati ve reconstruction) for virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) and polychromatic images (T3D) in a phantom and patients in portal venous abdominal PCD-CT. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured in a water-filled phantom. Consecutive oncologic patients who received a portal venous abdominal CT on a clinical PCD-CT between March and April 2021 were included. VMI at 60keV an d T3D were reconstructed without QIR (QIR-off) and with QIR at four levels (QIR1-4). Global noise index (GNI), CNR, and voxel-wise CT attenuation differences were measured. Noise and texture, artefacts, diagnostic confidence, and overall quality were assessed qualitatively. Conspi cuity of hypodense liver lesions was rated by four readers. Parametric and n on-parametric tests were used. Results or Findings: In the phantom, NPS showed unchanged noise texture across reconstructions. Fifty patients (mean age, 5 9 years \u00b116, 31 women) were included. GNI was reduced from QIR-off to QIR- 4 by 45% and by 44% for 60keV and T3D, respectively (P<.001). CNR of the li ver improved from QIR-off to QIR-4 by 74% from 11\u00b12.2 to 19.1\u00b14.5 19.4\u00b15.3 for 60 keV and T3D,respectively (P<.001). No evidence of a difference was found in mean attenuation of fat and liver (P=.79-P=.84) and on a voxel-wise basis among reconstructions. Qualitati vely, QIR-4 outperformed all other reconstructions in every category for 60k eV and T3D (P<.001-P=.01). All four readers rated QIR-4 nspicuity (P<.001-P=.04). Conclusion: In portal venous abdominal PCD-CT, high levels of Q IR improved image quality by reducing noise and improving CNR and lesion conspicuity without compromising image texture or CT attenuatio n values. Limitations: No limitation were identified. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by a local ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Lu, J. Gao; Zheng Zhou/CN (1193355391@qq.com) Purpose: To evaluate the impact of deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) on liver metastasis detection compared with iterati ve reconstruction. Methods or Background: Forty-five patients (23 men) underwent abdominal scans with data sets reconstructed using ASiR-V 60% , and DLIR (low, medium, and high strength levels) at 1.25mm slice t hickness. Metastases were defined by histopathologic analysis or progression and regression. After a portal venous pass with ASiR-V 60% images, a 70% reduced radiation dose pass was added with DLIR images. One reviewer scored ASiR-V image quality and marked findings. Two additional independent rev iewers noted whether marked findings were present on DLIR images and ass igned scores for relative conspicuity. Quantitative metrics (image noise, contrast to noise ratio [CNR], and signal to noise ratio [SNR]) and qualitative parameters (sharpness, artefacts, and overall image quality) were compared . Formal statistical inference for size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was made (paired t tests), with Bonferroni adjustment. Results or Findings: Two independent reviewers identified all ASiR-V image lesions (n=98) on DLIR images, scoring them as equal to or better than DLIR at low, medium and high strength levels for conspic uity in 96.9% (95 of 98), 97.9% (96 of 98) and 98.9% (97 of 98) , respectivel y. Compared to ASiR-V 60% images, DLIR images at medium or high strength levels showed similar or lower image noise, similar or higher CNR and SNR, s imilar scores in artefacts, and better perceived scores in sharpness and overal l image quality. For ASIR and MBIR, SSDE was mGy \u00b14.3 .1 (P< .001) respectively. Conclusion: Liver CT images reconstructed with DLIR may allow up to 70% radiation dose reduction compared with the dose wit h ASiR-V 60%, without compromising depiction of liver metastases or image quality.

Kim, *P. Y. Choi*; Seoul/KR (phillipchoi007@gmail.com) Purpose: To train and validate deep learning (DL) classification models for automatically detecting and differentiating maligna nt thyroid nodules from benign nodules on ultrasound (US) images and to com pare their performances to those of experienced radiologists. Methods or Background: US images of thyroid nodules of patients who underwent US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB) at our institution between January 2010 and March 2020 were retrospect ively reviewed. A total of 15409 images from 7321 patients (mean age, 60\u00b113 ) were randomly grouped into a training (n=12327) and validation (n=3082) set. Independent internal [n=432; mean age, 50\u00b114] and external [n=168; mean age, 52\u00b115] test datasets were also acquired. Four experienced radiologists independently classified the images of internal and external test datasets. Images of thyroid nodules were automatically segmented via DL algorit hm, which were subsequently trained using three different image-cl assification DL models (VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet). The accuracy, sensitivit y, specificity, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) of DL models were calculated for the internal and external test datas ets and compared with diagnoses by four radiologists. Results or Findings: All three DL models demonstrated higher diagnostic performances than four radiologists in both internal (AUC, 0.83-0.86 vs test datasets. VGG16 model demonstrated the highest diagnostic performance in both internal (AUC, 0.86; sensitivity, 91.8%; specificity, 73.2%) specificity, 76.8%) test datasets. Conclusion: The DL models overall demonstrated higher diagnosti c performances than experienced radiologists in disti nguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules on US images. DL classifi cation models may augment radiologists' diagnosis. Limitations: The reference standard was cytologic samples from F NAB.

Dolz*, V. V\u00e1zquez, E. Granell; S abadell/ES Purpose: Determine the diagnostic efficiency and assess mali gnancy risk stratification of the 2017 European Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (EU-TIRADS) in comparison to the 2017 Americ an College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS) management guidelines. Methods or Background: Retrospective study reviewing all fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules done following the EU-TIRADS at our center from January 2018 to December 2020. W e evaluated the ultrasound characteristics of all the nodules and r egrouped them according to ACR-TIRADS. The ACR-TIRADS criteria for FNAB differ slightly from those recommendations made by European guidelines. Low-ri sk lesions (TR3) require larger dimensions for FNAB in ACR-TIRADS compared to EU-TIRADS (25 vs 20mm). Regarding intermediate risk lesions ( TR4), the interpretation of ultrasound characteristics is somewhat different in ACR-TIRADS. We analysed FNABs done under the EU-TIRADS criteria that did not meet the ACR-TIRADS criteria and calculated the rate of malignancy for all this FNABs and for each subgroup in both systems. Results or Findings: Of 589 thyroid nodules biopsied, ACR-TIRADS criteri a for biopsy were unmet in 188 (31.9%): 33 nodules di d not meet the size condition, and 155 were not candidates for FNAB bec ause of their ultrasound characteristics. FNABs were inconclusive in 20 pati ents; in the remaining 168, only 1 (0.6%) was malignant, which was an ACR-TR3 m ixed cystic and solid hypoechoic nodule (papillary thyroid carcinoma). None of the nodules reclassified as ACR-TR2 were malignant. Conclusion: Using ACR-TIRADS would have decreased the number of FNABs by 31.9%; only 1 malignant nodule would have been missed (0.6%). Most of the nodules that did not meet ACR-TIRADS cr iteria were mixed cystic- solid isoechoic lesions (ACR-TR2), and all of them were benign. Limitations: Most of the pathological results are from FNAB, wit hout having surgical confirmation. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Del Gaudio*, D. Fresilli, Dolcetti, Wave Elastography (SWE) and Strain Ratio (SRE) accuracy alone and with TIRADS classification for indeterminate thyroid nodules at FNAC characterisation. Methods or Background: Preoperative staging neck ultrasound was performed on 160 patients candidates for thyroidect omy with 160 indeterminate nodules and were classified using K-T IRADS score. Subsequently, elastosonographic evaluation was perf ormed by of quantitative (SWE expressed in kPa) tative (SRE) and compared with post-thyroidectomy histological resul ts. The main aim was to asses diagnostic performance of each method, alone and in combination. 2x2 contingency tables and ROC curve analysis were made. To evaluate statistically significant differences (P-value <0.0 5), Bonferroni test was used. Liu test was used to calculate cut-off values to maximise SWE and SRE sensitivity and specificity. Results or Findings: (kPa expressed). SRE evaluation showed the best diagnost ic accuracy compared to the SWE (kPa expressed) (p<0.05) and to the K-TIRAD S (p>0.05). The association of SRE with conventional ultrasound wit h K-TIRADS score increased sensitivity (93% vs 71.5%) but decreased the specificity than conventional US alone (76.5% vs 82.5%). Conclusion: Strain US-Elastography (SRE) used in combination wi th K- TIRADS improves negative predictive value and sensi tivity in the thyroid nodule charaterisation with indeterminate cytology. Nevertheless, further multicentre studies on larger population are needed . Limitations: Still small population study, the lack of interoper ator variability computation.

Petrasova*; Brno/CZ (petrasovahana@gmail.com) Purpose: To extend and revise the diagnostic value of contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for differentiation between malignant and benign thyroid nodules. Methods or Background: This single-institution prospective study aims to compare CEUS qualitative and objective quantitative parameters in benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Consecutive cohort of 10 0 patients was examined by CEUS, 68 out of them were further analysed in detail. All included patients underwent cytological and/or histopathological veri fication of the diagnosis. Results or Findings: Fifty-five (81%) of thyroid nodules were benign and 13 (19%) were malignant. Ring enhancement was strongly associated with a benign diagnosis (positive predictive value 100%) a nd heterogeneous enhancement was associated with malignancy (positiv e predictive value 72,7%). The shape of the TIC (time-intensity curve) curves was more often identical in the benign lesion (98.2%) than in mali gnant lesions (69.2%), p=0.004. Conclusion: This study suggests that CEUS enhancement patterns were significantly different in benign and malignant les ions, and that ring enhancement was very helpful to identify benign les ions, whereas heterogeneous enhancement was helpful to detect mal ignant lesions. Limitations: Generally, there is a disagreement about the clinic al value of CEUS on the thyroid in the present literature. Over lapping data between CEUS qualitative and quantitative evaluation parameters and criteria of benign and malignant nodules indicate a limitation in the interpretation of tumor microvascularity. So far, there is no established s tandard for examination methodology, thus it is difficult to compare the re sults of different studies.

T. El-Diasty*, L. H. Meriky, A. O. Aludaini, M. A. T. Alharthy, A. Badeeb; Jeddah/SA (meldiasty@hotmail.com) Purpose: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobser ver variability in assessment of TI-RADS ultrasound features, final categories, and recommendations for nodule biopsy. Methods or Background: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with waiver of the infor med consent. We searched our database for patients who underwent thyroidectomy between 2016 and 2019 with available histopathological results and p reoperative ultrasound. Ultrasound images of the selected cases were collec ted, anonymised, and distributed among 2 third-year radiology trainees ( readers 1 & 2) and 2 board certified radiologists (readers 3 & 4 with 10 and 1 3 years of experience, respectively). All the readers performed the analys is independently and were blinded to the clinical data. Diagnostic performanc e of TIRADS was calculated for each reader. The Fleiss kappa ( ) statistics were applied to assess interobserver agreement of TI-RADS scoring results for thyroid nodules as well as the recommendations for biopsy. Results or Findings: After exclusion, a final cohort of 177 patients wer e included. 91 (51.4%) of the nodules were benign and 86 (48.6%) were Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 289 malignant. Reader 4 achieved the best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.766 compared to 0.53, 0.6 & 0.732 for readers 1,2 & 3 r espectively). The interobserver agreement among all readers was poor for both the TI-RADS category and biopsy recommendation ( =0.16 and 0.2 respectively). Individual readers comparison showed good agreement between reader 1 and 2 for the TI-RADS category and recommendations ( =0.747 and 0.79). Fair agreement was found between the other individual readers comparisons. Conclusion: Our results showed better diagnostic performance fo r experienced readers. However, the overall interobserver agreement regarding TIRADS assessment categories and recommendations was poor, which may be related to variability in experience level.

Methods or Background: One hundred and fifty-seven cervical LNs non- metastatic and 76 metastatic) were analysed. Fifty-nine cervical LNs (27 non-metastatic and 32 metastatic) diagnosis were affected by cervical root artifact using contrast-enhanced CT images. EC V fraction was calculated using an equilibrium-phase iodine map derived from DECT and SECT. Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis were applied to evaluate correlations between SECT and DECT derived ECV fractions. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves anal ysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance. Results or Findings: ECV fraction using DECT was strong correlated to that using SECT (r=0.883; p<0.001) with a small bias (-0.4). Metastatic cervical LNs showed significantly higher SECT and DECT derived E CV fraction than non- metastatic cervical LNs 22.53% vs 42.41%; p both <0.001). Optimal diagnostic performance was achieved with an AUC of 0.793 and 0.813, setting SECT and DECT fracti on of 34.99% and 36.45% as cut-off value. In LNs diagnosis affected by cervical root artifact group, SECT and DECT derived ECV fraction still obt ained 0.716 and Conclusion: The correlation between DECT and SECT derived ECV f raction was strong. ECV fraction can help to diagnose metas tatic cervical LNs from PTC, especially in LNs diagnosis affected by cervic al root artifact group.

Methods or Background: This study prospectively enrolled 64 consecutive PTC patients with 71 small LLNs suspected by conven tional US according to the 2015 ATA guidelines from October 2020 to Septem ber 2021, and the 52 metastatic LNs and 19 benign LNs all received CEUS a week before biopsy or surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US and CEUS features were calculated and the diagnostic performance of C EUS and PostVP-CEUS was compared. Results or Findings: CEUS correctly diagnosed 18 LNs more than conventional US. Among the 19 benign LLNs, 16 manif ested centrifugal (6, 31.6%) or overall (10, 52.6%) enhancement in artery phase; 18 LLNs presented iso-enhancement in post-vascular phase (94.7%). Among 52 metastatic LLNs, 46 manifested centripetal (25, 48. 0%) or asynchronous (21, 40.0%) enhancement in artery phase; 51 were (29,55.7%) in post-va scular specificity, and of CEUS PostVP-CEUS was Conclusion: CEUS with Sonazoid has excellent performance in diagnosing small LLNs of PTC patients compared with US; the di agnostic value of PostVP- CEUS has no difference from CEUS. Limitations: This study is a single-centre study and the sample size was small, lacking of normal LNs as control group.

Wang, L. Zhang, D. T. Ma, X. Kon g, Z. B. Ma, Y. Z. Xie, X. J. Li; Taian/CN (liuxiaoyan0522@163.com) Purpose: To analyse the MRI features and pathological basis of thyroid nodules, and to explore the relationship between MR I and pathological features of thyroid nodules, so as to improve the diagnostic level of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Methods or Background: Twenty-eight patients with thyroid nodules confirmed by surgery and pathology were analysed retrospectively. The patients were examined by conventional plain scan, enhanced scan and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) before surgery, an d were divided into benign nodule group and malignant nodule group according t o pathological results. The morphology, boundary, texture, signal type, acc ompanying features, enhancement mode and diffusion weighted limitation degree of the lesions were observed. The results were compared with intra operative pathology. Results or Findings: There were 62 nodules on MRI images of 28 patients with thyroid nodules. 15 lesions were accompanied by cystic degeneration (24.2%),13 lesions were associated with calcificati on (21.0%). There were 43 cases (69.4%) with mild to moderate enhancement and 19 cases (39.6%) with obvious enhancement. DWI showed obvious diffusion l imitation in 28 lesions (45.2%). There were 17 benign nodules (27.4%) and 45 malignant nodules (72.6%). Univariate analysis showed that there were differences in boundary (P=0.002), TIWI signal (P=0.018), enhancement degre e (P=0.003) and DWI (P=0.001) between the benign and maligna nt groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that enhancement signal degree (P=0.003, OR value 0.095) and DWI limitation (P=0.008,OR value 12.109) were independent predictors Thyroid malignant nodules showed morphologic hemody namic characteristics on MRI, showing mild to moderate enhancement and significantly limited on DWI. Routine thyroid scan combined with enhancement and DWI can improve the detection rate of malignant nodules. Limitations: The sample amount is small. Ethics committee approval: Under approval.

C. V. Perez-Riverola, Bello Cueto, M. Rigla; Sabadell/ES Purpose: To determine the malignancy risk of thyroid nodules with isolated macrocalcifications (MC) and/or rim calcifications when present in non-high suspicion thyroid nodules. Methods or Background: Restrospective study reviewing all fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) of thyroid nodules done in our center from January 2014 to December 2020. We rejected the nodules with previous FNAB. We selected the nodules with MC (echogenic foci >1 in size with posterior shadowing and/or peripheral dystrophic calcificatio ns) and classify them in groups following the 2017 European Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (EU-TIRADS). We calculated the rate of malig nancy and compare them with the rest of the nodules for each subgroup, using Chi-square comparison tests. Results or Findings: Of 1536 biopsied thyroid nodules from January 2014 to December 2020, 1224 met criteria for EU-TIRADS 3 (L ow Risk) or EU-TIRADS 4 (Intermediate Risk). 5 nodules were unclassifiabl e following EU-TIRADS due to their circumferential calcifications restricting further sonographic assessment. The remaining 307 were classified in ot her EU-TIRADS category or had previous FNAB and therefore they were exclud ed. From 1224 nodules selected, we classified 943 as EU-TIRADS 3 and 281 as EU-TIRADS 4. Of the 943 EU-TR3 nodules, 59 of them had macrocalcificati ons and 884 did not. The malignancy rate in these two groups was 5.7% and 3. 4% respectively. Of the 281 EU-TR4 nodules, 40 of them had macrocalcificati ons and 241 did not. The malignancy rate in these two groups was 20.7% and 2 1.8%. A p value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. The results wer e not significantly different in both groups (TR3 p=0.358, TR4 p=0.894). Conclusion: Macrocalcifications in thyroid nodules do not incre ase the malignancy risk in a statistically significant way when present in NHSTN. Limitations: Pandemics.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MR I), 4D computed tomography (4D CT), ultrasound (US) and 99mTc-sestamibi scan have all been shown to have good diagnostic performance for this purpose. Both 4D CT and MRI are able to give a diagnosis together wi th a good demonstration of related anatomy. MRI has the advantage of using non-ionising radiation and causing fewer allergies to intravenous contrast. A prospective single-centre study was conducted. Patients with a clinical and l aboratory diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism completed both a dynamic MRI an d a 4D CT scan. The images were evaluated by a neuroradiologist and lat er correlated with surgical outcomes. Any other imaging data available (99mTc-s estamibi scan or US) were also recorded and analysed. Results or Findings: Twenty one hyperfunctioning glands were surgically proven. Eighteen of which were detected by MRI with no false positive results (sensitivity 85.7%, PPV 100%). Sixteen adenomas wer e detected by 4D CT, with one suspected lesion surgically proven to be a normal parathyroid gland (Sensitivity 76.2%, PPV 94.2%). Two of the adenomas not apparent on MRI were detected on 4D CT, while 4 adenomas were detec ted by MRI alone. When combining the two methods, the sensitivity ros e to 87.0%. Conclusion: Our study suggests that both MRI and 4D CT are good diagnostic tools in the case of hyperparathyroidism. Combining the methods may be of benefit. Limitations: Our sample size was suboptimal and therefore the results need further affirmation by future studies. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Vienna/AT RPS Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubbl e for preoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients improved surgical planning during COVID-19 pandemic *P. K. G. Palanisamy*, J. Weeks, J. Rait, C-M. Mars h, C. Kam, K. Cox; Maistone/UK (p.palanisamy@nhs.net) Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer treatment was affected by lack of operating resources. Standard B -mode ultrasound together with CEUS core biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) provide enhanced radiological assessment of the axilla. At a time of crisis, this study aimed to assess whether CEUS SLN biopsy improved theatre uti lisation and in reducing patient exposure. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 291 Methods or Background: Between March 2020 and January 2022, prospective data was collected on 174 patients. Pat ients had a normal B-mode axillary successful ly biopsied in 127/174 (72%). The median age was 53 and median tumour size 30mm. 34 (40%) of patients had ER- or Her-2+ breast cancer. Of those with successful SLN core biopsy, 22 had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, 15 primary endocrine treatment and 4 had incomplete data. 86 p atients had primary surgical treatment and the sensitivity was 50%, specificity 98% and NPV 79% with a 35% prevalence of LN metastases in this grou p. Of the 16 patients with malignant SLN on core biopsy, 9 had 2 or more LN macrometastases found at the end of surgical treatment, 5 patients had singl e LN macrometastasis, 1 had a single micrometastasis and 1 a 1.5 mm deposit in peri-nodal fat. Conclusion: The addition of CEUS SLN core biopsy to standard B- mode ultrasound improved surgical treatment planning. Di recting those with malignant SLN to axillary lymph node dissection rat her than surgical SLN excision avoided a second axillary procedure for 14 patients. Although, 2 patients were overtreated for micrometastatic disease, enhanced axillary staging with CEUS allowed better use of theatre res ources during the crisis. Limitations: There was incomplete data in 4 patients. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was not required. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Payne*, T. Zachari; Edinburgh/UK Purpose: Breast pain is one of the most common symptoms prom pting referral to specialist breast services; however there is lim ited evidence to support best radiological practice. We aimed to determine the patient outcomes following initial investigation by mammography and/or ultraso und to establish the value of imaging in these patients. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of 297 patients presenting t o the symptomatic breast clinic with breast pain and a normal clinical examination who were referred for imaging between S eptember 2020 and April 2021. Results or Findings: In total only 1 cancer was identified, this did not correspond to the site of pain and therefore was cl assed as incidental. 22% (n=66) of patients required additional imaging (inc luding compression/ magnification views, digital breast tomosynthesis or ultrasound). 11 biopsies were performed with 8 normal/benign pathological fi ndings and 2 cases of indeterminate nature, which included a radial scar and flat epithelial atypia. No patients had a treatable cause for their pain ident ified on imaging. Conclusion: Imaging in patients with breast pain in the absence of other symptoms results in a cancer detection rate equal t o or below the screening incidence (0.3% vs 0.7%) and may result in unnecess ary additional investigations and biopsies. Limitations: Our study included all types of breast pain and a r elatively small sample size (n=16) had unilateral focal breast pain. We propose that further research on a larger group of patients with focal breast pain should be performed to establish whether there is a higher cancer detection rate in this subgroup.

We evaluated whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can ide ntify target lymphatic vessels for LVA surgery in the upper extremities. Methods or Background: In this retrospective review, CEUS with intradermal injection of microbubbles was used prior to LVA sur gery in the upper extremities between October 2019 and September 2021 . All patients had secondary upper extremity lymphoedema from breast c ancer treatment. Technical success was defined as lymphatics identif ied by CEUS that led to successful LVAs. Results or Findings: All 11 patients were women (mean age: 56 years \u00b1 8) . The median number of injection sites was 11 (range: 8-14). CEUS identified lymphatic vessels in all 11 women, including in 6 women where ICG fluorescent lymphography failed to identify any tar gets. A total of 35 explorations (median: 3 per patient, range: 2-4) were performed, and 24 LVAs (median 3 per patient, range: 0-4) were created. Of the anastomosis, 33% was mapped by ICG fluorescent lymphography only. Of the 33 explorations on targets mapped by CEUS, anastomosis could be made in 22 sites for a t echnical success rate of 67% (22/33). Seven women had at least one additional LVA created from the use of CEUS. Conclusion: CEUS is a promising tool for identifying lymphatic vessels in the upper extremities, especially when ICG fluorescent lymphography fails to identify targets or cannot be used. Limitations: Larger prospective study may further delineate the role of CEUS. Ethics committee approval: A waiver was received from the institutional review board.

Methods or Background: 110 MRI-detected lesions (80 patients), subsequently underwent second-look US between Febru ary 2016 and July 2019, were retrospectively reviewed. The lesions we re not detected in previous mammography and bilateral breast US. The chi-square and Fischer exact tests were used to evaluate the associations between MRI features and pathology results with SUDR and second-look US findings with malignancy rates. Significant variables in the univariate analyses were evaluated with multivariate analysis. Additionally, the performance of MRI feat ures in SUDR prediction was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results or Findings: While 28.8% of the lesions with a second-look US correlate were malignant, 96.1% of the lesions without a sonographic correlation were benign. In univariate analyses, lesion type (mass-non mass- focus), pathology result (benign-malignant), MRI BI -RADS category, and kinetic curve were significantly associated with SU DR. In multivariate analysis, MRI BI-RADS category (odds 9.470, p=0.001) were significantly associated with SUDR. Combined compound scoring with these factors could predict S Furthermore, lesions with irregular shapes and margins were more often m alignant in the analysis of US findings (p<0.001). In subgroup analysis, this association was significant only in sonographic correlations of masses. Conclusion: Combined compound scoring with MRI BI-RADS category and lesion type could predict SUDR. Besides, second-look US could give additional diagnostic information to distinguish between benig n and malignant masses. Limitations: This was a singlecentre retrospective study. MRI-guided biopsy was not available at our institution. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the institutional review board (107/17).

The purpose of this study is to compare MRI ADC values of the breast masses with quantitative elastography based on ultrasound shear wave measurements. Methods or Background: We retrospectively evaluated 130 patients with histopathologically proven breast masses. The mean age of the patients was 51 years (range 34 - 78 years). Shear wave elastogr aphy was measured in kiloPascals (kPa9) unites which is a quantitative m easure of tissue stiffness. DWI were obtained using a 1.5-T MRI system. Results or Findings: ADC values were strongly inversely correlated with elasticity. In our study the cut-off value of ADC w as 1.015 x 10-3 cm2 /sec (p=0.01) to achieve 72% and spec ificity 75% and cut-off value of elasticity was 114.50 kPa achieve to sensivit y of 75% and spesificity 72% to discriminate between the malignant and benign br east lesions. Elasticity was inversely strongly correlated with ADC ( r = -0,46, p<0.01) according to Pearson Correlation. Conclusion: Tissue density correlated with stiffness of breast tumours as measured by DWIC MRI and shear wave elastography. T he relationship was linear. Limitations: Retrospective design of the study is one of the lim itations of our study. Misregistration of the two measurements is another possible limitation. Manually drown ROIs on the ADC map may show variati ons, and may not correspond exactly to the ROI which is also manuall y drown on the elastographic image. Fusion imaging technologies may ensure more accurate registration of the ROIs used in two modalities.

E. Lee*, O. Woo, S. E. Song, K. R. Cho, B. K. S eo; Seoul/KR Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of contrast-en hanced ultrasound (CEUS) for additional magnetic resonance (MR)-detected enhancing lesions and to determine whether or not k inetic pattern results comparable to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE- MRI) of the breast can be obtained using the quanti tative analysis of CEUS. Methods or Background: In this singlecentre prospective study, a total of 71 additional MR-detected breast lesions were included. CEUS examination was performed, and lesions were categorised according t o the breast imaging- reporting and data system (BI-RADS). The sensitivit y, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of CEUS were calculated by comparing the BI-RADS category to the final pathology results. The degree of agreement between CEUS and DCE-MRI kinetic patterns was evaluated usi ng weighted kappa. Results or Findings: On CEUS, 46 lesions were assigned as BI-RADS category 4B, 4C, or 5, while 25 lesions category 3 or 4A. The diagnostic performance of CEUS for enhancing lesions on DCE-MR I was excellent, with 84.9% sensitivity, 94.4% specificity, and 97.8% pos itive predictive value. A total of 57/71 (80%) lesions had correlating kineti c patterns and showed good agreement (weighted kappa = 0.66) between CEUS and DCE-MRI. Benign lesions showed excellent agreement (weighted kappa = 0.84), and intraductal carcinoma (IDC) showed good agreement (weighted kappa = 0.62). Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of CEUS for additional MR-detected breast lesions was excellent. Accurate kinetic patt ern assessment, fairly comparable to DCE-MRI, can be obtained for benign a nd IDC lesions using CEUS. Limitations: The benign breast lesions were not confirmed by pat hology, therefore, excluded. Furthermore, the small sample size may limit statistical power. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Funding for this study: This research received no specific grant from any funding agency.

Jing*, Q. Lu, L. Yan, F. Zheng, P. Wang, B. Hua ng, W. Wang; Shanghai/CN (luxiajing2018@163.com) Purpose: To analyse the clinical and imaging findings of non-mass-like breast lesions on automated breast volume scanner (ABVS) i mages and to evaluate their diagnostic values in the differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. Methods or Background: From Dec. 2014 to Apr. 2020, a total of 113 women with 118 histologically proven NML breast lesions w ere retrospectively enrolled. The clinical and ABVS findings were compa red using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and independent samples t test. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to select indepen dent predictors of malignancy. A linear discriminant analysis classifi er was employed to classify benign and malignant lesions. Results or Findings: According to the postoperative pathology, 39/118 an d 79/118 lesions were classified as benign and malignant, respectively. Age, nipple discharge, calcification, the retraction phenomenon and the distribution pattern were significantly different between the tw o groups (all p<0.05). In the binary logistic regression analysis, calcification (odds 156.241; p=0.005) were independent risk factors for malignancy, with high positive predictive values (8 2.8%, 89.3%, 90.9%, respectively). The combination of these three featu res yields a sensitivity of 84.8%, specificity of 66.7% and accuracy of 78.8% i n linear discriminant analysis. Conclusion: Calcification, the retraction phenomenon and the segmental distribution pattern may aid in the differential di agnosis of non-mass-like lesions. Combined diagnosis with these features can improve the diagnostic performance. Limitations: This was a retrospective study, and the sample size was relatively small. Ethics committee approval: The hospital's institutional review board approved this study and waived the need for informed consent from all patients.

Muscogiuri*, L. Nicosia, G. Signorelli, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) sys tem on mammary ultrasound (US) can improve the diagnostic performance of inexperienced radiologists. Methods or Background: We collected ultrasound images of 256 breast lesions, acquired with a linear high-frequency prob e. We asked two experienced and two inexperienced radiologists to r etrospectively review the US features of each breast lesion according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories. A CAD examination with S-DetectTM software (Samsung Healthcare, Seoul, South Korea) w as conducted retrospectively by another uninvolved radiologist, blinded to the BI-RADS values previously attributed to the lesions. Diagnostic performances of experienced and inexperienced radiologists and CAD were compared and the interobserver agreement among radiologists was calc ulated. Results or Findings: The diagnostic performance of the experienced group in terms of sensitivity was significantly higher than CAD (p<0.001). Conversely, the diagnostic performance of the inexperienced gro up in terms of both sensitivity and specificity was significantly lower than CAD (p<0.001). We obtained an excellent agreement in the evaluation of the lesions among the two expert radiologists (Kappa coefficient: 88.7%), and among the two non- expert 84.9%). Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 293 Our showed that S-detect has greater specificity, NPV and PPV than inexperienced radiolo gists. The US CAD system is a useful additional tool to improve the diagnost ic performance of the inexperienced radiologists, eventually reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies. Moreover, it is a valid second opinion in case of experienced radiologists. Limitations: There is some limitation of our study: it is a retr ospective study, the S-Detect cannot evaluate the non-mass breast le sions and also, the small number of cases. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study was notified to the ethics committee and was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study. Author breast cancer initially categorised as BI-RADS 4A in ultrasound. Methods or Background: A retrospective review was done on PACS and HIS database of a subspecialty breast clinic for malign ant lesions categorised as BI-RADS 4A in ultrasound. Various characteristics i ncluding demographic data, ultrasound description, major histologic characteri stics and molecular subtypes were recorded and compared with lesions characteris ed as BI-RADS 5 using chi-squared test. Results or Findings: Out of 3049 ultrasound-guided breast biopsies pathology and IHC results were available in 2076 patients. There were 873 patients categorised as BI-RADS 4A; 49 of which tur ned out malignant. These included 6 non-mass lesions including two luminal c ancers with extensive DCIS, one HER2-positive, two HER2-positive luminal b DCIS, all the HER2- positive cancers in young women who underwent ultrasound prior to mammogram. 12 were medullary cancers, 9 with triple negative molecular subtype. 11 cases of invasive papillary cancer were also categorised as BI- RADS 4A; in 4 of which a prominent cystic component was not visible, presenting as a lobular mass. 5 were triple negativ e cancers without medullary features presenting as non-shadowing lobular hypoec hoic masses. Out of 9 luminal A cancers categorised as BI-RADS 4A only one was luminal A and 7 had Ki67 above 30%. Conclusion: Rate of papillary and medullary cancer was signific antly higher and luminal a cancer significantly lower in patient s categorised as BI-RADS 4A comparing to those categorised as BI-RADS 5. Also t he age of patients with less typical appearance for malignancy in ultrasound was significantly lower than those accurately categorised. Limitations: Patients with underestimated risk of malignancy wer e younger and many of them didn't have mammograms; this can affect the risk assessment by the radiologist.

Higashigaito, V. To develop and contrast media (CM) protocol for thoracoabdominal CT angiography (CTA) of the ao rta with first generation photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT). Methods or Background: 100 consecutive patients (mean age 74.5\u00b18.4years, 17 women) were prospectively included who underwent thoracoabdominal CTA of the aorta with first-generation PCD-CT at 12 0kV and who underwent previous thoracoabdominal CTA with energy-integrati ng detector (EID)-CT using automated tube voltage selection. Tube current-time product in PCD-CT was modified in each patient to obtain equal volume CT-dose-index (CTDIvol) as with EID-CT. In PCD-CT, were reconstructed 40-55keV). on of the aorta, noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was determined. Subjective image quality was rated. In the first cohort (40 patients), the same CM-protocol was used for PCD-CT and EID-CT (volume 70ml, flow rate 4ml/s, 370mg/ml). Increase of CNR in PCD-CT compared to EID-CT in this cohort was quantified and served as reference for CM-volume reduction in the second cohort (60 patients). Results or Findings: Similar CTDIvol between PCD-CT and EID-CT was observed (both, 4.9\u00b11.9mGy) (p>0.05). In the first cohort, VMI at 40-50keV showed significantly higher CNR compared to EID-CT (all, p<0.05). VMI at 50 and 55keV showed highest subjective image scores. V MI at 50keV was selected as ideal keV-level (best trade-off between subjective and objective image quality), showing 25% increase of CNR compare d to EID-CT. CM- volume in the second cohort was reduced by 25% (52. 5ml, 3ml/s). In the second cohort similar CNR and subjective image qual ity was observed between VMI at 50keV from PCD-CT using low-volume C (both, with generation of VMI increas es CNR, which can be translated into a low-volume CM-protoc ol resulting in diagnostic image quality.

Rippel*, J. A. Decker, D. J. Kroencke, F. Schwarz, C. Scheurig-Muenkler; Augsburg/DE Purpose: To compare image quality of a novel dual-source photon-counting detector CT with a second generation dual-source CT with energy integrating detector (EID-CT) in patients who undergo lower ext remity run-off CT angiography. Methods or Background: Here, we present initial data from 40 consecutive patients who underwent CTA on a novel dual-source photon counting detector CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) (PCD-CT group). For comparison, 40 patients matched for sex , age, height and BMI who underwent a similar scan on a second generation dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens Healthineers) were retrospectively included as a control group. Basic demographic data were compared. Virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) reconstructions in diff erent keV settings (range: Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 294 40-120) were performed. Enhancement and noise were measured for each of 13 vascular segments as mean and standard deviation of CT values in ROI's in the abdominal aorta and downstream vascular segment s as well as the standard deviation within surrounding air, respecti vely. Signal- and contrast-to- noise-ratio were calculated. Results or Findings: There were no significant differences between both groups in sex ratio (26 male, 14 female in both groups), age (70.5\u00b110.0 vs 68.0\u00b110.7 years) or BMI When group, the VMI-reconstruct ions in the 40-55 keV range were clearly superior (e.g. in the superficial extremity run-off studies on the PCD-CT demonstrate significantly higher signal- and contrast-to-noise- ratios, particularly for low keV VMI-reconstructions. These routinely available reconstructions represent a substantial improvement in objective image quality of CT angiographies. Limitations: The retrospective character of this study is a limi tation.

Huang; Lanzhou/CN Purpose: To explore the clinical application of double-layer detector spectral CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in the diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis. Methods or Background: The CTPA data of 30 patients diagnosed with fibrosing mediastinitis were retrospectively analys ed. The degree of compression and stenosis of pulmonary arteries, vei ns, and bronchi were measured on conventional images, the iodine density and Z effective values of lung segments were measured to evaluate the pulmona ry perfusion, analysed and compared CT ventilation/perfusion imaging data. Results or Findings: The pulmonary arteries, veins, and bronchi of 30 patients were narrowed in varying degrees, which wa s surrounded and compressed by proliferative soft tissue of mediasti num and hilar. The iodine density and Z effective values reflecting pulmonary perfusion parameters were correlated with the degree of pulmonary artery stenosis. The more severe pulmonary artery stenosis, the lower the iodine density and Z effective values of corresponding pulmonary segment (P<0.001). The r ight superior pulmonary vein and the primary branch of the double superior pulmonary vein were more easily involved and the degree of stenosis was more serious (P<0.001). 16 cases of SPECT pulmonary ventilation/perfusion imaging showed different degrees of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation dama ge. CT iodine density values showed more abnormal perfusion lung segments than SPECT (P<0.05). Conclusion: Dual-layer detector spectral can degree of pulmonary vascular and bronchial stenosis in patients with fibrosing mediastinitis, and can also accurately quantify the degree of pulmonary perfusion damage. It can be used as a \"one-stop\" im aging evaluation method for the diagnosis of fibrosing mediastinitis. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Maris, require lifelong imaging surveillance to avoid potential life- threatening complications. The aim of the study was to examine the value of dual-energy CT imaging as an adjunct to differentiate aggressive from benign T2EL after EVAR. Methods or Background: Study participants were consecutive patients referred for CT at 1-month after EVAR. CT imaging acquisition included a dual- energy CT angiography (DECTA) and a delayed single- energy CT (SECT) imaging. Patients diagnosed with T2EL were re-exami ned at 6-months post- EVAR to assess the aneurysm sac growth (ASG). Upon ASG recorded, patients were categorised as having benign (group A ) or suspicious for aggressive (group B) T2EL. DECTA image data were em ployed to calculate the normalised effective atomic number (NZeff), the normalised iodine concentration (NIC), the slope (S) of HUendoleak/HU aorta against monochromatic energy, the dual-energy index (DEI) and endoleak index (EI) for each T2EL. Statistical anal ysis was employed to compare all above parameters regarding their abilit y to differentiate aggressive from benign T2EL. Results or Findings: Among 40 patients examined at 1-month after EVAR, 1 4 patients were diagnosed with T2EL. Nine patients we re assigned to group A and five patients to group B. NZeff and EI were fou nd to be significantly lower in group A. There were no significant differences i n NIC, DEI, and S values between groups A and B. NZeff was found to have the highest power to discriminate aggressive T2EL with an area-under-cur ve of 86.7%, showing 100% specificity and 60% sensitivity. Conclusion: The use of DECT imaging at 1-month after EVAR may provide quantitative indices able to discriminate aggressiv e from benign T2ELs after EVAR and could therefore provide decision support t ools to assist in patient management.

The aim of this study was to identify the optimal scan delay for each patient us ing test bolus technique in order to reduce the volume of contrast agent. Methods or Background: All patients included in this prospective trial (n= 109) were referred to CTPA due to suspected pulmonary em bolism (PE). The study group (n=78) underwent CTPA with 20ml Iomeron 400 i .v using test bolus technique. Only standard exclusion criteria for CTP A were applied; no study- related exclusion criteria were defined. The retros pectively selected control group (n=31) underwent CTPA using our standard prot ocol (bolus tracking with 50 ml Iomeron 400 i.v). Two independent readers mea sured the attenuation in the pulmonary trunk (PT) and the superior vena cava (SVC). For (ICCs) were calculated. or Findings: PE was detected in 14 patients (12.8%). According t o both readers, the attenuation in the PT was signifi cantly (p<0.001) lower in the study group (mean 352\u00b1145 HU) compared to the contr ol group (mean 520\u00b1180 HU), with excellent interreader agreement ( ICC 0.968). However, a higher percentage of patients in the study group re ached diagnostic attenuation values of >200 HU in the PT, according to reader 1 (96.2% vs 93.5%) and reader 2 (92.3% vs 90.3%).

The aim of this study is to determine the aortic pulsatility in patients with a bdominal aortic aneurysms. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, analyses of readily available CTA images were performed of 31 patients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysms. Reconstructions of the raw ECG gated dataset at 30 and 90% of the R-R cycle were used. After lumen segment ation, total aortic cross- sectional area was measured in a plane perpendicular to the centreline. 12 measurements were completed both in diastole and sy stole in diastolic cross-sectional areas to det ermine absolute and relative pulsatility [(ds-dd)/dd; %]. Results or Findings: We performed 24 measurements per patient, 744 in total. The mean pulsatility values at each measurem ent point were Conclusion: Based on the measured results, the mean pulsatility of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms is in a submillimet ric range, which is less than 5% of the diastolic diameter. It is probably not re levant for stent graft sizing as an average oversize of 10-20% is used in planning. According to our previous studies, aortic pulsatility in patients with aneury sms is similar to that of patients with non-dilated vessels. Limitations: There were no limitations.

V. Saushkin*, V. V. S. Sazonova; Tomsk/RU (saushkin.vv@outlook.com) Purpose: The aim of the study was to compare the elastic pro perties (EP) of normal and dilated ascending (ECG-gated CT A). Methods The study enrolled 41 patients (aged 63\u00b110 years; 15 men), which were divided on group 1 (n=22, aged 64\u00b17) with AA diameter (AAd) >45mm (dilatation and and group 2 ( n=19, aged 63\u00b19) with AAd<45mm (normal). All patients underwent ECG-gated CTA. CTA datasets were reformatted into 10-phases. We evaluated EP of AA as systolic and diastolic difference of AAd, cross-sectional areas, aortic segments length, and calculated strain, compliance (Com) and distensibil ity (Dis) of the aortic wall according to [Zubair V, 2020]. Results or Findings: In group 1 for both Sinus of Valsalva (SV) and AA all calculated EP parameters, except ST, were lower, comparing with group We also divided group 2 into 2 subgroups: subgroup 1 (n=10) with AA diameter<50 mm (dilatation) and subgroup 2 (n=12) with AAdiameter> 50 mm (aneurysm). EP of the aorta between these subgroups did not differ si gnificantly: SVcom 0.63 (- 7.68; 3.34) vs 0.39 allows evaluating of EP of AA and giv es additional information, which potentially may have prognostic value in patients with AA dilatation or aneurysm. Patients with AA di latation and aneurysm have worse AA EP comparing with normal AA, but do not di ffer from each other. Limitations: Data analysis depending on the patient's gender was not performed. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the Ethics Committee.

Comparison of 2- and 3-mater ial decomposition reconstructions of photon-counting detector CT data sets *J. A. Decker*, S. Bette, C. Scheurig-Muenkler, B. Jehs, F. Risch, F. Kroencke, F. Schwarz; Augsburg/DE (Josua.Decker@uk-augsburg.de) Purpose: To assess the eries derived by two-material (2MD) or three-material decomposition (3MD) reconstructions of arterial scans of the aorta on a novel photon-count ing detector CT (PCD-CT) in comparison with true non-contrast scans (TNC). Methods or Background: Twenty consecutive patients with clinically indicat ed CT of the aorta after endovascular aneurysm repair scanned on a novel PCD-CT (Naeotom alpha, SiemensHealthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Scans were acquired series and in arterial phase; 2MD- and 3MD- reconstructions performed using the arterial p hase dataset; virtually unenhanced series generated from both reconstructions. Standard-deviation of CT-values (noise) was measured on 6 regions of interest in the aorta. Two experienced interventional radiologists compared al l series regarding image quality, contrast-removal and potential removal of calcifications and stent parts using a 5-point Likert-scale (5=excellent/no removal of stent-parts/calcium to 1=non-diagnostic/complete removal of stent-parts/calcium). Subjective diagnostic suitability of virtual unenhanced series was assessed as: no, partial or full suitability for the replacement of TNC seri es. Results or Findings: Image noise was higher in 2MD- (20.2\u00b14.9) and 3MD- reconstructions (18.1\u00b14.7) than in TNC-series (14.2\u00b11.7; p<0.001). Subjective image quality was substantially higher in than in 2MD- reconstructions (4.2\u00b10.9 vs. 2.5\u00b10.6; p<0.001). Contrast-removal was considered complete for all patients in both 2MD- and 3MD-reconstructions. Unlike in 2MD-reconstructions, in 3MD-reconstructions only and atherosclerotic calcifications (4.6\u00b10.5 vs. 3.0\u00b10.6;p<0.001) were erroneously subtracted. T he expert readers found 92.5% of 3MD-reconstructions as suited (27.5% parti ally 3MD-reconstructions of arterial phase PCD-CT datasets show high diagnostic quality with full contrast removal and only minimal erroneous subtractions of stent parts and calcifications. Usi ng these to replace additional unenhanced acquisitions would significantly reduce radiation doses. Limitations: Small sample-size, retrospective single-centre study.

Methods or Background: From a retrospective central radiological (by a senior neuroradiologist) and histopathological (by a senior neuropathologist) review of 202 CNS vascular lesions, we identified t hree cases of unclassified vascular anomalies. Interestingly, they shared the same radiological and histopathological features evoking the cavernous subtype of angioleiomyomas described in the soft tissue. We grouped them toget her with four additional similar cases from our clinicopathological network and performed combined molecular analyses (whole-exome-sequencing (WES) an alysis and DNA- methylation profiling). Moreover, cases were compar ed with a cohort of 5 angioleiomyomas of soft tissue. Results or Findings: The seven lesions had the same histopathology (cavernous angioma features with muscular component ) and neuroimaging (solitary extra-axial, dural-based lesion with mimicking WES analysis identified a p.Gly41Cys GJA4 mutation in 3/6 cases. This mutation hepatic haemangiomas and cutaneous venous malformations. not classifiable using the CNS brain tumour (version 12.5), and sarcoma (version 12.2) Classifiers, by unsuperv ised t-SNE and hierarchical clustering analyses, 5/6 lesions grouped together a nd formed a distinct epigenetic group separated from the clusters of sof t other vascular and histomolecular tumour type, with frequent GJA4 mutations and a distinct DNA methylation pattern corresponding to the suggested new terminology of \"dural angioleiomyomas\". They are a rare and benign lesion that radiologists need to know among the differential diagnoses of meningioma. Limitations: The cohort was relatively small, due to low frequency and small number of lesions operated because of their often b eing interpretated as meningioma.

Methods or Background: 12 patients with suspected glioma have been prospectively examined. Then, surgery and neuropath ological analysis to determine the IDH-status have been performed in all patients. All MRI, MRS(I) measurements were performed on a Siemens MAGNETOM T erra 7T MR- scanner in 1Tx32Rx head- coil. The proposed SLOW-ESPI, as well as the classical MEGA-SVS/CSI me thods were performed on all 12 patients during the same examination. Results or Findings: Thanks to lower artifacts, SLOW-EPSI has better spectral quality compared to MEGA-SVS/CSI in many c ases. When using MEGA-SVS and -CSI, there are one and two ambiguous cases, respectively, mainly due to water contamination and B0/B1 inhomogeneities. In contrast, there is no ambiguous case using SLOW-EPSI. 12 pati ents with suspected glioma were included in this prospective study. SLO W-editing for detection of 2HG signal showed 91.7% (11/12) accuracy whereas th e other ambiguous included. Conclusion: SLOW-editing shows its advantage in detecting 2HG a ng. The EPSI-based SLOW-editing can be performed within 10 minutes in clinical mode. Limitations: SLOW-editing does not work at low fields 1.5T, and it might work at 3T but needs to be investigated.

Few studi es have specifically characterised LGG as one of the three key molecular subtypes. Our study investigated the accuracy of combining multiple conventional MRI features to predict LGG molecular subtype, aiming to developing a practical predictive algorithm. Methods or Background: LGG diagnosed between 2007 and 2013 were identified. Two neuroradiologists independently ass essed nine conventional MRI features. Features with interobserver agreement yielding 0.6 proceeded to consensus assessment. MRI features were correlat ed with genotype, classified as markers of were also noted for IDHwt tumours. Results or Findings: 119 patients met the study criteria. T2-FLAIR misma tch sign was the most predictive feature across subtypes (p<0.001). All 30 tumours with >50% mismatch were IDHmut/1p19qint, and all 7 with mismatch, enhancing tumours. tumour IDHmut/1p19qint status on univariate analysis (p<0. 001), but there was no longer an association once T2-FLAIR mismatch was ac counted for. Enhancement (p=0.001), necrosis (p=0.002) and haemo rrhage (p=0.027) correlated with were IDHmut/1p19qcodel (p=0.008). Conclusion: T2-FLAIR mismatch strongly predicts IDHmut/1p19qint even with a lower threshold of 25% mismatch. When tumours exhibit <25% mismatch, secondary features include enhancement, necrosis an d haemorrhage (predicting IDHwt, especially \"molecular glioblastoma\"), and calcifications (IDHmut/1p19qcodel). Well-defined margins are no longer predictive after accounting for mismatch.

They ar e classified by their genetics (IDH mutation, 1p/19q co-deletion). To bet ter understand factors influencing prognosis, we conducted a large retrospective single-institution study using a novel method to identify long-term su rvivor (LTS) characteristics. Methods or Background: Using a combination of regular expression (RegEx) search and natural language processing (NLP), data extracted from the radiology information system (RIS) was used to identify patients with a pathology-confirmed diagnosis of oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma. Reports were extracted using RegEx, and overall survival (O S) was obtained by utilising the first CT/MRI reports and last MRI on record. To verify the accuracy of this method, we performed a chart review where O S was defined as the date of diagnosis to the current date or date of death. Results or Findings: Following inclusion criteria, 269 patients were obt ained. NLP was validated with a mean absolute error of 149.8 days. ANOVA analysis of tumours revealed no difference in OS of patients within the 4 genetic classifications: IDH mutated 1p/19q co-deletion, ID H no co-deletion, IDH non-mutated no-codeletion (p=.34). When classifying by pathology, a significant difference in OS was seen between oligodendroglioma patients (1633.39 days), astrocyt oma (2192.06 days), and mixed pathology (2512.76 days) (p<.001). Conclusion: Our study provides insight regarding the genetic and pathological classification of oligodendrogliomas. Pathology sho wed that oligodendrogliomas have significant lower OS than astrocytoma and mixed- tumour counterparts. Genetics showed no significant OS based on genetic classification suggesting the need for further anal ysis.

Amer*, A. Darbandi, E. B. Ciavarra, K. R. Lano, A. is an aggressive brain tumour wi th a mean survival of 14 months. We conducted a large retrosp ective single-institution study to identify the impact of GBM tumour location on patient prognosis. Methods or Background: Using regular expression (RegEx) search and natural language processing (NLP) in Python, data extracted from the radiology information system (RIS) was used to identify 4425 patients who presented at MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2006-2021 with pathology- confirmed GBM. We defined overall survival (OS) as the time between the first CT/MRI report mentioning GBM and the last, a method verified using chart review. We compared OS of patients with GBMs involv ing different lobes to each other, including those with multilobe involvem ent. Results or Findings: Frontal lobe was done to compar e OS. Multilobe analysis showed that frontal lobe involvement had better OS than non-frontal lobe involvement (656.82\u00b1887.78 vs 601.493\u00b1722.140 [p<.05]). Conversely, occipital lobe was associated with significantly lower survival than non-occipital lobe involvement (516.57\u00b1622.26 vs 65 5.12\u00b1848.01 [p<.01]). Conclusion: Our study is the largest single-institution study o f the impact of GBM tumour location on OS. We demonstrate that loca tion has an impact on patient survival. Frontal lobe involvement was associated with better prognosis and occipital with worse. This may be for a number of reasons. Frontal lobe tumours are more amenable to surgical resection. Fu rthermore, patients typically become symptomatic earlier, allowing for earlier intervention. Prior studies have also suggested a potential biomarker difference between lobes, which will be investigated in future analyses of our dataset. Limitations: Extent of involvement was not considered.

C. Raymond Guzman\u00b2, N. multi-echo DSC perfusion and correlate them with cell density and cell size. Methods or Background: In a classic DSC perfusion sequence, T1 and T2* leakage effects determine the post-bolus signal, an d are influenced by tissue geometry (i.e. cell density, cell size). Multi-echo perfusion MRI enables to disentangle T2* and T1 components that contribute t o the classic DSC curve. We retrospectively selected patients with: diagnosi s of perfusion and DWI datasets, availability of histopathological images from targeted biopsies. Post-processing allowed to distinguish pure T2* component from pure T1 component, and to perform a DCE analysis on the latter. The quantitative MRI markers obtained will be compared to histopathological data. Results or Findings: The following novel MRI quantitative maps were successfully computed voxelwise: R2* at steady state (reflecting T2* leakage effects), R1 at steady state (reflecting T1 leakage effects), transverse relaxivity at tracer equilibrium (TRATE, reflecting the combination of T2* and T1 leakage effects). In addition, VE and kTRANS wer e computed from the DCE analysis, and the percentage of signal recovery (PSR) was computed from the second echo of the multi-echo DSC (comparable to a classic single- echo DSC sequence). Conclusion: Histopathological validation will assess the useful ness of the novel multi-echo derived quantitative maps for the non-invasive prediction of tumour microstructure. This would be particularly r elevant for: 1) differential diagnosis between brain tumours with different cell size and cell density (e.g. lymphoma vs glioblastoma); 2) treatment response as sessment (as pre- existing studies proved that cell shrinkage is an early event in treatment response).

Methods or Background: This was a retrospective cohort study including all patients diagnosed with pituitary adenomas who were treated surgically and followed up at a tertiary hospital between 2012 and 2022. Radiological variables from the first MRI that were collected were tumour dimensions, volume, sphenoidal, cavernous sinus invasion, tumou r signal intensity on diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging (signal intensit y ratio in T2-weighted sequences between the pituitary tumour and corpus c allosum) and diffusion restriction. Activity and secretory type of adenoma s were also collected. Friday Abstract-based Programme A B 298 Pathological variables included for analysis were i mmunohistochemistry results, citokeratins and KI-67 status. Tumour remn ants and time until recurrence were obtained from successive MRI scans. Statistically significant variables on univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis to obtain an adjusted relative risk. Time to recurrenc e was analysed through Mantel-Cox and Kaplan-Meyer. Results or Findings: Tumours with a higher volume than 5cm3, cavernous and sphenoidal sinus invasion were significantly as sociated with tumour recurrence RR (1.7, 2.1, 2.8), IC (1.1-2.7, 1.5-2.9 , 1.8-4.3) respectively, with p<0.05. High Ki-67 did statistical signif icance, with a RR 1.7 (0.4-7.3) p>0.05; however tumours with sinus invasion and hig h KI-67 showed earlier recurrence (RR 9.5, p>0.05) as did those with a hig her tumour signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences (RR 15.2, p<0.001). Respec ting secretory type, those with ACTH and GH overproduction had earlier r ecurrence rates on Mantel-Cox test (RR 18.42, p<0.05). Conclusion: Sinus invasion, ki-67 and T2 signal ratio higher than 2, were associated with a higher rate of recurrence. Time until recurrence varied according to these variables, tumour volume and type of hormone status. Limitations: Some of the patients were followed for shorter durations of time, leading to censored data. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

The distinction between tumour progress ion and radionecrosis is a clinical challenge and currently relies on Dynami c Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) perfusion. Amide Proton Transfer-weighted (AP Tw) imaging enables measurement of the chemical exchange saturation tra nsfer (CEST) contrast between mobile protein/peptide amide protons and bulk water. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of APT w imaging and DSC perfusion in the distinction between metastasis rec urrence and radionecrosis. Methods or Background: 22 brain pre-irradiated lesions were prospectively examined at 3 Tesla. Diagnosis of tumour progression or radionecrosis was assessed by either (i) histological examination or (ii) minimum 6 months' follow- up or (iii) CT-PET scan. APTw sequence was acquired with a 3D snapshot- GRE, a B1 value of 2.22 T and a Duty Cycle of 55%. DSC perfusion was acquired after a single dose of gadolinium-chelated contrast agent and a low flip angle. APTw, fuild suppressed (F.S.) APTw and rCBV maps were obtained after post-processing. Results or Findings: Among 22 lesions, 10 were evaluated as radionecrosi s and 12 as tumoural progression. Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) were 0.641 for rCBV perfusion and APTw discriminated cerebral lesions w ith a specificity of 90% and a sensitivity of 66.7% and 100% respectively. C was (1-1). Conclusion: APTw metrics are more accurate than rCBV values in the distinction between tumour recurrence and radio-induced tissue changes in brain metastasis. Fluid suppression enhance diagnos tic accuracy of APTw imaging. Limitations: Despite the encouraging results of the F.S. APTw metric, these must be explored on a larger patient cohort.

J. Pruis, F. A. Verburg, P. J. van Doormaal, R. Balvers, E. M. Bos, M. van den Bent, M. Smits, *S. E. Veldhuijzen van Z anten*; Rotterdam/NL (s.veldhuijzenvanzanten@erasmusmc.nl) here introduce the principle of theranostics and intra-arterial (IA) administration of radionuclides to the field of neu ro-oncology in order to improve current - and explore novel - treatment str ategies. Methods or Background: Seven patients receiving palliative care for meningioma (MG, n=2), (GBM, received intravenous (IV) and separate IA administration of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE (in MG patient s) or [68Ga]Ga-PSMA- 11 (in BM/GBM patients), followed by diagnostic PET -imaging at respectively 60 and 90 (DOTA-TATE), or 90, 165 and 240 minutes p ost-injection (PSMA). Standardised uptake values were calculated for tumour, contralateral healthy brain and liver. Tumour-to-liver (T/L) ratios were calculated using OLINDA software. Results or Findings: All seven patients showed positive uptake in tumour with low background signal (SUV mean in healthy brain ranging from <0.01 - 0.13) indicating selective targeting. Each lesion showed a notable increase in uptake after IA (IV) administration: SUVmax 42.0 (14.0) an d 77.1 (27.7) for [68Ga]Ga- DOTA-TATE in the MG patients, SUVmax values of 155. 4 (17.1) and 257.3 (12.0), [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in BM and GBM patients, respectively. No increase in SUV values was observed for healthy brain and liver . T/L ratios increased with respectively a factor 3 in the MG patients; a facto r 6 and 16 in BM patients; and 14, 16 and 26 in GBM patients, resulting in much mo re favourable target-to- non-target exposure ratios in case of therapy. Conclusion: Selective IA administrative leads to a strong, significant and relevant increase in CNS tumour uptake thus opening up new avenues for more effective therapeutic use of theranostic trace rs in patients, many of whom are without effective options for further treatment .

An evaluation of the T2/FLAIR mismatch sign for oligodendroglioma diagnosis *J. M. Brunelli*, I. d. S. Alves, C. S. Barbosa, C. B. F. Leite, S. S. Alves, C. Amancio, C. d. C. Leite; Sao Paulo/BR (juliamartinsbrunelli@gmail.com) Purpose: The 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of tumours of the central nervous system considers abs ence of codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q as the diagnos is of oligodendroglioma. The T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign has been considered a highly specific imaging biomarker for IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted low-grade glioma. We aimed to and validate if neuroradiologists' performance could pr edict 1p/19q status based on the mismatch sign. Methods or Background: The study included patients with low grade gliomas who have histopathological confirmation (through bi opsy/surgical resection), molecular study and imaging tests in our database ( n=86). Preoperative imaging was retrospectively assessed by two indepen dent neuroradiologists and one fellow radiologist, blinded to the 1p/19q s tatus, to assess presence/absence of \"T2-FLAIR mismatch\" sign. statistics were calculated to determine interobserver agreement between the 3 rev iewers, and the Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between 1p/19q status and the presence of T2-FLAIR mismatch. The analysis was performed by using SSPS statistics. Results or Findings: Analysis demonstrated moderate interreader agreement for the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign [ = 0.584 (0.478-0.691)]. The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was present in 8 cases (9.3%) and had a positive predictive value of 75%, negative predictive value of 96%, a s ensitivity of 66%, and a specificity of 97% (p<0.00001). Friday Programme A B 299 Conclusion: Among low-grade gliomas, T2-FLAIR mismatch sign represents a highly imaging biomarker for the IDH-mutant, 1p/19q non-codeleted molecular subtype. The main difference between the readers was observed because of the imprecise definition of homogeneity on these sequences that characterise the 1p/19q non-codeleted molecular subtype tumours was a limitation in this study.

Johns on; Houston, TX/US Purpose: assess the ability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT imagi ng to measure responses to radiation therapy in meningiom as. Methods or Background: It is well-recognised that postoperative radiation improves disease-free survival in patients with meningiomas. Currently, guidelines for grading treatment response in those undergoing radiation therapy are significantly limited. Adult patients w ith any meningioma of at least 10 mm measurable residual disease with planned radi ation therapy underwent 68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT imaging 30 days prior to radiation therapy initiation and then at 12 +/- 4 weeks following radiation ther apy conclusion. Quantitative analysis of lesions DOTATATE activity was performed using MIM (MIM Software Inc, Beachwood, OH) on pre- and post-treat ment scans. Results or Findings: Three patients received external beam radiation ranging from 50.4-60 Gy. One received proton therapy to a dose of 59 Gy. One received Gamma Knife only (14 Gy) and one received both with culmulative dose of 64.4 Gy. PET data non-pa rametric paired t-test (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Max SUV in patients before and after radiation was 8.53\u00b15.59 and 7.61\u00b15.43 respectively, with no s ignificant difference between groups (p=.162). No significant difference was found between mean SUV (p=.303), TLG SUV (p=.240), total SUV (p=.240), or volume (p=.442) before and after radiation. Conclusion: This study suggests there is little to no measured metabolic response to radiation therapy in meningiomas as measured by 68Ga- DOTATATE PET CT imaging. Currently, treatment for m eningioma is mostly observation and surgery when clinically indicated; adjuvant radiotherapy/ radiosurgery is used for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas. Further studies on effects of radiation therapy for meningiomas can provide further insight on treatment guidelines. Limitations: This was an imaging-only study without traditional two-year follow-up. Ethics committee approval: The IRB of UT MDACC approved this study.

McEntee*; Cork/IE (mark.mcentee@ucc.ie) Purpose: Health care workers experiences of workplace harass ment are well documented across the world. There appears to be a lack of up-to-date data available on issues relating to workplace harassment amongst radiographers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the incident rate, reporting mechanisms and support services associated with workplace hara ssment. Methods or Background: A questionnaire was designed by adapting a WHO (2003) survey on violence in the health sector. Fol lowing ethical approval and a pilot phase, radiographers across the ROI were invi ted to participate via a snowballing methodology using Social Media and direct contact. Results or Findings: A total of 60 responses were recorded. Verbal abuse was the most frequent form of harassment (65%), fol lowed by acts of microaggression (48%) ent (41.6%) and physical assault (15%). Over 78% were aware of the reporting procedures in place concerning workplace harassment. The majority of participants (78.3%) reported that they had not received official traini ng on how to utilise reporting mechanisms, with 73% stating that they would be mor e likely to report an incident if they knew how. Almost 90% felt that support offered to them following work-related harassment was inadequate. Conclusion: The vulnerability of radiographers to workplace har assment is demonstrated throughout this research. Emphasis is placed on the need for departments to implement strategies to protect empl oyees from such incidents. Limitations: The limited-time frame of this research did not all ow for a thorough analysis to be conducted on a larger cohor t. As a result, the sample size and findings do not represent the wider population of radiographers in ROI. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was granted from the Social Research Ethics Committee in UCC (CT-SREC-2020-39). Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Increased flow of patients and heavy workloads have been shown to have numerous negative outcomes on work well-being. The aim of this study was to assess radiographers' perceived workload. Methods or Background: For this cross sectional designed study conducted as part of a MSc degree in 2019, data was gathered via an online survey sent to diagnostic radiographers in Western Switzerland. Perceived workload was determined using the validated translated version of the NASA-RTLX. Descriptive statistics were established. Results or Findings: Response rate was 23.9% (n=150). Radiographers' percieved workload was above average (6.48/0-10 scale). Mental, physical, temporal demand and performance all scored above 7/ 0-10 scale, with temporal demand being the highest score. The increased number of examinations and the increased pressure to reduce t ime both have an impact on radiographers' perceived temporal workload. Conclusion: These results show that radiographers have high per ceived workload. Misalignment between radiographers' willi ngness to have more time with their patients and the induced time pressures, could lead to an increase in staff turnover. Staff shortage can contribute to hi gher perceived workload since understaffing will automatically induce more work and may lead to error and negative impacts on patient safety. To decrease per ceived physical workload and strain, ergonomic principals must be encouraged through adequate training and work organisation. Departments must ta ke actions that will increase staff in radiological departments to decre ase perceived high workload and guarantee quality of care in the future. Limitations: Limitations linked to using self-reported surveys, analysis of likert scales and the understandability of some statements . Ethics committee approval: Approval was obtained through head of departments. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

Sipos*, A. Repa; Kaposv\u00e1r/HU (cpt.david.sipos@gmail.com) Purpose: Interruptions while working may adversely affect the level of stress and professional quality of life of healthcare work ers. Our aim was to assess the impact of workplace distractions at our institution. Methods or Background: 61 respondents completed our self-designed and internationally validated Effort Reward Imbalance and Professional Quality of Life Scale questionnaire. We also observed the amount and the reason of daily phone calls. Results were analysed using descriptiv e statistics, two-sample T- test, ANOVA, Mann Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p0.05). Results or Findings: Male respondents (p=0.026) over 40 years of age (p=0.020) working as a physician (p=0.004) had significantly higher stress values compared to other professions. Coffee and sm oking habits did not, but the presence of background noise increased stress l evels (p=0.004). The values of Compassion Satisfaction dimension were si gnificantly elevated in the group of women (p=0.004), those over 40 years of age (p=0.008), and those who assist 25 or more phone calls per day (p=0.019) . Male gender (p=0.05), administration and physician positions (p=0.030; p= 0.001), the presence of background noise (p=0.05) affected significantly ne gatively on burnout dimension. Regarding compassion fatigue dimension t he values of non- smoking workers were found to be elevated (p=0.003) . Conclusion: Men over the age of 40 who experience background noise had significantly higher stress values. Profession, gender, age and background noise had significant impact on an individual's professional quality of life. Limitations: Among the limitations of the study belong co-worker s who did not fill out our questionnaire. Ethics committee approval: Approval obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee.

Lewis, Y. Casmod; Johannesburg/ZA (shab0703@gmail.com) Purpose: To explore South African diagnostic radiographers' lived experiences when imaging trauma patients. Methods or Background: Healthcare workers who work with trauma patients experience changes in their psychological functioni ng. Since diagnostic radiographers image trauma patients as part of thei r work routine, they may have similar experiences. However, limited studies were found on radiographers' experience imaging trauma patients. Therefore this qualitative, explorative and descriptive phenomenological study explored diagnostic radiographers' lived experiences when imaging traum a patients. Data was collected through one-on-one in-depth interviews fr om 20 diagnostic radiographers in both the private and public healthcare sectors in Gauteng, South Africa. Detailed notes were taken during the interviews and interviews were audio-recorded. The data was transcribed and underwent thematic analysis. Trustworthiness and ethical principles we re adhered to throughout the study. Results or Findings: Participants conceptualised trauma differently, experiencing both positive and negative effects to imaging trauma patients. They also shared their varying degrees of preparedness to image trauma patients and their coping mechanisms. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 302 Conclusion: Participants viewed imaging of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, road accidents, gender-based violence, bu rns and paediatric injuries to be traumatic. They experienced emotional saturation, desensitisation, detachment and vicarious traumatis ation but evidenced post- traumatic growth and professional commitment. They shared the mechanisms they employ to deal with imaging trauma patients. Limitations: In-depth interviews were conducted virtually, and t herefore non- verbal communication could not be assessed.

Radiographers play a key role in student education. This role is multi-facet ed, often requiring skills not closely aligned to their primary priority of healthcare service provision. There is a lack of research on clinical training in radiography in Europe. A greater understanding is needed of factors influencing radi ographers' ability to effectively undertake clinical education in the context of the challenging \"real- life\" clinical department. This study aimed to develop our current understanding of how radiographers view student supervision in th eir clinical setting by undertaking a national study in Ireland to contribute to the evidence base for Europe. Methods or Background: A mixed-methods, anonymous survey was developed in line with best practice and distributed electronically via networks associated with the radiographer community. Descrip tive statistics were generated and thematic analysis was conducted on optional free-text comments. Results or Findings: There were 217 respondents, representative of the range of radiographer grades, with 57.1% having greater than 6 years' experience of student supervision. Although the maj ority reported positive attitudes, a significant minority did not feel adeq uately trained in the tasks required. Time pressures from clinical workload and perceived lack of organisational support, along with lack of guidance on expectations were challenges highlighted. Additionally, there is a perceived academia-clinical divide to be bridged. Conclusion: Effective clinical supervision is dependent on coll aborative engagement and support at all levels including the clinical department, academic and healthcare institutions, and national organisations. The findings highlight implications for educational supports, pr actice, policy and future research. Limitations: The study was undertaken in the context of one Euro pean country (Ireland). Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was obtained through University College Cork Social Research Ethics Committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

England\u00b9, S. Bockhold\u00b2, J. McNulty\u00b2, L. A. Rainf ord\u00b2, M. F. d. and report the research ethics processes and related challenges for radiographers undertaking research. Methods or Background: An online survey was distributed electronically to radiographers. Convenience sampling was used but respondents were also invited through professional networks. A variety of open- and closed-ended questions were employed, to document the research ethics processes/related challenges within their country. Numerical data was described using descriptive statistics; inferential statistics were used for comparisons/ correlations. Qualitative responses were analysed t hematically. Results or Findings: 288 questionnaires were received from radiographers involved in research within Europe; 56 were excluded due to incomplete responses. The remaining 232 participants represent ed 33 (61%) of the European nations. 95.7% (n = 222) of respondents in dicated that ethical approval was required prior to commencing research projects and 94.8% (n = 220) felt it was important to have research ethics approval before analysing patient data. Most respondents (69%) noted it was a requirement to report research ethics procedures/reference numbers in res earch outputs. Respondents indicated some uncertainty around proce sses for reporting incidental findings, risk assessments and incentive s. Seven themes emerged regarding the challenges for research ethics: 1. Onerous and time-consuming processes for approval; 2. Complexity/lack of guidelines/procedures for applications; 3. Lack of training, experience and k nowledge of the applicant; 4. Lack of standardisation and consistency of the appl ication process; 5. Difficulties accessing data; 6. Cost of application s; 7. Difficulties adhering to rules/regulations. Conclusion: There is broad alignment with research ethics princ iples and processes across Europe, likewise, challenges exist which highlight areas for improvement, and these are again broadly similar. Limitations: This was a self-administered survey and was not rep resentative of all European countries. Hence results may not be representative of the wider picture in Europe. Responses may have disproportionately come from clinical/academia with a stronger research culture. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by City, University of London (ETH1920-0977).

To review the therapeutic options in case of vascular complications analysing especially the role of interventional radiology. Methods or Background: Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice f or end-stage renal disease, with better quality of lif e and longer life expectancy demonstrated. Doppler ultrasound is an excellent to ol for the evaluation of kidney transplantation not only in the immediate postoperative but also for long-term follow-up. In this poster, we will review the appearance of vascular Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 303 renal transplant complications at imaging, typical presenting symptoms, and treatment options. Results or Findings: Vascular complications occur in less than 10% of renal transplants, but we must be able to recognize them due to the potential kidney loss that they may entail. The main vascular compli cations in renal transplant iliac artery thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, compartment syndrome, torsion the transplanted kidney. The role of endoluminal techni ques in the treatment of these complications is constantly increasing. Although early vascular complications, such as renal artery or vein thrombosis usually require urgent surgical treatment, most late vascular complications, such as renal artery stenosis or post-biopsy iatrogenic complications ar e successfully treated using interventional radiology techniques. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a useful tool to evaluate anatom ical characteristics and vascular Doppler flow in renal transplant, being the initial imaging modality used to evaluate vascular patency and potential complications arising in the renal vasculature, among others. Many vascular renal transplant complications may be potentially t reatable if detected early, and the interventional radiologist has an important therapeutic role in these cases.

Alonso S. Mor\u00f3n Hodge, C. Mart\u00edn Her v\u00e1s, S. Agudo Fernandez, M. E. Garcia Fernandez, M. Alva rez Maestro; Madrid/ES Purpose: To review TNM and Mayo Clinic classification for in travascular extension of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To revise radiological findings employed to differentiate bland and tumour thrombus and signs that may indicate complex vascular surgery. To illustrate re nal tumours with vascular wall invasion by different cases from our instituti on. Methods or Background: Intravascular tumour thrombus is seen at presentation in approximately 10% of patients with RCC. In many cases radical nephrectomy with thrombectomy is the only therapeut ic option. Sometimes it has to be performed with inferior vena cava resecti on. These surgeries entail high complexity and require multidisciplinary teams . Radiological evaluation to detect vascular extension is crucial for an adequat e surgical planning. Initial imaging may be done with CT. Thrombus level, type of thrombus and ancillary findings that have been associated with vascular wall invasion and complex surgery need to be specified. Results or Findings: We have retrospectively reviewed patients with RCC and vascular extension treated at our institution f rom 2011-2021. A total number of 18 patients had vascular invasion. Most of them were clear cell carcinomas (15 cases) with Mayo level 1 (7 patients ) and Mayo 4 (5 patients). Urography, US, CT and MRI images will be displayed with pathologic correlation. To determine thrombus level, we will r evise TNM (8th Ed.) and Mayo Clinic classifications. We will review radiological findings that may aid in the differentiation between bland and tumour thrombus, as well as morphologic and quantitative criteria that associate complex vascular surgery. Conclusion: Thorough radiological evaluation followed by prompt surgery is vital for an adequate management of patients with R CC and vascular invasion. Radiologic evaluation must include thrombus level, type of thrombus and vascular invasion likelihood criteria related with complex vascular surgery. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Lucas Cava*\u00b9, F. M. S\u00e1nchez-Margallo\u00b9, To the feasibility, effectivenes s, and safety of prostatic artery occlusion (PAO) with a liquid embolic agent in a canine model. Methods or Background: Five adult male Beagle dogs (5.00\u00b10.71 years) underwent PAO with Onyx-18. MRI evaluation was perf ormed immediately before, and at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 mont hs after PAO. Onxy cast and recanalisation of the occluded arteries were documented by CT and angiography immediately after PAO, and at 1 month and 3 months follow-ups. All dogs were closely inspected for potential procedure-related complications. Prostate volume reduction and prostate infarction s ize were statistically compared. Results or Findings: PAO procedures were performed successfully on both sides in all dogs. Onyx reflux resulting in occlusi on of the internal pudendal artery occurred in one dog, and was confirmed by CT . No major PAO-related complications were observed in any dogs during 3 months. Compared with baseline data, MRI study showed a significant prost ate shrinkage in all animals, which started at 2 weeks after PAO, with a maximal prostate volume reduction at 1 month, and kept stable until 3 months. Prostate infarction was detected bilaterally in all animals, and then decre ased statistically at 2 weeks and 1 month. Recanalisation was observed in 7 and 8 prostate sides, respectively at 1 and 3 months after PAO. Conclusion: PAO with Onyx\u00ae is a safe and effective procedure th at may induce a significant prostate shrinkage due to the local ischaemia. As an alternative technique, PAO may have potential in cl inical practice in the management of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Limitations: The limitations was the small sample size.

P. A. P. C. Moura, O. Zorzenoni, M. I. Novis; S\u00e3o Paulo/BR Purpose: This summarise the somatic and viscer al neural anatomy in a practical way, to illustrate the main findings of neural involvement by deep pelvic endometriosis. Methods or Background: A survey of images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with endometriosis in the radiology department of our institution over three years, with a literature rev iew. Results or Findings: Although rare, the involvement of the pelvic nerves by deep endometriosis (DE) has high clinical relevance and its early diagnosis and adequate treatment can avoid functional and sensory limitations. The pelvic neural anatomy is divided into somatic and v isceral nerves. The main somatic nerves that have an endopelvic course include the lumbosacral plexus, the sciatic, pudendal, and obturator nerves , responsible for innervation of the lower limbs and pelvic floor. Pelvic visceral innervation is performed by the superior hypogastric plexus, hypogastric and inferior hypogastric plexus, responsible for innervating the vagina, cer vix, uterus, fallopian tubes, bladder and rectum. DE can affect the nerves by ext ension of other pelvic lesions or as an isolated finding. MRI findings inc lude infiltrative and retractile tissue, sometimes with haematic content, blood cyst s, diffuse neural root thickening, restricted diffusion, signs of denervat ion with muscle atrophy and, rarely, bone extension with oedema. Conclusion: Diagnosis of neural injuries from DE is a challenge for abdominal radiologists. The recognition of details of pelvic neuroanatomy allows the radiologist to identify or at least suspect neural endometriosis and supply relevant information to the surgeon. Highlighting neural involvement is crucial not only for surgical planning, but also for inform ing and discussing possible complications with patients.

Deen*; Cambridge/UK Purpose: To investigate the relationship between magnetisati transfer (MT) and tissue macromolecules in high-grade serous ovar ian cancer (HGSOC) and whether there is a detectable change in magnetisati on transfer ratio (MTR) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Methods or Background: In this prospective observational study, twelve HGSOC patients were imaged at 3T before treatment and five of these patients were also imaged after three cycles of NACT. MTR wa s compared to tissue histology and immunohistochemistry, quantified with semi-automated histology analysis software. Tumour cellularity was used as a marker of intracellular macromolecular concentration and the extracellular proteins collagen IV and laminin were used as markers of extracellular macromolecular concentration. The Shapiro-Wilk test was first used to assess for normality of data. Spearman's rank-order and Pearson's correlation tes ts were then used to compare MTR with tissue quantifications. Results or Findings: The had a positive correlation with cellularity, rho = 0.56 (P < 0.05) and a negative correlation with tumour v olume, rho = -0.72 (P = 0.01). MTR did not correlate with collagen IV or laminin quantification (P = 0.40 and P = 0.90 respectively). For those patients imaged before and after NAC, an increase in MTR was observed in each case with m ean MTR 20.6 \u00b1 3.1% treatment-na\u00efve HGSOC , is reflective of cellularity and therefore intracellul ar macromolecular concentration.

Berr\u00edos; Toledo/ES Purpose: Describe the main imaging characteristics of adrenal pathology and its histological correlation. Methods or Background: At present, with the growing demand for radiological tests such as computed tomography (CT) , there has been a significant increase in the incidental detection of adrenal tumours, with adenomas and metastases being the most frequent pat hologies. The indications for imaging studying the adrenal gl ands are patients with impaired adrenal function, evaluation of incidental ly found masses, and identification of metastatic disease in cancer pati ents. There is a vast spectrum of adrenal lesions, such as benign and malignant masses, hemorrhage, infections, pseudotumours, and adrenal hyperplasia. With the use of CT, two criteria differentiate benign adenomas from malignant lesions: the intracellular lipid content in the mass and vascular enhancement differences. Results or Findings: We will use a classification based on the main imaging findings to facilitate radiological diagnosis, dist inguishing the following groups: small adrenal masses, large solid masses, cystic le sions, and others. We provide CT, ultrasound, and MRI images to describe and illustrate the most common features of common and rare adrenal lesions that may suggest a specific diagnosis. Furthermore, we show the histopathological findings of these adrenal affections to highlight the capacity of histology in the differentiation of lesions indistinguishable by ima ging, which is essential for the subsequent therapeutic management of the patient. Conclusion: Radiologists play a fundamental role in the detecti on and characterisation of adrenal lesions in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging allow the diagnosis in most cases. Consequently, it is crucial to know the main imaging findings to differentiate benign from malignant masses and guide the differential diagnosis that allows adequate patient therapeutic management .

Methods or Background: Radiomic studies are based on the use of quantitative biomarkers or features for their use i n prognosis and diagnosis of several pathologies. However, this field presents a lack of standardisation. There are several initiatives regarding this topic and quality in radiomic research starts with the use of textural phantoms t o analyse the response of the features when different protocols or scanners are used. In this study, the most robust features are selected in terms of repeatability and reproducibility for five scanners using a CCR textural phantom, ARI A software for segmentation and registration, and Quibim Precision platform for the extraction of 91 features. Results or Findings: From the test-retest analysis without repositioning, 42.9% of the features were repeatable, fulfilling t hat ICC>0.9 and wCV<1% for the 80% of the scanners. In the intra-CT study, 38. 5% of the features satisfied the reproducibility criteria based on CCC>0.9 and w CV<10%. In the inter-CT comparison, 45.1% of the features were reproducible across the scanners. Finally, 25.3% (23/91) features were considered as both repeatable and reproducible biomarkers, suitable for radiomic studies. Conclusion: Repeatability and reproducibility studies with text ural phantoms are the first step for quality radiomics research, assessing the most robust features and helping in high-dimensionality reducti on of variables for further model training. Limitations: Filtering conditions were chosen to obtain a similar amount of features in each selection. Different conditions would lead to other datasets. Moreover, shape features were not analysed since volumes of interest were imposed. Ethics committee approval: This study received the approval of the Galician Local Ethics Committee (2019/230).

Ramanauskas*\u00b9, of Oxipit \"ChestEye Quality\" tool for quality assurance purposes in chest x-ray reporting on Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (Tilburg, the Netherlands) retrospective d ata sample. Methods or Background: A retrospective sample of anonymised chest x-ray studies from the time period of 10.02.2021-15.09.2021 (n = 15655) was selected. The studies were processed by the solution which identified the cases with the most potential for a missed finding based on the output of the solution and the results of the automatic evaluation of the radiologists final report using a custom made chest x-ray report natur al language processing tool. A radiologist has evaluated the cases flagged by the software to determine if there is a clinically significant radi ological finding detectable in the image which was not appropriately described in the radiologist report. The final performance metrics were evaluated to quantify the number of cases with significant radiological findings missed in the radiologists report and flagged by the solution. Results or Findings: A total of 14 studies (0,0894 %) were evaluated as containing clinically significant radiological findings detectable in the image on retrospective review which were not appropriately described in the final radiologist report. 8 studies contained nodular opacities and 6 studies contained an area of consolidation. Conclusion: The results indicate that AI based software used for quality assurance purposes is able to detect studies where a clinically significant radiological finding is not appropriately described by the reporting radiologist. In a prospective setting this could help to prevent a significant number of radiological errors. Limitations: This was a retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: In progress.

Methods or Background: A retrospective sample of anonymised chest x-ray studies from the time period of 15.02.2020-01.08.2020 (n = 52818) was selected. The studies were processed by the solution which identified the cases with the most potential for a missed finding based on the output of the solution and the results of the automatic evaluation of the radiologists final report using a custom made chest x-ray report natur al language processing tool. A radiologist has evaluated the cases flagged by the software to determine if there is a clinically significant radi ological finding detectable in the image, which was not appropriately described in the radiologist report. The final performance metrics were evaluated to quantif y the number of cases with significant radiological findings missed in the radiologists report and flagged by the solution. Results or Findings: A total of 42 studies (0,795 %) were evaluated as containing clinically significant radiological findings detectable in the image on retrospective review which were not appropriately described in the final radiologist report. 10 studies contained nodular opacities, 13 studies contained an area of consolidation, 19 studies contained a pn eumothorax, 5 studies contained malposition of central venous line. Conclusion: The results indicate that AI based software used for quality assurance purposes is able to detect studies where a clinically significant radiological finding is not appropriately described by the reporting radiologist. In a prospective setting this could help to prevent a significant number of radiological errors. Limitations: This was a retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: In progress.

Demircioglu, Radiomics often deal with high-dimensional . Since often external cohorts are not available, cross-validation is applied to obtain an estimation on the generalisability of the models. U nfortunately, if feature selection is applied incorrectly before the cross-v alidation, it can result in data leakage and thus to biased results. An experiment i s conducted to measure the extend of this bias. Methods or Background: Ten publicly available datasets were used to apply feature selection incorrectly before a 10-fold cros s-validation on the one hand, and to apply it correctly inside the cross-validati on. Models were evaluated using AUC-ROC, as well as accuracy. Results or Findings: Incorrect feature selection before cross-validation led to biases of up to 0.15 in AUC-ROC and 0.17 in accurac y. Conclusion: Highly biased results can be trained if feature sel ection and cross-validation are incorrectly applied. Limitations: No external cohort were available for further valid ating the resulting bias, although it can be expected that results of the cross-validation generalised to external cohorts. Ethics committee approval: All data used in this study were previously published, therefore ethical approval was waived by the local Ethics Committee.

Hertgers*\u00b9, K. Hergaarden\u00b9, A. Efitorov\u00b2, Compensating the performance drop of AI models due to deployment in clinical workflows different from the training environment by using dedicated ensembling technique and re-training parts of the model with a limited number of images. Methods or Background: We trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the classification of chest x-rays with respect to occurrence of pneumothorax on ChestXray-14, MIMIC-CXR and CheXper t datasets. Variation of architecture and hyperparameters yield ed a total of nine pretrained CNNs, which were ensembled by a single fully connec ted layer trained on the mentioned datasets. By minimising this last layer's number of parameters, we enabled retraining on a small number of images. For performance evaluation, 542 chest x-rays from clinical routine from our hos pital were annotated by radiologists and split into a training set (118 pos itive/316 negative pneumothorax) and a test set (30 positive/78 negati ve). After establishing the baseline performance on the test set, the model was retrained on the training set, and performance was reevaluated on the test set. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 306 Results or Findings: We obtained an AUC of 0.868 on the MIMIC-CXR data. The performance dropped to 0.542 when applying the model directly on the clinical data. By selective retraining the performa nce increased to an AUC of 0.915. The difference between the original and retr ained AUC values stems presumably from different samplings of the overall case distribution. Conclusion: We demonstrated a time-efficient workflow to adapt laboratory trained AI models to the clinical data distribution they will be used with. This is done by retraining a small ensembling layer using l imited dataset to counteract the drop in performance that occurs, thus making the AI predictions more reliable and clinically usable.

Payne, R. Black, P riest, F. J. Gilbert; Cambridge/UK (sh2040@cam.ac.uk) Purpose: To evaluate the performance of deep learning (DL) algorithms in a triennial breast screening programme. Methods or Background: Two DL algorithms (DL-1&DL-2) were tested retrospectively on full-field digital mammograms of 50-70-year-olds from a UK National Health Service screening centre and compar ed with reader performance. Ground truth for normals was negative three-yearly mammogram, and histopathology for cancer cases. Thr esholds were pre- specified at UK consensus reader performance of 96% specificity. Results or Findings: In 2017 18,831 women were screened of which 10,052 cases were included with either a normal subsequent examination (Covid19 delayed screening round), screen-detected cancer di agnosis 138 (7.3/1000) or interval cancers diagnosis 71 (3.8/1000). At consensus reader specificity of 96.1% sensitivity was 68.4%, (51.7-66.0), 58. 9% (51.7-65.6) respectively. Reader 1 achieved 95.5% and 63.6% specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Th e AUC for DL-1 and DL-2 picked up 13.0% and 22.2% next round cancers as wel l as 18.3% and 19.7% interval cancers respectively, at the assigned thre shold. With the threshold at 90% specificity the respective sensitivities for DL-1 and DL-2 were 70.8% and 71.3%. The proportion of next round cancers detecte d were 33.3%, and 31.5%, and interval cancers were 33.8%, and 43.7%, for DL-1 and DL-2 respectively. Conclusion: At 96.1% specificity threshold the systems show sim ilar performance, but inferior to consensus and first re ader performance. Stand- alone AI could be used at 90% threshold with second reader arbitrating to 95% specificity. Benchmarking performance with screenin g cohorts establishes appropriate thresholds before prospective testing. Limitations: One screening site and majority of cases from one m anufacture.

Hickman*, N. Payne, R. Prie st, F. J. Gilbert; Cambridge/UK Purpose: To evaluate the performance of three different Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, designed for various automated mammography screen reading tasks, applied for interval cancer (IC) detection. Methods or Background: DL algorithms were independently tested on two- view digital screening mammograms collected from 2011-2020 at one UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme site on predominantly (>90%) Philips machines. The dataset consisted of I Cs with a histopathological diagnosis as well as normal age and year matched controls at a ratio of 1:3. Pre-specified thresholds were used to evaluate perf ormance of algorithms designed for different screening tasks. The thresholds were European consensus (98%), UK consensus (96%), and adapted re ading specificity (90%) and expected IC detection sensitivity (30%). An application-specific threshold for each algorithm was also applied. Results or Findings: 8308 images containing 528 IC cases (25.42%) were used for testing all three DL algorithms and result s are listed in a consistent order. At 98%, specificity, sensitivity was 15.91%, 11.74%, 15.53%; sensitivity, specificity was 93.87%, 90.77%, 92 .45%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.72, 0.71, 0.71. At the pre- specified company threshold, the specificity and sensitivity were 75.86% and 57.77%, 98.52% and was 0.746. Conclusion: DL algorithms could play a role in the earlier detection of cancers. How algorithms are designed for specific screening tasks should be considered when determining thresholds for use and their appli cation. In addition, this study demonstrates how a combination of algorithms could improve performance. Limitations: Small study cohort without the class-imbalance of r outine screening from one screening site and predominantly one vendor.

Hoogenboom\u00b9, M. M. L. Engels\u00b2, J. prevalence of findings associated with pre- diagnostic pancreatic cancer on MRI. Methods or Background: As part of a single-centre, retrospective, case- control study of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between 2010-2016, a cohort of 27 patients w ho had an MRI within 3 years prior to diagnosis were matched with 103 heal thy controls for age, gender, modality, contrast use, and date of imaging. Two board-certified radiologists independently interpreted each imaging exam, blinded to Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 307 case/control status. The prevalence of missed PDAC and related features were evaluated. Results or Findings: A focal pancreatic mass was suspected in 63% of cas es by the two radiologists, with an increased detectio n rate closer to eventual diagnosis. The interobserver agreement was substant ial (kappa 0.66). MRI- findings, including or mm pancreatic duct, had 100% specificity for pre-diagnostic PDAC and similar sensitivities among the reviewers, between 41% to 52% (p<0.0001). Focal pan creatic atrophy was seen in 35% of cases and none of the controls. Other findings significantly associated with pre-diagnostic PDAC included diffus e pancreatic atrophy and the presence of perivascular soft tissue. A complet ely normal pancreas was seen in 5.6% of cases and 59.2% of controls. Conclusion: In patients who underwent an MRI up to 3 years before diagnosis of PDAC, a suspected mass was found in as many as 63% on secondary review by radiologists, an astonishing statistic. I n pursuit of detecting PDAC at a more curable stage, this study suggests paying ex tra attention to highly specific findings. Limitations: Retrospective design and selection bias.

In this prospective exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET/MRI-based ea rly chemotherapy response prediction in PDAC at two weeks upon therapy onset. Methods or Background: In a mixed cohort, seventeen patients treated with chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX- or Gemcitabine-based) in neoadjuvant or palliative intent were enrolled. All patients were imaged by [18F]FDG PET/MRI before and two weeks after onset of chemotherapy. R esponse per RECIST1.1 was then assessed at multiple t -test, Man-Whitney-U test and Fisher's exact test for binary features. Results or Findings: At 72\u00b143 days, twelve patients were classified as responders and five patients as non-responders. An increase in MTV50% and ADCmean ( 20% respectively) and a decrease in TLG50% ( 20%) at 2 weeks after chemotherapy onset enabled e xcellent prediction and discrimination of responders and non-responders, respectively. Parameter combinations ( TLG50% and ADCmax particular a change in tumour glycoly sis and cellularity, may enable very early chemotherapy response prediction in PDAC.

Marticorena Garcia; Berlin/DE Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic from healthy pancreatic tissue and to asses s the prediction of tumour aggressiveness by correlating PNET stiffness with P ET derived asphericity. Methods or Background: 13 patients with PNET were prospectively compared to 13 age-/sex-matched heathy volunteers. Multifrequency MRE with tomoelastography-postprocessing provided Diagn of MRE was evaluated by ROC-AUC analysis. PNET-SWS cor relations were calculated with Pearson's r. Results or Findings: SWS was ity (r=0.81; p=0.01). Conclusion: Multifrequency MRE provides quantitative imaging ma rkers for the detection of PNET and the prediction of greater tumour aggressiveness by increased stiffness. Limitations: A small sample size without further analysis of PNE T subgroups was investigated. Furthermore, for ethical reasons, no prospective tumour biopsies were performed directly before MRE. Instea d, diagnoses were confirmed by routine clinical histopathology and PE T/CT and PET/MRI.

We evaluat a more detailed MRI subtyping of the cystic Our retrospective single-centre study included MR examinations of pathologically confirmed SCN (n = 45) and MCN (n = 21) within the years 2005-2020. We designed an MRI reading template with graphic illustration of seven subtypes of cystic patterns (micro, macro, micro- macro, honeycomb, micro-honeycomb, macro-honeycomb, micro-macro- and cyst sign). Interobserver variability and diagnosti c performance was evaluated by three independent readers. Results or Findings: Based on the current guidelines, the majority of SC N were microcystic (28/45; 62%) macrocystic however, were also classified macrocystic (16/45; 36%) and therefore potentially suspicious of MCN. U sing the more detailed subtyping, 11/16 (69%) of these SCN showed at least one of the following imaging findings: honeycomb-components, centralisat ion, scar. These findings were not detected in MCN and therefore had a high negative predictive value for MCN (100%). In contrast, cyst-in-cyst was only found in MCN (5/21; 24%). Interobserver agreement was excellent for honeycomb components (kappa = 0.86), good for centralisation (kappa = 0.66) and c yst-in-cyst sign (kappa = 0.70) and moderate for scar (kappa = 0.57). Conclusion: Detailed MRI subtyping allows for improved differentiation between SCN and MCN, especially in SCN with macrocy stic components. Limitations: Limitations of the study include the retrospective patient selection and the single-centre design.

We aimed to investigate the prognostic effect of sarcopenia and myosteatosis in patients with resect able PDAC, by using muscle quality map on preoperative computed tomography (CT). Methods or Background: This study included 347 patients with resectable PDAC, underwent successful upfront surgery. Preoper ative CT-based muscle quality map was generated to measure skeletal muscl e area (SMA), further classified into normal attenuating muscle area (NAM A) and low attenuating muscle area. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was used as an sarcopenia index. As there is no widely used index of myosteatosis on muscle quality map, we evaluated optimal index of myosteatosis and diagnos tic cutoffs. Survival analysis was carried out using univariate and multi variate Cox regression according to muscle type; normal muscle type (nMT), sarcopenic (sMT), myosteatotic (mMT), combined (cMT). Results had the lowest correlation with SMI (Pearson's r = 0.32), and determined as the optimal index of myosteatosis. Either having sarcopenia or myosteatosis is prognos tic for poor overall survival (OS), even adjusted by clinicopathologic factors (hazard ratio [HR] free survival (RFS), preoperative sarcopenia and myosteatosis found to b e associated in the univariable analysis, albeit only the mMT showed si gnificantly higher tumour recurrence compared with nMT in the multivariable a nalysis (HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.01/2.20]). Conclusion: Presence of sarcopenia or myosteatosis is associate d with poor OS and RFS after upfront surgery in patients with r esectable PDAC. Limitations: We measured muscle parameters in a single timepoint on preoperative CT. Longitudinal change of muscle after surgery needs to be further investigated.

A fully automated airway-artery (A A) method was validated for the detection and monitoring of Awt and bronchi ectasis on chest-CT. We hypothesised the AA-method sensitive to detect p rogression of Awt and bronchiectasis in CF. Methods or Background: LungQ-AA software (v2.3.1rc, Thirona B.V., The Netherlands) fully automatically identifies the air way tree, matching arteries, and airway generation (G) for each AA-pair. For eac h AA-pair outer airway wall diameter (Aout), Awt and paired artery diameter (A) are measured and Aout/A and Awt/A are calculated and presented from segment al bronchi (G1) up to the last visible airways generation (G20). LungQ-AA %Br onchiectasis is CF[1] %Bronchiectasis for validation. We analysed CTs of 190 CF patients who participated in the phase III Ataluren study[1]. Mixed-effects models w ere used to investigate differences in Aout/A and Awt/A over 48 weeks in each generation adjusted for gender, age, weight, and height. Results or Findings: From G1 to baseline 45,828 AA-pairs (156 patients) and follow-up 59,137 AA-pai rs (176 patients). Over 48 weeks, Aout/A and Awt/A increased (all p<0.0001).

However, the effects of CFTRm on lung disease as well as on chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) depicted by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are little understood. Methods or Background: 52 adults with CF (31\u00b19y, range 19-55y) underwent chest MRI twice, before (MRI1) and after (MRI2) at least one month of Kaftrio therapy (n=19), CFTRm other than Kaftrio (n=8) and difference between MRI1 and MRI2: 34\u00b118m onth). 25 patients also underwent MRI of the paranasal sinuses twice before and after Kaftrio (n=9), other CFTRm (n=5) and without CFTRm (n=11). MRI sca ns were visually assessed in consensus by two readers using the vali dated CF-MRI and CRS- MRI scoring systems. Forced expiratory volume in 1s percent predicted (FEV1%) was measured by spirometry in conjunction w ith MRI. Results or Findings: The CF-MRI score decreased significantly from MRI1 to MRI2 only in patients treated with Kaftrio (-11.4\u00b14.6, p<0.001), mainly due to reduction and bronchiectasis/wall thickening (-3.3\u00b12.2, p<0.001), did not differ (- 0.4\u00b11.7, p=0.298). The CRS-MRI score also decreased only in patients with Kaftrio from MRI1 to MRI2 (-6.9\u00b13.0, p=0.001), sinus: -0.9\u00b11.0, p=0.001). In patients treated with Kaftrio, the decrease in the CF-MRI score correlate d with an increase in FEV1% (r=-0.547, p<0.001). Conclusion: MRI detected beneficial effects of Kaftrio on struc tural lung disease, and improvements were accompanied by an increase in FEV1%. Further, we could demonstrate improvements of chronic rhinosinusitis after Kaftrio therapy. Limitations: As a limitation our study was performed unicentrically and children were not included.

P. Sheahan, *A. T. O'Mahony*, C. Crowley, D. Mor rissey, H. Ibrahim, A. McMahon, O. O'Connor, M. A. Maher, B. Plant; Cor k/IE (aomahony@ucc.ie) Purpose: As the life expectancy of patients with CF extends, the effect of ionising radiation exposure is of increasing concer n. This paper directly quantifies and evaluates CED in the era of low dose CT techniques and CFTR modulator therapy. Methods or Background: Retrospective observational study at a nationally designated specialist CF tertiary care centre. A study period from 01/01/2010- 31/01/2021, included 180 patients who were >18 year s and attending this facility alone for the entire study duration. Clini cal data including demographics, transplant status and modulator status were recorde d. CED data for all modalities was taken from actual institutional imaging, institutional averages if not possible and estimated using up to date dose da ta from published literature where unavailable. Number of studies and individual CED were recorded. Segregated according to thoracic or extra-thoracic and within these groups by modality. Data split into either pre-or post-modulator where applicable. Results or Findings: 139 of 180 commenced modulator treatments, 15 of 18 0 receiving lung with two liver transplants. 82% of patients received <25 mSv over the study period. Pre-modulator mean number of studies/year/person was 2.65 (1.52 Thoracic, ean number of studies/year/person was 2.98 (1.78 Thoracic, 1.20 E xtra-thoracic). five-fold increase in thoracic CT scanning. However, there was no increased radiation exposure and in fa ct a net CED reduction. Increased abdomen-pelvic imaging in CF is having a relative proportional effect on CED.

Methods or Background: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane were searched by two independent reviewers for studies on association between CT-based emphysema (visually or quantitatively assessed based on HU) and lung cancer risk. Emphysema was measured as a dichotomous and c ontinuous variable (%Low Attenuation Area). Associations of emphysema severity (trace, mild and moderate-severe by visual and quantitative analysis ) and subtype (only by visual) with lung cancer were also identified. Adjusted odds ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios were derived and combined to estimate overall and stratified pooled ORs (pORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Results or Findings: 21 out of 3,343 screened studies with 25 study subs ets were included. The overall pOR for lung cancer given the presence of emphysema was 2.28 (95%CI: 2.01-2.60, I2=31.1%, 19 I2=0%, 6 study subsets) per 1% increase of %LAA. Studies with visual emphys ema yielded comparable results with that of quantitative CT emphysema: pOR 2.26 (95%CI: 1.94-2.64, 2.25 (95%CI: 1.82-2.77, I2=0%; 9 study subsets), respectively. Based on 6 studies including 1,716 participants, pORs of emphysema severity for lung cancer ranged f rom 2.48-4.50 for visual assessment and 1.90-2.45 for quantitative CT. Compared with no emphysema, centrilobular emphysema was significantly with 1.50-3.22, Both visual and quantitative CT-based emphysema are associated with the risk of lung cancer and this ri sk increases with emphysema severity. Regarding subtype, only centrilobular emphysema shows an association with lung cancer. Limitations: Few studies reported severity and subtype of emphys ema. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

At present, there is no data on th e mechanical properties of tracheae and to what extent e.g. chronic lymphocyte infiltration with concomitant remodeling affects respiratory mechanic s. The aim of this basic research work was to establish a methodology to inv estigate tracheae for their biomechanical properties and to create a CT-based, finite element model (FEM) to simulate respiratory mechanics. Methods or Background: 8 tracheae were obtained from body donors (6 /2 ), three with known severe COPD, within 24 hours af ter death. Scans were performed on a dual-source CT (Somatom Force, Sieme ns) and FEM with separate representation of cartilage braces ligamentous connective was created (Synopsys was performed using tensile tests. To clas sify different material properties, individual cartilage braces were tested in isolation in a separate compression test. Results or Findings: In tensile tests on composite samples of the trache a a linear stiffening behaviour could be derived for larger deformations. Stiffness between 10-30 MPa occurred. Stiffness of COPD patie nts' trachea (\u00d815MPa) was distinctly lower when compared to the other sam ples (\u00d825MPa). Through combination of mechanical experiments and CT scan, a FEM was created and with parameter identification the biological parameters were determined. There, the annular ligaments were significantly sti ffer than the cartilages. Conclusion: In this work, the biomechanical properties of trachea were determined and the first biomechanically realistic digital trachea model for airway simulation was calculated with the acquired CT images. Lower stiffness of the examined COPD trachea might be a first biome chanical correlate for radiological findings such as tracheal collapse, me rging applied pathomechanics and imaging.

Fichera*, R. Stramare, R. Motta, To a semi-automatic quantification of cystic pulmonary changes in paediatric patients with juvenile system ic sclerosis (JSSc) and to perform a longitudinal quantitative evaluation of s uch changes at follow-up. Methods or Background: Children with JSSc referring to our tertiary centre who performed at least one computed tomography (CT) were included. One radiologist with four years of experience in paedia tric imaging performed all segmentations by 3D Slicer par ticular, the lung segmenter and CT analyser tools were used and the volume affected by cystic changes was considered in the range -1050 - -950 Hu. To evaluate the reliability of the method, a second reader performed the same measurem ents and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was comput ed. For the longitudinal assessment, aiming to reduce the bias due to the gr owth of children during the interval between the two CT scans, a ratio between the volume affected by cystic changes and the overall inflated lungs volum e was applied. Then the ratios at the two-time intervals were compared usin g the paired Student's t- test. The applied level of significance was 0.05 fo r all analyses. Results or Findings: Ten patients (4 female; mean age 7.8\u00b14.6 years old) were examined at diagnosis and seven (70%) underwent a follow-up CT. At diagnosis, on average, the bilateral inflated volum e was of 1085\u00b1475 cc3 and the volume affected by cystic changes was of 183.82 cc3 (16.8%). The method demonstrated high interrater reliability in the qua ntification of cystic changes (ICC=0.832). At follow-up, the proposed ratio demonstrated a statistically significant increase of the cystic changes (ratio 0 .11 vs 0.19, p=0.009). Conclusion: The proposed semi-automatic quantification of cysti c changes in paediatric patients with JSSc demonstrated to be a reliable tool at diagnosis and follow-up. Limitations: Not applicable.

Choe, E. J. Chae; Seoul/KR (sumin943@gmail.com) Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether pulmonary c yst progression after long-term follow-up of thoracic CT in patient s with Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome (BHD) and to investigate risk factors for pneumothorax in patients with BHD. Methods or Background: Our retrospective cohort included 44 patients with BHD (18 men; mean age 54.2 \u00b1 11.6 years). We evaluated whether cysts progress via visual assessment and quantitative measurement on the initial and serial thoracic CT images. We also evaluated whether the pulmonary function test (PFT) progresses. The visual assessment included size, location, number, shape, distribution, presence of the visibl e wall, fissural or subpleural cysts, and air-cuff signs. In 26 patients available 1-mm thin-section data, the quantitative assessment was performed with the volume of the low attenuation area (LAA) using in-house software. Risk factors fo r pneumothorax were analysed using multiple regression analysis. Results or Findings: On visual assessment, the largest cyst in both lungs showed a significantly increase in size (right: 5.00 mm, p < 0.001, 95% quantitative assessment, cysts s howed a slow increase in size on the dot plot on serial thoracic CT. In 33 p atients with available PFT data, change -0.65% (p=0 .054, 95% CI; not show a significant diff erence but showed decreasing tendency. The family history of pneumothorax was the risk factor for the development of pneumothorax. Conclusion: Pulmonary cysts in patients with BHD increase in si ze on longitudinal thoracic CT. The risk factor for pneum othorax in BHD patients is the family history of pneumothorax. Limitations: This study is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a single centre. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study received institutional review board approval. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Yalon*, K. N. Glazebrook, L. D. Viers, S. Leng, M. Johnson, C. McCollough, J. G. Fletcher; Rochester, MN/US Purpose: To compare the of and silicone- specific dual-energy CT (DECT) material classificat ion for identifying silicone associated with breast implant rupture. Methods or Background: This prospective study included patients with silicone breast implants undergoing MRI. DECT images were reconstructed using two methods: a) conventional virtual non-cont rast (VNC) and b) silicone specific. A non-reader breast radiologist established the reference standard for extracapsular and nodal silicone on MRI. Three blinded radiologists reviewed the randomised DECT images reconstructed using the two material classification methods on two separate sessions to detect extracapsular and nodal silicone. Results or Findings: Forty-seven female patients with 89 implants were included. Extracapsular silicone was identified in 12/12 patients and 35/35 lymph nodes, relatively to the MR gold standard. Pooled reader data demonstrated that the silicone-specific classificat ion had higher AUC these trends were not signifi cant. Silicon-specific material classification resulted in significant improvement in detection of extracapsular and nodal silicone for one of three readers classification tends to show improved reader confidence in detecting both extracapsular and nodal silicon, with statistical significance shown for one reader. Sili cone-specific DECT material classification offers a promising alternative to MR for patients undergoing breast implant evaluation. Limitations: Number of cases.

Ma, A. Liu, H. Li, J. Ma, Y. Wang, Z. Ye; Tianjin/CN (zhuyueqiang1985@126.com) Purpose: axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in breast canc er patients. Methods or Background: 169 patients with breast cancer confirmed by surgical excision pathology were divided into training (n=113) and validation Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 311 (n=56) cohorts. 851 radiomics features were extract ed from tumours on CE- CBBCT, features selection were performed using two- sample t test and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and radi omics score was constructed with support vector machine. Multivaria te logistic regression analysis was used to establish a radiomics nomogram based on the combination of radiomics score and independent clinicopathologic risk factors for identifying whether the tumour presented ALN metastasis. The performance of the radiomics nomogram was assessed by its discr imination, calibration, and clinical usefulness with independent validation. Results or Findings: 67 of 169 patients were confirmed with ALN metastas is. The radiomics nomogram, comprising pathological grade, Ki-67 index and radiomics score, showed good performance in predict ing which tumours presented ALN metastasis (AUC=0.837 with 95% confidence in the validation cohort) and good calibratio n. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the radiomics nom ogram. Conclusion: CE-CBBCT based radiomics nomogram has potential to be used as a non-invasive tool in predicting ALN metastasis from preoperative images, and could therefore be useful to assist clinicians in preoperative decision- making. This could be especially important in CBBCT , since it could help address the issue of limited axilla coverage. Limitations: The cohort was relatively small and only mass lesions were enrolled. Ethics committee approval: The institutional review board approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Sefidbakht*, P. Iranpour, erative axillary staging in patients referred for biopsy of breast m asses to a tertiary breast clinic. To compare the accuracy of US done by breas t imaging expert (BI) to general radiologist (GR) in the diagnosis of malign ant axillary LNs. To identify areas of improvement in GR training in preoperative staging of the axilla. Methods or Background: The axillae were re-evaluated in 655 patients with B4b-B5 masses in the breast who were referred for biopsy of the breast and/or axillary LN. The number, size, and morphological characteristics of additional LNs detected on expert ultrasound were compared to initial US and surgery results in patients who underwent surgery without N AC. Results or Findings: Out of 655 pateints who entered the study, initiall y 98 patients turned out malignant and underwent surgery (BCT or MRM) and SLNB 7/or ALND without NAC. In 75 patients additional obviously malignant (29) or suspicious (46) LN were detected in expert US. In s urgery in 58 patients the additional LNs were proven to be malignant. Out of 58 surgery-proven new LNs, 23 were located in level 1, 8 in level 3, and 16 were either small but round with or without evidence of extra-LN invasion or sh owed focal cortical thickening level 2 lymph nodes. In 11 patients number of obviously malignant lymph nodes in level 2 were underestimated. Conclusion: There is a significant added value to BI-performed axillary LN staging (58/98). This specifically includes level 1 and 3LN. The GR will benefit from training in evaluating these areas, detailed m orphological evaluation of the smaller lymph nodes, and clinical significance of the exact number of involved lymph nodes in clinical decision making. Limitations: Exact ultrasound-surgery correlation for LNs is challenging. Ethics committee approval: The institutional ethics committee approved this retrospective blinded study.

H. computed tomography (DLCT) for preoperative diagnosis of axi llary sentinel lymph node (SLNs) metastases in breast cancer. Methods or Background: In this prospective study, twenty-eight patients wi th breast cancer (age: 53.4 \u00b1 9.0 performed dual-phase contrast enhanced CT on a spectral dual-layer detector during August 2019 to June 2020 before surgery. Spectral quantitative parameters including HU (in Hounsfield units per kiloelectron-volt), nIC (normalized iodine conc entration), and Zeff (Z- effective value) in both arterial and delay phase w ere compared between metastatic and non-metastatic SLNs using the McNemar test. The diagnostic performance of spectral parameters were analysed by receiver operating characteristic curves. Results or Findings: In total, 103 SLNs (23 metastatic, 80 nonmetastatic ) were matched in operation with preoperatively label ed SLNs on DLCT images. All spectral parameters ( Hu, nIC, and Zeff) during both arterial and delay phase were greater in metastatic than nonmetastatic SLNs (all P 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that Hu in delay phase was the best single parameter for the detection of metastatic SLNs on a per-lymph node basis, with AUC accuracy of 79.6% and specificity of 78.8% (63/80). Conclusion: The spectral quantitative parameters of DLCT, such as the Hu, demonstrated high diagnostic performances in the di fferentiation of metastatic and non-metastatic SLNs in breast cancer.

Methods or Background: We retrospectively screened from June 2017 to August 2021 women with histological diagnosis of br east cancer who underwent 14G CB of suspicious axillary LNs (n=152) ; we excluded 57 patients who underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. We compared histologic results of CB with the histology from axillary LN dissection, our gold standard, to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CB. Results or Findings: Out of 95 LN CB, 95.8% resulted positive for breast cancer infiltration while 4.2% negative. Sensitivit y of CB in our study was 95.79% (CI 89.57%-98.84%), PPV 100% and accuracy US diameter of true-positi ve (TP) LN was 16.1 mm (range 4-40 mm), while of false-negative (FN) LN was 6.5 5-8 mm). Conclusion: 14G CB of axillary LN showed a high accuracy in the diagnosis of breast cancer metastasis. FN results in our sample could be explained by sampling error due to small diameter of LN.

Methods or Background: This prospective, single-centre study was approved by the ethics committee and patients gave written i nformed consent. Patients with suspicious lesions on conventional imaging (mammography, tomosynthesis, ultrasound) and no contraindications to [18F]- fluoroethylcholine-PET-MRI were included. Histology was considered as reference standard for breast lesions and lymph-nod es. Breast FEC-PET-MRI was performed in a prone position with a dedicated coil. Data on staging with conventional imaging were collected. Two breast fel lows (R1, R2) evaluated the PET-MRI examinations. Lesion detection and diagnostic performance for lymph-node status were evaluated. Results or Findings: 79 patients (mean age 55 years, standard deviation 11.9) with 83 lesions were included (76 invasive carcinomas [IC]), seven ductal carcinomas in situ [DCIS]). Four patients had bilat eral tumours, two were not detected on conventional imaging (one monofocal, on e multifocal). Conventional imaging correctly with a lymph-node metastasis were 43% and 89% with conventional imaging. Sensitivity was 50% (R1) and 46% (R2) with MRI, 79% (R1) and 70% (R2) with FEC-PET. Specificity was and R2) with FEC-PET. Conclusion: [18F]-fluoroethylcholine PET-MRI improves local staging of breast cancer, in particular the detection of lymph -node metastasis.

Echavarri, R. Garcia de Eulate, orreta D\u00edaz de Cerio, M. dr\u00e9s; Purpose: To evaluate the precision of automated volumetry in brain MRI to differentiate Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) from Parkinson's disease (PD) in comparison with planimetric measurements. Methods or Background: A retrospective study analysed 141 patients with the clinical diagnosis of Parkinsonism paired by age and sex and with a healthy control group (HCF) (PSP n = 47, PE n = 68, HCG=26) who underwent brain MRI. Patients without T1 MPRAGE sequences (1 mm thi n slice) were excluded, leaving 83 patients (PSP n = 29, PE n = 54). The different subclinical types of PSP were PSP-RS (19), PSP-P (5), PSP-PGF ( 4), and PSP-F (1). Two independent radiologists blind to diagnosis per formed a planimetric assessment with measurement of the width of the midbrain and bridge in the sagittal plane, drawing perpendicular lines (method of Luke et al.), and calculated the midbrain-pons ratio (MP). The volumes of the midbrain and the pons were obtained in an automated and normalised w ay using SyngoviaBrainMorphometry software, Siemens. The int raclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess interobserver agreement and ROC curves to assess the diagnostic precision of the different biomarkers to differentiate PSP from PD. Results or Findings: The brainstem planimetric analysis that best- discriminated PSP from PD was the midbrain with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, followed by the MP ratio with an AUC of 0.96. The planimetric measurements presented very good reproducibility wi th an ICC of > 0.75. The automated midbrain volume presented an AUC of 0.86, while the volumetric MP ratio had an AUC of 0.66. Conclusion: The automated segmentation of the brainstem is a robust and fast-application technique, showing the midbrain volume a remarkable diagnostic performance in the differentiation of PS P from PD.

Donatelli*, I. Ricca, F. Bianchi, D. Frosini, V . Montano, E. Del Prete, A. Tessa, M. Mancuso, F. M. Santorelli; Pisa/IT Purpose: The differential diagnosis between Hereditary Spast ic Paraplegia (HSP), Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) and Amyotrop hic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) can be challenging, especially in the early s teps of assessment of adult patients with a lower limb onset upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome when family history and gene testing are mute. These dis eases share the UMN impairment, but the neuropathology showed different patterns of neuronal involvement: while HSP is primarily an axonopathy, in PLS and ALS the primary motor cortex is often involved. In ALS, mor eover, the UMN impairment is associated with increased iron-laden microglia i n the primary motor cortex (PMC); the abnormal iron deposition can be detected in vivo using T2*- weighted MR images and appears as an hypointense ri m. Here we employed 3T T2*-weighted images to investigate the radiologi cal appearance of the PMC in HSP patients and, for comparison, in PLS and ALS . Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 3T T2*-weighted MR scans of 23 HSP patients, 7 PLS patients with lower limb onset and 92 ALS patients, 8 of which had a lower limb onset UMN syndrome (UMN-ALS). The signal intensity of the PMC was visually rated as i sointense, mildly or marked reduced compared to the post-central cortex. Results or Findings: Most HSP patients had normal signal intensity (86%) ; on the contrary, all the PLS, most UMN-ALS patients (7 5%) and 42% of the remaining ALS patients had marked PMC hypointensity . Conclusion: Iron sensitive imaging of the PMC could provide useful information in the differential diagnosis of sporadic adult-onset UMN syndromes, as the hypointense rim often seen in PLS and UMN-ALS patients is apparently rare in HSP patients. Limitations: The small number of HSP, PLS and UMN-ALS patients. Ethics committee approval: The local ethics committee has been informed about this study.

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (MRPI) in differentiating PSP fr om PD. Methods or Background: A systematic literature search of PubMed- MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify origin al articles evaluating the diagnostic performance of the MRPI in different iating PSP from PD published up to 20 February 2021. The pooled sensit ivity and specificity were calculated using the bivariate random-effects model . The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using a hierarchical summary r eceiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model. Meta-regression was p erformed to explain the effects of heterogeneity. Results or Findings: A total of 14 original articles involving 484 PSP p atients and 1243 PD patients were included. T1-weighted images were used to calculate the MRPI in all studies. Among the 14 studies, 9 studies used 3D T1- weighted images. The pooled sensitivity and specifi city for the diagnostic performance of the MRPI in differentiating PSP from PD and CI, 91-100%), respectively. The area under HSROC curve was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00). Meta-regr ession showed the association of the magnet field strength with heter ogeneity. Conclusion: The MRPI could accurately differentiate PSP from PD and support the implementation of appropriate management strategies for patients with PSP. Limitations: There was heterogeneity among the selected studies. We performed meta-regression analysis and studies using 3.0 T MRI showed significantly higher sensitivity (100%) and specifi city (100%) than those of studies using 1.5 T MRI (sensitivity of 98% and spe cificity of 97%) (P < 0.01).

Author Disclosures: Seongken Kim: Author: First not macrostructural cortical de generation in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment: evidence from NODDI investigation *X. Bai*, T. Guo, X. Guan, M. Zhang; Hangzhou/CN (baixueqin1@126.com) This study aimed to investigate the cortical micros tructural and morphological degenerative patterns in patients wit h Parkinson's disease (PD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using Neurite O rientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and T1-weighted imaging. Methods or Background: A total of 108 subjects, including 38 patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), 38 PD-MCI, and 32 healthy controls (HC), were included. PD-MCI was diagnosed according to the MDS Task Force level II criteria. Cortical microstructural alterations were evaluated by using NODDI with gray matter-based spatial statistics (GBSS). C ortical thickness analyses were performed using the FreeSurfer software. Results or Findings: For cortical microstructural analyses, compared wit h HC, PD-NC showed lower orientation dispersion index (OD I) in bilateral cingulate, supplementary motor area, right paracentral lobule and precuneus; while PD- MCI showed widespread lower ODI throughout bilateral frontal, parietal, occipital and right temporal areas and regional low er neurite density index (NDI), predominantly in left frontal area and cingulate. However, for cortical thickness analyses, there were no group difference in any vertex in the between-group comparisons. Besides, the NDI values within the areas with lower NDI were associated with the Montreal Cogniti ve Assessment (MoCA) scores in the PD patients (r = 0.240, P = 0.041). Conclusion: Microstructural but not macrostructural cortical de generation in Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that cortical microstructural alterations may be much more sensit ive than morphological changes to cortical degeneration in PD-MCI. Limitations: Our study is a cross-sectional study with relativel y small sample size.

R. Tse*, L. Shen, L. Yoon, K. Bird, A. Kamay a; Stanford, CA/US Purpose: To determine the imaging outcomes of US-2 observati ons. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, we evaluated 175 adult patients (70 women, 105 men) with US-2 subthreshold observations on HCC surveillance ultrasound. Inclusion criteria was or orthotopic liver transplant (n=3). At ultrasound, the observation outcome was defined as resolved if it w as no longer present, stable if it was re-identified and remained subcent imeter, or progressed if it grew to 10 mm. At CT/MRI, the observation outcome was defin ed as resolved if it was not re-identified. Otherwise, the appropr iate CT/MRI LI-RADS category was assigned. Results or Findings: Of 175 patients, 173 (99%) had US-2 observations that were either stable (n=68), resolved (n=85), no corr elate at OLT (n=3), or as LR-1 or LR-2 CT/MRI (n=17). 2 (1%) observations were LR-3 at CT/MRI. No observations progressed on ultrasound follow-up or were classified as LR-4 or higher at CT/MRI. 8 patients developed HCC after a median of 2.0 years that were metachronous to the U S-2 observation; all HCCs were unequivocally in a separate location and were preceded by a surveillance ultrasound that showed resolution of t he US-2 observation. Conclusion: US-2 subthreshold observations are unlikely to progress or become HCC. Approximately half of them resolve at f ollow-up imaging. Limitations: This was a singlecentre retrospective study with relatively small sample size. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Methods or Background: Between June 2012 and December 2019, 290 patients (mean age, 67.9 years \u00b1 9.74; 223 men) wit h 383 HCCs (mean size, 15.9 mm\u00b15.49) undergoing RFA were included in this retrospective study. Among patients, 158 patients had history of previous treatment (mean number, 1.3\u00b11.8) with 109 viable HCCs. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative seeding metastasis after RFA. Independent factors affecting seeding metastasis were investigated by using multi variable Cox proportional hazard regression. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 314 Results or Findings: Incidence of seeding metastasis per 3.1% (9/290) and per tumour was 4.4% (17/383). The mean time interval after recent RFA until first detection of seeding metastasis was 807.2 Subcapsular HCC, and viable HCC from previous locoregional treatment are potential risk factors for seeding me tastasis. Limitations: The limitations of this study were as follows. Firs t, this was retrospective study conducted at a single instituti on where RFA was performed by one experienced radiologist, thus the results may not be generalisable. Second some potential risk factors were not analysed such as tumour differentiation. Finally relative small number of p atients with seeding metastasis were included.

Li*; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To role incoherent motion (I VIM) to preoperatively assess liver regeneration. Methods or Background: 54 HCC patients had semiautomatic CT volumetric analysis software drew the outline of the total functional liver, preoperative future liver remnant volume, and postoperative liver remnant volume. And the regeneration index (RI) and parenchymal hepatic resection rate were th en manually calculated. The relation between diffusion parameters and fibrosis stage was assessed using Spearman correlation analysis. Logistic regressions analysis were used for exploring factors associated with higher RI. RO C analyses were performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of IVIM. Results or Findings: Significant negative relations showed between D val ue and fibrosis stage (r =-0.361, p=0.007), between fibrosis stage (r =-0.457, p=0.001). At multivariate analysis, only higher D value (OR, 8.131; 95% CI, 1.094-60.424; p=0.041) was associated with higher RI. D value and D* value for the diagnosis of higher RI showed good di fferentiation power with AUC of 0.599-0.880). D value and D* value worked as reliable preoperativ e predictors for evaluating the capacity of liver regeneration f or HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy. Limitations: First, the retrospective design may cause selection bias and limit its feasibility. Second, due to the retrospective n ature, the interval between postoperative CT image and surgery is not uniformed, ranging from 35-300 days.

This study aimed to develop a radiomics pr ediction model based on multisequence MRI to predict in HBP hypointense nodules without Methods pathologic confirmed HBP hypointense nodules without APHE (less than 3 cm) in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis screened between January 2008 and June 2016. Radiomics features were separat ely extracted from the T2-weighted images (T2WIs), T1-weighted images (T1W Is), HBPs, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. A suppor t vector machine (SVM) model with 8-fold cross validation was built by usi ng multisequence radiomic features. Results or Findings: A total of 278 patients with 291 lesions (199 HCCs and 92 nonmalignant cirrhosis-associated nodules) in ei ght institutions were used. 420 radiomics features are extracted in four MRI sequences. 54, 10, 21 and 33 significant radiomics features were selected in T2W I, T1WI, ADC map and HBP, respectively. Using SVM with c value of 0.0007 , mean area under the curve (AUC) to was 0.797 (range, 0.740- 0.890). Conclusion: A radiomics model based on multisequence MRI serves as an effective quantitative approach to predict HCC in H BP hypointense nodules without APHE.

Methods or Background: A total of 122 lesions (73 AP shunts and 49 HCCs) detected on quadriphasic CT in 101 patients with chronic liver disease were analysed. All lesions showed arterial enhancement a nd isodensity on delayed phase (DP) with exclusion of typical features of AP shunts. Lesion morphologic features on biphasic values and analyses of lesion attenuation on quadriphasic CT were performed. Diagnostic performances for prediction of AP shunts over HCC were compared among the biphasic Results or Findings: In multivariate analysis, the presence of concomitant HCC, visual hypodensity on PP and visual hyperdensi ty on PVP were independent predictors for HCCs rather than AP shun ts. Additional review of PP and PVP revealed significantly improved diagnost ic performance yielding the highest diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Hypodensity on PP and hyperdensity on PVP are predictive features in differentiating atypical small hypervascular HCC from AP shunts in patients with high-risk of HCC. Careful e valuation of the PP and PVP may reduce underdiagnosis and lead to earlier diagn osis of atypical small HCCs. Limitations: First, our study was retrospective and has small ca se number. Second, pathological proofs weren't available for m ost of the lesions. Third, the fixed time delay after intravenous contrast injecti on without customisation. Fourth, the visual assessment of the lesion's attenuation is subjective.

Shen, T. Tiyarattanachai, K. Bird, T. Liang, L. S. Yoon, A. Kamaya; Stanford, CA/US Purpose: To determine how the presence of cirrhosis and modality (CT versus MRI) for diagnostic characterisation affect positiv e predictive values (PPV) of US-3 observations. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 225 adult patients (10 0 women, 125 men) high-risk for hepatocellular carcin oma (HCC) from 2017- 2021 had an observations incl uded focal observations 10 mm in 216 patients and venous thrombi in 9 patie nts. PPV were calculated using diagnostic characterisation as the reference standard. Results or Findings: Of 225 patients, 116 (52%) had cirrhosis and 109 (4 8%) did not. Most non-cirrhotic patients had hepatitis B virus (n=100). Overall PPV was 33% (27-39%) for at least intermediate probabil ity of cancer and 15% (10- 20%) for at least probable cancer. Cirrhosis signif icantly affected the PPV of cancer. For at least intermediate probability of ca ncer, PPV increased from Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 315 (8-21%) in non-cirrhotic patients to 51% (42-60%) in cirrhotic patients (p<0.001). For at least 4% (0-7%) to 26% (18-34%; p<0.001). a correlate (p=0.470). At multivariable analysis, cirrhosis was the most important predictor of at least probable cancer (p<0.001; odds ratio OR 20.4), followed observation size (p<0.001; OR 2.65) and age (p=0.004; OR 1.05). Alpha-fetoprotein, visualisation score, and modality (CT vs MRI) were not significant predictors. Conclusion: PPV for at least probable cancer in US-3 observatio ns decreases from about 1 in 4 among cirrhotic patients to 1 in 25 among non-cirrhotic patients. Modality did not affect PPV. Limitations: This was a single-institution, retrospective study that evaluated positive predictive value only. Ethics committee approval: This study is IRB approved.

Bott performance of a comprehensive CT brain (CTB) deep-learning model that has been trained on data f rom multiple sites across Australia. Methods or Background: Whilst numerous deep-learning models for CT brain are available for use, they have been limited to detection of only a single or a small number of findings (<15). This is the first s tudy of a comprehensive learning model for CT brain capable of assessing up to 212 findings. A total of 2,848 CTB cases from adults ( 18 years) who had at least one thin-slice (1.5mm thick) non-contrast CTB were included in the test dataset. This was ground-truthed by 5 radiologists and adjudicated by a neuroradiologist. 32 radiologists read each case to assess baseline radi ologist performance. The difference in AUC was calculated for each of the fi ndings. Results or Findings: When adjusted for multiple hypotheses (across 212 C TB findings), the performance of the deep-learning mod el was superior to the average radiologist performance in 65% of CTB findi ngs. The radiologist was superior in 3% of findings, and 22% were inconclusi ve. Statistical measurements showed radiologist performance had a m acroaveraged AUC of 0\u00b7680 across all the clinical findings, compared wi th the deep-learning model's standalone performance AUC of 0\u00b7896. Conclusion: The comprehensive deep-learning model performed bet ter than the radiologist in a majority of findings on a large set of non-contrast CTB studies. Limitations: This study was a comparison of radiologist performance to model performance based on AUCs. To determine its usefuln ess and its utility in improving the performance of radiologists in report ing findings on CT brain studies will need to be tested.

Rubini\u00b9, B. metrics used to rank neuroimaging solutions for lesion segmentation and their applicability in clinical practice. Methods or Background: The metrics used to rank neuroimaging solutions are often centred around classical scores such as D ice and sensitivity, whereas when assessing neurological illnesses like multiple sclerosis, the detection of lesions is of greater clinical importance than their delineation. Also, an algorithm could present great sensitivity in general, but systematically miss lesions in one of the McDonald regions. We trained a 3D CNN model with two different MR scans datasets. The first one contained 15289 lesions and the second one 18700 lesions from which 634 and 840 wer e present in the infratentorial region, respectively. We evaluated t he performance of both models on a curated dataset of 29 FLAIR scans from open source databases (ISBI and MSSEG challenges). The images were annotated by expert neuroanatomists. Results or Findings: The Dice score of both models was very similar (0.6 76 and 0.662). The overall lesion sensitivity increased by 18% (0.60 for the first model and 0.71 for the second one) but, more striki ngly, the lesion sensitivity proper to the infratentorial region improved by 82. 35% for the second model. Conclusion: When evaluating the performance of lesion detection algorithms in multiple sclerosis it is important to evaluate d etection over delineation performance and measure separately by McDonald's re gion. Limitations: Both models are still deficient in the infratentori al region and more data is needed for efficient detection. Infratentor ial lesions are the least abundant type of lesions from the McDonald regions; this poses an issue of class-imbalance that should be addressed during mod el-training. Ethics committee approval: The open source data was used in conformity with their respective user agreements.

Methods or Background: Patients with acoustic neuroma treated with radiosurgery from 2004 to 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Inclusion criteria were having contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images available before and at 24 and 36 months after treatment. Cli nical, audiometric and treatment data were collected at the same time points. Lesions were classified as stable, reduced or increased according to the volume variation assessed on the pre- and post-radiosurgery MRI. Tumours were semi-automatically segmented on the pre-treatment MRI using 3DSlicer. pre-processed in three uniformity correction; deskulling; Z-score transformation. For each patient, 851 features were extracted using PyRadiomics. We trained ML methods to predict the l esion increase at the two time points, using a nested cross-validation (CV) s cheme. On the training set of each outer loop, feature selection was performed using LASSO and the Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 316 selected features were used as input to build four ML classification methods: SVM, RF, NNet and XGBoost. To overcome class imbalance during training SMOTE was used. Finally, trained models were tested on the corresponding held-out patients in each outer loop to evaluate balanced accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Results or Findings: We included 95 patients treated with Cyberknife\u00ae. T he NNet was the best algorithm for predicting the response at 24 months (accuracy 71%, sensitivity 60%, specificity 82%) and 36 months (accuracy 66%, sensitivity 50%, specificity 83%). Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that the proposed methods have great potential in distinguishing, before radiosurg ery, patients with tumour volume increase from patients with stable or reduced lesions. Limitations: Subsequent studies are ongoing to assess the robust ness and reproducibility of these results Ethics committee approval: Ethical committee approval was obtained in 2019.

Dalbis, J. Grilo, S. Hitziger, W. X. Ling, J. R. Opalka, *A. Lemke*; Berlin/DE Purpose: The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) requires t he assessment of lesion load from brain MRIs. Traditionally, MS lesi ons are manually annotated by radiologists, a process that is inefficient and error prone. The AI-software mdbrain leverages deep learning to automatically se gment MS lesions. Here, we assess the accuracy of the lesion-segmentation algorithm of mdbrain version 4.5 compared to SPM-SLS and to the inter-rater performance of 4 experts. Methods or Background: mdbrain uses a deep neural network to segment lesions from a FLAIR scan. The network was trained using 280 annotated FLAIRs. Performances were tested on a separate data set of 30 FLAIRs annotated by 4 experts. To assess segmentation accuracy, we computed the lesion-wise F1 score between each algorithm (mdbrai n and SPM-SLS) and rater, averaged across raters. The inter-rater F1 w as computed by comparing the annotation of each rater against the remaining 3. F1 scores were also computed for different lesion classes separately. Results or Findings: mdbrain achieved an F1 score of 0.72, which was lar ger than SPM-SLS (F1=0.55) but slightly smaller than th e inter-rater (F1=0.75). F1 scores of mdbrain were F1=0.76). An average time of 2 minutes was required by mdbrain to process a single scan (GPU-equipped machine). Conclusion: The AI-software mdbrain 4.5 achieved a lesion-segmentation accuracy comparable to a pool of human experts and considerably higher than SPM-SLS. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: With IRB approval and patient consent, 50 consecutive patients underwent standard-of-care (SO C) and accelerated (FAST) spine MRI exams acquired from a GE 3T Archit ect scanner. DL processing of the FAST scan data set (FAST-DL) was performed using an FDA-cleared CNN-based DL image-enhancement product: Recon tool offers powerful denoising, s harpness enhancement and elimination of some artifacts, such as truncati on ringing. Two neuroradiologists were presented with the different image series as paired, side-by-side datasets. Datasets were blinded and ra ndomized in sequence and left-right display order. Image features were preference rated on a 5-point Likert scale for: (1) overall IQ, (2) anatomy conspicuity, (3) cord/CSF/lesion contrast, (4) sharpness, (5) apparent SNR, (6) artefacts and (7) aberrations. Results or Findings: FAST-DL was qualitatively better than SOC and FAST across all 6 categories, ( 2 (4, n = 52), p = < .01). Very high inter-rater agreement was observed, with mean score difference = -0.26, 95% CI = -1.26, 0.74. Conclusion: DL enables 50% spine MRI scan time reduction as wel l as what radiologists perceive as enhanced image quality wit h benefits in SNR, image sharpness and artifact reduction over SOC and FAST images without DL processing, providing gains in efficiency and portending practice utility for routine use.

Author Disclosures: Marc Lebel: Employee: GE Healthcare Mary Neil Subtle Medical Speaker: Healthcare Maggie Fung: RPS vs. FreeSurfer & SPM: repeatability and per compare the repeatability and diagnosti c accuracy of different academic and commercial brain volumetry s olutions with different methodologies with and without Deep Learning (DL). Methods or Background: Brain volumetry measurements were carried out with the open-source software packages FreeSurfer ( v6.0.0) and SPM (v12) and were compared against a commercially available software solution, mdbrain (v4.4), based on DeepLearning technology. T he MIRIAD cohort included 45 patients with confirmed Alzheimer's dis ease, and 23 age-matched healthy controls served as a data set. Furthermore, back-to-back scans (n=178) carried out on the same day were included. Images were acquired on a 1.5T MR-scanner using standard 3D-T1w images. Brain volumetry was performed for several regions, including the whole brain, grey and white matter, all lobes, the hippocampus and all ventricl es. All systems were compared in terms of repeatability and performance. The performance was quantified using ROC analysis by calculating the corresponding AUCs. Results or Findings: For the repeatability tests, the DL-based mdbrain showed a significantly better stability as compared to FreeSurfer and SPM for all analyzed regions (e.g. mean deviations to refer ence for whole brain 0.06+/- 0.09% vs. 0.43+/-0.87% vs. 0.12+-0.06%, mean +/-SD) . Performance also yielded higher AUC values for mdbrain and SPM (mean value whole brain 0.96 & 0.95) Conclusion: mdbrain showed s igns of better repeatability for all of the evaluated regions. This is reflected in improved mean values and a lower overall error. Taking into account the shorter evaluation time of <5min for the DL-based approach vs. ~10h for FreeSurfer and ~30min for SPM, mdbrain appears to be a valuabl e tool to enable the routine application of brain volumetry in clinical practice.

The aim of this study is to compare the success rate of FNAC done by a head and neck sonographer who was trained by in-house head and neck radiologists, compared to the success rates of FNAC performed by consultants and trainees. The standard range of non-diagnostic yiel d (in percentage) from several studies has been quoted as between 10-30%. Our aim is to train sonographers in doing ultrasound and FNAC to help w ith the acute and outpatient workload. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of FNAC outcomes done by a sonographer over a 13-month period were included. Results or Findings: 182 FNAC were done by a sonographer from 1 January 2021 to 1 February 2022. This involved sampling of pathological cervical lymph nodes, thyroid, and salivary gland lesions. Out of 182 studies, 70.8% showed conclusive results and 29.2% were inconclusive. The results were then compared with a standard cytology assessment set by RCR. As per RCR Audit Live, FNAC of thyroid nodules should have a 70% diagnostic yield. A comparison was made with the previous FNAC audit done by consultants and trainees within the department which showed non-diagnostic sample yield 27.2% of 1222 FNA done over a 4-year period. Conclusion: The diagnostic yield of FNAC done by a sonographer is the same as the FNAC outcomes done by consultants and traine es in the first audit cycle and meets the standard set by RCR Audit Live and several other published studies.

We a im to identify this agreement with pathology. Methods or Background: All nodules were examined using high-resolution ultrasound, and then FNA was done. In ultrasound, all descriptors for determining TIRADS and ATA scores were evaluated. N odules with non- diagnostic cytology in FNA were excluded, while sus picious/malignant cytology was confirmed by excisional biopsy and pathology. B enign lesions were confirmed by follow-up imaging within one year. The agreement of TIRADS and ATA and their relationship with pathology were determined. Results or Findings: 200 patients (52.5% male) with a mean age of 53\u00b19.2 years (36-68) were enrolled. Twenty-seven (13.5%) greement between ATA was 0.96 (P<0.001). 5 cases showed non- concordance(2.5%): 4 nodules with high ATA and TIRA DS of 4 (2 benign and 2 PTC), and one FTC nodule with low ATA and TIRADS of 4. Considering pathology, 106 benign nodules showed ATA of low or very low and TIRADS of 2 or 3; 10 PTC nodules showed high ATA and TIRADS of 5; 2 MTC nodules showed high ATA and TIRADS of 5; 45 benign nodules showed high ATA and TIRADS of 5; 20 benign nodules showed intermediate ATA and TIRADS of 4; 10 FTC nodules showed intermediate ATA and TIRADS of 4; and 2 PTC nodules showed intermediate ATA and TIRADS of 4. Conclusion: TIRADS and ATA can be used interchangeably due to high agreement. Limitations: Unsatisfactory sample and pathology results.

Jiang*; Guilin/CN (jzw18377330355@163.com) Purpose: To explore the value of 18F-FDG PET / CT parameters in predicting BRAFV600E mutation in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Methods or Background: The clinical data of 141 patients with DTC confirmed by surgery were analysed retrospectively. All patients underwent 18F-FDG PET / CT and BRAFV600E mutation detection. The differences of clinical characteristics (age, gender, pathological type, tumour diameter, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, clinical stage, Ki-67) and PET/CT parameters (maximum standardised uptake value (SUV max) and metabolic tumour volume MTV) between patients of BRAFV600E mutation and BRAFV600E wild type were analysed using an independ ent-sample t test, a 2 test and a Fisher exact test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to obtain the best boundary point for MTV to predict BRAFV600E mutation. A logistic regression model was utilised to analyse the variables predicting the mutation status of BRAFV600E. Results or Findings: There were 74 (52.5%) patients with BRAFV600E mutation and 67 (47.5%) patients with wild type. Th ere were significant differences between the two groups in gender, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, pathological type, clinical stage and MTV (all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the best cut-off values for MTV prediction of BRAFV600E mutation were 12.0cm3 and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.64. Logistic multivariate analysis showed tha t extrathyroid extension, lymph node metastasis and MTV were independent fact ors predicting BRAFV600E mutation (P < 0.05). Conclusion: MTV has a certain reference value in predicting BRA FV600E mutation in patients with DTC. Limitations: This study did not analyse other types of gene mutations, such as the TERT gene, which need to be discussed in future research.

(CT) images and clinical data can contribute in optimizing patient management for head and neck cancer. We present the outcomes after the first two editions (2020/2021) of the HECKTOR-MICCAI challenge and discuss the future goals. Methods or Background: We collected FDG-PET/CT images with clinical data from 5/6 centers in 2020/2021, totaling 254/325 cases. Primary tumors were delineated by experts according to established guidelines. The HECKTOR challenge was organized at the MICCAI 2020 and 2021 conferences to evaluate algorithms on tumor segmentation and prediction of Progression-Free Survival (PFS). Results or Findings: Simple, well-designed ensembles of 3D U-Nets obtained the best segmentation results (Dice coefficient of 0.76/0.78). PET images contained the most predictive information with the tumor metabolic uptake acting as tumor detection. In association with CT providing additional tissue characteristics, multi-modal models provided the best results. Some nodal metastases were hard to differentiate from primary tumors. A high inter- algorithm agreement was obtained, with some cases incorrectly segmented by all algorithms. For the PFS prediction, approaches relying on deep learning and/or standard radiomics were proposed. Best performance (C-index of 0.72) was achieved without using the expert contours. Conclusion: The growing interest in the challenge is matched by the growth of the consortium and dataset. We conducted various post-challenge analyses, leading the path for new challenge designs and tasks. The challenge will be organized in 2022 with more than 1000 cases. Limitations: The gold-standard segmentation used in this study was expert manual annotation on the PET/CT fusion image without contrast. This can lead to errors and could explain the saturation in segmentation results. Ethics committee approval: Obtained for all collected data.

Caltabiano, Purpose: The prognosis of uveal melanomas (UMs) is related to several factors, among which are histopathologic features. Histologically, UM can be classified as spindle cell, mixed cell and epithelioid cell type, the latter being related to a more severe prognosis. The diagnosis of UM is almost exclusively clinical, whereas tumour-sampling procedures are not routinely performed due to their invasiveness and related complications. The aim of our study was to retrospectively assess the correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and the histologic type of uveal melanomas, in order to verify the clinical value of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) as non- invasive prognostic marker. Methods or Background: 16 uveal melanomas that had undergone MR examination (with conventional and DWI sequences) and subsequent primary enucleation without any previous radiotherapy treatment were retrospectively selected. The ADC value of the tumor was compared with histologic type. For the final analysis, histologic type was dichotomised as epithelioid versus non- epithelioid cell type (including spindle cell and mixed cell type). The data were compared by using the independent t test. Results or Findings: Histologic type was as follows: epithelioid cell type (n = 3), non-epithelioid cell type (n = 13; spindle cell n = 7, mixed cell type n = 6). The overall ADC value of UMs was 1.06 \u00b1 0.22 \u00d7 10-3mm2/s. The mean ADC value of UMs was 1.17 \u00b1 0.12 \u00d7 10-3mm2/s in the epithelioid cell type group and 1.03 \u00b1 0.23 \u00d7 10-3mm2/s in the non-epithelioid cell type group. No significant difference between the two groups was found (t = 0.4, p = 0.34). Conclusion: Quantitative measurement of DWI-ADC of UMs is not accurate enough to non-invasively select patients with epithelioid cell type. Limitations: Retrospective.

Retrospective analysis of 18 consecutive patients (88.9% male, mean age 72\u00b19 years) treated at two centres in Germany, which were candidates for elective endovascular thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and non-calcified iliac access vessels to enable a parallel wire approach to the aneurysm lumen using large transfemoral access sheaths were included. The aneurysm sacs Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 319 were implanted with shape memory polymer devices immediately following aortic endograft placement. Results or Findings: Technical success was achieved in all patients. Mean baseline aortic aneurysm sac volume was 195\u00b1117 mL, and the perfused aneurysm volume was 97\u00b160 mL. Patients were implanted with a mean of 24\u00b112 shape memory polymer devices (range, 5-45, corresponding to 6.25- 56.25 mL expanded embolic material volume per patient). At 11\u00b17 months (range, 3-24 months) follow-up, mean change in aneurysm sac volume of 16 patients was 30 \u00b1 21 mL (p = .0006); two patients have not yet reached 3- month follow-up. Sac regression was even observed in the presence of type II endoleaks in 6 patients and 2 small type IA endoleaks, without necessity for further intervention to date. No morbidity or mortality related to sac treatment with shape memory polymer devices occurred. Conclusion: Usage of shape memory polymer devices for active aortic aneurysm sac management appears to be safe and feasible in this initial small case series. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate effectiveness. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

G\u00f3g*, M. Gy\u00e1n\u00f3, Z. Mih\u00e1ly, P. Legeza, J. P. B. Nemes, P. S\u00f3tonyi; Variance Angiography (DVA) provided higher contrast-to-noise ratio and better image quality than Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic performance of DVA in reduced radiation lower limb examinations. Methods or Background: We enrolled 30 patients undergoing diagnostic lower limb x-ray angiography. In three anatomical regions duplicated series were made by normal and reduced dose x-ray protocol (N: normal 1,2 microGy/frame, R: reduced 0,36 microGy/frame). The diagnostic value of DSA and DVA images was evaluated in a task-based survey. Six readers were asked to identify the arteries and evaluate the degree of stenosis. The endpoints were the number of recognised arteries, and the sensitivity and specificity of DVA-R images compared to DSA-N. Results or Findings: There was no significant difference in the overall number of recognised arteries (DSA-N: 5.56\u00b10.01, DVA-R: 5.46\u00b10.01) and in the proportion arteries for diagnosis (DSA-N: 92.3\u00b10.1 %, DVA-R: 93.5\u00b10.1 %). DVA-R reproduced the DSA-N diagnostic categories with 0.84 sensitivity and 0.80 specificity. When the discordant decisions were supervised and the valid diagnostic category was determined by an expert, the accuracy of DSA-N and DVA-R was identical in the abdominal and femoral regions, but DVA-R had significantly higher accuracy in the crural region (91% vs 80%). Conclusion: DVA allows a very substantial (70%) reduction of DSA-related radiation exposure in lower limb angiographiy without compromising the diagnostic value of images, therefore this technology might increase the safety of these endovascular procedures. Limitations: Single-centre study in dedicated anatomical regions. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the Hungarian National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition. Funding for this study: Funding was received from the European Union's Horizon 2020 EIC Accelerator program and the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary. Author Disclosures: Janos Pal Unreported venous on routine CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis and the possibility of earlier diagnosis and intervention *N. A. O'Halloran*, C. Lehane, E. O'Malley, G. J. Purpose: The true prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is underestimated because many cases are not apparent clinically. About half of VTEs in cancer patients are incidentally detected without clinical suspicion of VTE. Incidental VTEs are mostly diagnosed by multidetector CT (MDCT) scans requested for oncologic staging. However, VTE on routine imaging may be overlooked by non-vascular specialist radiologists. The aim of this study was to evaluate if VTE may be detected earlier in asymptomatic patients on routine abdominal CT imaging. Methods or Background: All patients who underwent intervention for lower limb and pelvic VTE between 2008 and 2021 and who had a CT abdomen/pelvis one month prior to intervention were identified. These studies were reviewed by a vascular interventional radiologist to assess for unreported deep venous disease. Results or Findings: We identified 514 patients who underwent venous intervention for inferior vena cava or iliofemoral venous disease who had previous CT investigation. The mean interval time from first CT to radiological intervention was 2.2 years (range 1 month-10 years). Patients underwent a mean of 4.3 studies prior to intervention. 65% of retrospectively reviewed CTs demonstrated IVC or ileofemoral venous disease. The presence of venous pathology was described in 14% of reports provided by non-vascular specialist consultant radiologists. Conclusion: Deep venous pathology is often under-reported on CT abdomen/pelvis. The high rate of venous intervention demonstrated in this study in this patient cohort highlights the importance of including abdominal and pelvic veins as a review area when reporting all CTs to allow for earlier and therefore more effective intervention and reducing patient morbidity. Limitations: Single centre study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Methods or Background: Thromboembolic disease, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a frequent pathology associated with high morbidity and mortality rate. The initial treatment is anticoagulation, but is associated with an increased bleeding risk. In those patients in whom anticoagulation is not recommended, placement of temporary IVCF would be indicated. IVCF are not free of complications, so they should be removed as soon as the indication that led to their placement ceases. Results or Findings: Single-centre, observational, retrospective study of patients undergoing inferior vena cava (IVC) filters removal between May 2015 and May 2021. The primary endpoint was D-RIVCF, defined as a procedure requiring more than five minutes of fluoroscopy. Demographic variables and comorbidities were collected. The type of filter, time from placement (<45 days vs >45 days) and the angiographic variables angulation with respect to IVC (>15\u00ba), hook against wall and embeded legs(>3mm) were analysed. A total of 109 patients (mean age 65 years old, 64.2% males) met the criteria for analysis. Mean fluoroscopy time for removal was 12.2 minutes (0.3-132.9 minutes), in 49.5% (n54) of cases >5mins of fluoroscopy were necessary. Univariate analysis showed significant differences between the two groups in the variables hook against IVC wall (D-RIVCF 44.4% vs 23.6%; p (D-RIVCF20.4% p 0.008) and placement (D-RIVCF 51.9% vs 5.5%; p = 0.006). Conclusion: This retrospective study shows a significant association between D-IVCFR in patients with embedded legs, hook against IVC wall and time from placement. Understanding and identifying the variables that hinder removal helps better planning of the procedure. Limitations: The limitations were the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of long-term follow-up.

Methods or Background: The study prospectively investigated 20 consecutive patients (23 lesions; 16 men; mean age 67\u00b116 years) with dysfunctional AVF undergoing fluoroscopically-guided, balloon angioplasty between June 2019-May 2020. Primary endpoints were outcome quantification using sequential DUS VF analysis following each dilation, 6-months target lesion re-intervention (TLR)-free rate, procedural success (postprocedural VF value to the baseline steady-state access) and correlation between procedural success and TLR-free rate. Secondary endpoints included 6-months lesion late lumen loss (LLL), correlation between balloon diameter and intraprocedural VF values, and correlation between VF and LLL at 6 months. Results or Findings: Mean VF increase was 168.5%\u00b1102.5% (range: 24.24%-493.33%). Procedural success was 80%a (16/20 cases). VFA improved procedural success by 20% (4/20 cases) compared to standard assessment (<30% residual stenosis and palpable thrill). TLR-free rate was 78.3%, 67.3% at 6 and 12 months. Significantly less TLR was noted in cases of procedural success (82.4% vs 66.7% 6-months; p=0.041). Unweighted linear regression showed significant correlation between diameter of balloon and VF (146.9\u00b142.3ml/min VF gain per mm of balloon diameter; p=0.001, R2=0.23) and a significant correlation between LLL and VF decline at follow-up (102.0\u00b134.6ml/min loss per mm of LLL; p=0.01, R2=0.35). Optimal VF cut off value and percentile increase to predict access failure were 720 ml/min (sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 71.4%) study; small sample size.

Methods or Background: From February 2018 to June 2020, 30 pAVF were created in 30 consecutive patients (30/30 male, age: 55.3\u00b113.6years). 21/30 patients (70%) were already on hemodialysis using a central venous catheter. Outcome evaluations were technical success, complications, and cannulation rate. Secondary outcome evaluations included the number of secondary procedures needed for cannulation, maintenance time to cannulation and pAVF survival. Results or Findings: Technical success was 100%. Complication rate was 6.7% (2/30) including a pseudoaneurysm of the brachial artery that occured immediately after sheath removal and an aneurysm of the anastomosis 17 days post-procedure, which was isolated with a covered stent placed in the arterial side. Mean follow-up (range: Four pAVFs were thrombosed after cannulation with two of them successfully declotted. Sixteen interventions were needed to achieve cannulation after the index procedure in 15 patients (overall 0.53 procedures/patient). Seven conservative endovascular interventions (following cannulation) were performed during the follow-up period in 6 patients (overall 0.27 procedures/patient, 0.17 procedures/patient-years). For the pAVF that were cannulated, survival was 96.1% at one year, and 82% at two and three years according to Kaplan Meier survival analysis. Conclusion: This primary experience suggests that pAVF creation is secure, successfully performed with high maturation and long-term patency rates. Large-scale prospective studies are needed to affirm the results. Limitations: Retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: Ethics commitee approval was not needed.

Buso Gil, L. Ferrer Puchol, E. Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez; Alzira/ES Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of catheter-guided local fibrinolysis in acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APT) with hemodynamic stability and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). Methods or Background: Retrospective descriptive study in adult intensive care unit (ICU). Catheter-guided local fibrinolysis (pigtail 5F catheter) was performed with a bolus of 250,000 IU urokinase followed by continuous infusion of 100,000 IU/hour until arteriographic control at 24 and/or 48h. After treatment, and before hospital discharge, a follow-up echocardiography was performed. Clinical success was defined by no progression to shock, decreased thrombotic load and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPs), improvement in RVD, and survival to ICU discharge. Safety variables were major bleeding events and procedure-related complications. Results or Findings: 23 patients were included (mean age 64 \u00b1 14 years). Clinical success was obtained in 91.3% of the patients. Angiographic control revealed a reduction in thrombotic load in 91.3% of cases. The mean PAPs (mmHg) decreased from 54 to 34 (P-value = 3.616e-07). In the ultrasound control, an improvement in DVD was observed in all cases with an increase in the mean TAPSE (mm) from 13.8 to 19.6 mm (p-value = 0.002293) and an increase in mean St from 7.9 to 12. 5 cm/s (p-value = 0.01881), 95% CI. Survival to hospital discharge was 95.7%. One patient progressed to shock. There were two minor bleeding complications. Conclusion: Catheter-guided local fibrinolysis is effective for the treatment of PE in our case series by significantly reducing thrombotic load, PAPs, and RVD, thus avoiding progression to hemodynamic instability, and without associating life-threatening complications or mortality related to the procedure. Limitations: Retrospective study with limited sample. Diagnostic techniques limitations. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the ethics committe Hospital de la Ribera.

Biesmann, T. Penzkofer ; Purpose: and test a convolutional neural network that recognises the type and anatomical orientation of MRI volumes solely from imaging without relying on DICOM metadata. Automatic sequence detection would have a wide variety of applications in AI, conventi onal reporting or quality assurance. Methods or Background: The underlying dataset included 31,602 prostate MRI volumes of 10 different sequence types (localis The images were rescaled to a common size of 64 x 64 x 64 voxels. A 3D ResNet18 was trained to differentiate the sequence classes using a standard training/validation/hold-out test set st rategy. Results or Findings: The ResNet18 model was able to consistently classif y the MRI sequences of the hold-out test set with an accuracy of 99.7% (i.e. less than 1 in 340 volumes is misclassified). The sensit ivities of the individual sequences were between 97.4% The developed ResNet successfully distinguishes dif ferent sequences with very high precision. The trained model can quickly assign sequences to large data sets with unknown naming and/or metadata standards. In the context of automatic sequence identification, the trained model shows a number of potential clinical and scie ntific applications, such as managing data from multiple sources with inconsiste nt naming standards, quality assurance of imaging protocols, and identif ication of appropriate imaging studies for study cohorts. Limitations: Considering that this study is limited to a prostat e MRI dataset (which itself is a benefit), nevertheless further s tudies should investigate the applicability to more heterogeneous data sets, incl uding imaging volumes from different modalities such as CT.

Methods or Background: Multiparametric MR imaging is recommended prior to prostate biopsies but lacks specificity. A CAD s ystem based on quantitative imaging could help radiologists. The CAD extracted quantitative features from regions-of-interest (ROIs) of the peripheral and the transition zone of the prostate. Normalisation methods were investigated t o handle vendor- dependent features such as T2-weighted signal and apparent diffusion coefficient. Logistic regression models combined the most efficient features to characterise International Society of Urological Pa thology (ISUP) grade 2 cancers in these regions. Models were developed and selected in a prospectively-maintained training data set of 290 patients imaged on four MR scanners and treated by prostatectomy at our instit ution, and then in a refinement data set of 114 consecutive patients ref erred for prostate biopsy and imaged on two of the previous scanners. Finally , models combined in the CAD were compared to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) in an external test data set in which a radiologist delineated lesions targeted at biopsy for 119 random patients referred for prostate biopsy. Results or Findings: In the test data set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for characteri zing ISUP CAD provided similar to those of a specialised uro-radiologist.

Author Disclosures: three-dim ensional lesion single point seeds in prostate MR I *A. Schrader*, N. B. Netzer, V. biopsy has become the standar d for prostate cancer diagnosis and relies on lesion segmentations . Manual segmentation is time-consuming and suffers from limited inter-reader reliability. We propose a real-time deep learning (DL) inference model for interactive lesion segmentation from placement of small lesion seed points and allowing for lesion volume adjustments. Methods or Background: 1848 manually segmented lesions from 914 patients were used for CNN training in 5-fold cross -validation. Testing was performed on a subsequent test set containing 427 l esions from 236 patients. Lesion positions were indicated by small oblate sph eres placed randomly inside training segmentations. 3D-UNet ensemble was trained with T2w images and lesion seeds as input, predicting full s egmentations by minimising boundary CE and dice loss. For testing, seeds were placed at the center-of- mass of ground truth ROIs, then probability map thr esholds were set to A) a fixed value of 0.5, corresponding to default lesion proposals; B) custom thresholds, matching lesion volume to ground truth volume, comparable to interactive fine-tuning of thresholds by users. Overlap between CNN and manual segmentations was quantified with Dice coeff icients. Results or Findings: Median Dice coefficient was A) 0.63 (0.51-0.72) for fixed thresholds and B) 0.70 (0.60-0.78) for volume-match ed thresholds. For PROSTATEx, median Dice on significant lesions was A ) 0.68 (0.58-0.73) and B) 0.71 (0.66-0.76). Processing and prediction took on average 247ms per lesion. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 322 Conclusion: This real-time DL annotation assistance system achi eves Dice scores approaching the range of inter-radiologist a greement, which is improved further by user thresholding. Fast prediction times allow repeated real-time seed placement and interactive volume adjustment. Limitations: Similar studies for automatic segmentations should be undertaken for ADC/DCE and systems should be evaluated by multiple users during manual interaction.

Roest*\u00b9, Kwee\u00b9, \u00b9Groningen/NL, \u00b2Nijmegen/NL Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of automatic longitudinal analysis of consecutive bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI) scans to detect clinically significant (cs) prostate cancer (PCa). Methods or Background: This retrospective study included a multi-center data set of 1539 patients who underwent bpMRI (T2+D WI) between 2014 and 2020, of whom 105 patients underwent at least two c onsecutive bpMRI before biopsy without pathologically confirmed csPCa prior to follow-up. A deep learning prostate cancer detection model was develo ped and trained to produce a heatmap of all PIRADS 2 lesions across baseline and current studies. The aligned heatmaps for each patient's baseline and current examination were used to extract differential volum etric and likelihood features reflecting explainable changes between examinations . A logistic classifier was trained to predict from these features csPCa (ISUP> 1) at the time of the current examination according to biopsy. A model tr ained on the current study only was developed for comparison. An extended model was developed incorporating clinical parameters (PSA density and age). Cross-validation was performed to assess the detection performance of the models on unseen data. The diagnostic performance of the best model was compared to the radiologist scores. Diagnostic accuracies are compared using li kelihood ratio tests and ROC analysis. Results or Findings: The model including baseline and current study (AUC 0.73 CI: 0.49 0.89) performed better (AUC 0.70 CI: 0.42 0.86), and significantly (P=0.002) improved fi t. Adding clinical variables further improved diagnostic performance (AUC 0.79 C I: 0.60 0.94). The extended surveillance model's performance was comparable to that of the CI: 0.52 0.86).

Methods or Background: 60 patients undergoing 3T multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for evaluation of prostate cancer were pros pectively enrolled in this institutional review board-approved study between O ctober 2020 and March 2021. After acquisition of standard T2 TSE imaging (T2S), the novel T2 TSE sequence with DLR (T2DLR) was applied in three plan es. Overall, acquisition time for T2S resulted in 10:21 min versus 3:50 min for T2DLR. Image evaluation was performed by two radiologists independently in a blinded random order using a Likert scale ranging from 1-4 (4 best) and applying the following criteria: noise levels, artifacts, overal l image quality, diagnostic confidence, and lesion conspicuity. Additionally, T 2 and PI-RADS scoring were performed. Results or Findings: Mean patient age was 69\u00b19 years (range, 49-85 years ). Noise levels as well as extent of artifacts were ev aluated to be significantly improved in T2DLR versus T2S by both readers (p<0.0 5). Overall image quality was also evaluated to be superior in T2DLR versus T2S in all three acquisition planes (p=0.005 - <0.001). Lesion conspicuity was rated by both readers with a median of 4 in T2DLR versus a median of 3 in T2S (p=0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Accelerated T2-weighted TSE imaging of the prostate in three planes including DLR is feasible, with a significan t improvement of image quality, and allows an acquisition time reduction of more than 60%. Limitations: The fact that there was no DLR of DCE or DWI was id entified as a limitation of this study. Ethics committee approval: IRB approval was obtained.

Wang; Beijing/CN (chenqian8319@163.com) Purpose: which serve as the core of the neural network, and their couplings can reflect different therapeutic effects in tinnitus patients. We hypothesised that tinnitus patients wi th different outcomes after sound therapy (narrowband noise) would have distinc t brain network topological alterations. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 323 Methods or Background: Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were prospect ively performed in 60 patients with idiopathic tinnitus and 57 healthy controls (HCs). Graph- theoretical network analyses of structural connecti vity (SC), functional connectivity (FC) and SC and FC coupling were performed. Associations between clinical performance and graph-theoretical features were also analysed. Results or Findings: Treatment was effective (effective group; EG) in 28 patients and ineffective (ineffective group; IG) in 32 patients. For FC, the patients in the EG showed higher local efficiency t han patients in the IG. For SC, patients in both the EG and IG displayed lower normalised characteristic path length, characteristic path length and global efficiency than the HCs. More importantly, patients in the IG had higher coupling than the HCs, whereas there was no difference in coupling between patients in t he EG and HCs. Additionally, there were significant associations b etween the SC features and clinical performance in patients in the EG. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that tinnitus patients exh ibited significant brain network topological alterations, especially in the structural brain network. More importantly, patients who demonstrated different curative effects showed distinct SC-FC topological coupling properties. SC-FC coupling could be an indicator that could be used to predict prognoses in patients with idiopathic tinnitus before sound therapy. Limitations: We didn't conduct it as a longitudinal study.

Methods or Background: In this phase II clinical trial, 63 patients were randomized in three groups with different intervent (G3) injection of saline. Patients were followed with 1.5 T MR, performed bef ore treatment and 12 months later. The protocol included univoxel MR spe ctroscopy at both hand knobs and Brain Volume BRAVO, to extract region-wis e CT through surface- based morphometry analysis. Clinical surveillance i ncluded scales to evaluate functional status, muscular strength and respirator y function, as well as duration and disease progression. For statistical analysis we used SPSS 20.0.0 for Windows and JASP 0.14. Results or Findings: NAA/Cho and NAA/Cho Cr in the dominant hemisphere increased 12 months after intraspinal infusion. NAA /Cho Cr in the dominant hemisphere before treatment was lower in G1 than in G2 patients. Symptoms progression before treatment was greater in the G1 patients as compared with the other groups. Besides, NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho Cr in the non-dominant hemisphere and rate of progression in the G1 patients demonstrated a negative correlation. Regarding CT in the G1 patients, 3-month MRIs showed a reduction in some points of the frontal and temporo -occipital lobes in the dominant hemisphere, as well as in the parietal and frontal lobes of the non- dominant hemisphere, which, however, increased after 12 months.

Ngum*\u00b9, Y. performance of the cNeuro\u00ae cMRI soft ware in detecting MS lesions from T2-FLAIR images using two independent cohorts. Methods or Background: The Karolinska Institutet (KI) cohort contained dat a from 39 relapsing-remitting MS patients on anti-CD- 20 therapy with manual segmentation (19 males, 44.7\u00b18.2 years). The MICCAI -2016 cohort contained data from 38 MS patients (8 males, 46.9\u00b110.2 years, four sites, four scanners) with manual segmentations by seven experts used for generating a consensus ground truth. Lesions were detected using the cNeur o\u00ae cMRI software (Combinostics, Finland). Several metrics were used to evaluate performance against the ground truth: F1 score = 2*(SENS*PPV)/( SENS+PPV) for lesion detection (lesions > 3 mm3), a correlation coeffici ent for lesion counts and lesion volumes, and an absolute value of difference in the lesion counts (median and 95th percentile) (lesions > 10 mm3). Results or Findings: The F1 score was 0.61 (KI) and 0.64 (MICCAI-2016) when compared with the ground truth. When each expert was compared with all other experts, the experts had F1 scores 0.545- 0.706, while the corresponding value for automatic detection was 0.5 52. The correlation coefficient was 0.88 (0.92 without one outlier) (KI ), 0.91 for lesion counts and R=0.97 (KI) and (MICCAI-20 16) for lesion volumes. The (95th percentile) for the absolute diffe rence in lesion counts was 8 (28.6) (KI) and 5.5 (26.6) (MICCAI-2016). Conclusion: The results show comparable overall performance, F1 score 0.61 and 0.64, in two independent cohorts. As F1 score f or automated detection was within the range of seven experts (0.552 vs. 0. 545-0.706), the results suggest that image quantification tools are reaching the detection level comparable to human experts. Limitations: A limited number of cases was used. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority.

Abeysekera, Wood, B. J. Reed, N. Swanston, J. Yung, K-P. Hwang, J. M. Johnson; Houston, TX/US Purpose: To evaluate quantitative performance measures betwe en \"quick\" brain (QB) protocol versus standard-of-care (SOC) protocol in patients at high risk of motion. Methods or Background: QB sequences reduce scanning time, motion and patient sedation needs. Quantitative imaging measur es were provided by MRQy, an open-source quality-control tool for imagi ng data. The SOC imaging group consisted of ER and inpatients receiving brai n MR. QB patients were those suspected not to tolerate the SOC examination. Both studies included Ax T1, T2, T2 FLAIR, T2*, DWI, T1 post and 3D T1 post. Imaging metrics between the groups were analysed using a student's t-test. Results or Findings: Mean imaging time for the SOC study (420 exams) was 25 min versus 12 min for the QB study (185 scans). Both studies included Ax T1, T2, T2 FLAIR, T2*, DWI, The QB version utilises GRE sequences and added acceleration. Comparison of mean, range, and variance for the two groups showed no statistical difference for 3D T1 post, T2 and T2 FLAIR imaging (P > .01). Variance within measures of SNR were greater for quick sequences (T2: 0.07, 3D imaging time from ~25 to ~12 m inutes without significant change in mean, range and varia nce of foreground intensity values, though variability within measures of SNR w ere slightly higher in the quick scans compared to SOC studies. Thus, the gain in speed is a trade-off for potential decrease in quantitative imaging metr ics. Limitations: Study relies on quantitative measures, not qualitat ive, which may not correlate with radiologists' quality impression.

A. A. Cova; Trieste/IT Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribut ion of radiomics through the texture analysis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MS and compare the apparently normal white mat ter of patients with MS with the white matter of healthy controls. Methods or Background: A retrospective study on 25 patients with MS (24 with a relapsing-remitting type and 1 with a primar y-progressive type) and 25 healthy controls who underwent a 3T MRI was perform ed. Through a dedicated software, ROIs were placed in the followi ng areas: genu of the corpus callosum and the lateral ventricles. Finally, features on which to develop a logistic model were chosen. Results or Findings: Statistically significant differences (p<0.05/nfeat ure) were found between the two groups, especially in the frontal and parietal lobes and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. In the temporal lobe no statistically significant difference was found. As far as the thalami, the middle cerebellar peduncles and the genu are concerned, the model did not show an optimal performance. Conclusion: This study allowed the identification of the statis tically significative differences between the apparently normal white matter of patients with MS and the white matter of healthy controls th rough radiomics. The chosen features can become a classification model a nd be further used to implement machine learning in order to achieve the possibility of an early diagnoses between several different white matter di seases.

Here we present a combined functional magnetic resonance (f MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study that tracks functional and micr ostructural change over three days of learning phonetic categorisation in a new language. Methods or Background: Twenty adult native English-speaking participants were scanned before and after attending a new langu age (Arabic) training course of one hour for three consecutive days. Duri ng the course, the participants were trained to do two tasks: phonetic discrimination and a pronunciation task. Results or Findings: Behavioural results show significant performance improvements on both tasks after training. Function al imaging analysis provides evidence for (i) significant pre-training blood-oxygenation-level- dependent (BOLD) signal differences between native and non-native languages in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) but not in any other language- related areas; and (ii) significant post-training B OLD signal increases in the left IFG. This increase is correlated with the participa nts' behavioural performance change. Microstructural (DTI) analysis in the left IFG shows a significant post- training increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) aft er just three days of training. In functional connectivity, positive correlation was o bserved between the left inferior frontal gyrus and two areas (the right cer ebellum and the left middle occipital gyrus) and a negative correlation in the right lingual gyrus. Conclusion: These findings indicate that short-term speech-soun d learning recruits the same brain area and the same functional network that is being used for processing the L1. The microstructural changes could indicate an early stage of myelination process in the left IFG. Limitations: No follow-up scan.

Methods or Background: 10 APC patients were scanned twice on the same day on Siemens Aera 1.5T MRI. MpWB-MRI DIXON sequences. ADC and relative fat-fraction (rFF) maps were calculated. A radiologist measured up to 10 target bone metastases per study. Means of ADC, b900 signal int ensity (SI), b900 SI normalised versus the conus medullaris, rFF and max imum diameter(MD) on rFF images for each target lesion and averages across all targets per patient were recorded. On commercially available post-processing software the total disease volume (tDV in ml) was manually delineated on b900 images and mean global (g)ADC was derived. repeatabil ity coefficients (RCs) and variance (CoVs) were calculated . Results or Findings: 73 individual targets (median MD 26 mm, range 10-56 mm) were included. Lesion mm), RC 1.9%. Conclusion: Individual APC bone metastases' ADC and MD, average target ADC, rFF and MD and tDV and gADC show good repeatability, which is good technical validation and evidence to support furthe r development as imaging biomarkers.

Gallagher\u00b2; \u00b9T\u00fcbingen/DE, \u00b2Cambridge/UK Purpose: There is an unmet clinical need to differentiate in dolent and aggressive renal cell cancers (RCC) to improve treatment stratification (surveillance vs surgery). However, conventional im aging and single tumour biopsies cannot determine tumour grade sufficiently accurately. Metabolic changes reflecting aggressiveness could be used to assess RCC. Hyperpolarised 13C-pyruvate MRI has shown promise t o measure grade- dependent alterations in other cancers. This study aimed to prospectively correlate the metabolic phenotype of RCC with tumour grade and validate the findings on histology. Methods or Background: Six participants with treatment-na\u00efve clear cell C underwent preoperative hyperpolarised 13C-pyruvate conversion to lactate (kPL) was derived from the metabolite signals create within the tumour. moulds enabled multi-regional, ded samples were stained for MCT1 and MCT4, membrane transporters of pyruvate and lactate, to determine their role in 13C-pyruvate metabolism. RNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase, catalysing the conversion between pyruvate and lactate, was in each tumour. Results or Findings: The with the tumour grade of co-localised biopsies (P=0.03, corrected for patient dependency). The kPL also correlated with the expression of MCT1 (P=0.016), t he transporter taking up pyruvate, providing mechanistic evidence for signal generation. The RNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase trended towards a positive correlation with kPL. The kPL was not correlated with physiological MRI measures of diffusivity, perfusion, and well as histological cell density. Conclusion: Hyperpolarised 13C-pyruvate MRI may serve to assess tumour grade in RCC. Furthermore, it may guide biopsies to the most aggressive sub- regions of a tumour, enabling more accurate treatment stratification. Limitations: Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings .

Drljevic-Nielsen*\u00b9, J. Mains\u00b9, K. Thorup\u00b9, have shown prognostic ability in patients with metastati c renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Whether early change in DL-CT parameters is associated with patient outcomes is unknown. Methods or Background: DL-CT scans were performed at baseline and after one month of checkpoint immunotherapy or tyrosine-k inase inhibitor therapy. Scans were reconstructed to conventional CT and DL- CT series, and used for assessment of Hounsfield Units (HU), iodine concent ration (IC), and the effective atomic number (Zeffective) in the combined RECISTv.1.1 target lesions. The relative changes from baseline to one month, defined as IC(combined), Zeffective(combined) and HU(combined), were assessed categorically (cut-off: lower quartile) and associa ted with progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response rate. Results or Findings: Overall, 115 and 104 mRCC patients were included at baseline and one month, respectively. Following one month of treatment, median IC (combined) decreased from 2.3 to 1.2 mg/m l,(p<0.001), Zeffective (combined) from 8.5 to 8.0,(p<0.001), and HU (combi ned) from 86.0 to 64.0 HU, (p<0.001). After adjustments for treatments, hi stology and baseline factors, the largest reductions in IC (combined) (HR 0.47, associated with favorable OS; the largest reduction in Zeffective (combined) was associated with higher re sponse (OR=2.79, 95% CI: 1.12-6.94, p=0.027). No associations were found between HU (combined) and outcomes. Conclusion: Early reductions at one month in DL-CT derived IC (combined) and Zeffective (combined) are associated with favourabl e outcomes in patients with mRCC. This information may reassure physicians and patients about treatment strategy. Limitations: Cardiac output and patient size can affect the cont rast enhancement of the tissue and thus the quantificati on of DL-CT parameters.

Cankaya*, L. Damgaci; Ankara/TR Purpose: To evaluate the value of histogram analysis in immunotherapy response assessment and predicting prognosis in met astatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patients treated with nivolumab. Methods or Background: 27 metastatic RCC patients treated with that are analysed are non-enhanced basal CT which is before the drug administration, non-enhanced first control CT which is 3 months after the drug administration and non-enhanc ed second control CT which is 6 months after the drug administration. CT scans were evaluated based on iRECIST criteria, then target lesions were selected and measured for each patient. Each target lesion was segmented usin g software (Olea Sphere 3.0-SP 23 Olea Medicals, La Ciotat, France) with fr ee hand technique and the entire lesion was obtained sequantially as VOI. Usi ng this VOI, size, first order parameters and shape parameters were studied for each target lesion via software. Patients dichotomised into two groups as objective responders and non-objective responders according to iRECIST crite ria, then histogram analysis parameters were compared between the group s using Wilcoxon, paired t, Mann Whitney u, Kruskal Wallis tests. Results or Findings: According to first CT scans measurements at 3rd month control, objective responders have lower values of volume, 90th percentile and at 6th months measurements skewness values are lower in objective responders. According to second CT scans measurements objective responders have lower values of skewness. We also r esearched the correlation between histogram analysis parameters and IMDC scores, which is a prognostic model. We found a positive correlation between IMDC scores and median, volume, 90th percentile values. Conclusion: Histogram analysis might be promising quantitative imaging tool in response assesment and predicting prognosis of m etastatic RCC patients treated with immunotherapy.

Yu*, H. Le, S. Fulcher, M. A. Turner; Richmond, VA/US (jinxing.yu@vcuhealth.org) Purpose: evaluate mult i-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) using PI-RADS v2 in detection of prostate cancer (PCa) among radiologists with different levels of experience. Methods or Background: Between 07/1/2018 and 12/31/2020, 462 patients underwent prostate mp-MRI and then US/MRI fusion target biopsies. In order to be considered suitable candidates for study, pat ients had to have at least one cancer-suspicious region (CSR) at mp-MRI and no prior history of PCa treatment. All CSRs at MRI were assigned PI-RADS sc ores based on PI-RADS Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 326 v2 when studies were interpreted by two GU radiologists, one with 15 years (reader 1) and the other 3 years (reader 2) in reading prostate MRI. Results were compared to histopathology obtained by MR/ultr asound fusion guided biopsies. Statistical analysis was applied to the d ata collected. Results or Findings: US/MRI fusion prostate biopsies of 513 lesions in 4 62 patients were performed and revealed 396 PCa (77% t umour detection rate). In PI-RADS 5, 4 and 3 lesions, detection rates of P Ca was 97%, 87% and 50% for reader 1, and 90%, 88% and 36% for reader 2, respectively. There was a significant difference between reader 1 and reader 2 regarding detection of PCa for PI-RADS 3 lesions, p<0.01 (50% vs. 36%, P=0 .0054). When considering high cancer-suspicious lesions (PI-RADS 4,5), diagnostic performances were similar between reader 1 and 2 wi th no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion: Tumour detection rate of 77% amongst lesions deemed suspicious for PCa at mp-MRI using PI-RADS v2 was d emonstrated supporting PI-RADS v2 as a reliable and replicable reporting s ystem for detection of PCa. Among them, cancer detection rate in PI-RADS 3 lesi ons increased with greater reader experience and detection rate in PI- RADS 4 and 5 was similar between readers.

Methods or Background: Thirty-four patients were randomly selected from the database of the BonEnza phase III trial. Imaging was performed on a 1.5T scanner, with MET-RADS-P compliant protocol. For each patient, a Small Active Lesion (SAL, < 10 mm) and a Large Active Les ion (LAL, >10 mm) were identified. Manual segmentation on the most represe ntative slice (blinded choice) was performed once by R1 and twice by R2. I ntra- and interrater agreement of single-slice and volumetric FF% on SAL and LAL and first-order features were evaluated with interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Spearman's correlation coefficient was used for single-slice and volumetric measurements correlation. \"3DSlicer\" was used for pyradiomics\" for feature Results or Findings: Regarding FF%, intra-reader ICC for SAL and LAL and LAL was 0.641 and 0.805 on single-slice measurements and 0.762 and 0.883 on volumetric measurements. Correlation between FF% measured on single slice and volume was 0.817 for SAL and 0.649 for LAL. Regarding first-order featur es, 10Percentile, Median, Minimum, RootMeanSquared had inter- and intra-rater agreement >0.75 for both LAL and SAL, 90Percentile for LAL only. Conclusion: In mRCPC, FF% on bone metastases is reproducible, especially when considering lesions >10 mm with a volumetric a pproach. First-order features showed good reproducibility too.

Berardi*, C. Pereira da Silva, M. Engbersen, W. van Driel, C. Lok, R. van Stein, M. Lahaye, R. G. H. Beets-Tan ; Amsterdam/NL (berardi.eva@gmail.com) Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is used in ovarian cancer (OC) patients with peritoneal metastasis (PM). Current s tandards like RECIST are difficult to apply in the daily clinic because peri toneal lesions are challenging to measure, especially after NACT. This study aims to evaluate a new standardised scoring system for monitoring chemotherapy response: \"The Estimated Volume Index (EVI)\". Methods or Background: Ovarian cancer patients with PM treated with NACT followed by surgery were included from 2012-2017. A retrospective analysis of CT-scans before and after NACT was performed by an experienced reader and a reader with no experience in staging PM. EVI categorises patients according to the subjective overall response based on the response present in the majority of 7 regions as defined by the \"Dutch Region Score\". The response is classified based on the percentage of l esions decreased or progressed for each region: progressive, mixed, stable, partial, good or complete. To validate EVI, results were compared to the median overall survival (OS). Results or Findings: 58 ovarian cancer patients were included with a median age of 70 years. Twenty-four out of 58 patients (41%) had a complete resection and 34/58 (59%) an incomplete debulking. Median OS was 29.0 months. For reader 1 median OS correlated significantly (p<0.001) with the EVI scoring. The median OS for patients with progressiv e disease or mixed response was 8 months, stable disease 25 months and partial, good or complete response was 49 months (p<0.001). The interrater reliability agreement was 0.338 (p<0.001). Conclusion: These preliminary results show that EVI, in experie nced hands, can help quantify treatment response in advanced OC patients. EVI provides vital information concerning the prognosis and migh t help in selecting the optimal treatment for each patient.

Aluffi*\u00b9, G. Avesani\u00b2, cont rast-enhanced CT images for predicting residual tumor (RT) and ea rly recurrence (ER) (<1year) after debulking surgery. Methods or Background: In this retrospective multicentre study we enrolled 227 patients with ovarian cancer (OC) who underwent debulking surgery with an available preoperative CT. Manual segmentation of the primary ovarian tumour was performed. 217 radiomic features were ex tracted from the contoured lesion using MODDICOM software. Feature s tability was assessed with ANOVA. ComBat method was used to harmonise par ameters that proved unstable due to image heterogeneity (different slic e thickness and different scanners). Patients were randomly grouped into a testing set and a validation test. Wilcoxon-SSMann-Whitney and Pearson analysis were performed to select features in the training set, while the synt hetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was used to balance our data set. Machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logi stic Regression with elastic net regularisation) were developed using al ternatively all the 217 features or the features selected with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Pearson analysis. Machine learning model performances were finally estimated by 3- fold cross-validation (CV). Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 327 Results or Findings: The models built using all the extracted features s howed lower predictive performance than those built using only the selected features. Best results were obtained with Decision Tree model predicting RT (mean AUC: 0.61, CI: 0.09) and with XGBoost model predict (mean AUC: 0.60, CI: 0.07). Conclusion: Our multicentre study, which analysed a relatively sizable \"real world\" data set, showed unsatisfying results of the radiomic models both for RT and ER. Further studies are needed to build a relia ble radiomic models for the decision making process. Limitations: The retrospective non-consecutive study design was identified as a limiting factor.

We used a s oftware to calculate the percentage of negative voxel in the lesions. The me asure of the volume was hand-traced made slice-by-slice for the extraction of the volume of interest (VOI). On unenhanced CT-scan, standard deviation (S D) of the mean attenuation values has been noted to assess noise e ffect. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of percentage of negati ve pixels to distinguish between adenomas and of lipid-poor than 10% negative pixels on unenhanced CT-scan. By comparison, on enhanced CT-scan, we find any metastases and only 3.1% of lipid-poor adenomas, showed the percentage of negative pixels above 10%. For the 10% negative pixel percentage threshol d, our sensitivity and specificity were 68.7% and 84.3% respectively for t he diagnosis of adenoma. After excluding 24 nodules in 21 patients because of a large SD (> 20 of HU values), we would detect 56.5% of lipid-poor adenom as and 7.5% of metastases on unenhanced CT with the same threshold. We aimed to find the threshold of percentage of negative pixel by establ ishing a ROC curve. We found that 12% corresponded to the most specific th reshold with an acceptable sensitivity (respectively 95.6% and biopsy-proven diagnosis; we malignant nodules. Limitations: The CT histogram method with a threshold value of > 12% negative pixels can identify many benign adrenal no dules with attenuation values >10 HU on unenhanced CT with extremely high specificity.

Kocova; RPS dual-energy in 79 patients I. Mohamed, A. Duhamel, J. Giordano, A. Purpose: To evaluate vascular more t han 6 months after hospitalisation for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods or Background: In a cohort of 739 patients having been hospitalise d for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between March 2020 and Apr il 2021 (T0 period), 222 patients remaining symptomatic more than 6 mont hs after the initial infection underwent a delayed specialised follow-up. The eligibility criteria for the long-term assessment of pulmonary circulation ( T1 period) included: (a) a dual-energy CT angiographic (CTA) obtai ned with the same equipment; and (b) interpretable lung perfusion images. 143 patients were excluded because (a) chest CTA had been obtained <6 months after pneumonia (n=126); (b) there was a non-interpretabl e lung perfusion (n=17). The final study group included 79 patients with mor phologic and lung perfusion imaging at T1 (mean \u00b1 SD between T0 and T1: 7.9 \u00b11. 7 months). Results or Findings: At T1, morphologic images showed (a) complete resolution of acute PE (12/79;15.2%) and newly developed features of chronic PE (3/79; 3.8%); (b) newly diagnosed acute PE (2/79 ; 2.5%). Lung perfusion was abnormal in 69 patients (87.4%), depicting (a) perfusion defects of 3 endoluminal filling defects; and (b) areas of increased perfusion 59 patients (74.9%), superimposed on follow-up showed newly developed CT features of acute and chronic PE but also two types of perfusion abnormalities, suggestive of persistent hypercoagulability as well as unresolved/sequelae of the widespread microangiopathy described in the acute phase of the disease.

Vicini*\u00b9, A. Iannarelli\u00b9, S. Ruggiero\u00b9, D. \u00b9Latina/IT, \u00b2Rome/IT (simone.vicini@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compar e the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT imaging in unvacc inated and vaccinated COVID-19 individuals, along with the impact of diff erent types of vaccines. Methods or Background: Retrospective observational study on COVID-19 positive patients with respiratory symptoms, and chest CT to evaluate lung involvement. Unvaccinated and vaccinated patients w ere included. Each CT exam was interpreted by 3 radiologists with the att ribution of a score from 0 to 5 for each lobe (for a maximum value of 25) based o n the percentage of parenchymal involvement according to Chang et al. M orphological patterns of lung involvement were also evaluated. Scores and characteristics were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients and mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 328 Results or Findings: 467 patients were analysed, including 216 unvaccina ted and 251 vaccinated (167 mRNA vaccine; 84 adenovirus vaccine). Unvaccinated patients showed a median CT score of 10/25 compared to the median score of 5/25 in the vaccinated (3/25 mRNA v accine; 6/25 adenovirus vaccine) (P <0.05). Considering a value >= 15 of th e score as a cut-off, a diagnostic accuracy with AUC of 0.98, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93%, was obtained in predicting admission to intens ive care unit (ICU). Logistic regression analysis identified complete vaccination as a protective factor with respect to a score >= 15 (OR = 15.2). Conclusion: Complete vaccination was found to be a protective f actor in preventing the onset of severe COVID-19 pneumonia a t imaging. Limitations: Retrospective nature. The study was conducted in a single region in Italy. No possibility to evaluate all the types of vaccines; limited to the types of vaccines distributed in our region.

Thie\u00df*, K. K. Bressem, L. C. Adams, L. Vah ldiek, S. M. Niehues; Berlin/DE (martin@hjts.de) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyse image quali ty and confounding factors that affect image quality in patients suspected of SARS- CoV-2 infection. Also, the impact on reproducibilit y of quality ratings of low- dose chest CT protocols is evaluated. Methods or Background: We retrospectively included 100 randomly selected low-dose chest CT scans of patients suspected of SA RS-CoV-2 infection in two centres. Two radiologists rated image quality b ased on a Likert scale. Reasons for reduced ratings were evaluated. In order to allow for analysis of inter- and intra-reader reliability, ratings were r epeated after three weeks. Additionally, radiation dose was analysed. Results or Findings: The median effective radiation dose of the analysed scans was in the submillisievert range (0.53 mSv, I QR: 0.35 mSv) and the majority of scans received optimal quality ratings. Those with reduced ratings (38%) most commonly demonstrated noticeable artefac ts (63%), high noise (39%) or lack of sharpness (18%). Only one scan was rated as non-diagnostic due to excessive artefacts caused by lowered arms. Inter-reader and intra- reader reliability showed almost perfect agreement (Cohen's of with almost perfect inter-reader and intra-reader agreement in patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Image q uality was mostly impaired by unavoidable artefacts due to low dose, without limiting clinical assessment of lung parenchyma. Limitations: The major limitation of our study is the retrospect ive image evaluation of two centers with limited sample size.

RPS 1804-5 Possible alterations of imaging patterns in compute d tomography for Delta-VOC of SARS-CoV-2 *C. C. K. M. Schulze-Hagen; findings for COVID-19 been described as bilateral, multifocal ground-glas s opacities (GGOs), consolidations and reticulation. Round pulmonary masses or nodules with a halo sign are considered uncommon. The authors rece ntly observed several patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with these uncommon findings. This may indicate alterations of CT morphology as v ariants fluctuate and is to be retrospectively analysed. Methods or Background: 161 initial CTs of patients with confirmed SARS- CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR within 2 days of CT) examined between January 2021 and 15th of September 2021 were included. Pati ents with invasive ventilation and patients with insufficient virus ty ping were excluded. CTs were assessed for signs established to be typical for CO VID-19, as well as other pulmonary findings. Results were compared using Man n-Whitney U tests, students' t-tests, descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests. Results or Findings: After exclusion, 86/161 patients/CTs were included. 22 patients had a viral genome profile consistent with Delta-VOC, 39 patients with Alpha-VOC and 25 patients with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2. Three Delta-VOC- patients demonstrated multiple round consolidations with a surrounding halo sign, whereas no Alpha-VOC-patients (p=0.043) or no n-VOC-patients (p=0.095) demonstrated these findings. Conclusion: In this study 13.6% of Delta-VOC-patients presented with bilateral round consolidations with halo signs. Thi s was not an established imaging pattern in COVID-19 pneumonia yet. Based on these results Delta- VOC might cause a divergence in CT-morphologic phenotype. Limitations: Low recruitment count. Selection bias (e.g. vaccination prioritisation).

M. Masci*, effectiveness COVID-19 vaccin ation during SARS-CoV-2 infection using the CT Severity Score (C TSS) to compare the degree of pulmonary involvement between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients. Methods or Background: 1033 SARS-CoV-2+ patients (673 vaccinated and 360 non-vaccinated), matched for clinical and demographic characteristics, who underwent a chest CT scan were enrolled. Images were evaluated by two readers with 3 and 15 years of experience using the CTSS (0-25), resulting from the sum of lobar scores based on the percentage of involvement (0:0%; 1: <5%; 2:5-25%; 3:26-50%; 4:51-75%; 5: > 75%). The CTSS was compared between vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients, als o considering the type of vaccine and the number of doses received. Results or Findings: The CTSS resulted significantly lower in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated patients (p<0.0001). The data was confirmed also when patients with no evidence of pneumonia (CTSS=0) were not considered in the analysis(p<0.0001). Moreover, when patients were stratified based on the number of doses received, non-vaccinated subjec ts showed higher CTSS than patients with 1, 2 and 3 doses (p<0.0001); pat ients with 3 doses obtained lower CTSS compared to those with 1 and 2 doses (p= 0.03). No difference of CTSS was found between the different types of vacci ne received. Conclusion: The CTSS allowed for differentiating the degree of pulmonary involvement during COVID-19 infection between vacci nated and non- vaccinated patients, demonstrating milder cases of disease following vaccination, suggesting its effectiveness in reduci ng the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 329 Limitations: The main limitations were represented by the retros pective nature of the study, which did not allow for establishing a cause-effect relationship between vaccination and the lower pulmonary involvement, and the unavailable data on the time interval between the date of vaccination and the infection. Ethics committee approval: Ethical approval was obtained for this study. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Rizzetto*, L. Berta, G. Zorzi, L. A. A. Vanzulli; Milan/IT (Francesco.rizzetto@unimi.it) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance in different iating COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonias on CT imaging by comparing radiologists and a radiomics-based artificial intel ligence (R-AI) model. Methods or Background: Chest CT images of 1028 patients with positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 (n=646) and other respiratory v iruses (n=382) were used to develop a R-AI classifier to discriminate b etween COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID) and pneumonia from other viruses (non-COVID). The model was trained with 808 CT images; the remaining 220 CT images (151 COVID-19, 69 non-COVID-19) were used as independent validation dataset, applying a threshold on the predicted values of 0.5. Four readers (three radiologists with >10 years experience and one radi ology resident with 3 years experience) were enrolled to blindly evaluate the i ndependent validation dataset using the CO-RADS score. A high-suspicion s cenario (CO-RADS 3 considered as COVID) and a low-suspicion scenario ( CO-RADS 3 considered as non-COVID) were simulated. Specificity (SP), sen sitivity (SE) and accuracy (ACC) were calculated for human readers and R-AI model. Inter-reader agreement was also assessed with ordinal-weighted F leiss' kappa (k). Results or Findings: The R-AI model achieved SE=79%, SP=78% and ACC=79% in distinguishing COVID from non-COVID pneumonia on the validation dataset. Inter-reader agreement in assig CO-RADS was good (k=0.68, IC95% 0.63-0.72) and diagnostic performanc e was averaged between readers. In particular, the readers obtained SE=83% , SP=65% and ACC=78% a nd ACC=74% in the low-suspicion scenario. Excluding the less experienced reader did not significantly change these results. Conclusion: A radiomics-based artificial intelligence model may provide comparable diagnostic performance to human readers in distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonias on C T imaging. Limitations: Generalisability of the results should be assessed in a multicentre setting. Ethics committee approval: Local ethical committee approved the study.

Armbruster*\u00b9, J. Wailzer\u00b9, A. Dadras\u00b9, M. J. Purpose: COVID-19 infections are on a steep rise in early 20 22 and new mutations are spreading rapidly. Machine-learning m odels predicting severe disease courses remain of interest to efficiently allocate limited medical resources. Methods or Background: In this analysis, we included 551 PCR-confirmed COVID cases from 10 university hospitals out of a nationwide collection of 3065 COVID cases across all 36 German university female/male: 172/372; known comorbidit ies: 1.68\u00b11.47[min-max: outcome variables in a binary di sease-severity score and trained predictors for severe disease progression. Our cohort included 129 severe (ICU admission and invasive ventilation) and 422 non-severe cases. We leveraged 31 structured CT-reporting items per patient. Complementary clinical parameters included 18 additional features as input variables (9 anamnestic parameters, 4 vital parameters, oxygen t herapy type, IL-6, lymphocyte count, CRP and D-dimers). We lassifiers (RandomForest, GradientBoosting) to estimate the li kelihood of severe outcomes for hospitalised patients and, additionall y, for all location-specific folds to test generalisability. Results or Findings: Predicting the highest treatment status, we achieve an accuracy of 73.19% and increase this by 15 percentage-points when predicting the highest ventilatory needs (88.41%). By combining these two metrics, we achieve an accuracy of 94.93%. Compared to models t rained on image- derived parameters only, we improve by 8 percentage-points. Location-specific train/test folds achieved an averaged accuracy of 94.64\u00b10.03% and show that our model generalises among different hospitals. Conclusion: By using baseline parameters complementary to image analysis, the model accurately predicts COVID-19-patients' di sease progression at the time of the first CT scan after hospital admission. Our tool will be made available for public use. Limitations: This preliminary analysis should be expanded to inc lude datasets of further centers of the nationwide RACOON network .

C. Labuschagne*, H. Moodley, J. Venturas; Johan nesburg/ZA (chrisjanlab@live.com) Purpose: To compare Brixia scores of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia in a middle- to lower-income country and develop predictive models of clinical outcome using Brixia scores and clinical and laboratory data. Methods or Background: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of adults with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 1 May - 30 June 2020. Two radiologists, blinded to all clinical information, generated Brix ia scores independently. These were compared to clinical parameters, length of stay, and clinical outcomes. Inter-rater agreement was assessed. Multivariable l ogistic regression identified variables predictive of mortality. Results or Findings: There were 263 patients, 51% were male (median age 47 years [IQR = 20]). Hypertension (38.4%), diabetes (25.1%), obesity (19.4%) and HIV (15.6%) were the commonest co-morbidities. The median length of stay (n = 258) was 7.5 days (IQR = 7). Fifty (19%) patients died, median age 55 years (IQR = 23), versus survivors, 46 years (IQ R = 20; p=0.01). One or more co-morbidities conferred a higher death rate ( 23% versus 9.2% without) (p = 0.01). The median Brixia score for the deceased was higher (14.5) than for discharged patients (9.0) (p = 0.00). Inter-rater agreement was good (ICC 0.77; 95% CI 0.6-0.85; p = 0.00). Models combining Brixia score, age, male gender and obesity as well as Brixia score and CRP predict ed the highest risk for mortality (AUC = 0.78). Conclusion: We developed the first South African models incorporating Brixia scores, clinical features and a serological marker, which is a promising risk- stratification tool in a resource-limited setting. Limitations: Single-centre study with no control group. Two general radiologists allocated Brixia scores.

Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients who underwent a chest CT-scan was performed in four medical centres. The prognostic value of chest CT results was assessed u sing a multivariable survival analysis. The characteristics included in the model were the degree of lung involvement, ground-glass opacities, nodular c onsolidations, linear consolidations, a predomin antly inferior lung involvement, pleural effusion and crazy paving. The model was also adjusted on age, sex, and the centre in which the patient was hospitalised. The primary endpoint was 30-day in-hospital mortality. A second model used a composite endpoint of admission to an intensive care unit or 30-day in-hospital mortality. Results or Findings: A total of 515 patients with available follow-up information were included. Advanced age, a degree of pulmonary involvement 50% (Hazard Ratio 2.25 [95% CI: 1.378-3.671], p = 0 .001), nodular consolidations and pleural effusions were associated with lower 30-day in- hospital survival rates. An exploratory subgroup an alysis showed a 60.6% mortality rate in patients over 75 with 50% lung involvement on a CT-scan. Conclusion: Chest CT findings such as the percentage of pulmona ry involvement 50%, pleural effusion and nodular consolidation wer e strongly associated with 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients Limitations: In the context of the first outbreak peak of the ep idemic, many patients did not have access to an RT-PCR at the ti me of admission. Hence, for some patients, inclusion was decided based on t he clinical presentation combined with CT scan findings.

Methods or Background: A total of 88'864 reports (62'803 chest radiographs ; 26'061 CTs performed in the emergency room; years 2012-3/2022) were included from the radiological information system. Using a text search algorithm, first, all chest radiographs/CT examinat ions containing the clinical question \"pulmonary infection/pneumonia\" in the ref erring physicians order were identified (28'715 chest radiographs; 7'887 CT s). Secondly, the algorithm searched for the written negation of the presence of a pulmonary infection \"no pulmonary infiltrate\" in the report. After excluding examinations negative for pulmonary infections, the remainder of the reports were searched for the positive statement of a pulmonary infection. If non e of the conditions applied, the examination was labeled \"other\" regarding diagnosis. Results or Findings: From 1/2014 to 2/2020 the average pulmonary infecti ons detected by chest radiographs ranged from 55.3-62.9 per month while 241.1- 303.6 chest radiographs were negative for pulmonary infection, yielding a 15.5- 18.4% detection rate. There were clear seasonal changes with maximum detection counts ranging from 89-104 in the winter months compared to 31-46 in the summer. For CT, there was a sharp increase i n average monthly pulmonary infection detection in 2020/21, ranging b etween 68.8-72.2 (vs. 13.8- 21.2, 2014 to 2019). However, detection rates remai ned similar (2014-2019: 38.2-49.3% vs. 2020-2021: 41.6-44.8%). The course o f the positive pulmonary infection CT curve 2020-2022 correlates well with l ocal waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Text mining of radiology reports allows for extract ion of diagnosis, thus delivering a metric to track the trend of such diagnosis in real time. As demonstrated the seasonality and pandemic course of pulmonary infections can be revealed. Limitations: Text search algorithm may not have 100% accuracy. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Booz*\u00b9, To evaluate diagnostic and image quality of dual-energy CT (DECT) late arterial (LA) phase iodine mapping for assessment of ABI compared to portal venous (PV) iodine maps and LA conventional CT series. Methods or Background: Data from 142 patients (72 men) who had undergone DECT based on a standardised three-phasic scan protocol due to clinical suspicion of ABI were included. One board- certified radiologist manually performed region-of-interest (ROI) measurements in bowel segments on LA and PV DECT iodine maps as well as LA convent ional series, both in surgery-confirmed ischaemic and non-ischaemic bowel loops. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Additionally, subjective visual image rating was carried out. Sur gical data served as the reference standard. Results or Findings: DECT-based iodine uptake values showed significant differences in LA phases between ischaemic (0.71 \u00b1 0.28 between 63 \u00b1 8.97 HU) (p<.001). Iodine quantification on LA phase revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.982, significantly higher compared to the CT valu es evaluated on conventional series (0.828) and PV phase iodine qua ntification (0.852). The optimal LA phase iodine density threshold was 1.24 mg/mL, providing a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%. LA iodi ne maps were rated significantly better than PV iodine maps (p<.001) r egarding image quality and diagnostic confidence. Conclusion: Application of LA phase DECT iodine maps increases diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence and image quality f or assessement of ABI. Limitations: Single-centre study.

Methods or Background: We prospectively evaluated 75 cirrhotic patients and 25 healthy volunteers with MRE, T1/T2 mapping. Fibrosis stage, splenic/liver volume and the presence of oesophageal varices were also determined. Results or Findings: Liver MRE showed a significant moderate positive correlation with T1 mapping (r=0.51 and p=0.000) and T1 and T2 mapping and s pleen volume were found to be statistically significant in detecting fibros is (p<0.05). There was a significant moderate positive correlation with spleen MRE and T2 mapping (r=0.37 and p=0.001). Although there was a statisti cally significant difference between patient and control group in spleen T1 mapping (p=0.000), a correlation wasn't detected between spleen MRE and T1 mapping in the patient group. In the comparison of the patient and the control groups the cut- off values for liver MRE, liver T1 mapping and live r T2 mapping were 2.6 kPA (AUC=0.97), 619 ms (AUC=0.90) and 52.5 ms (AUC=0.62 ), respectively. The cut-off value for the prediction of oesophageal var ices in the patient group p<0.0001) and 607 cm3 (AUC=0.790, p<0.0001) for spleen MRE and spleen volume, respectively. Conclusion: Liver MRE showed a positive moderate correlation wi th liver T1 and T2 mapping. In the prediction of oesophageal varices, spleen volume showed a similar diagnostic performance with spleen MRE. Limitations: This study was limited by the inability to use cont rast agent.

The rectum and sigmoid colon, respectively, have a RDOR of 5.4 and 2.6 when butylscopolamine is applied compared to Bisaco dyl (P=0.051; P = 0.008), and a RDOR of 4.2 and 5.7 with Bisacodyl compared to no medical preparation (P=0.006; P<0.01). Small bowel delineat ion was significantly better with butylscopolamine compared to Bisacodyl (P=0.007). There was no significant difference in delineation of the other structures between protocols. There is a significant higher chance of observing r ectal wall oedema with Bisacodyl compared to the other protocols (resp. RD OR 0.055 and 0.051 the small bowel and rectosigmoid compared to Bisacodyl, which, in t urn, provides better delineation of the rectosigmoid compared to no medi cation. Moreover, Bisacodyl causes rectal wall oedema in the majority of cases. Limitations: Retrospective study design. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Tse*, L. S. Yoon, A. Kamaya; Stanfo rd, CA/US Purpose: neuroendocrine (PNETs) are Methods 50 treatment-na\u00efve PNETs from 50 adult patients (57\u00b114 years; 29 women, 21 men) from 2010-2021 with serial CT/MRI separated by at least 3 months and histopathology w ere included for analysis. Orthogonal dimensions of PNETs were measured for each PNET. Growth kinetics were assessed with volume doubling time (V DT) using the modified Schwartz equation. Qualitative imaging features wer e evaluated by two abdominal radiologists blinded to histopathology. H istopathologic grade was assigned using the 2017 WHO classification system. Results or Findings: Of 50 PNETs, 38 (76%) were grade 1, and 12 (24%) were grade 2-3. Median VDT for grade 1 PNETs was 1. 8 years (interquartile range IQR 1.4-6.4 years) while median VDT p=0.003). Grade 2-3 PNETs were more likely to have local mass effect (defined as vascular involvement, main baseline imaging (50% vs 13%; p=0.014) and VDT < 3 years (75% vs 18%), compared to grade 1 PNETs. Baseline size, presence of calcifications and tumour vascularity relative to the rest of the panc reas were not associated with grade. At multivariable analysis, VDT was the most significant predictor of PNET grade (odds ratio OR 3.9), followed by radiologic evidence of metastases (OR 2.1) and local mass effect (OR 1.6). Conclusion: High-growth kinetics defined by volume doubling tim e with higher-grade pancreatic neuroendocr ine tumours. Limitations: Single-centre, retrospective study with a small sam ple size.

The imaging manifestations of IgG4-RD are broad and variable depending on the organ invol ved. However, when there are simultaneous findings of typical of IgG4-RD in multiple organs, then the possibility of IgG4-RD should be raised. Hence, the objective behind this study is to understand the imaging spectrum of IgG4-RD in multiple organs in histopathological proven cases, analyse the post-tr eatment imaging response in these cases and to address imaging differentials for the same. Methods or Background: Imaging features (CT and MRI based on the organ involved) in 15 histopathologically proven cases of IgG4-related disease with varied organ involvement were retrospectively analy sed and characterised with respect to each organ. Post-treatment imaging respo nse in these after a month of corticosteroid therapy was assessed. Results or Findings: Images from 10 patients were retrospectively evalua ted. Multiple patients had abdominal findings with invol vement of the pancreas, biliary tree, genito-urinary system, intra-abdominal vasculature and the bowel in our study. Besides this, we had a couple of pati ents with IgG4-RD presenting with varied lung appearances. A few pati ents with head and neck involvement were also analysed with involvement of salivary glands and lymph nodes, and cervical vasculature and orbital pseudo- tumours were also seen. Post-treatment imaging revealed gradual regression of the inflammation. Conclusion: IgG4-RD is an inflammatory sclerosing disease process. Most patients usually present with simultaneous involvem ent of a few organs or with isolated organ involvement. It shows good response to steroids. Awareness of the imaging spectrum of the same should prevent a w rong diagnosis. Limitations: Some patients were lost to follow-up, and hence pos t-treatment imaging was not available for them.

R. Kr\u00f6ger; Minden/ DE Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of the on line reference system (ORS) STATdx Elsevier (Amsterdam, NL) as a d iagnostic tool regarding the correct diagnosis, the subjective confidence of the radiologists and its influence on the invested time in the diagn osis of rare abdominal tumours. Methods or Background: 101 patients with rare tumour entities or atypic manifestations and histological secured diagnosis w ere retrospectively included. A blinded rereading was performed by three radiologists with different levels of experience (8, 5 and 2 years). First, an ad-hoc diagnosis was made and immediately afterwards a second diagnosis was established with the help of an ORS. Additionally, the subjective confidence of the diagnosis was recorded with a 5-point Likert scale and the used t ime was noted. Results or Findings: The experienced reader (correct diagnosis, CD, 46.5 %), as well as the advanced reader (CD 45.5%) made the correct diagnosis more frequently compared to the less experienced reader (CD 25.7%). A relevant improvement in the correct diagnostic frequency was only achieved by the advanced reader (CD with ORS 57.4%). The experienced reader (CD with ORS 47.5%) and the less experienced reader (CD with ORS 27.7%) showed less benefit. The subjective confidence increased s ignificantly when the ORS was used (3,9 \u00b1 0,9 vs. 3,2 \u00b1 0,9; p < 0,001). The invested time when using the ORS was significantly increased compared to the tim e needed for an ad-hoc diagnosis (3,7 \u00b1 0,001). Conclusion: The effect of the ORS on the correct diagnosis diff ers with the experience of the radiologists, where especially the advanced reader showed an improvement. The used ORS system increased the diagnostic confidence significantly at a significant increased expenditur e of time. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

RPS 1801-10 Single vs. multi-level comparison of visceral fat estimation on abdominal CT T. H. Chan, C. K. Cheng, F. Huang, *V. Vardhanabhut i*; Hong Kong/HK Purpose: CT contains body composition data that can be quant itatively measured and used as imaging biomarkers. Traditionally because of the labour-intensive nature of segmenting visceral abdominal fat, these have been done manually at a single-slice level. With new dee p-learning techniques, automated whole-volume segmentation is now possible. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of single-level es timation of visceral fat estimation to multi-level combinations between L1-L 5 and whole visceral abdominal fat volume as the reference standard. Methods or Background: We retrospectively collected 130 cases from our institutional database who had received whole-body non-contrast CT scans. All scans were manually segmented for visceral fat by a board-certified radiologist. We compared single levels and different combinations of multi-vertebral levels (e.g. L1+L2, L1+L2+L3, etc.), with a total of 31 co mbinations. Whole visceral abdominal fat volume segmented for the abdominal and pelvic region was used as the reference standard. R2 correlation anal ysis was performed. Results or Findings: The R2 correlation ranged from 0.7769 - 0.9534. As expected the highest R2 correlation was achieved us ing all slice levels L1-L5. Using a single-slice level at L3 (generally regarde d as the previous standard) achieved an R2 of 0.9183. Using combined L1+L3+L5 c ould achieve an R2 of 0.9501. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 333 Conclusion: With the advent of deep-learning automated segmentation, it now becomes possible to segment visceral abdominal fat at whole volume. We systematically compared multiple levels combination of visceral fat estimation and showed that multi-level combinations achieved higher correlation, but whether these differences would amount to meaningful clinical significance needs further exploration. Limitations: The clinical significance of these differences needs to be further explored. For example, if there are statistical dif ferences in the prediction of subsequent risk i.e. metabolic syndrome, etc. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the local institution.

MRCP is accurate, non-invasive and safe. The aim of this study was to assess the over-added outcome of the integration of MRCP and PTC in the diagnosis of malignant biliary obstruction. Methods or Background: This study was conducted on 60 patients (36 males and 24 females) with malignant obstructive jaundice . Their ages ranged between 36 and 85 years with a mean age of 59.9 yea rs. All the 60 examined cases in our study were subjected to MRCP and PTC t o detect the diagnosis, the level of obstruction and the degree of obstruct ion. Results or Findings: Both MRCP and PTC were accurate in the detection of the malignant biliary dilatation and the level of obstruction. MRCP provided adequate information in the diagnosis of the malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 86.6%, with low sensitivity, to detect the degre e of obstruction whether complete or partial, 12.5% compared to PTC. MRCP detected other related malignant features in 40% of cases. PTC-related com plications were detected in 12 out of 60 cases (20%). In 11 patients more th an one puncture had to be performed during PTC to delineate the whole biliary system. Conclusion: MRCP is an accurate and non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of malignant obstructive jaundice and the level of biliary obstruction. PTC is accurate in the detection of the level and t he degree of biliary obstruction, but the possibility of complications r eserves PTC for therapeutic procedures. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: An approval of the study was obtained from the Menoufia University Academic and Ethical Committee.

Blouet; Caen/FR RPS 1812-2 Quantitative MRI of the human fetal ganglionic emin ence: neuroradiological insights into a St\u00fcmpflen*\u00b9, C. Mitter\u00b9, E. Schwartz\u00b9, of fetal interneuron migration arising from the ganglionic eminence (GE) may lead to neuropsychiatric and neur odevelopmental disorders. Early detection of alterations of this t ransient brain structure at prenatal stages may improve the MRI phenotyping of neurodevelopmental diseases. This atlas-based fetal MRI study aimed to quantitatively assess longitudinal development of the GE. Methods or Background: In this retrospective IRB-approved singlecentre study, postprocessing was conducted based on semiautomated segmentation of super-resolution fetal brain 1.5T and 3T MR data sets. After assessment of data quality, a longitudinal, quantitative atlas-based analysis of the ganglionic eminence was conducted by several raters. Results or Findings: A total of 112 patients (gestational age 19-39 week s, mean 27.5 GW) without structural brain anomalies, c ardiac defects, fetal growth restriction, and/or poor super-resolution im age quality were included and analysed. In the observed time interval, the volume of the ganglionic eminence ranged from 1,100.25 mm3 to 53.25 mm3 (mean 572.31 mm3, SD 232.01) with average volumes continuously decreasing from 19 to 39 GW. For each gestational day, a volumetric reduction of 3.5 9 mm3 (95% CI 2.45 - 4.73) within the GE was detected. Conclusion: Super-resolution based quantitative MR volumetry al lowed to analyse the continuous decline in size of the GE fr om 19GW onwards - initially documenting a physiological degenerative process in the developing human brain. The first set of reference values of this st ructure was provided, enabling radiologists to objectively quantify GE development using fetal MRI. Limitations: Potential risk of selection bias (exclusion of fetuses with severe comorbidities) was identified as a limitation.

Mitter*, M. P. Brugger, D. Prayer, and cortical interneurons proliferate within the gangli onic eminence (GE), a transient developmental structure located adjacent to the lateral ventricle, which demonstrates a highly anisotropic microstruct ure. We used in utero DTI- based tractography to investigate the 3D morphology and diffusion parameters of the GE in the developing human brain in vivo dur ing the second trimester. Methods or Background: We included non-motion degraded in utero DTI unsedated fetuses tensor sequences were performed using a 1.5T unit. were geometrically co-registered T2-weighted MR seque nces. The GE was anatomically defined using a multiple ROI approach and visualised using a FACT algorithm. Results or Findings: Tractography of the GE allowed the 3D visualisation of anisotropic diffusion within the GE as C-shaped str eamlines, forming thick \"pseudofiber\" tracts along the wall of the lateral ventricle. Pseudofibers showed an anterior-posterior orientation along the body of the lateral ventricle and a superior-inferior orientation in front of the trigo ne. Co-registered T2 weighted sequences confirmed the location of pseudofibers to the cell dense GE compartment. Mean FA and ADC values were established for GE pseudofiber tracts. Conclusion: DTI based tractography can be used to visualise pseudofiber tracts within the GE in living unsedated fetuses in utero as early as 21 GW. Since the anisotropic microstructure of the GE may be related to tangential migration of developing neurons, normal values for GE diffusion parameters in healthy fetuses might be of value in the prenatal diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Limitations: Preselection of cases to ensure minimal fetal motio n was identified as a limitation.

Tavares S-T. oni, of DUS) gated 4D flow MRI of the thoracic aorta in human fetuses at 3T. Methods or Background: 4D flow MRI of the thoracic aorta was performed at 3T in four healthy fetuses and in six fetuses with vascular pathologies (gestational week 30-38). Direct cardiac gating of the fetal heart was performed using an MR-compatible DUS-sensor. Source images (1.8-2.5x1.8- 2.5x2.0-2.5 mm\u00b3) of the thoracic aorta were obtained in parasagittal orientation using compressed sensing and free maternal breathing. Blood flow in the great thoracic vessels was visualised by streamlines. Flo w volumes and velocities were quantified in the ascending aorta, descending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and ductus arteriosus. Results or Findings: DUS-gated 4D flow MRI was successfully performed in 7/10 fetuses. Three data sets of fetuses with cardi ovascular pathologies could not be analysed due to image artefacts caused by fetal movement or maternal breathing. Blood flow in the great thoracic vessels was successfully visualised in the remaining seven fetuses. Streamline-visualis ation revealed narrowing of the aortic isthmus and excluded double aortic arch in one case, respectively. Time-velocity curves based on 4D flow MRI measurements demonstrated typical arterial blood flow patterns with early sys tolic peaks and low-positive diastolic blood velocities. Average blood flow and velocity in descending aorta was 27.7\u00b16.3 cm/s and 8.3\u00b14.5 at using DUS-gating was feasib le and allowed for visualisation and quantification of blood flow in the fetal thoracic aorta. Further prospective studies are warranted to determine the diagnostic value of DUS-gated fetal 4D flow MRI in congenital cardiovascular disease. Limitations: The fact that there was no comparison with fetal echocardiography, as well as the small study population were identified as limitations.

St\u00fcmpflen*\u00b9, studies have shown struc tural brain anomalies in patients suffering from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, potentially resulting in long-lasting behavioural c hanges. This atlas-based fetal MRI study aimed to identify regional effects of pre natal alcohol exposure (PAE) on human fetal brain development. Methods or Background: This IRB approved, prospective single-center study identified pregnant women referred for fetal MRI wi th variable amounts of alcohol intake during gestation using two standardi sed, anonymised questionnaires (TACE and PRAMS). Postprocessing resolution imaging and semiautomated atlas-based se gmentations. After visual inspection, assessment of data quality and manual c orrection, an atlas-based analysis of twelve fetal brain structures was performed. Linear models were applied with an additional factor to account for va rying gestational ages and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjam ini-Hochberg procedure. Results or Findings: After excluding 476 subjects with structural brain anomalies and/or poor super-resolution image qualit y, a total of 24 patients (26 observations) with and 52 age- and gender-matched c ontrols without PAE (gestational age 21-37 weeks, mean 27.4 GW) were included and analysed. In fetuses with PAE the corpus callosum (p<0.001) show ed significantly larger volumes, whereas the periventricular/germinal zone (p=0.001) showed smaller volumes compared to controls. Conclusion: This study systematically documented the selective effects of PAE on regional brain volumes at prenatal stages: besides the reduction of the periventricular zone, an increased regional growth of the corpus callosum was found, indicating a change in the developmental dyn amics of the normal trajectory of interhemispheric connectivity - even with minor prenatal alcohol exposure (1-3 standardised drinks/week). Limitations: The potential risk of selection bias (exclusion of fetuses with severe comorbidities) and reporting bias (underreporting of alcohol consumption) were identified as limitations. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee (EK-Nr.2199/2017).

M. Limbad*, B. K. Kapadia, C. Mehta; Vadodara/I N (Kajalsradiology@gmail.com) Purpose: To generate normal reference data for anterior and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity and resistance index in preterm and term neonates as a baseline. Grey-scale ultrasound for brain pare nchyma is non-invasive, portable, inexpensive, and gives real time assessments. However, many cerebral lesions are circulatory in origin so it is important to study Doppler, which provides the ideal tool for diagnosis, follow -up and management of brain damage caused by perinatal asphyxia, infection, dev elopmental and cerebrovascular disorders. Methods or Background: An observational study of transfontanelle and transtemporal pulsed wave Doppler of 715 neonates b orn at gestational age 27-42 weeks within 72 hours of life. Parameters mea sured were peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), average maximum and mean velocities (TAMAX & TAMEAN), pulsatility index (PI) and resistive index (RI) in anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Results or Findings: The mean PSV, EDV 11.1 and The PI 1.39\u00b10.26, 06 for ACA and 1.35\u00b10.27, 0.68\u00b10.07 for MCA. Conclusion: This is the largest study to establish a normative database for above mentioned indices. CRBV are directly proporti onal to gestational age and birth weight. Higher RI seen in preterm as comp ared to term neonates. No statistically significant differences on Doppler pa rameters in relation to type of delivery, sex and postnatal age. No correlation was observed between Doppler indices and gestation as component velocities all i ncrease with advancing gestation. These data are important for facilitating the correct interpretation of abnormal findings. Limitations: No major limitation was identified. Machine to machine variation in values was seen to a minor degree. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No extra funding was required.

Methods or Background: Neonatal intracranial hypertension is a serious threat to the health of neonates. The diagnosis of the NICH is quite difficult in clinical situation due to the unspecific clinical m anifestations. And the lumbar puncture is an invasive operation. The clinical doc tors and anxious parents are eager to find a noninvasive technology to detect NI CH timely and accurately. A total of 117 neonates who were suspicious of intrac ranial lesions were Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 335 included. We utilised the quantitative MRI to obtai n the volumetric data . The nomogram was constructed by incorporating the volum etric data and clinical features by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibrati on curve, and decision curve. Results or Findings: The clinical and volumetric quantitative MRI featur es, including postmenstrual age, weight, mode of delivery and the gray matter volume, were significantly associated with neonatal intracranial hypertension risk. The nomogram showed satisfactory discriminati on with an AUC of 0.76. Favourable clinical utility was observed using deci sion curve analysis. Conclusion: The nomogram, incorporating the clinical and volumetric quantitative MRI features, provided an individualis ed prediction of neonatal intracranial hypertension risk and helped decision making and guidance of early diagnosis and treatment for neonatal intracranial hypertension. Limitations: First, our sample size was relatively small and had a limited portion of non-ICH group. Second, our model was not externally validated yet due to the limited dataset.

Gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) signal-to-noise were calcul ated. Two radiologists independently determined the image quality using 5- point Likert-type scale: the GM-WM differentiation (GWMA), the subcalvarial spac the beam hardening artifacts in posterior fossa (PFAA) and t he overall diagnostic quality. Student's t-test, ANOVA and Wilcoxon test were used to determine statistical significance. Intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC) was used to assess the interrater agreement. Results or Findings: Compared with CI, significant superior CNR and nois e of GM and WM were observed in VMIs at all 40-100 KeV l evels (all P<0.001). The SAI and PFAI were lowest in VMI at 100 KeV. Bes ides, statistical difference was detected for PFAI compared to CI (P< 0.001). In subjective ratings, the observers reported optimal GWMA at 50- 55 KeV, optimal SAA and PFAA at 100 KeV, best assessment of overall diagnos tic quality at 55 KeV, all of which were significantly better compared with CI (all P<0.001). Good ICC was observed between two radiologists (overall ICC: 0.764). Conclusion: VMI scan significantly improves image quality of pediatric cerebral scan compared with CI. The optimal energy- level for the supratentorial brain was 55 KeV, for subcalvarial space and posterior fossa 100 keV.

The main goal is to find the cause of everlasting gadolinium (Gd) persistence in CSF of paediatric cancer survivors after GBCA. Methods or Background: Study group: paediatric underwent 47 paediatric patients wit h haematological malignancies, never exposed to the GBCA, underwent lumbar puncture. CSF samples of both groups were analysed for gadolinium , iron and ferritin concentration. In vitro siderotic and control human oligodendrocyte (HOG) cell line models were developed and cultured with calcei n-labelled Dotarem. Intracellular amount of Gd and iron in both cell li nes was performed by ICP- Mass Spectrometry. Single-cell uptake of Dotarem wa s performed confocal microscopy. Results or Findings: The mean number of Gd-enhanced MRI was 1.8 (1 - 8). The mean interval between the last MRI and lumbar puncture was 2.8 (0.3 - 12) years. Mean (\u00b1 SD) CSF Gd concentration was 0.065 (0.199) g/L. We detected 0.001 g/L Gd concentration in the CSF of the patients who had undergone a single Gd-enhanced MRI 12 years before the lumbar puncture. We found differences (p<0.05) comparing CSF Gd conc entration in low, moderate and severe systemic siderosis. We confirmed that Gd deposition in glia increased in iron overload. We documented transmembrane passage of gadolinium in two glial cells lines, with and without iron overload. Conclusion: Neurodegenerative diseases have been increasingly diagnosed in paediatric patients in recent years. Gd brain st orage along with other metals such as iron could accelerate the onset of degenerative symptoms.

Ahrens, P-C. studies exist for MRI evaulation of the dimensi ons of the optic nerve (OND) in children and adolescents. Published reference values are only comparable to a limited extent. The aim of this study was to use routine MRI for the estimation of OND and to establish a simple measurement protocol. Methods or Background: Routine skull MRI at 1.5 T and 3.0 T of 164 childre n and adolescents (88m, 76f) aged 0-18 years (median 8.3 years) were evaluated retrospectively. OND in sagittal and axial orientation was determined 3 and 10 mm posterior to the lamina cribrosa sclerae (measuring points I and II) and immediately before entering the optic chias m (measuring point III). Evaluation was performed without optic nerve sheath. For statistical analysis of the measured values, the patients were divided into five age groups. Results or Findings: Evaluating the influence of various variables (hemisphere, gender, orientation level, field strength), individual statistically significant differences were found. The reference v alues were only given for measuring point I and amounted to 1.9-2.8 mm in the sagittal orientation plane and 1.5-3.1 mm in the axial plane. It could be show n that OND increases with age, with most of the growth being completed by the age of six. Conclusion: The collected reference data were comparable with e xisting studies. So, the OND can be measured in children us ing a routine MRI. For exact measurements, thin-slice 3D T2-weighted MRI w ith isovoxels would have to be carried out. Limitations: MRI was performed at both 1.5 and 3 T. Despite stro ng exclusion criteria, no typical normal collective was recorded.

Moya; Guadalajara/MX (so_sarmx@hotmail.com) Purpose: We collaborate with AI experts to design together t wo deep learning architectures (models) to classify the mammography projections in terms of left or right (L/R) and Craniocaudal and Mediolateral oblique considering the most important anatomical regions and compare it with the model feature maps. Methods or Background: We use the Curated Breast Imaging Subset (CBIS) to train, validate and test in the mini-MIAS databa se. Our work is totally reproducible due to the fact that we use open data sources, and we provide all the labels and code. Results or Findings: ProjectionNet, devoted to classify between CC and M LO projections, archives a test accuracy of 99.5 and A UC of 0.999 in comparison to MobileNet with 97.7 and AUC of 0.997. LRNet, cap able of classifying the left and right breast in the MLO projection, obtained a test accuracy of 98.8 and AUC 0.999. whereas a MobileNet gets an accuracy of 79.8 and AUC of 0.80. The saliency-maps show that the proposed CNNs highl ight the anatomical regions of the breast (pectoral muscle, nipple, edg es and perimeter). In contrast, the MobileNet map focuses mainly in broad areas with empty space. For the segmentation model we present preliminary r esults in a test set where it is possible to see how is removed the non-relevant features of the image. Conclusion: By preparing the mammography screening images for t he AI, we address a fundamental step to allow the classificat ion by breast area segmentation and the classification as CC/MLO and L/R projections. Limitations: This study is limited by the lack of access to more mammography data from unlabelled projections and more diverse s ources. Ethics committee approval: We have followed most of the applicable recommendations of prediction model study Risk of B ias Assesment Tool (PROBAST) to make explainable and responsible AI. Funding for this study: Funding was received from the Jalisco Goverment.

L. artificial intelligence ( AI) based triaging strategy in breast cancer screening as compared to independent double reading with consensus. Methods or Background: A consecutive cohort of 37674 digital mammography screening exams (including 210 screen-detected, 45 interval, and 110 next-round screen-detected (NRSD) cancers) were retrospectively collected from a German screening site. An AI system (Transpara, ScreenPoint Medical) computed a cancer risk score (from 1 to 10) for each exam. Double reading of all exams was compared with an autonomous AI triaging strategy; no human reading is performed for the least suspici ous exams classified by AI (score 1-6), only exams with score 7-10 are double read, and the top 1% most suspicious exams as classified by AI are automatically recalled. Cancer detection rate (CDR), recall rate (RR), and consens us workload were evaluated. Results or Findings: Double reading of all exams resulted in a CDR of 5.6/1000, RR of 4.4% (1655/37674), and consensus wo rkload of 4255 exams. A total of 27562 exams (73.2%), including 5 screen- detected cancers and 636 false-positive recalls, had an AI score of 1-6. AI found 5 additional cancers (2 interval cancers and 3 NRSD cancers) and 173 additi onal false-positive recalls in the 1% most suspicious exams. Autonomous AI tria ging resulted in a similar CDR (5.6/1000), 28.0% lower RR (down to 3.2%), and 45.1% reduction of consensus workload compared to standard double reading. Conclusion: Not reading exams with AI score 1-6 can reduce radi ologists' RR and workload in screening at the cost of missing some screen-detected cancers. However, recalling the top 1% might compensate this loss in CDR. AI- assisted double reading of all exams can likely low er the RR and increase the CDR, but prospective studies should confirm this.

Meetescu*, M. S. erbnescu, L. M. Florescu, G. T. Streba, I. Gheonea; Craiova/RO (raluca.meetescu@gmail.com) Purpose: The objective of the study was, using deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques, to determine if the pathol ogy depicted on a mammogram is either benign or malignant. A total of 559 patients underwent breast ultrasound, mammography, and ultrasound-guid ed breast biopsy. The patients were divided into three categories: benign, ductal carcinomas, and non-ductal carcinomas, based on the histopathologic al results. Methods or Background: Using only the craniocaudal view of the mammograms, we performed pre-processing and segment ation algorithms. An algorithm was used to remove the areola and the adj acent skin, given the large variability of the tissue. Therefore, patients with breast lesions close to the skin were removed from the study. The remaining breast i mage was resized on the Y axis to a square image and then resized to 512 \u00d7 512 pixels. To identify the lesion, a variable square of 322,622 pixels was searched inside every image. No information was lost during each image rotation. For data augmentation, each image was rotated 360 times and a crop of 227 \u00d7 227 pixels was saved, resulting in a total of 201,240 images. The images were cropped at this size because the deep learning algorithm transfer learni ng used from AlexNet network has an input image size of 227 \u00d7 227. Results or Findings: On 100 runs of the algorithm, the mean accuracy the results on mammograms in the craniocaudal view, the proposed solution can be used as a non-invasive and highly precise computer-aided system based on deep learning that c an classify breast lesions based on changes identified. Limitations: Patients with recent trauma and lesions next to the areola were not included in the study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: Our study received no funding.

Supervised Machi ne learning (SML) algorithms can be applied to understand trends from the frequency spectrum collected through MammoWave in response to stimulus , allowing automatic recognition of breasts without lesion, benign, and malignant lesions. The performance is determined by statistically measured detection rates. Methods or Background: The study comprises 327 breasts (from 180 patients) collected in Toledo Hospital, Spain, in t he context of a multicentric international clinical trial (enrollment just ended). All breasts have their own correspondent output of radiologist study review (i .e. gold standard), obtained from echography and/or mammography and/or MRI, plus radiological/histological follow up where required. MammoWave examinations are performed measuring complex S21 in multi-bistat ic fashion where magnitudes reveal diverse patterns when reflected f rom tissues without lesion, benign, and malignant lesions. SML has been applied to train the model and recognise different breast patterns. Results or Findings: According to radiologist study review, 247 breasts without lesions and 80 breasts with lesions underwent MammoWave examination. Radiological/histological follow up confirmed that 21 were benign lesions and 59 malignant lesions. The proposed SML model achieved a no lesion detection-rate of 69%, a Conclusion: The proposed SML from MammoWave data can discriminate breasts without lesion, benign, and malignant lesio ns at a high rate. Limitations: We didn't consider patients' pre-menstrual informat ion. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Toledo Hospital, Spain (7/10/2019).

Bunk*\u00b9, D. We developed and evaluated an AI system's decision referral approach, where very confident algorithmic assessments are performed automatically and more difficult assessments are de ferred to the radiologist. This two-part system incorporates triage of normal exams, while introducing a \"safety net\" to maintain high sensitivity by perfor ming predictions on cancer- positive exams. Methods or Background: A representative screening program data set of a total of N=24,501 full-field mammography exams from biopsy-confirmed, ers (n=2,396), and follow- up proven negatives (n=20,000) from 8 German breast cancer screening units was used to simulate the impact of the decision ref erral approach on screening program-level sensitivity. Images were analysed usi ng a commercial AI system. We computed the program-level change in sensitivity based on a previously validated threshold for cancer detection derived from an operating point of 98% screen-detected cancer sensitivity for normal triaging and 99% specificity for the safety net. Upper and lower bou nds of the change in sensitivity were computed using resampling methods. Absolute reduction in missed cancers and triaging rate was also calculated. Results or Findings: The sensitivity of the simulated screening program was 59.7%. At the selected operating point, sensitivity of the screening programme is improved by 3.9 (2.8-5.2) percentage points. The AI system detected 20.5% of cancers missed by radiologists, while also offer ing automation potential with a triaging rate of 50.7% for each radiologist. Conclusion: By combining triaging with algorithmic detections of highly suspicious lesions that would otherwise have been m issed by radiologists, a decision referral approach demonstrates improvement of sensitivity for the screening program. Limitations: Not applicable Ethics committee approval: Approval by an ethics committee was not necessitated due to the retrospective and fully ano nymised nature of the mammography studies.

In this study, we aimed to implement and evaluate the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automatic detection of BACs. Methods or Background: Four-view mammograms were included in this retrospective study and labelled as BAC positive (B AC+) or BAC negative (BAC-) by 3 readers. The study included 1493 women (169 BAC+), aged 59.1\u00b19.9 years. A 16-layer pre-trained Visual Geome try Group (VGG16) model was modified in its convolutional end to learn high -level features for detecting vascular calcifications, discriminating BAC+ from B AC- images. To account for class imbalance during model training, we randomly undersampled the majority BAC- class in the training set to reach a 30% BAC+ prevalence; the validation and test sets remained intact to reflect the BAC re al prevalence. The training, validation, and test sets consisted of 1552 (365 BA C+), 896 (69 BAC+), and 908 (78 BAC+) images. Accuracy, geometric-mean (G-m ean), and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnostic performance at image- level. Results or Findings: The resulting accuracy, G-mean, and mean AUC were 0.96, 0.95, and 0.98 for the training, for the validation, and 0.92, 0.83, and 0.85 for the test set, respectively . Conclusion: Our model showed promising performances in BAC dete ction, confirmed by an AUC of 0.85 in the testing. A reliable automatic tool for BAC detection could allow large-scale studies on women' s CVD risk stratification leveraging the mammographic screening programme. Limitations: Increased BAC+ prevalence in the training set due t o majority class undersampling was identified as a limitation of this study.

Assess the trainees' perception of AI software for screening mammography. Methods or Background: A pre-test, TF and post-test were created from an AI training dataset. Trainees were randomised into control or intervention groups. The intervention group completed the pre-test, AI-augmented TF, and post-test. The control group completed a pre-test a nd post-test, and was offered the opportunity to complete the AI-augmented TF. For each case, participants were asked to mark the single most sus picious lesion (if any), assign a forced BI-RADS and Level of Suspicion (LOS ) score on a scale of 0 to 100%. Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis was used to compare pre- and post-test performance. Participants were asked to provide feedback via survey. Results or Findings: For the control group (n=9), average pre-test AUC w as .874 and average post-test AUC was .891. For the intervention group (n=9), average pre-test AUC was .848 and average post-test AUC was .910. The AUC difference for the intervention group was .062 (-0.04, 0.17, 95% CI). The AUC difference for the control group was .018 (-0.08, 0.11, 95% CI). Though the difference in delta AUC between the control and intervention groups was not significant, performance in the intervention gr oup improved more than in the control group. 14 out of 18 participants did some or all of the teaching file cases. 93% of participants agreed or strongly agree d with \"The teaching file was a valuable educational tool.\" Conclusion: Reviewing a TF with AI software may improve trainee s' ability to detect malignancy. Trainees felt the AI system serv ed as a valuable educational tool. Limitations: This study's small sample was identified as a limit ation.

A. Magnuska*\u00b9, B. Theek\u00b9, M. \u00b2Baden-Baden/DE (zmagnuska@ukaachen.de) Purpose: The goal of our study was to develop a CAD system f or breast lesion detection and classification based on radiomics signatures (RS). YOLOv3 and Viola-Jones-based lesion detection boxes were evaluated to identify the lesions. Then, RS resulting from detection boxes and manually obtained segments were compared. Methods or Background: The data pool of breast US images (199 malignant and 143 benign cases) was used to prepare eight dif ferent data sets (including pre-processed and spatially augmented images). Viol a-Jones and YOLOv3 algorithms were trained for lesion detection. Three separate RS were obtained using the features extracted from the automatically outlined breast lesion detection boxes and manually delineated segments. T he classification models were established and evaluated concerning the accur acy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). Results or Findings: After training on a dataset including logarithmic derivatives of US images, we found that YOLOv3 obtains better results in breast Interestingly, model trained with RS derived from Y OLOv3 detection boxes achieved higher overall accuracy (89.58%), sensitiv ity (90.00%), specificity (88.89%), and AUROC (0.90) segments (80.00%; 83.33%; 75.00%; 0.87). Conclusion: Deriving RS from the detection box is a promising t echnique for building a breast lesion classification model, whic h might reduce the need for lesion segmentation in the future design of CAD sys tems.

Sampangi*, A. Singh, V. Bhat, A. Sigamani; Bang alore/IN (dr_sudhakar79@yahoo.com) Purpose: Machine learning (AI) over mammography has shown to enhance the accuracy of interpretation and reduce diagnosic errors. In this study, we evaluate a new technique called Thermalytix that us es machine learning over thermal images. If Thermalytix is found to be non-i nferior to standard screening methods, a new affordable, accessible, radiation-fr ee screening test would be available for the developing world to address the i ssue of low survival rates. Methods or Background: A prospective two-centre study of Thermalytix was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of Thermalyti x for detecting malignant breasts. Subjects with possible symptoms of breast cancer took a Thermalytix test before standard imaging tests. Radiologist rep orts of mammography and breast ultrasound were blinded and compared with auto-generated Thermalytix AI scores. An ROC curve for Thermalytix was obtained for different cut-off points on Thermalytix scores. An operating point was determined for 10% non- inferiority margin. Results or Findings: 258 symptomatic women were enrolled. 63 women (24.4%) were diagnosed with malignant breast cancer on histopathology. The AUROC of Thermalytix was 0.845. At Youden's sensitivity of 82.5% (95% CI, 73.2 to 91.9) and specificity CI, 75.0 to Diagnostic of 92% (95% 80.7 to 97.8) and a specificity of 45.9% (95% CI, 34.3 t o 57.9) when BI-RADS 3 was considered test-positive. For women under 45 years, Thermalytix sensitivity was 87.0% and specificity was 80.6%. Conclusion: Thermalytix was found to be 10% non-inferior in se nsitivity to mammography. It also showed good performance on wom en younger than 45 years. Limitations: Only symptomatic population was included in the stu dy, as Clinical Breast Examination is the standard populat ion screening method in LMICs.

Verboom*\u00b9, segmentation of digital mammograms (DMs) into background, breast, and pectoral muscle that is applicable to cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) projections and can generalise across varied models of different vendors. Methods or Background: Two data sets were used: 247 diagnostic DM exams and 253 screening DM exams, totalling 1000 CC and 1000 MLO processed images, of which 379 (37.9%) and 985 (98. 5%) contained a pectoral muscle respectively. The images were acquired with 6 different DM system models from three vendors: Siemens (13%), GE (36%), and Hologic (51%). The multi-class segmentation was done by a U-Net tr ained with a subset of 600 mammograms and a multi-class weighted focal los s. Several types of data augmentation were used during training, to generali se across model types, including a random look-up table, random elastic and gamma transformations. The model was tested on a subset of 244 processed m ammograms. Results or Findings: Segmentation of the test set resulted in dice scores of (mean \u00b1 and pectoral muscle, respectively. The pect oral muscle segmentation resulted in a higher dice score for MLO views (0.952 \u00b1 0.072) than for CC views (0.597 \u00b1 0.337). Among different model types, the mean overall DICE scores ranged from 0.987 to 0.995 for the different system models. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 339 Conclusion: The developed method yielded accurate overall segme ntation results independent of view and was able to general ise well over mammograms acquired by different models. Segmentati on of the pectoral muscle in cranio-caudal views requires further opti misation. Limitations: The segmentation method is based on mammograms from a single population.

Lucey; Galway/IE RPS 1809-2 Does ramping power protocol reduce complications in patients treated with image-guided microwave ablation for renal tumours? produc e subcapsular haematomas as a possible complication, due to the i ncrease of intra-organ pressure. A progressive power increase could reduce the intra-organ pressure during MWA, and thus the number of subcapsular haem atomas. The purpose of this study was to compare subcapsular haematoma rate and outcome of patients with renal tumour treated with MWA using r amping power technique with patients treated with standard fixed power pro tocol MWA. Methods or Background: 167 patients (181 procedures) were included in the study: group 1 (82 patients/ 88 procedures) underwe nt ramping power MWA, starting at 30/40W and gradually increasing power t o the desired maximum value, while group 2 (85 patients/93 procedures) un derwent standard MWA with a fixed power value. All patients underwent co ntrast-enhanced CT immediately after the ablation and 24h later, to id entify immediate complications and results of the ablation. Results or Findings: Subcapsular haematoma occurred in a significantly lower number of procedures in group 1 compared to group 2 (1/88 (1.1%) vs 8/93 (8.6%), p=0.038). No significant differences w ere found in the number of overall complications (9/88 (10.2%) in group 1 vs 16/93 (17.2%), group 1 and in (91,4% ) in group 2 (p=0. 915). Conclusion: A lower incidence of subcapsular haematomas in kidney tumours treated with MWA can be obtained using ramping prot ocol instead of standard MWA, maintaining a similar efficacy. Limitations: Limiting factors in this study were retrospective e valuation, pathological heterogeneities in renal tumours not having been considered as well as the choice of the ramping protocol being em pirical and subjective.

Haghighi; Tehran/IR (mahdavi0ali@yahoo.com) Purpose: Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) is a rare condit ion that usually develops in a surgical scar resulting from a Caesar ean section. Its treatment options consist of the excision of the lesion and/o r hormonal therapies, although wide surgical excision is the treatment of choice in the literature. Here we review a case series of abdominal wall endometri osis treated with radio- frequency ablation (RFA) under ultrasound guidance. Methods or Background: 8 patients were included in this study, all of them presenting with palpable mass(es) in the abdominal wall close to a cesarean scar. The patients underwent full diagnostic workup including ultrasound and MRI. Written informed consents were obtained. Befor e RFA, the patient's pain level was assessed using a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment. RFA was performed under general anaesth esia with Neuro N50 generator with 500KHZ up to 99\u00b0C temperature for a maximum of 10 minutes. The patients' pain level was assessed one week, one month and 4 months after the procedure. Results or Findings: Before the procedure mean VAS was 8.2. One week after the procedure, this was reduced to 2.3, after one month to 1.5 and after 4 months to 1.2. Four patients reported no pain after one month (VAS=0). No major complications was observed except for moderat e erythema at RFA site resolving after one week. Conclusion: Medical management of AWE often results in temporar y relief. Wide surgical excision may create a defect in the abdominal wall and may increase the risk of hernia formation. RFA is used in many solid and superficial organs such as the thyroid. However, there are no s tudies in the literature on the role of RFA in the treatment of pain related to endometriosis. Here we suggest that RFA could be considered as an alternat ive treatment for AWE. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Only 15-20% of them are qualified for pancreatoduodenectomy. Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) of pancreas is an increasingly used method for unresectable pancreati c cancer that can be used in cytoreduction followed by surgical treatment and shows promising results in palliative care. It is claimed that IRE is not caus ing thermal effect comparing to radiofrequency and microwave ablation. Early assess ment of signal intensity changes after IRE could provide information on actu al processes occurring in the ablation zone. Methods or Background: So far, we have retrospectively analysed the MRI studies of 26 patients (10 F, 16 M, aged 35-71) wit h unresectable pancreatic cancer, performed on 1,5T and 3T scanners one day b efore IRE procedure and up to 7 days after. The standard protocol for pancreas was performed including subtraction series. The qualitative and q uantitive assessment of obtained images was performed. Results or Findings: The signal intensity in the ablated zone on T1 FatS at images after contrast media administration with subtraction was in the range 0- 36. The ADC values after IRE were significantly higher compared to pre-IRE measurements. The signs of thermal effect, e.g. are as of needles placement, were found in 76% of patients. Conclusion: Results of this study could facilitate the interpretation of MRI studies after IRE. Lower SI values in the ablated z one on T1 FAT SAT CM images with subtraction could be linked with a bett er completeness of the procedure. The growth of ADC values after IRE is as sociated with water displacement to intercellular space what is a sign of procedure success. Limitations: The small group of patients and the fact that exami nations were performed on different scanners were identified as limiting factors.

W. Johnston*, C. Messiou, M. Smith, D. Strauss, A. Hayes, C. Benson, S. Gennatas, R. Jones, N. Fotiadis; London/UK Purpose: A prospective phase 2 trial has shown that image guided cryoablation is effective and safe in pre-treated D esmoid tumours. However, imaging appearances following treatment can be complex and the optimal method to evaluate response remains to be defined. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of 10 patients with symptomatic progressive disease undergoing cryoablation procedures. Quantitative imaging metrics were derived from T2 w eighted STIR images, before and after treatment: i) normalised T2 weighted signal intensity (T2nSI), ii) long axis diameter (LAD) iii) segmented tumour volumes at baseline iv) volume estimation using the prolate ellipsoid formula (length x width x height x 0.52) at all timepoints (PEV). Response was interpr eted for LAD and PEV using RECIST 1.1. Symptomatic response to treatment was evaluated at clinical follow-up, and percentage agreement with both objective metrics (LAD and PEV) calculated. Results or Findings: PEV showed near perfect correlation with full segmented tumour volume (Spearman's r 0.99, p<0.0001). Best objective response based upon post-treatment scans (median 15, IQR 7 - 23 months) was as follows: LAD: 6 stable disease (SD), 1 CR (complete response), 1 partial response (PR) 2 PD (progressive disease). Objective response rate (ORR) = 2/10, 30% agreement with symptomatic ORR = 7/10, 80% agreement with symptomatic response. Chan ges in signal intensity were unpredictable, with no statistically significant differences between baseline MRI, 6-month follow-up MRI, and most recent MRI (median 255, IQR 157 - 575) days. Conclusion: Our study suggests volumetric assessment of Desmoid tumours following cryoablation is more concordant with clinical outcome than single long axis measurement and can be estimated without labour intensive segmentation.

Our aim is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MRgHIFU treatment in bone metastases located in close proximity (< 1 cm) of s ensitive structures. Methods or Background: 88 patients (45.8% female, 54.2% male; mean age 58\u00b111.6) with 107 bone metastases were treated. Close proximity between lesion and sensitive structures was established on pre-treatment MR exams. VAS score at baseline, 3 and 6 months after treatment was assessed in all patients. MR/CT imaging was performed before and 3- 6 months after treatment. Primary endpoint was to assess major and minor complications involving sensitive structures. Secondary endpoints were assessment of treatment response, tumour control and impact of the proximity of sensitive structures on treatment efficacy. Results or Findings: 107 metastases were treated with MRgHIFU (Primary tumors: 37,3% breast, 19% kidney, 10,7% prostate, 3 3% others). Close proximity between lesion and sensitive structures w as recorded for 117 sites (31 tendon/enthesis/ligament, 16 vessels, 48 joints , 3 skin, 19 nerves). No adverse events over grade 2 were documented. VAS at baseline was 5.9\u00b12.7, with a significant reduction at 3 months (2.57\u00b12.5, p<0.0001) and at 6 months (2.82\u00b12.83, p<0.0001). Imaging follow-up at 3 and 6 months was available for 49 patients. Complete response was seen in 11 cases , partial response in 14, stability in 20 and progression in 4. Proximity to sensitive structures did not affect the efficacy of treatment (p<0.01). Conclusion: MRgHIFU can be safely and effectively performed on lesions located at < 1 cm from sensitive structures, wideni ng the range of applications and allowing currently ineligible patients according to recommendations to benefit from this treatment. Limitations: Partial drop-out in follow-up was identified as a l imitation.

Methods or Background: Between 2009 and 2020, we enrolled 85 cancer patients (mean age 60 years) with bone metastases. 43 patients had lesions at the upper limb, 13 at the lower limb, 21 pelvis, an d 8 thorax and vertebrae. The treatment was performed using ECT, through the appl ication of an electric pulse to the tumour mass allowing a local increased bleomycin delivery into the cells. Intravenous bolus injection of bleomycin (15 mg/m2) was performed, followed by the application of 8 electric pulses of 1000V/cm between each couple of electrodes (8 minutes after the end of dr ug injection) generated by Cliniporator VITAE (Igea S.p.A., Carpi, Italy) usin g dedicated electrodes. The procedures were performed under CT or fluoroscopic guidance. Results or Findings: 73 patients received a single course of ECT, 9 pati ents 2, 2 patients 3, and 1 patient 4. All the evaluable patients reported a decrease in pain from 30% to 100% (average 57% of pain relief) after the local treatment with ECT. 76% of evaluable patients reported a pain reduction of more than 50% after ECT treatment. No general complications r elated to the treatment were encountered. Local complications to treatment have been observed in two cases: skin necrosis. Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that the ECT approach is feasible and safe in patients with bone metastatic lesions. Pati ents reported radiology response and an improvement in usual activities and overall health. Limitations: The observational nature of the study with the lack of a control group was identified as a limiting factor.

Wacker, B. C. Meyer; Hannover/DE Purpose: Evaluation of feasibility and effect of a novel app roach to adrenal venous sampling (AVS) analysis by combining establi shed selective cortisol and aldosterone indices with the acquisition of a c ollimated C-arm CT (CACT_Coll). Methods or Background: Overall, 107 consecutive patients (62m; 54\u00b110 years) undergoing 111 AVS procedures without hormon al stimulation from July 2013 to February 2020 in a single institution were retrospectively analysed. Hormone levels were sequentially measured in suspec ted adrenal veins and right iliac vein, and selectivity indices (SI) comp uted. Successful AVS procedures were defined by stand-alone SI_Cortisol and/or SI_Aldosterone 2.0 as well as SI_Cortisol and/or SI_Aldosterone 1.1 combined with a positive right-sided the adrenals (n=80; opacified right adrenal Saturday Programme A B 341 vein). Radiation exposure of CACT was measured via dose area product (DAP) and compared to an age-/weight-matched cohort (n=66). Results or Findings: Preliminary success rates (SI_Cortisol and/or SI_Aldosterone 2.0) amounted to 99.1% (left) and 72.1% (right). T hese could be significantly increased to a 90.1% success rate on the right, by combining an adjusted SI of 1.1 with a positive CACT_Coll, pr oving the correct sampling position. Sensitivity for stand-alone CA CT (CACT_Coll) was 0.93, selective by vein enhancement. Mean DAP_Coll_CACT measured 2414 \u00b1 958 Gyxm2, while mean DAP_Full-FOV_CACT (p<0.001). Conclusion: AVS procedures is feasible and l eads to a significant increase in success rates of (right-sided) selective cannulation and may in combination with adapted hormone indices, of fer a successful alternative to previously published AVS analysis al gorithms with lower radiation exposure compared to a full-FOV CACT. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study and the evalu ation of a singular procedure in one individual centre were identified as limitations. A larger population combined with a multi-centric approach, prospective study design and correlation with post-surgical results s hould be considered.

Methods or Background: Six microwave ablations were performed in ex vivo porcine lungs using a single 17-gauge antenna for 5 minutes at 65W under CBCT guidance. Ablation zone growth was monitored at 1-minute-intervals using CBCT. An immediate post-procedure CBCT scan w as obtained after the probe was removed. Images acquired during the ablat ions with the probe-in- place were reconstructed using a MAR algorithm (MAR image). The unprocessed images (non-MAR image) were compared to MAR images using a subjective image quality assessment scale from 1 (severe artifact, no ablation zone visible) to 4 (minimal artifact, ablation zone clearly visible) and by comparing image noise and signal to noise ratio (SN R) in several regions around the ablation probe. Results or Findings: Mean image quality score of MAR images (mean scores from 1st to 5th minute: 1.04\u00b10.58 - 3.08\u00b10.72) was significantly higher than the mean image quality score of non-MAR images (mean sc ores from 1st to 5th minute: 3.54\u00b10.72 - 3.75\u00b10.61, p<0.001 for each). T he quantitative analysis demonstrated significant image noise reduction at either side of the ablation probe (p<0.001 and p=0.002) and at the tip of the n eedle (p<0.001) at MAR images. SNR of the MAR images was significantly hig her than the SNR of non- MAR images (p<0.001 - p=0.002). Conclusion: A metal artifact reduction algorithm improved image noise and SNR around the ablation probe and subjectively impr oved image quality during CBCT guided pulmonary microwave ablation in an ex v ivo porcine model.

Author Disclosures: Sebastian Sch\u00e4fer: Long-term outcomes in percutaneous cryoablation of tumours in of this study was to evaluate the impac t of percutaneous cryoablation of tumours in Patients wi th solitary kidney in terms of renal function, treatment-related complications, and oncological outcomes. Methods or Background: We have performed, as Italian groups, a multicentre retrospective study on patients with solitary kidney affected by renal cancer. From December 2009 to June 2018, all Patients under went percutaneous renal cryoablation. Their characteristics regarding age, tumour's size, PADUA score and presence of recurrence were collected. Serum cr eatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) wer e measured before and after treatment for the evaluation of renal functio n. Results or Findings: Thirty-two Patients Patients, mean age 70 years (range, 62-80 years), with 32 tumours (mean maximum diameter, 2.7 cm; range, 1.7- 4.5 cm) were treated with percutaneous cryoablation procedures with a mean follow-up period of 20 months (range, 12-84 months) . There was no significant change in creatinine pre- and post-ablation. None of the patients needed dialysis. One grade 3 or greater complications (Clavien-Dindo score) occurred after the 32 procedures (4% complication rate). The median hospital stay was 1.8 days (range, 1-3 days). The local tumour control rate was 89%, patients with tumours smaller than 4 cm had a lower probabil ity of recurrence (p=0.01). Conclusion: Percutaneous cryoablation is effective and safe in the management of renal tumours in patients with a soli tary kidney. This technique showed a low morbidity rate with preservation of renal function and good local oncological control. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study was identifie d as a limitation.

Methods or Background: 113 CT-guided bone biopsies performed in cancer patients by an interventional radiologist in one institution were retrospectively included. Routine blood parameters and tumour marker levels were recorded. In addition to the non-contrast (NC) biopsy CTs (11 3), contrast-enhanced (CE)- CTs (48) and PET/CTs (47) performed within four weeks of biopsy were reviewed; lesion location, diameter, lesion-to-cort ex distance and NC-CT appearance (dense sclerosis, ground-glass, normal b one, mixed or lytic) were recorded. Mean NC-CT, CE-CT HU and PET SUVmax were derived from biopsy tract and lesion segmentations. Needle diameter, tract length and number of samples were noted. Comparisons between t umour- positive/negative and next-generation sequencing (N GS)-feasible/non-feasible biopsies determined significant (p<0.05) laboratory , imaging and procedural parameter differences. Results or Findings: 76% of biopsies were tumour-positive. NGS was feasi ble in 28/42 cases (67%). Neither laboratory blood parameters, nor size, location or lesion-to-cortex distance affected biopsy succes s p<0.025). NC-CT lesion HU was significantly lower in positive biopsies (p=0.017). A 528 HU cut-off yielded 86% PP V. Biopsy tract HU and and measurements were not assoc iated biopsy success (each p>0.068). Needle diameter, tract length and n umber of samples were non-significant factors (each p>0.107).

Aznar M\u00e9ndez; Sevilla/ES Purpose: the contrast-enhanced mammography (CESM) features of calcifications with suspicious morphology in comparison with the final diagnosis. Methods or Background: Patients with suspicious breast calcifications evaluated by image-guided biopsy who had undergone CESM imaging were retrospectively selected from the institutional breast cancer database. Morphologic features and enhancement characteristic s on CESM were analysed according to the MRI BI-RADS lexicon by tw o radiologists in consensus. The findings were correlated with the fi nal diagnosis in the subsequent histopathologic examination. The statist ical significance was assessed with the chi-square test (p 0.05). Results or Findings: 127 women were included. Pathology showed 41 benign and 86 malignant lesions, of which 44 were ductal c arcinomas in situ (DCIS), 8 invasive ductal carcinoma and 34 mixed invasive and DCIS lesions. In post- contrast recombined images, 14 of 41 benign lesions (34.1%) and 77 of 86 malignant lesions (89.5%) showed contrast enhanceme nt (p < 0.001); 10 of 14 benign lesions showed mild enhancement (71.4%), and 49 of 77 malignant lesions (63.6%) showed moderate/marked enhancement (p = 0.014). Of the 91 lesions who showed enhancement, 73 showed nonmassli ke enhancement (80.2%). The most common enhancement pattern was heterogeneous in both benign and malignant lesions (72.7% and 74.2%, resp ectively) (p = 0.188). Enhancement distribution in the malignant lesions w as most commonly segmental (41.9%), while benign lesions showed a focal, regional and multiple enhancement in equal proportions (27.3%) (p = 0.189 ). Conclusion: CESM combines breast microcalcifi cations in the low-energy mammographic image with contrast enhancement information in the recombined image. The presence of enhancement and the intensity have been associated with the result of malignancy. Limitations: Retrospective design and limited sample size.

Hoxhaj*, M. Drissen, Tumour increased breast cancer (BC) lifetime risk (67-85%) . Moreover, some studies state that between 67-75% of female PHTS carriers develop benign breast lesions (BBL), which might hinder cancer detection. In this study, we investigated imaging features of breast disease in PHTS women. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 65 PHTS women (aged 18 years) who visited our university medical centre, a national PHTS expert centre, between 2001 and 2021. Breast MRI ex aminations were independently re-read by two radiologists. Results or Findings: In 21/65 (32%) women, 35 different BCs were diagnosed. The median age at diagnosis of the first BC was 40 years [range: 24-59]. At MRI, BCs had malignant features with irr egular shapes and margins, fast initial enhancement, plateau or washout in the delayed phase, and diffusion restriction. Eleven out of 21 (52.4%) wom en who developed BC were also diagnosed with BBL. Overall, 23/65 (35%) women were diagnosed with 89 pathologically-confirmed BBL. At MRI, BBL showed round to oval masses, with circumscribed margins and dark internal septation, slow/medium initial enhancement and persistent/plateau enhancement in t he delayed phase. Conclusion: The high prevalence of BC in our cohort is in line with literature findings. BBL were instead somewhat less frequent t han previously reported in literature but were commonly present in women who also developed BC. We conclude that BBL have a role in hindering BC detec tion. However, since imaging characteristics are typical, a close examin ation of the multiparametric MRI features is essential in order to detect BC ear ly and avoid unnecessary biopsy.

Teixeira*, R. Ribeiro, A. E. A. G. Costa, M. Faustino, J. P. A. Lopes, I. Cerejo, Z. T. d. Seabra; Vila Franca de Xira/PT Purpose: To provide a pictorial review about the development of homolateral axillary lymphadenopathy following covid-19 vaccination, using imaging cases from our institution. To present the main recommendations for its management, especially in the context of breast cancer surveill ance. To highlight the role of the radiologist in its diagnosis and follow-up. Methods or Background: With the unprecedented range of covid-19 vaccination, the development of ipsilateral axillar y lymphadenopathy has become an increasingly encountered side effect, evi dent over different imaging methods. This represents a challenge for the radiol ogist with an impact on breast imaging due to its ability for mimicking met astatic disease. Results or Findings: Lymphadenopathy imaging findings related to COVID-1 9 vaccination are mostly consistent with a reactive s cenario, with oval morphology, diffuse or focal cortical thickening an d preserved hilum. Seen mainly up to 5 and 6 weeks after vaccination, lymphadenopathy may remain after 10 weeks, with decreased lymph nodes' size an d residual cortical thickening. Nonetheless, the relation may not be so clear. This led the European Society of Breast Imaging to present a lis t of 10 recommendations adjusted to different clinical statuses, including women attending screening programmes and cases with known breast cancer or hi story of breast cancer. The key points consist in obtaining vaccination dat a, and scheduling breast examinations, if possible, before the first dose or at least 12 weeks after the last dose of the vaccine. Conclusion: As the vaccination campaign proceeds, COVID-19 vacc ine- induced lymphadenopathy will continue to be a reali ty. This reinforces the radiologist's role for the proper schedule of imagi ng exams and its correct interpretation, providing adequate follow-up if nec essary, as the goal is to reduce unnecessary anxiety, additional imaging and invasive procedures while maintaining the suitable quality of breast cancer s urveillance.

F. Heidenreich, S. Veldhoen; W\u00fcrzburg/DE Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a computer-aided detection system for pulmonary nodules and its depe ndence on radiation dose in paediatric ULDCT. Methods or Background: 382 consecutive ULDCT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Scans with present inflammatory consolida tions were excluded. Two study groups were built from remaining 254 data set s based on the scan protocol applied: with identical tube voltage of 10 0kV, the reference mAs (ref.mAs) was set to 30mAs in 72 patients (m=34; 11 .0\u00b14.8 years) whereas 182 patients (m=108; 11.6\u00b15.1 years) were scanned using 96ref.mAs. Three radiologists assessed the data sets for pulmonary nodules and each nodule was categorised by size (2-3mm;>3mm). Findings were compared to the CAD results and total CAD errors were quantified. Objec tive image noise (OIN) was measured. Radiation dose was estimated using size-s pecific dose estimates (SSDE). Results or Findings: Using the 30ref.mAs setup, radiation dose was significantly lower compared to the 96ref.mAs group (SSDE 0.15\u00b10.09 vs. 0.49\u00b10.19mGy; p<0.001). OIN was significantly higher in all measured regions (p<0.001). Detection rates differed significantly f or pulmonary nodules 2-3mm (0.24 vs. 0.48;p=0.002) and >3mm (0.44 vs. 0.71;p=0.007). False positive findings per scan did not differ significantly (0.33 vs. 0.39;p=0.53). No significant correlation between radiation dose and CAD errors was found. Conclusion: Lowering the parameters for automatic tube current modulation in paediatric ULDCT results in significant dose reduct ion but also in reduced detection rates especially of small pulmonary nodul es, suggesting a dose dependency of evaluated CAD system. However, CAD can assist radiologists as second observer tool even in paediatric ULDCT, especially in detection of nodules >3mm. Limitations: The evaluated CAD system was initially trained on C T scans of adults. Our findings are not to be generalised to t he totality of CAD due to the different work principles.

Dellepiane*\u00b9, M. present the additional value of ASL perfusion in the evaluation of children with new-onset acute neurological symptoms . Methods or Background: Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is a perfusion MRI technique that uses magnetically labelled water mol ecules in blood stream as an endogenous tracer, thereby obviating the use of exogenous tracers such as gadolinium-based contrast media (DSC/DCE-MRI) as well as radiation exposure (SPECT, CTP, PET). These advantages make A SL an attractive technique in children with a host of conditions inc luding brain neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, and epilepsy. ASL also has an increasing role in the initial evaluation of patients with new-onset acute neurological deficit, allowing the neuroradiologist to strongly suggest a specific diagnosis in otherwise doubtful cases. Results or Findings: Increased ASL signal can be found in patients with post- ictal states, often without or with very subtle cha nges on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). During seizures, uncontrolled electr ical activity increases the metabolic demand from the affected brain area, in t urn resulting in increased perfusion. Conversely, post-critical paralysis (i.e. Todd's palsy) presents with diffuse hypoperfusion of the affected hemisphere, r eflecting temporary vasoconstriction. Hemiplegic migraine can present w ith both hyper- and hypoperfusion of the affected hemisphere depending on timing; migraine aura is associated with vasoconstriction and hypoperfusi on, while the subsequent headache is characterised by vasodilatation and hyp erperfusion. In all these conditions, the perfusion abnormality typically res olves on follow-up studies in the next few days. Conclusion: In acute neurological disorders, ASL can be the onl y abnormal sequence in an otherwise unremarkable MRI study, al lowing to suggest a specific diagnosis as well as to monitor evolution. Limitations: ASL is still not widely available. Ethics committee approval: This study is in accordance with the ethical standards of the Giannina Gaslini Institute and the 1964 Helsinki declaration.

Tamasi*, I. Zeccolini; Naples/IT Purpose: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common query in paediatric radiology due to possible associated vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and the high risk for developing long-term sequelae. Current gui delines recommend renal ultrasound as a screening test after febrile urinar y tract infection, with voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) only if the ultrasound is abnormal. Contrast enhanced voiding urosonography (ce-VUS) is an emerg ent technique performed using ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue Bracco) that allows examination of the urinary tract, without radiation. The aim of this study is to validate ce-VUS in the study of vesico-ureteral ref lux in paediatric patients to replace it with the traditional x-ray technique. Methods or Background: The study group consisted of 210 children with history of relapsing UTIs between November 2016 and October 2020: 170 underwent VCUG and 142 contrast-enhanced voiding (c e-VUS) in order to determine the sensitivity, specificity of ce-VUS as well as the number and grading of vesico-ureteral reflux. The imaging prot ocol consisted of an ultrasound exam of the kidneys and bladder in the s upine position before and after the bladder filling with intravescical contrast media and at the end of the urinary phase by performing scan of the ureters. Results or Findings: VCUG revealed the presence of VUR in 148 out of 170 (28%), while ce-VUS allowed the visualisation of VU R in 110 out of 142 children (77%). VURs of low degree (I or II) detect ed by ce-VUS were in majority (33%, 12% respectively) vs VCUG (20%, 14% respectively). Conclusion: Ce-VUS method has got high sensitivity and specific ity in the diagnostics of vesico-ureteral reflux. It can be us ed in the same patients and in the same pathological conditions as the VCUG, but w ithout the use of ionising radiation. Limitations: Not applicable.

Offiah\u00b2; \u00b9Alkha Purpose: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of post-mortem im aging compared to conventional autopsy in identifying the cause of death in children. Methods or Background: Systematic reviews were undertaken to identify relevant English-language articles published in the literature up until July 2021. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies were developed in accordance with the Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) model. Studies reporting the diagnostic accu racy of various imaging modalities, or those in which sufficient data were present to enable this to be calculated, were included. The methodological quali ty of the included studies was analysed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Results or Findings: The initial electronic database search identified 1,915 potentially relevant publications. Out of these, 24 studies were available for qualitative synthesis. The overall mean sensitiviti es and specificities were 72.56 and 84.9 resonance i maging (PMMR), 58.54 Saturday radiography), respectively. In fetuses, stillbirths, and neonates, the mean sensitivity and specificity for microfocus-CT (micro-CT) were 91 and 98.5, respectively. Conclusion: PMCT and PMMR can be supplementary to autopsy or us ed as an alternative option in cases where parents refuse autopsy. Micro-CT provides accurate information on fetuses, stillbirt hs, and neonates, similar to that provided by autopsy. Limitations: The overall sample sizes for the imaging modalities in the available studies differed from one another; the results would have been more accurate if the sample sizes were similar for each imaging modality. Ethics committee approval: The study was registered with the PROSPERO international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews with a health-related outcome (registration number CRD4202 1264098).

The length and width of the thorax and wi dth of the heart were extracted starting from the posterior surface of the sternum to the anterior border of the vertebral bodyn(axial view), from thoracic vertebras coronal MPR images. The same anatomic references were used in the x-ray measurements. Results or Findings: The correlation between the increase in heart width with the increase of the HI value was = 0.4 (p < 0.05) indicating a moderate positive correlation, while the value of chest wall diameter and the increase of the HI had a weak negative correlation ( = -0.01; p > 0.05). The HI mean standard error based on CT images was 0.4 and the v alue based on chest radiographs was 1.4. Sagittal MPR were an asset rel iable for the HI's characterisation and confirmation of measurements m ade in axial views. All the values from the clinical report were validated. Conclusion: There is an advantage of using the CT scan, which p rovides a higher accuracy of measurements, yielding, in addic tion, a greater anatomical detail in the diagnostic of PE deformity aiming cor rectly inform the surgeon. The HI is a good index to assess the PE. Limitations: A retrospective study nulling the choice of protocol parameters. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Review the fetal MRI patterns of the main cerebellar abnormalities. Methods or Background: The cerebellar development is protracted, extending from the fifth week of gestation through the second postnatal year of life. The extended period of development makes the cerebellum vulnerable to a broad range of abnormalities. Prenatal ultrasound ( US) is the first prenatal imaging method for the assessment of cerebellar abnormalities, because it is a safe, non-invasive, and low-cost modality. However, fetal MRI, usually performed after the twentieth week of gestation, has emerged as a widely used secondary technique to evaluate suspected US featur es with a higher accuracy for the detection of posterior fossa abnormalities compared to that of US (87,7% vs 65.4%, respectively). Results or Findings: We describe a fetal MRI protocol, including multiplanar single-shot T2-weighted seque nces, acquired at different echo times, and FFE T1 and T2-weighted sequences. W e review the normal prenatal development of the cerebellum from the twentieth week of gestation. We explain the main cerebellar abnormalities amenable to Vein of Galen), and occipital meningocele. Conclusion: Fetal MRI plays a key role in the evaluation of sus pected US features of cerebellar abnormalities; therefore, fetal radiologists have to be familiar to the fetal MRI appearance of the normal prenatal cerebellum and the most common MRI findings of these diseases to reach the correct diagnosis.

Groen, R. Vliegenthart, G. de Bock; Groningen/NL (caicai597@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim was to determine risk factors for the prese nce of pulmonary nodules in a general Dutch population. Methods or Background: Participants aged 45 years from the Dutch Lifelines cohort who had undergone LDCT were included. Information on socio-demographic, medical history, smoking exposur es and lifestyle factors were obtained from the Lifelines self-reported data. A participant was considered as having pulmonary nodules if at least one noncalcified nodule with a volume 30mm3 was detected. Multivariable logistic regress ion analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for t he presence of pulmonary nodules. Results or Findings: In total, 7458 participants were included. 2926 (39.2%) participants had pulmonary nodules and 42.7% of them were never-smokers. Males accounted for 44.0% of the total population and 1433 (49.0%) had nodules. The median age was 58.18 years (IQR 52.18- 64.39). After adjusting for socio-demographic, medical history, smoking and lifestyle variables, it was found that former-smoker (pack-year <20: OR = 1.34, 1.96), and those having a family history of lung cancer (OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.3 7) had a significantly increased risk for the presence of pulmonary nodules in the general population. Conclusion: In this population-based cohort, 40% had pulmonary nodules. Risk factors were former and current smoking status and having a family history of lung cancer. Limitations: The causality between those factors and the presenc e of pulmonary nodules cannot be established due to the cross-sectional design.

McInnis\u00b9, M. Ang\u00b9, Y. Leung\u00b9, G. Darling\u00b9, of actionable incidental findings (A IFs) during lung cancer screening can contribute positively to patie nt outcomes, but can also lead to additional investigations. To help optimise investigations of AIFs, this study assessed the frequency and type of the most c ommonly reported AIFs from the first-year pilot of the Ontario Lung Screening Program (OLSP). Multidisciplinary input was then used to standardis e criteria to guide follow-up. Methods or Background: OLSP participants received at participating sites. AIF descr iptions and recommended management, as identified by site radiologists, wer e reviewed by a fellowship- trained thoracic radiologist, classified for frequency and anatomic distribution, and correlated with patient characteristics. A mult idisciplinary working group defined criteria for 'actionable' versus 'non-actionable' incidental findings for the seven most frequent AIFs, and provided management r ecommendations. Results or Findings: 1624 LDCTs were performed between June 2017 - May 2018. 534 AIFs were reported in 389 LDCTs. The most frequent AIF was coronary artery calcification (CAC) respectively). AIFs Lung-RADs scores (p<0.0001). Management recommendat ions were most diverse for CAC and ascending aortic dilatation. The seven most frequent AIFs comprised 44% of all AIFs; retrospective applicatio n of working group criteria for 'actionable' findings results in at least 25% f ewer of these AIFs. Conclusion: This work provides pragmatic guidance for the most frequently reported AIFs in lung cancer screening. When applied, criteria may substantively decrease follow-up for findings unlik ely to have clinical significance, and help standardise patient follow-up. Limitations: We did not follow up the outcome of the AIFs, nor t he costs to establish final diagnosis. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Yang; Wuhan/CN Purpose: To explore the feasibility of the attenuation value s of all thoracic vertebrae and the first lumbar vertebra measured by artificial intelligence on non-enhanced chest CT to do osteoporosis screening. Methods or Background: The patients were divided into three groups: normal group, osteopenia group and osteoporosis group acco rding to the results of DXA. And the attenuation values (HU) of all thoraci c and the first vertebrae were measured using artificial intelligence. The co rrelation between attenuation values and BMD values was analysed, and the diagnos tic efficacy of attenuation values on osteopenia or osteoporosis ri sk was further evaluated. Results or Findings: CT values of each thoracic vertebrae and the first lumbar vertebrae presented high predictive ability and diagnostic efficacy for osteopenia or osteoporosis. After clinical data cor rection, with every 10HU increase in CT values, the risk of osteopenia or os teoporosis decreased by 32%~44% and 61%~80%, respectively. And the combined diagnostic efficacy of all thoracic vertebrae was higher than that of a single vertebra. The AUC of recognising osteopenia or osteoporosis from normal group was 0.831and 0.972, respectively. Conclusion: The routine chest CT with AI is of great value in o pportunistic screening for osteopenia or osteoporosis, which can quickly screen the population at high risk of osteoporosis without inc reasing radiation dose, thus reducing the incidence of osteoporotic fracture.

Sun; cially available deep learning-based nodule detection (DLD) system according to the nodule location on chest radiographs (CXRs). Methods or Background: We used a dataset of 300 CXRs (100 normal and 200 abnormal images with 216 nodules). We divided t he intrathoracic region on CXR into two regions: non-danger zone (NDZ) and danger parahilar, paramediast inal, and retrodiaphragmatic areas, where nodules may be miss ed. The abnormal images included 107 NDZ and 109 DZ nodules. Eight ( NTRs), and four residents) interpreted each radiograph with and without the DLD system. The metrics of lesion localisation fraction (LLF; the number of le sion localisations divided by the total number of lesions) were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance according to nodule location. Results or Findings: The DLD system showed a lower LLF for the detection of DZ nodules (64.2%) than that of NDZ nodules (83. The TRs showed similar (D Z, 81.7%; NDZ, 84.6%; p=0.4170). The NTRs and residents showed system, the residents significantly improved from 56.7% to 6 5.6% (p=0.0072) in detecting DZ nodules. Conclusion: The performance of the DLD system was lower in the detection of danger zone nodules. Nonetheless, the deep learning-based nodule detection system can help less experienced observers detect p ulmonary nodules in the danger zone. Limitations: Since our study focused on per-nodule detection acc ording to the location of nodule, per-image specificity was not evaluated.

Johns, S. Matthews, M. Bull , M. Kamil, O. D. Evans, (toli.day@live.com) Purpose: Introduction: pulmonary nodules are common and result in patient anxiety and sizeable healthcare costs. According to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules (2015) using volumetry can reduce follow up imaging as further scans are not required if: nodule volume <80 mm3, nodule volume is stable at 12 months. The aim is to assess potential impact of nodule volumetry vs 2D measurements in a large teaching hospital. Methods or Background: Solid nodules discussed over 6 months at the pulmonary nodule MDT were retrospectively assessed using Enterprise Imaging (AGFA) pulmonary nodule volumetry tool. Vol ume was measured at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months. Cases with incomplet e imaging/ tool error or prior malignancy were excluded. Results or Findings: 61/84 (73%) cases were excluded. Specifically, tool failure accounted for exclusion of 46/61 patients ( 55% of total group); 45 on initial scan and 1 on 12 month scan. 39 cases were successfully measured at baseline, 7 (18%) had volume <80 mm3 and could have been discharged. 23 cases were successfully measured at 12 months, 16 ( 70%) had stable nodule volume and could have been discharged. 7 (30%) cases required further workup, of which the final diagnoses were 5 benign and 2 malignant. One malignant nodule was stable at 12 months but grew a t 24 months. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 346 Conclusion: Volumetric analysis of pulmonary nodules could greatly reduce follow-up requirements. The BTS guidelines failed to capture one malignancy . Limitations: Tool failure was a significant limiting factor. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable - retrospective service evaluation. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

P. Gonchar, Y. Shumskaya, I. Blokhin, M. oscow/RU Purpose: We aimed to assess the effect of COVID-19-associate d pneumonia on liver attenuation with an automated liver attenu ation measurement software in chest CT scans. Methods or Background: Retrospective cohort study. Data from outpatients who underwent two chest CT scans (baseline and foll ow-up) for COVID-19- associated pneumonia from January to July 2020 were analysed. We compared three subgroups per lung damage severity on follow-up scans (0%, <25%, or >25% of the lung volume) with the baseline without pulmonary changes, analysed the correlation between liver att enuation <40HU and increased ALT, AST. Automated liver attenuation measurement with batch processing was performed by an in-house developed s oftware \u00abCTLiverExam\u00bb. Results or Findings: The software successfully analysed 499 patients. Among all subgroups, there was no statistically significant difference between liver densities in baseline and follow-up CT scans. We found an association between liver attenuation at first CT and the lung involvement on a second (95% CI 1.755-6.429; OR 3.359; p<0.001). The odds f or reduced liver attenuation were 2.2 times higher for subgroup #3 v s. subgroup #1 (p=0.026). Association between decreased liver attenuation and elevated ALT, AST levels was significant among all subgroups: 0.243 (p<0.000 1) and 0.205 for liver attenuation may favour the developm ent of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients. Additionall y, automated liver attenuation measurement with batch processing could be used in chest CT. Limitations: There was a strict threshold for reduced liver atte nuation: <40 HU.

Jana, S. Bhalla, A. Kumar ta, V. Hadda; New Delhi/IN (drlokesh.aiims@gmail.com) Purpose: To compare and evaluate the usefulness of MRI Vs CT in bronchiectasis, to evaluate the reproducibility of CT and MRI scores, to compare MRI and CT scores with pulmonary function t ests (PFT), to optimise the MRI protocol in bronchiectasis. Methods or Background: In this prospective study, 25 patients between 7-21 years of age with a clinical/radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis underwent MDCT and MRI chest. MRI and CT scoring was performed using modified Bhalla-Helbich's score by two independent radiologi sts. A final consensus score was recorded both in CT and MRI. The overall image quality of different MRI sequences to identify the pathologies was also assessed. Appropriate statistical tests were used for inter-observer agreements, and correlation amongst CT and MRI; as well as CT, MRI and PFT. Results or Findings: Strong agreement (ICC 0.80-0.95) between CT and MRI was seen for extent and and MRI scores had perfect concordance (ICC 0.978). Statistically significant (p-value <0. 01) intraobserver and interobserver agreement for all CT and MRI score parameters was seen. A strong negative correlation was seen between total CT and MRI severity scores and FEV1, FVC, FEF 25-75%. DWI MR, 1.62 x 10-3 mm3/sec had a sensitivity of 70% and specifici ty of 75% in detecting true mucus plugs. Conclusion: MRI with DWI can be considered in the diagnostic al gorithm for assessment of lung changes in bronchiectasis as a r adiation-free non-invasive method of imaging in children, especially in follow -up. Limitations: The limitation is the small sample size, and non-inclusion of children less than 7 years. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Aiims Ethics committee.

A. Marzogi; Makkah/SA RPS 2002-2 Automated detection and BI-RADS classification of breast masses in digital mammographic views, enhanced by subtracting temporally consecutive mammograms Purpose: Improve the detection and BI-RADS classification of breast masses, by exploiting the subtraction of temporally consecutive mammograms and machine learning. Methods or Background: For this retrospective study, 80 pairs of full-fiel d digital mammograms were collected, with either no or BI-RADS benign masses (normal population) and BI-RADS suspicious masses ( suspicious population), in the most recent mammograms. Pre-processing, image registration and post- processing were applied to effectively subtract the images. The remaining regions were identified as normal tissue or true masses and, subsequently, the true masses were classified as BI-RADS benign or suspicious. For comparison, state-of-the-art temporal analysis was also performed. Results or Findings: Temporal subtraction improved the contrast ratio ~2 times, compared to the most recent mammographic view. The breast masses were detected with 99.9% accuracy (0.98 AUC) and th en classified as BI- RADS benign vs suspicious with 98% accuracy (0.98 A UC), using an artificial neural network. The improvement using temporal subt raction was statistically significant compared to the state-of-the-art tempor al analysis (p<0.05). Conclusion: With further improvements, the proposed algorithm has the potential to substantially contribute to the development of automated computer- aided diagnosis systems, with significant impact on patient prognosis. Limitations: The BI-RADS classification of masses not only varie s from one radiologist to another but might also be disproved by follow-up or pathology. Also, the adoption of the BI-RADS classification as the ground truth, without any confirmation by follow-up or pathology, limits the generalisability of the tool.

Payne*\u00b9, A. Antoniou\u00b9, \u00b2London/UK (np520@cam.ac.uk) Purpose: Dense breast tissue elevates the risk of developing breast cancer and can mask suspicious areas on screening mammograms. Supplemental imaging could result in earlier detection but needs to be targetted to those who will benefit. This interim analysis of the questionnaire and mammographic density data collected in the BRAID (breast screeni ng - risk adapted imaging for density) trial assesses the questionnaire compl etion-rate and the distribution of multifactorial breast cancer risk. Methods or Background: Women aged 50-70 years with dense breast tissue (BIRADS C/D) attending screening at four UK sites w ere invited to join the trial. Following online consent, they were asked to complete an online questionnaire covering their cancer family history and questionna ire-based breast cancer risk factors. Where data were incomplete women were cont acted and asked for the missing information on attendance for supplemental imaging. The questionnaire-based risk factors and mammographic d ensity were used to obtain the risk of developing breast cancer within a five-year period using the CanRisk web-services. Results or Findings: 1,553 questionnaires were completed by women aged between 50 and 70. The multifactorial 5-year breast risks followed a log-normal distribution. 187 [12.1%] participants were found t o be at low risk (<1%), 684 [44.2%] at average risk (1-1.66%), 666 [42.1%] at high risk (1.67-6%), and 9 [0.6%] at very high risk (>6%). Less than 5% of par ticipants contacted the research team with queries when entering data using the self-administered questionnaire. Conclusion: While high breast density alone conveys an elevated risk, multifactorial risk-assessment using CanRisk result s in high levels of risk- stratification and risk-reclassification among women with BIRADS C/D. With finite resources for a population screening program me, supplemental imaging could be targeted to those at increased risk of dev eloping the disease.

Breast density is a well -known risk factor for future development of breast cancer and may be used to str atify women to alternative screening modalities (e.g. breast MRI). Automated s oftware-based density classes are commonly used in mammography, but they correlate poorly with MRI breast density estimations for dense breasts. T o obtain a more homogeneous automatic breast density assessment acr oss modalities it is thus important to match density classes between modaliti es. Methods or Background: 510 patients with a total of 1039 studies were selected from the breast screening database available at our institution based on the availability of paired mammogram and MRI stu dies (max. +/- 1 month in between). Volpara (version 1.5.4) and a deep learni ng-based segmentation solution were used to calculate breast densities fo r mammograms and MRIs respectively. Standard Volpara density grade (VDG) thresholds were applied to mammographic breast densities. From the mammographi c VDG classes distribution, (A = 19.5%, B C= 35.7%, D =2 1.3%) calculated the optimised matching thr esholds for MRI. Results or Findings: Using adjusted for MRI, 74.4% (95% C I: [71.6% - 77.1%]) of studies showed an exact match b etween mammographic and MRI VDG classes (Cohen's weighted CI: [76.1% - 86%]) of corresponding MRI studies showed a perfect VDG class match. Conclusion: Matching of VDG thresholds in MRI facilitates comparing density assessment across modalities. However, approximatel y 20% of cases are rated as less dense on MRI than on mammography. Limitations: The mammographic VDG classes distribution does not reflect a realistic screening distribution. Ethics committee approval: The Ethics Committee of Radboudumc approved the study.

Kang; Seoul/KR Purpose: To evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) ca n improve the missed cancer detection in mammography screening. Methods or Background: A total of 204 consecutive women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2018 and 2020 were included. Mammograms at the time of diagnosis and at the time of preceding scre ening were reviewed by two radiologists and were classified into true negative and false negative (missed cancer and minimal findings) by consensus. Mammograms were also analysed with a deep learning-based AI system. The AI system remarks the site of suspected malignancy with grayscale and assigns an abnormality score. Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to com pare the abnormality score between groups. Results or Findings: Of the 204 cases, 137 were classified as true negat ive and 67 as false negative. Among the false negative cases, 34 were classified as missed cancer and 33 as minimal findings. The AI system accurately detected 27 cases from 34 missed cancers and 18 from 33 minimal findings. The abnormality scores between missed cancer and mi nimal findings detected by AI on the preceding mammograms showed significan t difference (p<0.05; 56 vs 33.8, respectively). Asymmetry was the most c ommon finding among the seven cases which could not be detected by AI in the missed cases (5/7). Conclusion: This retrospective study showed that the AI system correctly identified 13% of missed cancer (27/204) on the preceding screening mammography. The AI system facilitated cancer diagn osis by helping to easily detect missed or minimal findings on screening mamm ography. Limitations: Only a single AI system was used for analysis. The review process of mammograms was highly informed. Therefor e, the number of false negatives might have been exaggerated.

Methods or Background: Data from 260 radiologists, 12 breast physicians, and 207 radiology trainees while interpreting mammographic screening cases were collected. Each reader interpreted one to six test sets, each containing 60 mammographic cases (20 cancer, 40 normal) and provi ded a rating of 1 (confident normal) to 5 (confident abnormal) to eac h case. Using Matrix factorisation technique, a model (M1) was built to predict the rating provided by a reader to a case based on the user's previous int eractions with other cases as well as other user interaction data. The leave-o ne-out cross-validation was used for the assessment and an AUC of the model for predicting the difficult-to- interpret cancer cases for an observer was found. A difficult-to-interpret cancer case was defined as an abnormal case, rated as 2 or less. For comparison, a baseline model (M2), which only considered user (av erage rating from a user to all interpreted cases) and case (average rating provided by all users to a case) bias, was also built. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 348 Results or Findings: The mean AUC of M1 and M2 were 0.87\u00b10.21 and 0.73\u00b10.16, respectively. The paired, two-sided Wilc oxon signed-rank test showed the difference between the two models is sig nificant (p<0.001), demonstrating that our AI-based model can better pr edict the rating given by a reader to an abnormal case compared with the baseli ne model. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence can be used to predict diff icult-to-interpret cases and hence provide educational test sets, cust omised for a learner. Limitations: The study is a retrospective study. A prospective s tudy will be required in the future to investigate how the model should be updated as the user progresses and interacts with the customised educational materials.

A. Nielsen Moody, M. Fletcher; Leeds/UK (Nisha.sharma2@nhs.net) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasi bility of automated image quality assessments in a UK-based s ymptomatic mammography clinic, by comparing the visual assessm ents from a consensus of radiographers with automated AI software results . Methods or Background: This was a retrospective audit of 50 symptomatic mammograms, which included 200 images (100 CC and 100 MLO). Radiographers reviewed image quality criteria based on UK guidelines. The mammograms were processed by densitas\u00ae qualityAI algorithms to assess positioning criteria including pectoralis length d shape; IMF missing; IR placement; posterior tissues missing; and exaggerat ion. Manual and automated assessments were compared using Cohen's k appa for positioning errors with a frequency greater than n>5. Results or Findings: The AI algorithms assessed similar positioning crit eria to the UK image quality review. Agreement was the high est when assessing CC posterior tissue missing (kappa=0.954, 95%CI: 0.756, 1.00) (kappa 0.700, 95%CI: 0.502, 0.898). Agreement for MLO al (IMF missing, kappa=0.711, 95%CI: Conclusion: This study demonstrates that an automated AI softwa re tool may be practical for clinical image quality reviews in the NHS. Further research is required to validate the algorithms using a larger sample of data.

MI m easures local stiffness on the compressed breast surface. MI can be used to di stinguish malignant from benign lesions, thus reducing false positive findin gs. This is a preliminary study of DBTMI repeatability, using a deformable breast p hantom. The phantom contains simulated lesions: solid tumours and cysts . We compared MI values of different findings in phantom images. We investi gated the effect of sensor artifacts due to simultaneous acquisition. Methods or Background: We performed five repeated DBTMI acquisitions of phantom images. DBT images were acquired using a cl inical system and automatic exposure settings. MI data was acquired using a commercially available pressure sensor, placed on the breast sup port during DBT imaging. The sensor was calibrated using a vacuum device. The DBT images were preprocessed to reduce sensor artifacts. We generat ed composite images by overlaying MI data onto reconstructed DBT images, by matching the chest wall and breast outline. Results or Findings: High pressure values (18.0\u00b11.0 kPa for a centrally located solid tumour and 12.3\u00b11.5 kPa for a tumour near the nipple) relative to the background (7.44\u00b10.19 kPa) corresponded to locations of solid tumours in composite images. Simulated cysts did not produce high pressure. Variations in repeated measurements might be caused by the dif ference in the lesion depth. Residual artifacts have not obstructed visibility of lesions in the phantom. Conclusion: We performed preliminary clinical DBTMI acquisitions of a deformable breast phantom. Composite images were pr oduced by combining DBT images with MI data. High pressure corresponded to solid tumours in the phantom. Preliminary collection of patient DBTMI im ages is ongoing.

Giannotti*\u00b9, S. Taba\u00b9, (nicola.giannotti@sydney.edu.au) Purpose: Breast cancer represents the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. Early detection of breast tumours improves the prognosis of patients and survival rate. Propagation-based phase -contrast CT (PB-CT) is an imaging technique that uses refraction and absorpti on of the x-ray beam to produce images. The aim of this study was to compar e the performance of photoncounting and flat panel x-ray detectors with different pixel sizes in PB CT breast imaging. Methods or Background: Three mastectomy specimens underwent PB-CT imaging at Elettra Synchrotron (Trieste, Italy) and six using the PIXIRAD-8 CdTe single-photon-counting and Hamamatsu-C10900D Flat Panel Sensor respectively. C oronal PB-CT images produced at different imaging conditions were compa red to absorption-based computed tomography (AB-CT) reference images acquir ed at similar imaging conditions to investigate the image quality perform ance of the two image detectors. The image quality of the different data sets was assessed by eleven readers using a visual grading characteristics (VGC ) study. Results or Findings: The ICC test showed a moderate/good interobserver agreement for all the mastectomy images analysed (I CC=0.626, p=<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) showed that, when compared to AB-CT images, PIXIRAD-8 CdTe single-photon-counting detec tor can generate significantly higher quality PB-CT images at reduce d mean glandular dose compared to flat panel PBCT detectors (AUC=0.985, p<0.001). Conclusion: The main photon-counting and flat panel detectors differences are associated with the amount of dark current nois e, and spatial resolution. Although the respective significance in image quali ty was not quantified in this study, our findings demonstrated that photon-counti ng detectors produce higher quality PB-CT images at pre-defined scanning and radiation dose conditions.

Vatteroni\u00b2, and breast CE-MRI regarding sensitivity, spec ificity and negative predictive value (NPV). Methods or Background: Studies investigating the comparative diagnostic performance of CEM and CE-MRI published until April 2021 were eligible. Two readers extracted study characteristics and true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives of both CEM and CE-MR I. Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR +, LR-) were calculated by bivariate random effects models. A Fagan nomogram w as used to identify the maximum pretest probability at which posttest proba bilities of a negative CEM or CE-MRI exam were in line with the 2% malignancy rate benchmark for downgrading a BI-RADS 4 to BI-RADS 3 result. I2-statistics, Deek's funnel plot testing and meta-regression were employed. Results or Findings: Eight studies investigating 1161 lesions with an av erage cancer prevalence of 49% (range: 0.9-82.2%) were included. Sensitivity compared to CEM probability at which both tests could rule out breast cancer was 38% for CE-MRI and 13% for CEM. Conclusion: While CEM and CE-MRI show comparable diagnostic performance, CE-MRI is superior regarding sensitivi ty and LR and can rule out malignancy up to higher pretest probabilities than CEM. Limitations: This systematic review reveals a lack of data regar ding patient populations and indications, technical aspects as w ell as contrast media concentration and dose for CEM.

Barufaldi*\u00b9, A. Gastounioti\u00b2, W. Mankowski\u00b9, (bruno.barufaldi@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) Purpose: Evaluate radiation dose for a specific patient population enrolled in the breast cancer screening program from the Hospit al of the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA-USA). Methods or Background: The radiation dose delivered by screening tomosynthesis (DBT) is a current concern. 660 scree ning exams were collected using a dual-modality imaging protocol (D M+DBT). Exams were acquired on four tomosynthesis systems (Selenia Dim ensions, Hologic Inc.). Exposure and patient metadata were extracted from each DM and DBT image. Incident air kerma (IAK) and half value layer measurements were performed using a calibrated dosimeter (Accu Gold AGMS-M+, Radcal). LIBRA and DBT- derived provided breast glandularity estimates. Average glandular dose (AGD) was calculated using the IAK s caled to the breast surface and correction factors for x-ray spectra, b eam quality, thickness and glandularity following the IAEA guidelines. Results or Findings: DBT shows a significant decrease in mean patient AG D for women compared to DM for [40,49] years Differences in mean AG D per image are statistically significant for women [40,49] years ( DM=2.45\u00b10.96, DBT=2.17\u00b10.53 34\u00b14.69 mGy, P<0.001). Conclusion: Screening DBT does not increase radiation dose axiomatically and dose measurements should consider patient demographics. Breast glandularity affects AGD calculations significantly , resulting in estimates potentially inconsistent with DICOM headers. Limitations: Images were collected retrospectively, whereas exposure measurements were collected after the fact. The ref erence used to calculate AGD (Dance) considers semi-cylindrical breasts with glandularity homogeneously distributed in a central core. Non-uniform glandular distribution may affect AGD estimates.

J. O. C. Lan\u00e7a; Lisbon/PT A. Trianni; Trento/IT RPS 2014-3 X-ray scatter correction software for improving image quality and reducing radiation dose in large anatomical regions *M. F. Sayed*\u00b9, K. Knapp\u00b2, J. Fulford\u00b2, C. \u00b3Ta unton/UK Purpose: Globally, X-ray imaging is routinely used for diagnostic purposes. Scattered radiation from the patient is a major ima ge degradation factor, as scattered X-rays appear as mislocated events. The c onventional method of reducing X-ray scatter is an anti-scatter grid devi ce but this increases the dose and requires precise positioning and alignment. Rec ently, new 'virtual grid' image processing software (VG) has been developed t o correct scattered X- rays and overcome some of the technical issues asso ciated with grid devices. This study aims to assess the image quality and the radiation dose of VG corrected images compared to conventional grid devi ces. Methods or Background: A general FDR (Fujifilm) X-ray unit was used to perform anatomical phantom (KYOTO) scanning with di fferent thicknesses of fat layers present. A standard abdomen (AP) examination was applied with images acquired sequentially with/without the physi cal grid (PG) and exposure factors kept constant (kVp and SID) with AEC were u sed. VG software was applied to non-grid images. Mean intensity values and standard deviations of selected ROIs were measured, with paired samples T- Tests undertaken to compare differences. Results or Findings: The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of grid-less images was increased from (3\u00b11.56) to (5.1\u00b11.63) after applying VG software. The CNR of images acquired with the PG was found to be higher (9.61\u00b10.79) than VG (5.1\u00b11.63). In terms of (42.06\u00b14.87), VG images (32.39\u00b15.5), and PG images (53.01\u00b11.52). A significant difference (p < 0.001) was found for mean DAP between VG images (9.76\u00b10.40 \u00b5Gy.m\u00b2) and PG images (43.40\u00b10.95 mean and PG (0.085\u00b10.5mSv ). Conclusion: VG software improves the image quality of grid-less images, with a lower radiation dose compared to PG for Phantom based imaging of the abdomen. However, PG seemed to have superior image quality to VG software. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Expert annotation of lateral ankle-joint positioning in 2D skeletal X-ra y imaging using a standardised tool *O. K. S. Challiui\u00b9, T. Harder\u00b2, \u00b2Hamburg/DE, \u00b3Eindhoven/NL (ohertgers@gmail.com) Purpose: To understand what determines the decision for a retake, annotating ankle-joint positioning on X-ray imaging is necessary. Additionally, this is a critical requirement for future implementations of AI-assisted pose estimation for automated quality assessment. Methods or Background: We randomly sampled 500 lateral ankle-joint X-rays from the PACS system of our academic hospital. A we b-based annotation tool was developed, and the images were assessed and labeled by two expert image-reading radiographers. Pediatric cases and im ages with obscured joint spaces were excluded. Six quality labels defined: 1) diagnostic parameters 'joint space visibility' and 'cranial-caudal rotation'. For each aspect, three values were assigned: good, poor or bad. Overall image quality was labeled 'good' or 'bad'. The overall image quality was compared with the quality labels to determine w hich individual labels and combinations thereof were most predictive. Results or Findings: Image quality was assessed in 460 images, 40 cases meet the exclusion criteria (pediatric and joint sp ace obscured). Regarding 'overall image quality', both readers agreed on rat ing 'bad' in 41% and 'good' in 42% of cases (Cohens kappa 0.66). In 87% of the cas es, the overall image quality was determined by the combination of 'joint space visibility' or 'condyle overlap'. 'Joint alone 85% and of the images respectively. 'Medial-lateral rotation' or 'cranial-caudal rotation' explain in 77% and 65% of the cases the overall image quality. Conclusion: The aspects of joint-space visibility, condyle over lap, and to a lesser extent medial-lateral/cranial-caudal rotatio ns are predictive for correct lateral ankle X-ray positioning, and thus for preve nting retakes. Limitations: The limitations are a single-site validation and one view position evaluated. Ethics committee approval: A waiver of consent was obtained from the local ethics committee.

Meakin, C. Heales, A. G. ALQahtani, M. Gill, C. Ding; Exete r/UK (leerodri@gmail.com) Purpose: The clinical interest for software to predict fract ure risk, like trabecular bone score (TBS), has recently increased . The additional value of TBS, when compared to traditional bone mineral dens ity (BMD), is that it measures the bone texture and correlates it with the bone microarchitecture. This study explored the role of TBS in fracture ris k assessment (FRA) compared with BMD. Methods or Background: A total of 48 female participants were randomly selected from a study population. All participants had a DXA scan using a GE Lunar Prodigy (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL), and a T BS calculated for the lumbar spine (Medimaps Group SA, Switzerland). Part icipants were split into three groups: control (mean age is 40.8), osteoporosis without vertebral fractures (mean age is 58.1), and osteoporosis with vertebral fractures (mean age 71.8). Pearson correlations were performed to examine the relationship between BMD-adjusted FRAX and TBS-adjusted FRAX, an d logistic regression to access their fracture discrimination using SPSS (IBM, NY). Results or Findings: A strong correlation between BMD-adjusted FRAX and TBS-adjusted FRAX was found for all three groups, R 2 ranged from 0.895- 0.947 with an R2 of 0.9429 for the whole sample. Th e BMD adjusted FRAX model had an odds ratio (OR) of odds were 1.189 p<. 001. The TBS adjusted FRAX model had an OR of odds were 1.214 p< .001. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that there is a strong cor relation between TBS-adjusted FRAX and BMD-adjusted FRAX. The TBS-adjusted FRAX performed slightly better than the BMD-adjusted FRAX for fracture discrimination in our vertebral f racture group. Further work is required to explore the benefit of BMD and TBS-adjusted FRAX to improve the FRA in the future. Limitations: Participants were all white females, results might not be generalisable.

T. T. Rasmussen*\u00b9, S. K. Sondergaard\u00b2; \u00b9Odense/DK, \u00b2Kolding/DK Purpose: Lack of technical quality assurance in ultrasound p oses a threat to patients and may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropr iate treatment. The purpose of this study was first to investigate the application of quality assurance in ultrasound in Danish radiological departments, and second to test the quality of a variety of transducers using the i n-air method. Methods or Background: An anonymous short questionnaire, regarding the extent of ultrasound quality assurance used in the specific department, was sent out to leaders of all Radiological Departments in Denmark. The leaders were asked to forward the questionnaire to employee s responsible for ultrasound quality. Furthermore, two blinded senior year radiography students tested the transducer quality of 63 transducers (in clinical use) from different departments using the in-air method. Transducer faults were registered only when there was agreement between the two observers. Results or Findings: The questionnaire was answered by 48 respondents, of which only 38% answered that their department uses a quality assurance procedure. Furthermore, 50% answered that they did not experience the lack of quality assurance as a problem but 77% had exper ienced transducer faults in their department. The in-air method demonstrated transducer faults in 35 out of the 63 (56%) transducers including dropout, delamination and/or lens wear. Conclusion: The result of the questionnaire demonstrates a lack of technical quality assurance of ultrasound transducers in Dani sh radiological departments, which is further demonstrated by a hig h rate of faulty transducers. The in-air method, where the reverberation pattern is assessed, is an easy and inexpensive method to test the transduc er for obvious faults and may be included in a quality assurance protocol. Limitations: It is not possible to estimate the samplesize as the questionnaire was anonymous. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Therefore, there is a concern that the CT image will change compared to the centre of the FOV. We conducted experiments on spatial resolution and motion artifacts in cardiac CT examinations. Methods or Background: A wire phantom was used to evaluate the spatial resolution of on-centre and off-centre of the FOV. The position of moving object and X-ray tube become an important problem i n the evaluation of the motion artifact in the CT. We developed a new movin g phantom to solve this problem. And we compared the motion artifact in the centre and the off-centre of the FOV by using this phantom. Results or Findings: Comparing the on-centre and off-centre of the FOV, the on-centre had better spatial resolution than the of f-centre. The shapes of the motion artifact were changed by the position of the X-ray tube. However, according to new moving phantom, the motion artifac ts of the on-centre and off-centre were possible to evaluate in same X-ray tube position. The artifact of the off-centre became bigger than on-centre of the FOV. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 351 Conclusion: We evaluated the spatial resolution and motion arti facts of the off-centre of FOV. It was found that the spatial re solution is reduced and motion artifacts occur in the off-centre of FOV. Fr om the results of this experiment, it was found that it is important to pl ace the subject in the on- centre of FOV when performing the cardiac CT examin ations. Limitations: This report is based on the phantom experiment. We are planning to conduct research using human body.

Pais; Coimbra/PT Purpose: use dual-energy CT is eff ective in reducing metallic artefacts in CT images. It is als o intended to understand which level of monoenergetic reconstruction is most effective, as well as the added value of using iterative algorithms to improv e the image. Methods or Background: Materials and methods: Images with energies of 80 and 140Kv were acquired and the post-processing inc luded reconstructions with 150 and 190keV. In addition to monoenergetic r econstructions, the iMAR algorithm was applied. Qualitative assessment: experienced CT radiographers performed a blind assessment about the presence of artefacts and image quality on a 5-level scale. Quantitative evaluation: in the different sets of images, several regions of interest were defined which, in average values of Hounsfield units, gave us the beam attenuation and the image noise. Results or Findings: The 150keV monoenergetic images with application of the iMAR algorithm proved to be the images with the best diagnostic quality and the lowest presence of metal artifacts in both qualitative and quantitative assessment. Conclusion: The reduction of artefacts and image quality were evident in the 150keV monoenergetic images and with the use of iMA R compared to images without the use of the algorithm. Limitations: We did not evaluate the constitution of the differe nt constituent materials of the metallic artefacts.

Ferrreira; Coimbra/PT (rafaela_guis@hotmail.com) study aims to characterise the organisation of radiotherapy (RT) departments, analyse occupational exposure values a nd establish local diagnostic reference levels (DRL's) for breast and prostate CT-planning. Methods or Background: Authorisation and ethical approval were obtained. A national survey was disseminated across the RT nati onal departments. The survey presented 3 sections: equipment, staff and r adiographer's roles characterisation; occupational exposure values duri ng one month; and exposure parameters and CT does values (CTDIvol and DLP) for breast and prostate cancer CT planning. Local DRL's were based on the 75th percentile dose values. Results or Findings: A response rate of 25% of the national centres (50% of the state-run centres) was obtained. All department s promote three- dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) an d include at least intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and/or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) irradiation techniques. Half of the participating centres presented brachytherapy. Occupational exposure was collected from 54 radiographers' dosimeters, with an occupational dos e value of 0 mSv. The CT- planning dose values were 13mGy and 512mGy.cm for breast and 16mGy and 689mGy.cm for prostate. Conclusion: The majority of the RT national characterisation as pects were in line with the literature. The occupational values did not vary across the RT modalities. Local DRLs were established for breast and prostate CT-planning and the obtained values are similar to the recent E uropean studies. Limitations: The response rate was above desired, particularly f rom the private institutions. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by all the institutions' ethical committees.

Ota*\u00b9, T. Shibuya\u00b9, Purpose: Patient misidentification causes serious accidents in medical practice. Authentication systems based on facial im ages are used in many fields. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a newly developed face mask- enabled face recognition system in a CT room environment. Methods or Background: The face recognition system is PFAS version 2.0 (Canon Medtec Supply, Kawasaki, Japan). Thirty-two volunteers participated in the demonstration. Assuming a CT examination, the patients performed the authentication task while wearing the face mask dur ing CT room entry (walking and in a wheelchair) and positioning (supine positi on), and the success rate was calculated from the authentication results. Significant difference tests were conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis test on the auth entication scores obtained in the three situations. In this system, an authent ication score of 500 or higher is considered a successful authentication. Results or Findings: Authentication scores (mean +/- standard deviation) for entering the room (walking, wheelchair) and positio ning were mean 592 +/- 59, 596 +/- 60, and 567 +/- 51. No significant differen ces (p>0.05) were found between the authentication scores in each situation. Authentication success rates were similarly 100%, 97%, and 59%. The reason for the low authentication success rate during positioning was due to the angle between the camera and the examinee's face. Conclusion: Volunteers demonstrated the newly developed face mask- enabled face recognition system for practical use i n the radiology department. The system can be used in CT examinations by optimi sing the positioning of the camera for face recognition during positioning. Limitations: Although an actual CT exam room was used, this was only a demonstration experiment in a single room environment.

B. Dublin/IE (evan.comiskey@ucdconnect.ie) Purpose: Benefit-risk communication is a legal responsibilit y of radiographers. Several publications offer advice on how to frame benefit-risk explanations, and whether explanations are consistently offered by radiographers. Fewer papers analyse the content of risk explanations or report patient opinions on the analogies used. The current research investigat es Irish patient preferences regarding detailed explanation of radiation risk. Methods or Background: In an online survey, participants with a history of X- ray examination offered their opinions on risk expl anations for pelvis X-rays and pelvis CT scans. Five explanation types were in vestigated, using comparisons with risks of background radiation, num ber of chest X-rays, developing cancer, sea swimming and monetary cost. Responses were summarised as percentage weighted scores. Response distributions were compared using Friedman's two-way analysis of variance to determine any significant differences in opinion regarding explanations. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 352 Results or Findings: For each explanation, the 106 participants reported their opinions on ease of understanding, reassurance, alarm and level of risk. Significant differences in each of understanding, r eassurance and alarm were recorded between different explanations. For all ex planations, the perceived level of risk was greater for CT than for X-ray examinations. Conclusion: Patients reported background radiation as the most understandable and reassuring explanation. Monetary comparison was the least alarming analogy for risk in XR but conveyed increased alarm in CT, and resulted in the greatest appreciation of risk diffe rence between XR and CT. Mentioning a risk of cancer in explanations did not significantly increase participant alarm or reduce reassurance. Limitations: Participants were recruited through patient organis ations and thus distant from their imaging examination. Result s from actual patients may record greater alarm with risk explanation owing to the hospital setting.

W. Kusk*; Esbjerg/DK (martin.weber.kusk@rsyd.dk) Purpose: In radiographic or quality assurance studi es, images are often analysed or processed outside PACS. Efficient handling, while adhering to GDPR and other data security concerns is challen ging, especially in large AI data sets. Manual export from workstations, storage on USB-, or network drives are potential sources of data leaks, making mandatory logging/tracking difficult. We present implementation in a radiology department, of the opensource Apache NIFI server as solution to secure routing, processing and tracking image data. Methods or Background: Following server installation, dataflows were constructed in a graphical user interface. A DICOM listener was configured to receive images, and workstations/modalities were configured to push images. Processes were constructed to handle the following: automatic anonymisation/pseudonymisation, automatic sorting a nd routing of images to secure drives, based on DICOM meta-information, aut omatic rule-based renaming of images, extraction of DICOM tags to tex t files, and automatically triggering postprocessing tasks. Results or Findings: A 5000-image CT dataset could be pushed from a workstation followed by anonymisation and rerouting back in less than two minutes. Provided modality protocols were correctly named, pushed studies were automatically stored in project-specific folders and individual series were organised into separate folders on a secure drive, based on acquisition parameters stored in DICOM tags. It was possible to track the provenance of every single file, and no images ever left the hospital network. Once project- specific dataflows were set up and tested, no user intervention was required. The system was approved by local IT security. Learning curve for users was fast Conclusion: Apache NiFi is an efficient secure data infrastruct ure, suited to research and quality assurance in radiographic research with large datasets, without massive expenditure.

Bayesi an network meta-analysis was conducted to indirectly compare the overall diagnostic performance. Results or Findings: Twenty-six studies with 1602 pancreatic masses were included. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for MFP were 82% and 95%, respectively; and SROC curve (AUC) was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-92). However, the overall sensitivity and specificity of CECT were 81% and 94%; and, (95% C I, 0.90-0.94). CEUS showed a comparable overall diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of MFP and PDAC than CECT (relative DOR Conclusion: CEUS and CECT for differentiating MFP from PDAC. Limitations: Most of the original studies were originally design ed for examining the performance of only one of the two mo dalities, which could not avoid the effect of the characteristics of differen t patients. Although we did a Bayesian network meta-analysis to indirectly compar e the overall diagnostic performance of the two modalities, further original studies should be designed to directly compare the two diagnostic tests. Ethics committee approval: Institution review board approved this single- centre retrospective study and the requirement to obtain written informed consent was waived.

D. Yeomans*, V. E. Whitchurch, H. Samir, D. P. Purpose: In recent years, simulation-based transabdominal ul trasound training has been widely adopted due to its ability to creat e safe and standardised training experiences and reduce patient exposure to novice radiology trainees. It has been shown to improve performance in quantit ative studies, but there has been minimal qualitative investigation into per ceptions of its worth. This study addresses this by investigating the perspecti ves of radiology trainees regarding the value of simulation-based learning in a transabdominal ultrasound training programme. Methods or Background: 11 semi-structured interviews using questions modelled on the critical incident technique and the New World Kirkpatrick Model were conducted with trainees from two year gr oups who had experienced simulation-based learning. The interviews were thematically analysed. Results or Findings: 92 codes were generated and sorted into themes. There were 3 lower-order themes: direct perceptions of content, assessment and feedback; 3 mid-order themes: learner confidence, l earner motivation and relevance of content; and 2 higher-order themes: self-directed learning, and fidelity and technical factors. The findings highli ghted the simulation's strengths in providing new ways to learn psychomotor skills a nd clinical knowledge as an adjunct to traditional training. The importance of diligent selection and curation of content, meaningful feedback and purposeful assessments was emphasised. The findings suggested empowering learn ers to embrace self- directed learning and adopting near-peer teaching a pproaches would improve trainees' experiences. Conclusion: The study demonstrates there is a role for simulati on in ultrasound training, but its effective implementati on requires approaches that embrace self-directed learning and consider the impact of fidelity and technical factors on the learning experience. Limitations: There is a possibility of recall and self-selection bias amongst interviewees. The lead researcher's reflexivity and positionality as a senior trainee within the same training scheme is acknowle dged.

Meyer\u00b9, H. elastography quantitatively measures tis sue stiffness and is widely used in clinical practice to diagnose var ious diseases, including liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. The stiffness of soft organs has been shown to be sensitive to pressure-related diseases such as portal hypertension. Because of the coupling between tissue stiffness of abdominal organs and perfusion-related factors, simple breathing manoeuv res have altered the results of liver elastography, while other organs s uch as the spleen are understudied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a standardised Valsalva manoeuvre on liver stiffness and, for the first tim e, on spleen stiffness, using time-harmonic elastography (THE). Methods or Background: THE acquires full-field-of-view stiffness maps base d on shear-wave speed (SWS), covers deep tissues and is potentially sensitive to SWS changes induced by altered pressure in the hepatosplenic system. SWS of the liver and the spleen was measured in 17 healthy volunteers at baseline and during the Valsalva manoeuvre. Results or Findings: During Valsalva, SWS in the liver decreased by 2.2 % (from a median of 1.36 m/s to 1.32 m/s; p=0.021), w hile SWS in the spleen decreased by 5.2 % (from a median of 1.63 m/s to 1. 51 m/s; p=0.00059). Furthermore, we observed that the decrease was more pronounced the higher the baseline SWS values were. Conclusion: The results confirm our hypothesis that the Valsalv a manoeuvre decreases liver and spleen stiffness, showing that THE is sensitive to perfusion pressure-related changes in tissue stiffness. With its extensive organ coverage and high penetration depth, THE may facilitate translation of pressure-sensitive ultrasound elastography into clinical routine. Limitations: The small number of volunteers and the lack of Doppler flow parameters for correlation.

Methods or Background: Paediatric patients with PIMS may present with right lower quadrant tenderness or even peritonitis , resembling the presentation of acute complicated appendicitis. We retrospectively studied all abdominal ultrasound studies performed in our hospi tal for the evaluation of suspected appendicitis in two groups of paediatric patients, the first with a diagnosis of PIMS and the second with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of complicated appendicitis. A team of two experienced paediatric radiologists reviewed and agreed on the pathologic findings. Results or Findings: Altogether we had 17 paediatric patients with PIMS (mean age 8.2y ) and 22 patients with complicated appendicitis (mean age 11y ). The appendix was identified in 20 (91%) patients with appendicitis, all with signs of inflammation, and in 11 (65%) patients in the PIMS group (8 normal, 3 thickened). Mesenteric lymphadenitis was seen in 8 (36%) of the appendicitis group, all appearing reactive, and in 10 (59%) of t he PIMS group, of which 9 (90%) were round, hypoechoic and in clusters (one h ad central necrosis). Abdominal fluid, unclear to pus, was identified in 20 (91%) of the appendicitis patients, mostly peri-appendicular and minimal. Of the PIMS group, in 7 (41%) there was a moderate to large amount of clear ascit es. Gall bladder wall thickening was only noted in the PIMS group in 5 (30%) patients. Conclusion: RLQ tenderness and abnormal sonographic findings ma y be seen both in appendicitis and PIMS. Sonographic clues to diagnosis are the appearance of the appendix and the mesenteric lymph nodes, along with the amount and consistency of the abdominal fluid.

Ping; S hanghai/CN Purpose: To contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEU S) features of hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) in order to improve the ability of diagnosis. Methods or Background: The images of CEUS have been retrospectively evaluated in 42 lesions in 32 patients of HEHE who were confirmed by pathology from January 2004 to June 2021. Results or Findings: These 32 patients included 1 case of single type, 29 cases of multiple type and 2 cases of diffuse type. During the arterial period, 18 lesions showed overall enhancement, 6 lesions showed uneven dendritic enhancement, 16 lesions showed circular enhancement , and 2 lesions showed only slight peripheral enhancement. Three of the multiple lesions had both the overall enhancement pattern and the circular enhanc ement pattern in each patient. Fast in was observed in 20 lesions on CEUS , synchronous enhancement in 20 lesions and slow enhancement in 2 lesions and all lesions washed out quickly in late arterial phase or early portal phase. When the enhancement intensity reached its peak, compared to the normal hepatic parenchyma, hypoenhancement, isoenhancement and hyp erenhancement were observed in 11 lesions, 11 lesions and 20 lesi ons respectively. All 16 circular enhancement lesions showed high enhancemen t, 4 of the overall enhancement lesions showed high enhancement, 5 show ed low enhancement, and 9 showed equal enhancement. Among the dendritic enhancements, 2 showed equal enhancement, and 4 low enhancement. Af ter contrast-enhanced ultrasound, the boundaries of all lesions were displayed more clearly than two- dimensional ultrasound. Conclusion: CEUS is valuable in the diagnosis of HEHE.

Van Cauter; Genk/BE RPS 2011-2 Shared on voxel-based morphometry ( VBM) have revealed grey matter (GM) alterations in multiple b rain regions for addiction. However, findings are poorly replicated and it remains elusive whether distinct diagnoses of addiction are underpinned by shared abnormalities. Our aim was to conduct a quantitative meta-analysis of structur al neuroimaging studies investigating GM abnormalities in two main categori es of addiction: substance use disorders (SUD) and behavioral addictions (BA). Methods or Background: A systematic database search was conducted in several databases from 1st Jan 2010 to 23rd Oct 202 0 to identify eligible VBM studies. Meta-analysis was performed with the Seed- based d Mapping software package to compare alternations between individuals with addiction- related disorders and healthy controls (HC). Results or Findings: A total of 59 VBM studies including 2096 individual s with addiction-related disorders and 2637 HC met the inc lusion criteria. Individuals with addiction-related disorders showed shared GM v olume decrease in bilateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral insula, left superior temporal gyrus, and right heschl gyrus and GM increase in right gyrus fusiform gyrus comparing with HC (p<0.005). Subgroup analysi s found heterogeneity between SUD and BA mainly in left inferior occipital gyrus and right striatum (p < 0.005). Meta-regression revealed GM atrophy in left inferior frontal gyrus (r = 0.595, p = 0.015) were positively correlated with higher impulsivity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis identified a concordance across subtypes of addiction in terms of the brain structural changes in prefrontal and insula areas, which may relate to higher impulsivity observed acr oss addiction diagnoses. This concordance provides an organising model that emphasises the importance of shared neural substrates in addiction . Limitations: The causality between GM decrease and development of addiction is inexplicable by means of the integrati on of cross-sectional studies.

However, ASD cognitive dynamics are still elusive and functional connectivity (FC) biomarkers are missing. Our hypot hesis was that spatial stability (SS) of functional networks, intended as FC resilience to small brain parcellation changes, would capture cognitive dynam ics undetected on conventional analyses in ASD. Our aim was to invest igate SS in ASD compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods or Background: ASD patients and HC were selected from 3 independent datasets (ABIDE-I/II/III). Dkatlas40 was used for brain parcellation (standard parcels-SP). New modified parcels (MP) were generated by randomly moving 3% of vertices in 30% of adjacent S P (10% parcel's area variation). To evaluate FC, multiple centrality measures were calculated based on generated parcellations. SS for every measure was defined by the mean variation across generated networks. Statistical an alysis (ASD vs HC) was performed with ANOVA (p > 0.05). Results or Findings: 65 ASD patients and 80 HC were included. 100 parcellations were generated for each subject and 14500 functional networks were generated from rs-fMRI. SS of eigenvector cent rality (EC) was higher in ASD compared to HC in every dataset (p 0.0021; 0.03 4; 0.007). On the contrary, SS of assortativity lower (p 0.0021; 0.034; 0.007). Conclusion: SS of centrality measures was significantly different in ASD compared to HC. While prior analyses demonstrated b oth under- and over- connectivity in ASD, SS may capture dynamics underl ying both processes. SS expresses the consistency of a node's connectivity pattern across its neighborhood. In our case, it may reflect a pattern of interaction between eloquent brain areas, as a new potential biomarker of ASD. Limitations: Our main limitation was the high computational cost s of the analysis, partially mitigated by ad-hoc optimisatio n in python. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Gao*, M. Zhang, Y. Zhang; Zhengzhou/CN (gaoxinyu0806@163.com) Purpose: Smoking is associated with altered intrinsic activi ty of the brain. The aim of our study was to investigate how exactly cigarette smoking affects static and temporal dynamic intrinsic brain activity in th e resting state of smoking addicts and whether these changes are related to sm oking behaviour. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 355 Methods or Background: Based on static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (sALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low fr equency fluctuation (dALFF), we compared the differences of static and dynamic spontaneous brain activity between smoking addicted males (n=63 ) and healthy controls (n=30). Pearson correlation analysis was performed between dALFF in areas showing group differences and smoking behaviour (e. g., the Fagerstr\u00f6m test for nicotine Dependence [FTND] scores and pack-year s). Results or Findings: Compared with healthy controls, the value of static ALFF in the left superior/middle/inferior orbitofrontal gyrus was increased, and the variation in dynamic ALFF in the right superior tem poral/middle gyrus, left orbitofrontal region, left orbital superior/middle/ inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and right putamen was also i ncreased in the smoking group. It was noteworthy that the dALFF values of t he right superior temporal/middle gyrus, left orbital region, right s uperior frontal gyrus and right putamen were positively correlated with pack-years of smoking males. Conclusion: In resting state, smoking addicted males may have a bnormal static and dynamic spontaneous neural activity in t he prefrontal cortex (including orbital frontal lobe), putamen and super ior temporal/middle gyrus, which is correlated with pack-years of smoking males. It is speculated that these changes in spontaneous brain activity may be helpful to explore the mechanism of smoking addiction and guide clinical w ithdrawal treatment.

Melazzini*, L. A. Pichiecchio; Pavia/IT Purpose: Psychosis is a symptom common to several mental ill nesses and a defining feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorder s. The onset of psychotic disorders typically occurs in adolescence or early adulthood. Neuroradiological studies have reported evidence of brain structural abnormalities in patients with overt psychosis. However, early identification of b rain structural changes in young subjects at risk for developing psychosis is currently lacking. Methods or Background: Brain 3D T1-weighted and 64-directions DTI HARDI images were acquired on 55 help-seeking adolescents (12-17 years old) with psychiatric disorders who referred to our Institute. Patients were classified into non-psychotic (n=20), at risk of psychosis (n=20) a nd psychotic (n=15) using the CAARMS tool. Cortical from T1w images using FreeSurfer v.7.1.0. FSL-TBSS voxel-wise analysis wa s performed to study the distribution of diffusion-tensor imaging metrics in the white matter. A thorough neuropsychological test battery was adopted to investigate cognitive performance in several domains. Results or Findings: In patients at risk of psychosis, left pars triangularis and left superior frontal gyrus were significantly thinner than in psychotic (p=0.020) and non-psychotic (p=0.050) patients. Also in patients at risk of psychosis, thinner right and left pars triangularis were assoc iated with worse processing speed performance p=0.030 respectively ), whereas thinner rostral anterior cingulate gyrus was significantly associated with lower processing speed/coding subtest scores (p=0.010). T BSS analysis did not show any statistically significant results. Conclusion: Cortical thickness values were significantly differ ent among the three diagnostic groups. This study also showed specific associations between structural imaging features and cognitive performance in patients at risk for psychosis. Overall, capturing the pre-psychotic phase using neuroimaging could prove useful for the adoption of preventive s trategies in these individuals.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to i dentify shared and disorder- specific structural, functional, and multimodal abn ormalities between IGD and ADHD. Methods or Background: literature search conducted for whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and funct ional magnetic resonance studies comparing people w ith IGD or ADHD with healthy controls. Regional grey matter volume (GMV) and fMRI differences were compared over the patient groups and then a quantitative comparison was performed to find abnormalities (relative to controls) between IGD and ADHD using seed-based d mapping meta-analytic methods. Results or Findings: The meta-analysis contained 14 IGD VBM studies (contrasts covering IGDs and 335 HCs), 26 ADHD VBM studies (1,051 patients fMRI s tudies (603 with IGD and 564 and 29 ADHD fMRI studies (878 patients with ADHD and 803 controls). Structurally, VBM analysis showed disorder-specific GMV abnormality in the ation in the precuneus and shared abnormal co rtex, insular, and striatum. Conclusion: IGD and ADHD have shared structural and functional alterations. IGD has disorder-differentiating struc tural alterations in the putamen the orbitofront al cortex. Disorder- differentiating fMRI activations were predominantly observed in the precuneus among IGD subjects and shared impairing function co nnection was in the rewards circuit (including ACC, OFC, and striatum).

(polona.pozeg@chuv.ch) Purpose: Recovery consciousness anterior forebrain mesocircuit, involving thalamus, globus pallidus, striatum, and its the brainstem and default mode ne twork (DMN). This study investigated whether resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) functional connectivity (FC) in the brainstem-mesocircuit-DMN network is more preserved in patients with clinical cognitive motor dissociation (cCMD), i.e. behaviorally unresponsive patients with residual cognition as assessed by Mot or Behavior Tool-revised (MBT-r), than in the patients with true disorders o f consciousness (DOC). Methods or Background: 22 cCMD and 7 DOC patients, as identified with the Coma Recovery Scale-revised and MBT-r were included in this retrospective, cross-sectional study (12 women; age: 46.8\u00b118.7 yea rs). RsfMRI data (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) , preprocessed and analysed with medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) within DMN as seeds, and independent component analysis (ICA) were performed. We correlated FC with the Level of Cognitive Functioning (LCF) and Disabi lity Rating Scale (DRS) scores, and compared the FC between cCMD and DOC patients. The significance level was set at cluster size p-FDR-co rrected < 0.05 and voxel threshold p-uncorrected < 0.001. or Findings: LCF with FC between bilateral thalamus, brainstem, MPFC and right front al and temporal regions, and with FC between precuneus and MPFC within the I CA-defined patients displayed stronger FC than DOC patien ts between the bilateral thalamus and left frontal lobe, within MPFC, and between ICA-defined DMN and the right temporal lobe. Conclusion: These findings suggest more preserved FC within brainstem- mesocircuit-DMN network in the cCMD than DOC patien ts, and demonstrate that increased FC within this network is associated with a better clinical outcome.

Gong; Chengdu/CN Purpose: Anomalous amygdala based networks have been reported to be centrally involved in social anxiety disorder (SAD) , but findings have been heterogeneous due to small sample sizes, demographi c, and methodological differences, while little is known about the amygdala networks at subregional level in SAD. Herein, we aimed to identify the alterations of amygdala subregional networks in homogenous patients with SA D to investigate whether distinct parts of the amygdala functionally interac t with dissociable brain networks and contribute differently to the cerebral network substrates of SAD. Methods or Background: Based on the power analysis (Cohen's d = 0.5; = 0.05; 1- = 0.8), 49 non-comorbid patients with SAD and 53 d emography- matched healthy controls were recruited in the curr ent study, from whom the resting-state functional MRI images were obtained. Then whole-brain functional connectivity maps of four distinct (i.e. amygdalostriatal superficial area) and the amygdal ar entirety were generated, and whole-brain voxel-wise comparisons of functional connectivity between groups were conducted using two-sample t-test with age, sex, and mean frame-wise displacement as covariates. Results or Findings: SAD patients demonstrated widespread dysconnectivit y in cortico-amygdalo-cerebellar circuitry, mainly in cluding hyperconnectivity between the amygdala with default mode network/sens orimotor network and hypoconnectivity between the amygdala with visual n etwork/cerebellum network, in which the basolateral amygdala showed m ost prominent effects. Conclusion: For the first time, our findings suggested that dis tinct disruption patterns of large-scale amygdala subregional networ ks was implicated in SAD, and may reflect imbalanced network function of bott om-up response and top- down regulation in cognitive, emotional, and sensor y domains, which could offer novel insights into the underlying pathophysi ological mechanisms of SAD.

Methods or Background: MCI is characterised by neuro-inflammation, which is expected to elevated levels myo-inositol (mIns). In this study, we examined possible association between mIns levels in the hippocampus, prefrontal and temporal regions and microstructural integrity of t he external capsule. 1H-MRS was used to quantify levels of N-acetylaspartate (N AA), choline (Cho), and from MCI patients and 29 age-matched cognitively-intact older adults (non-MCI). Fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from whole-brain wate r diffusion imaging. Results or Findings: Mann-Whitney test revealed lower FA values in the l eft external capsule of the MCI subjects as compared to non-MCI (Z = -1.942, p = 0.052) but not in other white matter (WM) tracts (a ll, p > 0.1). Findings revealed that increased levels of hippocampal mIns were nega tively related to decreased FA in the left external capsule of MCI (r = -0.399) which was not seen in the non-MCI (r = 0.02). Contrarily, higher levels of hippocampal Cho were negatively related to lower FA in non-MCI (r = -0.455, p = 0.033) but not in MCI (r = 0.120). No associations were found betw een metabolites in the two other brain locations and FA. Conclusion: Observations suggest that decrease microstructural organisation of left external capsule could be related to local neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus. Limitations: Observations are limited by low sample size and mis sing data points that were excluded from the final analyses d ue to low quality of MRS. Therefore, findings of this pilot study should be v iewed as trends. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research (No. BE-10 -7).

Methods or Background: We use a series of techniques including chemo- fMRI, chemogenetics and optogenetics and prove that PVNvglut2 neurons can regulate both anxiety and wakefulness, and through two different downstream neural circuits. The PVN-PVT pathway regulates arousal but not anxiety-like behavior, while the PVN-Cg pathway is critical for regulating anxiety-like behavior but not arousal. Results or Findings: 1. The whole-brain BOLD signals and functional connectivity change after activation of the glutamatergic neurons in PVN. 2. Optogenetic activation of the PVN neu rons increases anxiety-like in mice. activation of the PVN-Cg neural circuit increases anxiety-like behaviors in mice. 4. Optoge netic long-term synaptic depression of the PVN-Cg neural circuit reduces anx iety-like behaviors in mice. 5. Optogenetic activation of the PVN-Cg neural circ uit has no effect on wakefulness in mice. 6. Optogenetic activation of t he PVN-PVT neural circuit increases wakefulness. Chemogenetic activat ion of the PVN-PVT neural circuit does not affect anxiety-like behaviors in m ice. Conclusion: The PVN-PVT pathway regulates arousal but not anxie ty-like behavior, while the PVN-Cg pathway is critical for regulating anxiety-like behavior but not arousal. Our study may help to unc over the neuronal mechanisms for anxiety disorders and insomnia. Limitations: Since the PVN is a complex nuclei which consist of different subregions containing functionally distinct neuronal subtypes, further study needs to be conducted to explore whether the PVNvgl ut2 neurons projecting to these targets belong to a common or distinct neuronal population.

MRI was performed using multichannel phased-array coils. Results or Findings: It was observed that, in the brain district, the GT VrifPET was volumetrically higher than the GTV3T (55.88%). Conclusion: This improvement in the definition of GTV leads to an optimisation and a clear change in the definition n ot only of the GTV, but especially of other target volumes such as CTV and Planning Target Volume (PTV) for the radiotherapist.

M. A. combination with traditional imaging ar e used in hadrontherapy both in the planning phase and follow-up. The main goal of this retrospective study is the assessment of the correlation between the treatment volumes, defined with MET PET-CT, and the potential clinical impact of any discrepancies. The secondary objective is to assess the sensitivity, specificity, the positive and negative predictive value of the m ultimethodological approach of high-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in t he assessment of early response to the therapy. The object of analysis wer e the images obtained by PET-CT and MRI of 25 patients suffering adenoid cys tic carcinoma (ACC) treated at CNAO from 2012 to 2019 with hadrontherapy. Based on histology, we define Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) on MET PET-CT a nd also on MRI images (GTV3T) by using a multimethodological approach of high-field MRI (3.0 T) Methods or Background: A GTVrifPET and a GTV were defined, evaluated on MRI (GTV3T) images using a multimethodological a pproach of high-field MRI (3.0 T). Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was also analysed in relation to GTV. The variation of these volumes was analysed in a descriptive way according to the definition of volume and percentag e changes. In the assessment of GTV3T, the following sequence was tak en into account: head- neck district, Turbo-Spin-Echo T2w sequence in the axial plane. MRI was performed using multichannel phased-array coils. Results or Findings: In the head-neck GTVrifPET was volumetrically lower than the GTV3T(68%). GTV were used by the radiotherapist in defining the CTV. Conclusion: Definition of GTV leads to an optimisation and a cl ear change in the definition not only of the GTV, but especially of other target volumes such as CTV and Planning Target Volume (PTV) for the radiotherapist.

Al Dahery*; Jeddah/SA (shrooq_talal@hotmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the challenges of optimising the quality of prostate MR images acquired in Saudi and Irish MRI departments and evaluate the influencing factors. Methods or Background: Axial T1W- and T2W-FSE MR images were retrospectively collected from 10 Irish (85 cases) and 7 Saudi (51 cases) hospitals. Quantitative analysis: signal-to-noise-r atio (SNR) and contrast-to- noise-ratio (CNR) were calculated based on signal i ntensity measurements obtained from the image background and from uniform areas of the central and transitional prostate zones, away from the prostati c urethra. The image datasets were independently evaluated by eight obse rvers and qualitative evaluation scores were recorded. An intervention was undertaken to improve prostate MR image quality at a single Saudi centre which had recorded low quality for several criteria during phase one. Both methods were again used to evaluate the post-intervention image quality. Results or Findings: Significant differences were noted in the SNR and C NR values for images acquired by using the T1W-FSE-TRA sequence between both countries. Median SNR and CNR values for T1W-F SE-TRA images acquired at Irish hospitals were higher than for th ose obtained from Saudi hospitals attributed to the wide range of slice thi cknesses (4-9 mm) utilised across participating hospitals. Observer scores indicated a preference for images acquired using thicker slices ( 6 mm) than those obtained with ( 4.5 mm). There were no significant differences for SNR and CNR values for T2W- FSE-TRA images in both countries. Scores identified a preference for thin-slice (3.5 mm). Conclusion: A multi-phase optimisation process of MR pulse sequ ences based on patient presentation is effective to optim ise visualisation of critical anatomical structures. Limitations: The small sample size was identified as a limitatio n. In addition, old versions of MRI machines were used in Irish hospitals, which could be a factor that makes a difference.

However, this improvement is limited by t he increased presence of artefacts. This research evaluated brain images tak en with both types of scanners. Methods or Background: Twenty brain scans (10 performed on a 1.5T scanner and 10 on a 3T scanner), reported as having no significant abnormalities, were included in this study. In phas e one, objective measures of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noi se ratio (CNR) were acquired and statistically analysed, for the axial 3DT1 weighted (W), T2W, fluid low attenuation inversion w eighted (DWI) and sagittal T2W sequences. Statistically significant v ariations in image quality were obtained for the axial T2W and FLAIR sequences (p<0.05), these were then included in phase two. Phase two of the study involved the latter sequences being reviewed by two radiologists using visual grading analysis (VGA). Results or Findings: Phase one results indicated that for all sequences, the SNR and CNR were higher on the 3T scanner, except f or the CNR of the 3DT1W sequence. Results from phase two showed that, for both sequences, images produced by the 3T scanner had a better imag e quality (AUC>0.5). Artefacts were potentially more common on the 1.5T scanner, however image quality variations were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: The results obtained from both phases indicated that, while both scanners produced images of sufficient diagnostic quality, scans obtained by the 3T scanner were found to have a superior image quality. Limitations: Each participant was scanned once, randomly on eith er the 1.5T or 3T scanner, due to ethical reasons.

Estall*; Leicester/UK (helen.estall@uhl-tr.nhs.uk) Purpose: To summarise the results of a national study lookin g at the numbers and scope of practice of radiographers that report MRI scans in the UK. Methods or Background: The demand on imaging in the UK is increasing year on year, with an increase in the demand for MR I of 48% in the last five years and an average annual increase of 10%. Issues with staffing have been found to affect reporting times. Health Education E ngland are investing in an additional 300 reporting radiographer posts in 2021 and state that radiographer reporting is an effective, efficient and safe way of meeting rising demand. There is no central register or knowledge of the number of radiographers reporting MRI examinations nationally. A questionnaire was sent to multiple different MRI groups and trusts within the UK. This report summarises the results of this survey, including the number traini ng, trained and in practice, their scope of practice and post qualification expectations including details of governance and audit. Results or Findings: Responses were received from 46 trusts. There is huge variation in scope, sign off and post qualification support and expectations. Conclusion: This survey provides an insight into the current st atus of MRI reporting radiographers in the UK. Although courses have been available since 2003, numbers are still low and there are significant geographical and work place practice variations. Defined standards of practice and the implementation of a central register would benefit both those in practice and those looking to implement an MRI reporting radiographer service.

P. Kotian*\u00b9, P. K\u00b2, tensor imaging (DTI) as a standard tool for imaging in PD, is still a debate within itself. The study aimed to compare the usefulness of DTI derived FA v alues between early PD and PD-plus syndromes like multiple system atrophy (MSA) and supranuclear palsy (PSP). Methods or Background: We evaluated DTI derived FA in early PD and PD- plus syndromes (MSA & PSP) patients. A total 100 patients (50) early PD were compared to (50) PD-plus syndrome patients. The fol lowing regions of the brain grey and white matter were included for FA analysis: corpus callosum, peduncles. We fur ther employed a region of interest (ROI) technique, to derive FA using a DTI protocol with b-value 1000s/mm2 and TE =100 milliseconds at Tesla (T). Results or Findings: Early PD and PD-plus syndrome patients showed statistically significant differences in FA values in the brain at the substantia nigra, putamen and cerebellar peduncles respectivel y. Conclusion: In DTI derived FA values help in detect ing microstructural changes in brain grey and white mat ter. Hence, they should be used as a standard tool for differentiating between PD and PD-plus syndromes. Limitations: An identified limitation was the use of 1.5 T MRI s ystem for obtaining DTI fractional anisotropy values.

Ivanac; Zagreb/HR RPS 2102-2 BraCoil - cup-shaped molds entailing a number of c onceptual drawbacks: the woman is lying uncomfortably in prone position with exposed breasts; Even adaptable RF coils are designed for large breasts, leading to poor image quality in smaller breasts; coil change and subject positioning are tedious for MR technologists; the anatomical distortion of hanging breasts leads to significant signal loss in central and posterior ar eas; The deformation between prone MRI and supine surgical and ultrasound examination complicates translation of imaging into treatment decisions; th e axillary lymph nodes are often insufficiently covered. We present a new appr oach for MR mammography addressing all of these Limitations: a wearable vest-like breast coil (\"BraCoil\") usable in prone and supine position. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 359 Methods or Background: BraCoil is an ultra-flexible array made of 28 coil elements covering both breasts and axillae. A semi- flexible 18-channel multi- purpose coil and rigid 16-channel breast coil were used as a reference for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) comparison in 10 healthy female volunteers. SNR maps were calculated without and with LR/HF acceler ation to investigate parallel imaging performance. Two breast radiologis ts provided feedback on image quality and anatomical breast representation. Results or Findings: A significant SNR gain up to a factor of 3 was meas ured with the BraCoil compared to commercial coils; acceleration factors up to 12 can be used. Excellent image quality for both small and large breasts were demonstrated. Conclusion: BraCoil provided 3 times higher SNR, better parallel imaging performance and superior image quality and anatomic al breast representation than standard coils, as the breast shape is well al igned with other imaging modalities and therapeutic interventions.

Methods or Background: Systematic review and meta-analyses, following the PRISMA standard, of studies that analysed the recur rence of benign PT, undergoing treatment by US-VAE compared with open s urgical excision and follow-up for at least 12 months after the interven tions. Studies found in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase were selected. The main outcome assessed was local tumour recurrence. The pooled effect measure used was the odds radio (OR) in order to estimate t he chances of recurrence of the benign PT. Results or Findings: Four studies were selected, with a total of 607 participants, undergoing US-VAE (252) and surgery ( 355). There was local recurrence in 26 cases in the US-VAE group and 24 i n the surgery group. Of the four studies, one of them was not included in t he estimate because it did not presented cases of recurrence in US-VAE or surgery. Therefore, the meta- analysis comprised the grouping of three studies, r esulting in a total sample of 595 patients. There was no difference in the recurr ence of benign phyllodes tumours, regardless of the that US-VAE minima lly invasive therapeutic option for benign phyllodes tumours, being a treatment as safe as standard surgical treatment. The type of treatment chosen, US-VAE or open surgery, does not impact the chance of recurrence f or benign phyllodes tumours. Limitations: All eligible studies were observational studies.

Methods or Background: Between April and September 2021 we performed preoperative cryoablation in 20 patients (between 53 and 79 years old, mean 63) with 20 unifocal infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC) (between 13 mm and 4 mm, mean 8 mm). All IDC were visible on ultrasound, were low grade (10 G1, 10 G2), Luminal A or B molecular phenotype, Ki 67 between 3-30% (mean 12%) and ultrasound negative axilla. All patients w ere studied with mammography and tomosynthesis, staged and biopsied by ultrasound. In 7 of the 8 patients with associated intraductal carcinom a (DCIS) in the core needle biopsy (CNB), MRI was performed to rule out extensi ve intraductal component. All of them underwent pre-surgical marking with fer romagnetic seed and cryoablation with 17G or 14G needle at that moment, taking advantage of the same anesthesia and cutaneous access. We applied th e usual protocol of triple phase: freezing-passive thawing-freezing and duration of approximately 40 minutes. Subsequently, we checked the correct pl acement of the seed with mammographic projection. Results or Findings: Out of 20 patients with low-risk unifocal IDC, in 1 9 of them no cells of the invasive component were identi fied in the examination of the surgical specimen, only 1 patient had an infilt rating carcinoma focus smaller than 1 mm. There were no post-cryoablation complications, only a slight burn. Conclusion: Cryoablation is effective in the local treatment of early low-risk IDC. The presence of isolated DIC nests close to th e area of post-Cryoablation steatonecrosis does not indicate treatment failure and does not imply a change in subsequent management with respect to traditional lumpectomy.

Methods or Background: From February 2020 to October 2021, 16 women (51 years \u00b1 14) with 8 BI-RADS 4b and 8 BI-RADS 4c US lesions underwent US-VABB for 10 B2 and 6 B3 results at the first-ste p CNB. Global rate of malignancy, and according to the BI-RADS category ( chi-squared with =0.05), were evaluated and false negatives were 3 samplings) and VABB ( 6 samplings). Final pathology was considered the reference standard for women wit h subsequent surgery, imaging follow-up in the remaining cases. Results or Findings: US-VABB yielded 6 B2, 4 B3, 6 B5 (6/16, 38% rate of malignancy). Out of 6 carcinomas (5 invasive and 1 in situ), 5 were identified in BI-RADS 4c lesions (5/8, 63%) and 1 in BI-RADS 4b l esions (1/8, 13%) (p=0.039). Of the remaining 10 cases (6 B2, 60% and 4 B3, 40%), 6 underwent surgery, with a benign final pathology in 4 B3 and an upgrade to carcinoma in situ in 2 B2, for a resulting false negative rate of 13% (2/16) at US-VABB. Conclusion: The use of US-VABB in the management of rad-path di scordance obtained a micro-invasive malignant diagnosis in al most 40% of cases underdiagnosed at CNB, avoiding excisional surgical biopsy. The latter is still recommended when an elevated suspicion at imaging persists despite a benign result at US-VABB. Our results highlight the importance of rad-path correlation by breast radiologists.

J. m etastatic biopsy- confirmed lymph node (MN) during axillary staging i n invasive breast cancer patients eventually matches with the sentinel node (SN) and (2) to assess the potential benefits of I-125 marking of BIRADS 6 les ions. Methods or Background: Between May 2018 to July 2021, 82 biopsy- confirmed invasive breast cancer with positive axil lary node patients who were candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were recrui ted. In a prospective design, we performed I-125 seed marking of both the positive node and the BI- RADS 6 lesion. Results or Findings: The MN was localised during the surgical procedure in 80/82 patients (97,5%) while the SN was localised i n 79/82 patients (96,34%). In 62 of 80 patients, the MN matched with the SN. 3 4 (54,83%) of these cases were reported as negative while 28 (45,6%) were reported as positive. Pathologic analysis of the MN correctly predicted t he axillary post-neoadjuvant status in 98,75% of cases. A metallic marker was us ed to track the confirmed BIRADS 6 lesion in 15 patients, while in 67 of them a I-125-radiolabelled seed was placed instead. This avoided the posterior mark er retrieval procedure when there was a complete radiological response. Conclusion: (1) I-125 node marking in combination with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB) is a feasible technique in the intraoperative setting. Pathological assessment of the MN allows the determination of th e axillary post- neoadjuvant status, thus potentially avoiding lymph adenectomy and decreasing false negatives of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (2) I-125 marking of BIRADS 6 lesions allows avoiding the pos terior marker retrieval procedure in the case of a complete radiological response. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: Identifying breast scar areas is crucial for an accurate delineation of the tumour lesions in CT si mulation radiation therapy. Most of the CT marking wires are made of highly dense materials that cause metallic and streaking artefacts. Some CT markers a re made of inflexible wires and could result in inaccuracies when marking scar borders over or under the irradiated areas. The treatment planning system may induce calculation errors because of the presence of artefacts. Materials and methods: CT simulation images were ac quired on the Siemens SOMATOM scanner using a 5 cm thick block of tissue equivalent plastic using playdough material shaped with a syringe as a cylin drical form of 2 mm x 2 mm x 30 mm (with different orientations). A multidetec tor spiral CT scan was performed using a collimation of 1.2 mm, 16 rows at 120 kVp and 15 mAs, as per local breast protocol. The resulted images were evaluated qualitatively (by visual assessment) and quantitatively by means of w ire dimensions and Hounsfield units (HU). Results or Findings: Playdough markers were clearly seen in CT images, as judged by two experienced radiation oncologists. No streaking and metallic artefacts were detected in the images. The quantita tive assessment shows the same original wire dimensions (\u00b10.2) mm and 300 (\u00b15) HU of the playdough material. Conclusion: The preliminary findings of this study are promisin g. They demonstrated that playdough material, as a tissue m arker, is clearly visible in CT images without streaking or metallic artefacts. Further evaluation is required, performed prior to implementation in a cl inical routine. Limitations: Limited sample size. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

The PROMISE trial was designed to demonstrate the non-inferiori ty of gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for contrast-e nhanced body MRI and its superiority to unenhanced MRI. Methods or Background: This international, randomised, double-blind, controlled, cross-over study included patients with lesions in different body regions (head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis and musculoskeletal). Patients (N=304) were randomised to undergo two MRI s (2 14 days interval), first with gadopiclenol, then gadobutrol, or vice v ersa. The primary criterion was lesion visualisation based on 3 parameters (border delineation, internal morphology and degree of contrast enhancement), ass essed by 3 independent blinded readers by main body region. Overall diagnostic preference was assessed in a global matched-pairs fashion by 3 additional blinded readers. Adverse events (AEs) were collected up to one day post-second MRI. Results or Findings: For all readers, and all visualisation co-criteria, the difference in mean of scores showed the non-inferio rity of gadopiclenol to gadobutrol non-inferiority margin [-0.35]; p<0.0001) and its superiority over unenhanced image s (p<0.0001). For overall diagnostic preference, readers reported no preference in 74.6%- 82.6% of the evaluations, preferred images with gadopiclenol in 12%-14.5% of the evaluations and gadobutrol in 5.4%-10.9% of the evaluations. AEs were reported similarly after MRI with gadopicl enol (18.1%) and gadobutrol (20.0%). AEs were considered related to gadopiclenol for 12 patients (4.2%) and to gadobutrol for 16 patients ( 5.5%), mostly injection-site reactions and none serious. Conclusion: MRI with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg is non-inferi or to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for lesion visualisation in different body regions. Gadopiclenol showed a good safety profile.

Liu*, Y. He, H. Xue, Z. Jin; Be ijing/CN Purpose: To proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging to differentiate deficient (dMMR) and mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, 3D APTw imaging, and diffusion- weighted imaging at 3 T MRI. Image quality and measurement confidence of APTw images were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scal e. APTw and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated and compared between the dMMR and pMMR groups and among the three EEA histol ogic grades based on the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIG O) grading system criteria. Student's t-test, analysis of variance wi th Scheffe post hoc test, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were per formed. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results or Findings: Thirty-five EEA patients (9 with dMMR tumours and 26 pMMR tumours) with good image quality were enr olled in quantitative analysis. APTw values were significantly higher in the dMMR group than in the pMMR group (3.2\u00b10.3% and 2.8\u00b10.5%, p= 0.019). 0.874\u00b10.104 \u00d7 10 - 3 mm2/s and \u00d7 10 - 3 mm2/s, respectively. No signif icant intergroup difference was noted (p=0.476). No statistically significant differences were observed in APTw values or ADC values among the three histologi c grades (p = 0.766 and p = 0.295, respectively). Conclusion: APTw values may be used as potential imaging marker s to differentiate dMMR from pMMR tumors in EEA. Limitations: This study was a singlecentre analysis, besides, im provements in the pelvic APTw sequence are warrented.

Zhang*, Y. Li, S. Wu, J. Zhang; Shanghai/CN Purpose: To explore the feasibility of establishing an adenomyosis rat model by endometrial implantation and the application val ue of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating an adenomyosis rat model. Methods or Background: 20 female rats were divided into control group and model group randomly. In the modelling group, one s ide of uterus of every rat was ligated and intercepted, and the endometrium wa s scraped and mixed with normal saline, which was evenly injected into the c ontralateral myometrium with a syringe. In the control group, one side of t he rat uterus was ligated and intercepted in the same way, and normal saline was uniformly injected into the contralateral myometrium. Two months after modellin g, the rats were examined by MRI, including T2-weighted axial and T1-weighted axial sequences. And the thickness of the uterus was measured. After MRI sca nning, the uterus of the rats was taken for hematoxylin-eosin staining. Stat istical analysis was performed via paired-samples t-test. Results or Findings: In the modelling group, adenomyosis lesions were successfully formed in all rats with a success rate of 100%. MRI showed that the myometrium of rats in the modelling group was t hickened with multiple hyperintense foci. The average thickness of uterine in the modelling group was higher than that in the control group, and the diff erence was statistically significant. Conclusion: The autologous endometrial implantation method is f easible to construct a rat model of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis i n rats can be clearly demonstrated by MRI, and adenomyosis in rats has si milar imaging characteristics to that in humans. Limitations: In this study, conventional MRI sequences were used to evaluate adenomyosis in rats without related functional sequences.

This study retrospectively included 108 wome n with EC who underwent 1.5-T MR imaging before hysterectomy from April 200 9 to May 2019. Texture features were extracted using the MODDICOM library with manual delineation of a region of interest around the whole tumour on MR images (axial T2- weighted). ROC curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of training and validation sets by using a subset of t he most relevant texture features tested individually in univariate analysis using Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney. Results or Findings: A total of 228 radiomics features were extracted and ultimately limited to 38 for DMI, 29 for LVSI, and 15 for risk class data sets. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predic tive value and negative predictive value were estimated (intermediate/ intermediate to high/high), respectively (AUC 0.837). Radiomic models showed good predictive performance in validation (A UC 0.683 - 0.769). Conclusion: An MRI-based radiomic model has great potential in developing advanced predictive performance in endometrial canc er. Limitations: The sample study could be enlarged.

T. M. Lisbon/PT Purpose: To evaluate the utility of fusing T2-Weighted Image s (T2WI) with Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) for evaluation of m yometrial invasion depth with relevance in endometrial cancer staging and tr eatment planning. Methods or Background: The authors conducted a retrospective, singlecentre study, which included 87 patients that had surgically confirmed primary endometrial cancer and had undergone preoperative pelvic MRI. Patients submitted to neoadjuvant therapy, with a history of pelvic neoplasia or treated with radiotherapy were excluded. All exams were read by an Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 362 experienced radiologist dedicated to urogenital radiology and the depth of myometrial invasion was evaluated using T2WI and fused T2WI-DWI images. Both results were compared to postsurgical histopat hological analysis. Results or Findings: When comparing both sets of imaging (T2WI and fused T2WI-DWI images), fused images had better accuracy in diagnosing deep myometrial invasion and this difference was statist ically significant (p<0.001). T2WI analysis correctly diagnosed 82.1% (70.6 - 88. 7) of cases, against 92.1% correctly diagnosed with fused images (79.5 - 97.2) . Conclusion: Although the accuracy of detecting myometrial invas ion depth with classic sequences is high, this work shows a s tatistically significant difference when comparing the accuracy of fused ima ges with standard evaluation, allowing for a better diagnosis with a post-processing technique that does not add acquisition time to MRI evaluatio n. Limitations: One limitation is related to the design of the stud y, since it is a retrospective, singlecentre study. Another limitati on was the absence of randomisation in the analysis of T2WI images, funct ional sequences, and then the fused images (all morphological images were fir st evaluated, followed by DWI and then fused images, in that order). This could introduce some learning bias. However, within each group of studies analyse d (T2WI or fused images) randomisation was ensured. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional review board. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Persiani*, L. Russo, B. Gui, M. Micc\u00f2, D. Cusum Manfredi; (ERI) is an image-based biom arker that reported interesting results in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in case of rectal cancer. Such a parameter is generally calculated on T2-weig hted MR images and consists in modelling the early tumour regression c ombining the tumour volume GTV volume measured at staging (Vpre) and at mid therapy (Vmid). This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of ERI in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (LACC), starting from T2-weighted and diffusion weighted im ages (DWI). Methods or Background: 88 patients affected by LACC (FIGO IB2-IVA) underwent 1.5 T MRI at two stages (before treatment and at mid therapy). GTV was delineated on axial T2-WI and DWI and ERI was c alculated for both. Radical hysterectomy was performed for each patient within 8 weeks after nCRT: pCR was considered in case of absence of any residual tumour cells at any site (pR0). The ERI performance in identifying pCR patients was quantified calculating the area (AUC) under the Receiver Opera ting Characteristic (ROC) curve and measuring sensitivity and specificity at the best threshold value. Results or Findings: The performance of ERI_DWI (AUC=0.81; CI 95% 0.70- 0.91) are superior to ERI_T2 (AUC =0.76 with 95% CI 0.65- 0.87). cut-off threshold, ERI_T2 shows high specificity (97.4%) with low sensitivity (43%), while ERI_DWI high sensitivi ty (86.5%) and limited specificity (64.1%). Conclusion: ERI is a good biomarker in case of LACC, especially if calculated considering DWI. Using this indicator, it is possible to identify non-responders early and modify the treatment accordingly. Limitations: No external validation cohort was available. Ethics committee approval: The workflow presented was approved by the institutional ethical committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

To our knowledge, impact of PI on prognosis has not been investigated. The aim of thi s study is to evaluate the association between PI degree and prognosis, in ter ms of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods or Background: From 2005 to 2019, 228 patients with a pathological diagnosis of LACC undergoing neoadjuvant chemo-radi otherapy (CRT) followed by radical hysterectomy were enrolled. Staging MRI were retrospectively evaluated. Maximum PI (PImax) and p arametrial length were quantitatively evaluated in millimetres, bilaterall y. Then, the ratio between PImax and parametrial length was calculated (PIrati o). All the analysis were performed in homogeneous subsets grouping patients according to pathological lymph nodal assessment (N- and N+) and for each patient according to the worst PI. OS and DFS curves were estimated by Kaplan-Meier product limit method. In both groups (N- and N+), c orrelation of PImax and PIratio with prognosis was performed using univariable Cox regression analysis provided both in terms of DFS and OS. Results or Findings: Out of 228 patients, 128 (56%) patients had nonmetastatic lymph nodes (N-) and 100 (44%) had metastatic lymph nodes (N+). The median follow-up of all patients was 73 m onths (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 66-77). The probability of DFS and O S at five years from diagnosis were respectively 74.4% and 84.8% in N-gr oup and 51.8% and 71.9% in N+ group. Greater PImax (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.10) and PIratio (HR=1.05) were associated with poorer overall survi val in the N-group (P=0.011 and P=0.024). Greater PImax (HR=1.07) was also associated with earlier recurrence (P=0.037). These parameters did not show statistically significant correlation in the N+ group. Conclusion: PImax and PIratio affect survival of N- patients wi th LACC. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study was identifie d as a limitation.

Brunetti; Naples/IT (francescoverde87@gmail.com) Purpose: To externally validate a qualitative magnetic reson ance imaging (MRI) method to predict placental accreta spectrum (PAS) in patients with placenta previa (PP). Methods or Background: Two qualitative MRI-based methods in interpreting PAS-related MRI findings were developed in our prev ious experience consisting of the presence of at least one (Method 1) or two (Method 2) of the following abnormal MRI signs: intraplacental dark bands, focal interruption of myometrial border and abnormal vascularity. These t wo methods were tested in an external cohort of 65 patients with PP and cl inical suspicion of PAS. Placental MRI evaluation was performed by three groups of radiologists with different levels of expertise. Group 1 included radiologists with at least 5 years of experience in body diagnostic imaging who routinely evaluated MR images on the basis of the qualitative presence of common abnormal signs associated with PAS. Group 2 and 3 respectively consisted of t wo couples of board- certified radiologists with at least 10 and 20 year s of experience in genito- urinary MRI which used both Methods 1 and 2 for ima ging evaluation. Results or Findings: A significant (p<0.0001) difference was found betwe en AUC values of imaging evaluation performed by radiologists of Group 3 using Method 1 (0.71) and Method 2 (0.89). The accuracy of Method 2 by radiologists of Group 3 was also significantly (p<0.0001) higher compared to that of both Methods 1 (0.61) and 2 (0.69) by radiologists of Group 2 as well as to that of the routine evaluation by radiologists o f Group 1 (0.64). Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 363 Conclusion: The identification of at least two abnormal MRI sig ns seems to be an accurate method for predicting PAS in patients w ith PP particularly when this method is used by more experienced radiologist s.

Longitudinal view of umbilical cord showi ng at least two complete segments (two arteries and one vein), excluding the two extremes was acquired. Distance between the coils was measured f rom inner edge of a vessel wall to outer edge of the next coil along the ipsilateral side of cord. Antenatal umbilical cord coiling index (UCI) was calculated as reciprocal of distance between a pair of coils in centimetres. 10th and 90th centile values were considered as cut offs for low and high estimates. Patients were followed up till delivery and pregnancy outcomes like gestat ional age at birth, mode of delivery, meconium stained liquor, birth weight, 5 min Apgar score and NICU admission were noted. Results or Findings: Normal UCI was in the range of 0.43 - 0.75 with abnormal UCI seen in 34 out of 200 patients. Signif icant association was found between UCI and gestational age (p=0.008), mode of delivery (p=0.010), birth weight (p<0.0001) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (p<0.0001). Hypocoiling showed a significant association with preterm deliv ery, low birth weight and adverse pregnancy outcome while hypercoiling was si gnificantly associated with low birth weight, Lower Segment Caesarean Sect ion (LSCS) and adverse pregnancy outcome. Conclusion: We found high specificity and negative predictive v alue for abnormal UCI in predicting low birth weight, LSCS, preterm gestation, indicating that a normal UCI can quite confidently rule out adverse pregnancy outcomes. Limitations: This was a singlecentre study with a small sample s ize. Ethics committee approval: Institutional ethical clearance was granted.

In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of differ ent colour Doppler and grayscale ultrasound quantitative indices in predic ting morbidly adherent placenta. Methods or Background: All pregnant women over 20 weeks of gestational age having a history of at least one previous caesarean section and the presence of anterior placenta were assessed for inc lusion in this research. Number of intraplacental echolucent zones (grayscal e) and echolucent zones with colour flow in colour Doppler ultrasound were counted in all patients. The nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (RO C) curves, the areas under the curve (AUC), and cut-off value were also evaluated. Results or Findings: A total of 120 patients were finally included in an alysis, fifteen of whom had morbidly adherent placenta and the rest were normal. Based on colour Doppler ultrasonography, more than two intraplacental echolucent zones with colour flow had respective se nsitivity and specificity of 93% and 98% in predicting the morbidly adherent placenta. Based on grayscale ultrasonography, more than thirteen intra placental echolucent zones had respective sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 80% for diagnosis of morbidly adherent placenta. Conclusion: Ultrasound quantitative criteria, including the num ber of the echolucent zones with/without colour flow showed si gnificant sensitivity and specificity in predicting and diagnosing morbidly a dherent placenta. Limitations: The low number of cases with morbidly adherent plac enta was the main limitation of our study, further studies w ith larger samples size are recommended.

Khurana*\u00b9, E. Chishti\u00b9, Purpose: determine if an educational intervention with the 2020 SAR/ESUR consensus article improves diagnostic effi ciency and confidence of abdominal radiologists interpreting placenta accret a spectrum (PAS) MRIs. Methods or Background: Three experienced radiologists blindly reviewed 20 MRIs (10 normal, 10 PAS: 1 accreta, 5 increta and 4 percreta), assigned them a diagnosis, and rated their confidence level. Afte rwards, readers were provided with the SAR/ESUR consensus article detail ing the 7 recommended MRI signs as well as an illustrated memory aid (int ervention). A 6 - 8-week gap was employed in an effort to reduce memory bias. Th e readers reassessed the same set of MRIs, first objectively looking for the presence/absence of each sign, and then assigning a PAS diagnosis and re-rat ing confidence level. If the pre-intervention diagnosis was incorrect, change-to -correct (C2C) diagnosis or change-to-near-correct (C2NC) diagnosis was assesse d. If the original diagnosis was correct, change in diagnostic confide nce (CDC) was measured. Pairwise comparisons were conducted using multiple Fisher's exact tests. Results or Findings: Only 1 of the 3 radiologists had significant change to correct diagnosis (33% C2C; c hange to near-correct diagnosis p=0.0156), but overall there w as increased confidence/CDC for all radiologists (92.8% of correct cases). When comparing according to pathology, MRI interpretation of place nta increta has the largest impact after intervention (C2NC - p=0.0078; CDC - p =0.0013). Conclusion: Prenatal radiological diagnosis of PAS disorders is vital for optimising antenatal care and preventing life-threatening complications. Standardised interpretation and reporting by incorporating the consensus recommended MRI signs can improve both accuracy and confidence in the PAS MRI diagnosis. Limitations: To ensure uniformity in study protocol and quality, only a small single institutional sample was used. Small reader sample allowed only intrareader and precluded interreader assessment. A larger scale multicentre study is warranted. Ethics committee approval: The IRB approved this study. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

R. Weir-Mccall*\u00b9, M. C. Williams\u00b2, A. Shah\u00b3, the updated National Institute for Health a nd Care Excellence chest pain guidelines (CG95) recommended coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the most cost-effec tive first line imaging test for the investigation of coronary artery disease. W e sought to determine the impact of CG95 on the temporal trends of coronary C TA use, its association with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) usage, and healthcare costs. Methods or Background: Investigations for coronary artery disease from 2012-2018 were extracted for the 42 service providers within the National Health Service of England. Annual growth rates were calculated and adjusted for population sizes. The impact of CG95 was assess ed using an interrupted time-series analysis. Changes in ICA usage were com pared between tertiles of CTA growth. Healthcare costs were calculated using national healthcare tariffs. Results or Findings: From 2012 to 2018, 1,909,314 investigations for coronary artery disease were performed, with an ann ualised per capita growth rate of 4.8%. CTA use grew over the study period, w hile perfusion imaging fell. CG95 was associated with a rise in CTA use (exp( ) 1.10 [95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.18], p=0.006). High ICA growth w as seen in the regions with the lowest growth in CTA (12.25 [95% CI 5.09 to 15. 46] angiograms/100,000 population/year) whereas ICA usage fell in those wi th the highest CTA growth (-1.13 [95% CI -7.07 to 5.71] angiograms/100,000 population/year). for coronary imaging was \u00a30.36 million/100,000 population/year, with an average annual change of - 0.8%. Conclusion: Imaging investigations for coronary artery disease are increasing, with the greatest growth seen in coronary CTA following CG95. Greater regional increases in coronary CTA were associated with fewer ICA. Overall healthcare costs for the chest pain pathway remained stable despite the growth in imaging.

Tesche\u00b3, G. ar tificial intelligence (AI)-based software solution for autom ated coronary artery segmentation and stenosis assessment using the Coronary Artery CAD-RADS. Methods or Background: Image data sets of 100 patients (48% male, 48.3\u00b110.8 years) who underwent clinically indicated CCTA were retrospectively analysed. Two readers independently evaluated CCTAs for the degree of coronary artery stenosis on a per-segment level usi ng the 18-coronary artery segment model with subsequent CAD-RADS classificati on according to SCCT guidelines. A fully automated investigational AI-based software prototype by Siemens was designed and tested on the CCTA data se ts and compared to human reading. Interreader agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa. Subsequently, the diagnostic performance of the sof tware prototype for detection of diseased coronary artery segments was assessed. Results or Findings: Forty-one patients had CAD with stenosis in at leas t one segment. Agreement between expert readers was 0.83 for CAD-RADS and 0.89 for the identification of diseased segments. T he software prototype yielded a sensitivity of 97.6% (92.8 - 100), and a negative predictive value of 96.9% (90.8 - 100) for the detection of diseased se gments, respectively. The software prototype reliably detected 40 out of 41 patients with CAD. One patient who was not correctly identified had a smal l, calcified plaque without associated coronary artery stenosis (CAD-RADS 1). T he average computational time of the software prototype was 240s per case. Conclusion: The fully automated investigational AI-based software prototype demonstrated fast and reliable identification of pa tients with coronary artery stenosis on CCTA with high diagnostic accuracy. Limitations: This was a retrospective, single-centre study with a limited number of patients. CT scans with insufficient image quality were excluded. CAD-RADS analysis by the software prototype was car ried out without a vessel diameter cut-off. Ethics committee approval: The protocol of this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Methods or Background: A deep convolution neural network-based super resolution deep learning reconstruction (PIQE) was developed where ultra-high resolution CT scanner (Canon Aquilion Precision) ac quired high dose data represented the training target and low dose normal resolution data were used as the training input. This super resolution neural network was optimised through different doses in the learning process. PI QE was applied on normal resolution CT data for achieving resolution restored low noise CT data from 52 coronary CT scans (Canon Aquilion ONE Prism or Genesis) at (PIQE-512) iterative reconstruction (AIDR) at 512x512 matrix w ere reviewed by an experienced cardiothoracic radiologist and evaluate d on a Likert scale (5=excellent, 1=poor) for spatial resolution, noise, diagnostic confidence and overall image quality. All images were reconstructed with 0.5 mm slice thickness, 0.25 mm increment and 200 mm field of vi ew. The data was analysed using a paired t-test. Results or Findings: Overall image quality for PIQE-1024 (4.92\u00b10.27) was higher than both AIDR (3.58\u00b10.54) or AIDR significantly 512 (4.79\u00b10.41, p=0.74). Spatial resolution with PIQE-1024 (3.40\u00b10.50) or PIQE-512 both p<0.01. than PIQE-512 PIQE has improved spatial resolution, noise charact eristics, diagnostic confidence and image quality compared to conventional reconstruction.

J. Bauer*, N. Nano, R. Adolf, A. ich, S. Martinoff, M. Hadamitzky; Munich/DE Purpose: To assess the long-term prognostic value of machine learning (ML) in time-to-event analyses on coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-derived measures and clinical parameters. Methods or Background: Data sets of 5457 patients (61.1\u00b111.1 years, 66.8% male) with suspected coronary artery disease who underwent CCTA were retrospectively analysed. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, instable angina, or late revascularisation (>90 days after index scan). Demographic parameters, clinical cardiovascular risk factors, CCTA-derived plaque features, and established CCTA-derived risk scores were assessed as predictors of MACE and incorporated into two models: a) a Cox proporti onal hazards (CPH) model with recursive feature elimination as reference. b) a ML model based on random survival forests. Both models were trained and validated employing repeated nested cross-validation. Harrell's concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the predictive power. Results or Findings: During the median follow-up of 7.3 years (IQR: 4.5 - 9.8 years), MACE was observed in 304 patients (5.6 %). The predictive power of the ML model (C-index 0.74 [95%CI 0.71-0.76]) was s 0.71 [95%CI -0.74], (C-indices 0.44- 0.69, 0.66-0.72], and the (C- index 0.66 [95%CI 0.63-0.69], p<0.001).

The aim of our study is to use Cardiac computed tom ography angiography (CCTA) to evaluate the performance of DLCN, Montreal risk score and SAFEHEART-RE in predicting the severity of CAD in this population. Methods or Background: From October 2013 to May 2019, we evaluated 139 consecutive subjects (\u00b1years, 82 males [%]) with cl inical and genetic diagnoses of FH. Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score ( DLCN), Montreal risk score and SAFEHEART-RE were calculated for each patient. Atherosclerotic burden CT scores (Agatston score, segment stenosis score [ SSS]) and CAD-RADS score were computed after analysis of coronary artery calcium and degree of stenosis for all coronary segments. Results or Findings: CAD-RADS <3 (non-obstructive) was found in 109 patients, while 30 patients had CCTA findings of obstructive disease (CAD- RADS 3). Agatston score and SSS were significantly higher in patients with higher Montreal score (p<001) and higher SAFEHEART- RE (p=0.047) and both scores showed a significant difference between the two CAD-RADS groups (p<0.001), whereas DLCN showed no statistically significant differences. Montreal risk score proved to be excel lent in discriminating between CAD groups (AUC=0.819; 95% p<0.001). The best cut-offs were respectively a Montreal risk score of 30 (sensitivi ty 52.1%, specificity 86%) and a (sensitivity spe 92%). Conclusion: risk score and efficaciously identify obstructive CAD and might help stratifying FH patients for prompt referral to CCTA.

However, their frequency and clinical implications remain uncertai n. Methods or Background: In this post-hoc analysis of the Scottish Computed Tomography of the HEART (SCOT-HEART) trial presence of coronary artery anomalies and myocardial bridging was assessed on C CTA. Imaging and clinical information were obtained from the SCOT-HE ART database. Results or Findings: CCTA from 1769 patients (mean age 58\u00b19, 56% male) were assessed. Coronary anomalies were identified i n 40 (2.3%) patients with 11 morphologies. The commonest was left circumflex from right sinus with retro-aortic course (14, 0.8%), followed by absent left main stem (10, 0.6%). There were no differences in demographic characteri stics, CCTA findings, myocardial infarction, or death in patients with or without anomalies. Myocardial bridging occurred in 215 (12%) patients, who were older (59\u00b19 vs 57\u00b19, p=0.027), more likely to be male (69% vs 55%, p<0.001) and had higher 10-year cardiovascular risk scores (18 [interquarti le range 12, 26] vs 15 [10, 23], p=0.001). Patients with myocardial bridging had a higher coronary artery calcium score [34 [0, 292] vs 18 [0, 219] Agatston Units, p=0.004) and were more likely to have obstructive coronary artery dis ease (35% vs 24%, p<0.001). They were more likely to undergo revascul arisation (21% vs 13%, p=0.002), but this was not independent of coronary artery disease. There were no differences concerning fatal or non-fatal myocar dial infarction between patients with and without myocardial bridging (0.9% versus 2.5%, p=0.230). Conclusion: Coronary anomalies are infrequent but myocardial br idging is common. Myocardial bridging is associated with risk factors and coronary artery disease on CCTA, but not with cardiac outcom es.

Boccalini*\u00b9, M. Teulade\u00b9, F. Rapallo\u00b2, (IMFS) most-likely indicating previous silent myocardial i nfarction (SMI) as on coronary artery calcium (CAC) computed tomography ( CT) scans in diabetic patients without history of coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods or Background: Diabetic patients screened for silent coronary insufficiency were categorised according to their C AC score in two groups comprising 242 patients with CAC=0 and 145 patients with CAC 300. CAC-CT were retrospectively evaluated for subendorcardial and transmural IMFS of the left ventricle in all likelihood indicating history of SMI. Adipose remodelling, patients' characteristics, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and metabolic profile were compared between different groups. Results or Findings: 83 (21%) patients with IMFS were identified, 55 (37.9%) in the group CAC 300 and 28 (11.6%) in the CAC=0 (OR=4.67; IC95%=2.7 8- 7.84; p<0.001). Total and average surface of detect ed IMFS and their number per patient were similar in both groups (p=0.55; p= 0.29; p=0.61). In the group CAC 300, patients with IMFS were older (p=0.03) and had a longer-lasting diabetes (p=0.04). Patients with IMFS were older, h ad longer history of diabetes, reduced glomerular filtration rate, more coronary calcifications (all p<0.05), and of an of having IMFS wi th multivariate analysis. Conclusion: In diabetic patients without known CHD, CT for CAC assessment provides additional information regarding IMFS, lik ely indicating previous unrecognised SMI. Limitations: First, the absence of confirmation with another ima ging modality that all the lesions are post-infarction. Second, this is a retrospective study and, thus, it remains to be established if this marker translates in an upwards CV risk restratification especially in diabetic patients with CAC=0. Ethics committee approval: This retrospective study on a prospective cohort was approved by the local ethic committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

L. Hammel*, L. technology provides appropriate data to calculate iodine-based perfusion maps for f unctional assessment of coronary stenosis. Methods or Background: An anatomical heart model was designed and produced using a 3D printing laser sintering techni que. The dynamical phantom can be flooded with water and contrast medi um. To simulate a perfusion defect, the bolus flow through the left c oronary artery was blocked by approximately 75 %. Time attenuation curves (TAC) w ere acquired with a 64- slice single source dual-layer spectral CT scanner using a fixed tube voltage of 120 kVp and an exposure of 30 mAs for 36 timepoints . A post-processing algorithm for tracer kinetic modelling using a one compartment approach was applied. Results or Findings: When averaged over a region with several voxels, dual- energy CT based dynamic perfusion imaging showed very similar results in blood flow measurements calculated from conventional TAC. The relative deviation was 0.93%. A relative deviation of 4.82% was found for flow values calculated from a single voxel. The fit accuracy of the tracer kinetic model increases for iodine-based TAC compared to conventi onally derived TAC (signal to noise ratio of 10.50 and 5.45 respectively). For the differentiation of stenotic myocardium from unaffected regions the rec eiver operating characteristic shows an area under the curve of 0.89 and 1.00 for conventional and spectral data respectively. Conclusion: Dual-energy CT and future spectral technologies lik e photon counting CT provide 4D iodine density data, which enables calculation of absolute quantitative perfusion maps with increased signal to noise ratio and improved ischaemia characterisation. Limitations: This study presents results for a 3D-printed heart phantom with simplified anatomy. Additionally, no heart movement can be simulated. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Fox\u00b9, Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness and practical implications of a novel workflow of using AI as a supporting reader for the detection of breast cancer in double reading screening mammography. Methods or Background: AI strategies in breast cancer screening should optimise the interaction between AI and human readers to maximise their combined benefit while ensuring patient safety and minimising clinical and operational risks. Large-scale retrospective data i s used to evaluate a new paradigm of AI-supported reading. Instead of replac ing a human reader, the AI serves as the second reader only if it agrees with the recall/no-recall decision of the first human reader. Otherwise, a second huma n reader makes an assessment, enacting standard human double reading. 280,594 participants from seven centres in two countries (UK, Hungary), and four hardware vendors (Giotto, Hologic, GE, Siemens) are included. Synthesised performance was measured via superiority/non-inferiority tests on c ancer detection rate, recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predic tive value. Workload was measured as arbitration rate and number of cases re quiring a second human reading. Results or Findings: The novel synthesised workflow was found to be superior or non-inferior on all screening metrics, almost halving arbitration and reducing the number of cases requiring second human reading by up to 87.5% compared to human double reading. Conclusion: AI as a supporting reader adds a safety net in case of AI discordance while retaining screening performance of standard of care and drastically reducing workload. Limitations: The second human reader would only assess cases where the AI and first human reader disagree. The impact of the change in case mix needs to be investigated further.

Methods or Background: 3278 conventional breast ultrasound images from 1078 individual patients depicting lesions were manually segmented and classified by two radiologists according to the BI- RADS standard. A U-Net- based architecture was trained with 2510 images and validated with 768 images. The performance of the network was evaluated on a test dataset consisting of 154 excluded from the training and validation dataset. The performance of the dCNN compared to human readers w as quantified using inter-rater agreement. Results or Findings: For lesion detection, the network reached 70% (65%) precision and 70% (81%) recall with respect to the annotating radiologist 1 (2). The inter-rater agreement for lesion classification between the dCNN and radiologist 1 (2) was substantial (moderate) for 3 classes and almost perfect (substantial) for binary classification (benign and malignant). The inter-rater agreement between the radiologists was measured as moderate to substantial for 3 and 2 classes, respectively. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the performance of the dCNN was comparable to the performance of experienced radiologists. Thus, our dCNN can serve as an observer-independent guide for subsequent clinical procedures. Furthermore, it can contribute to the s tandardisation of lesion classifications preventing unnecessary biopsies. Limitations: The test dataset consisted of only 154 images, whic h were unbalanced and extracted from one single site.

Magni, M. F. Sardanelli; Milan/IT (marco.ali90@gmail.com) Purpose: To develop and clinically validate an artificial intelligence software (Trace4BDensity\u00a9) for breast density classification, in order to eliminate subjective variability in visual assessment. Methods or Background: Trace4BDensity\u00a9 analyses the breast density of mid-lateral oblique mammographic projections (MLO) according to the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categor ies. The system was trained and validated internally using as reference the majority density class (mode measurement) independently assigned by 7 radi ologists to a dataset of MLO mammograms obtained from centre 1. External val idation was performed by 3 radiologists (whose breast density classificat ion was closest to the statistical mode measurement of the initial 7) on a dataset of MLO mammograms obtained from centre 2. Concordance betw een TRACE4BDensity\u00a9 and the statistical mode measurement of the 3 radiologists was calculated as a percentage, reliability by Cohen's k, both reported with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results or Findings: Two datasets of 760 (of 380 women) and 384 (of 197 women) MLO mammography projections were used for internal training/validation and external validation, respec tively. In the external validation dataset, Trace4BDensity\u00a9 achieved an acc uracy of 89.3% in distinguishing between BI-RADS categories a/b (non- dense breasts) and c/d (dense MLOs; CI CI 95% 0.667, 0.947). Conclusion: Trace4BDensity\u00a9 was developed and validated, proving to reliably distinguish dense from non-dense breasts according to the BI-RADS classification. Limitations: Mammograms with malignant lesions were excluded. Reliability analysis was performed only by three readers. TRACE 4BDensity does not provide quantitative BD measurements.

Author Disclosures: Andrea Cozzi: 2105-5 Combining radiomics and deep learning for classific ation of lesions on contrast-enhanced mammography classification performance (benign/mal ignant) mammography (CEM). We hypothesise that com bining both allows for automated detection, delineation, and improved classification of masses. Such a system can aid clinicians in their workflow and decision making. Methods or Background: 921 cases acquired at our hospital (with status and subtype proven by histopathological examination or 2-year follow-up) and 212 cases provided by Institute Gustave Roussy (external validation) had masses delineated by an expert radiologist. Pre-processed recombined and low energy images were used to train a RetinaNet DL model to a utomatically detect, contour, and classify suspicious masses. We also tr ained a radiomics-based machine learning model (xgboost) to classify masses detected and contoured both by the radiologist and by the DL model. We report the detection sensitivity as well as the AUC achieved by the models separatel y, combined, and when the models agreed on the external validation. Results or Findings: The DL model obtained a sensitivity of 90% for mass detection. Both the DL and radiomics-based models o btained an AUC of 0.86 on the manual contours which increased to 0.89 when ensembling the models. The models agreed on 79% of the lesions achieving an AUC of 0.93 on this subset. On the DL generated contours, the DL model obtained a classification AUC of 0.93, 0.94 for the radiomics-based model, an d 0.95 when combining the models. The models' classification agreed on 85% of the DL contours and obtained an AUC of 0.96 on the subset. Conclusion: A combination of DL and radiomics for the automated detection and classification of masses on CEM achieves clinic ally competitive results that can be translated into a clinical decision support system.

Ng, *B. Glocker*, T. Rijken, P. Kecskemethy; Lon don/UK Purpose: To demonstrate the importance of using representati ve data, including unconfirmed cases (neither positive nor negative) to assess recall rate (RR) and avoid obscuring real-world performanc e. Methods or Background: The performance of a commercially available AI system was evaluated in a large-scale retrospective study of unenriched representative real-world data (275,900 cases) from seven sites, two countries (UK, Hungary), and four device vendors (Hologic, GE , Siemens, IMS Giotto) from 2009-2019. Positives were pathology-proven mal ignancies. Negatives had 3-year negative follow-up results. Recall rate was assessed in two ways: Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 368 1) using the unenriched representative dataset, inc luding positives, negatives, and unconfirmed cases, and 2) after removing unconf irmed cases and artificially scaling up negatives to reconstruct th e screening cancer prevalence found in 1. Results or Findings: The representative dataset included 74.6% unconfirm ed cases. Cancer prevalence in method 1 versus 2 (pre- scaling) were 1.0% and 4.5%, respectively. The AI's standalone RR in metho d 1 versus 2 (post-scaling) was 11.5% and 9.5%, respectively, demonstrating an apparent 17.6% relative reduction when using a constructed dataset. Conclusion: For the assessment of AI performance on RR, it is i mportant to include unconfirmed cases which are likely to be more difficult for AI to assess correctly. Validating AI on non-representative, con structed datasets, excluding unconfirmed cases, may otherwise show optimisticall y low RR which would not translate to screening practice. Subsequent impleme ntation would pose a significant risk for overdiagnosing patients, leadi ng to unnecessary use of resources and unnecessary patient anxiety. Studies should use unbiased metrics with minimal truthing requirements such as RR and representative, real-world data, avoiding artificial construction, to assess AI performance in breast cancer screening. Limitations: Results may not be representative for other AI syst ems.

Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 12,301 mammography and tomosynthesis images from 3,516 patients of thr ee institutions (craniocaudal and mediolateral-oblique projections) have been analysed by assessing the presence of 7 key features that impac t image quality. A dCNN (deep Convolutional Neural Network) was applied to train seven models on features detecting the presence of anatomical landm arks and three models for feature localisation. The validity of the models was assessed by calculation of the mean squared error in a test dataset and in com parison to reading by experienced radiologists. Results or Findings: Accuracies of the dCNN models ranged between 93.0% for the classification nipple visualisation (RSME 0.84 cm) to 98.5% for the depiction the pectoralis muscle in the CC view (RSM E 1.79 cm). All models showed almost perfect agreement compared to human r eading with Cohen's Kappa score above 0.9. Conclusion: An AI-based quality assessment system using a dCNN allows for precise, consistent and observer-independent rating of digital mammography and tomosynthesis imaging. Limitations: Datasets chosen for training, validation and testing may potentially be biased due to the retrospective natu re of this study. Images from not all the manufacturers of the devices were included in this study limiting number of possible variants of images used for anal ysis. Not all ethnicities were included in this study, however representative data was taken from the general cohort of female patients in our institutio ns. Only one AI architecture tested.

Liebert*, H. Schreiter, L. A. Kapsner, S. Ohlme yer, F. B. Laun, E. S. Bickelhaupt; Erlangen/DE (andrzej.liebert@uk-erlangen.de) Purpose: To evaluate abbreviated, non-contrast enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) augmented by a high-resolut ion AI series reproducing the image characteristics of a contrast -enhanced subtraction sequence. Methods or Background: This IRB approved study included n=540 multiparametric breast MRI examinations including a multi-b-value DWI (50,750,1500 sec/mm2). Virtually subtraction series were derived for n=78 subjects applying a 2D-U-Net architecture trained using on the native acquisitions as input and the gadolinium-enhanced s ubtraction series as target. Two abbreviated protocols using maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the subtraction series were diagnostically assessed. Fi rst protocol was a virtual abbreviated contrast enhanced protocol (VACE), whic h used the MIP of the virtual subtraction series and all non-enhanced acquisitions necessary to derive the virtual series. The second protocol was an abbreviated contrast- enhanced protocol (ABCE) using the original gadolinium-enhanced subtraction acquisition and its MIP. Diagnostic indexes, image quality and artifact strength were assessed. Results or Findings: Sensitivity of 0.86 (31/36) achieved by VACE and ABCE protocols respectivel y. These diagnostic parameters showed statistically no significant diff erence. No significant difference in image quality and reading time were f ound between the two protocols. However a significantly higher number of artifacts could be noted for the ABCE protocol (p=0.003). Conclusion: Here we demonstrate the technical feasibility of augmenting non- contrast enhanced breast MRI by a virtual contrast enhanced subtraction series in an abbreviated protocol. Further research is necessary to advance the technique. Limitations: The study used acquisition only from a single scanner type (Siemens, Skyra-Fit). Due to the low number of test cases, the applied tests have a relatively small power to detect minor diffe rences between both protocols.

Oberije\u00b9, E. Ambrozay\u00b2, benefit of ar tificial intelligence (AI) as an extra reader in breast canc er screening (BCS). Methods or Background: A commercially available AI system was employed as an extra reader (XR) in addition to standard dou ble reading (DR) at a BCS provider in Hungary from Apr-Sept 2021. The XR work flow involved flagging cases the AI suggested to recall which DR did not r ecall, i.e. positive discordant cases, for arbitration by an experienced radiologist. Detected cancers were pathology-confirmed. Results or Findings: Standard DR for 3746 patients had an arbitration rate of 3.0% (114 patients), a recall rate of 6.7% (250 pat ients), and a cancer detection rate (CDR) of 12.5/1000 (47 cancer cases) . Of the cases that were not recalled by DR, the AI flagged 396 cases to rec ommend recall (positive discordance rate 10.6%). Extra arbitration resulted in recalling 6 patients, all of whom were diagnosed with breast cancer. This equate d to a total arbitration rate of 13.6% and 1.6/1000 increase in CDR (sum 14. 1/1000). An exact simulation with a less sensitive AI operating point yielded a total arbitration rate of 5.3%, while still detecting 5 of 6 extra cancer cases. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 369 Conclusion: This real-world deployment of AI increased cancer detection rates without recalling extra false positives, indi cating the effectiveness of AI as extra reader. Combining the XR workflow with workfl ows focused on workload savings will mitigate the increased arbitration rat e and optimise clinical and operational benefits. The results provide important , real-world evidence showing the benefit of using an AI reader in breast cancer screening, paving the way for innovative workflows where synergy of humans and AI achieve optimal performance for patients. Limitations: This was a singlecentre analysis; only one extra ar bitration reader was included. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was not required.

F. de Vries*\u00b9, S. J. Colosimo\u00b9, R. ymiter\u00b9, cancer mortality. H owever, a small number of women present with interval cancers betwe en screening rounds which were potentially missed by human readers. Art ificial intelligence (AI) could potentially support breast cancer screening, but its impact on interval cancers is unknown. Here, the ability of a commerci ally available AI algorithm to detect interval cancers was evaluated. Methods or Background: The performance of the AI algorithm was evaluated using UK screening data. All available interval can cers from cases between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2019 in NHS Grampian were i ncluded (N=52). Performance was stratified by lesion visibility on the screening mammogram, grade and size. Results or Findings: The AI would have recalled 14/52 (26.9%) for additi onal examinations. The AI indicated to recall 8/35 cases for which the lesion was not visible on screening mammograms; 3/9 cases for which the lesion was visible on review in hindsight; 2/2 cases for which the lesion was clearly visible; and 1/6 occult cases (lesion was not visible on scr eening or subsequent mammograms). The AI would have recalled a higher pr oportion of interval cancers <15 mm (7/16) than those >=15 mm (7/26), and a higher proportion of grade II (5/19) and III (7/24) tumours than DCIS (1/6). Conclusion: The introduction of a breast-screening AI solution into the screening pathway may reduce the number of women pr esenting with interval cancers by recalling them during routine screening. This AI algorithm might detect smaller, higher-grade cancers, which could h ave a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Limitations: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: A total of 185 masses (84 benign, 101 malignant) from 166 patient CE-BCT images were previously acquired. Each mass was manually annotated in 3D, and 174 radiomic features were extracted with a publicly available, previously validated software ( CaPTk). A multi-step reduction process was applied to discard non-inform ative, correlated and non- robust features to variations in annotations. Using the remaining features, a logistic regression model was trained and validated with stratified nested five- fold cross-validation. Additional forward feature s election was performed in each cross-validation loop (using only the training fold examples) to further reduce the feature space and prevent overfitting. T he final selected features were analysed statistically (Mann-Whitney U-test; B onferroni correction). The model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic, and the calibrat ion curve. Results or Findings: A total of 49/174 features were retained after the multistep reduction process. Five features, adjuste d by patient age, were used to train the model for each cross-validation fold. Interquartile range (IQR), equivalent spherical perimeter (ESP) and cooccurrence contrast (CC) were selected for all folds and were statistically signi ficant. The model resulted in an AUC=0.83 P>0.15). Conclusion: The model showed promising results in classifying breast mass malignancy in CE-BCT, especially considering that i t was developed only upon six features. Statistical analysis highlighted different imaging phenotypes for benign and malignant masses, with the latter showing greater contrast medium uptake (IQR), size (ESP) and heterogeneity (CC). Limitations: Absence of an independent test set, which will be i ncluded in future work. Ethics committee approval: Waived by our institutional review board.

Methods or Background: Six cases of osteoid osteoma of the hand were treated at our institution. The tumors were located in the proximal (2), middle (2), distal (1) phalanx and the hamate bone (1). We used a T-wrench and inserted a Kirschner wire (1.4-1.6 mm thick) into t he nidus by pressing and turning. Once the Kirschner wire was inserted, we i ntroduced the cannula of a beveled vertebroplasty needle co-axially, using the needle as a guide. Next, we removed the wire by pulling it, grasped by the wrench. Finally, we introduced the 7 mm active tip electrode and performed dry abl ation for 5 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius. Results or Findings: Technical success was achieved in all 6 cases, but 1 case developed a fracture shortly after treatment, with a stiff interphalangeal joint that required arthrolysis and plaster cast of the finger. The visual analog score (VAS) improved, from a mean value of 8 (8-10) to a mean value of 1 (0- 4). Conclusion: Radiofrequency thermal ablation of osteoid osteoma of the hand is feasible and provides good results in terms of p ain control and functional recovery. However, special care must be taken to av oid fractures due to the small size of bones in this anatomical region. Limitations: The sample size is small due to the low frequency o f osteoid osteoma in the hand. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by our local ethics committee (code TFG-ATME-2021).

The aim of this work is to evaluate the safet y of MRgHIFU treatment in OO located in close proximity (<1 cm) of sensitive structures. Methods or Background: Thirty-six patients (67% males, 33% females; mean age 23\u00b110,7yo) with OO were treated. Close proximit y of the site of treatment to sensitive structures was measured in pre-treatment MR exams. VAS score at baseline and follow-up (12-24 months) after treatment was assessed in all patients. Primary endpoint was to assess major and minor complications involving sensitive structures. Secondary endpoints were assessment of treatment response and the impact of the proximity to sensitive structures on treatment efficacy. Results or Findings: Close proximity of the target lesion to sensitive structures was recorded in 23 patients: 5 for tendon/enthesis/ligament, 2 vessels, 8 joints, 6 skin, 1 nerve and 1 organ (lung). No complications were experienced. VAS at baseline was 4\u00b11,4, with a complete pain relief at clinical follow-up in 33 patients. In 3 patients, a symptom relapse was observed: one was retreated with MRgHIFU and two with CT-guided r adiofrequency ablation (with pain relief at follow-up). Location in proxim ity to sensitive structures did not affect the efficacy of treatments (p<0.01). Onl y two of three lesions re- treated were in proximity of, respectively, the ili opsoas tendon and coxofemoral joint. Conclusion: MRgHIFU can be safely and effectively performed even on lesions located at <1 cm from sensitive structures, suggesting a broader range of applications and allowing a higher number of pat ients to benefit from this mini-invasive treatment.

The median age was 17 years, with a range between 5 and 41. Patients were evaluated 3 months after the procedure with a CT scan and were followed up for 1 year. A wide range of variables like location of the lesion, biopsy results, success rates and compl ications were reviewed for the subsequent statistical analysis. Results or Findings: Technical success was accomplished in 15 of the 16 patients (93.75%). All patients treated with this t echnique showed complete remission of symptoms 48 hours after the procedure. There were no immediate or late complications. Recurrence of pain was repor ted by two of our patients (12.5%) 30 and 48 months after treatment respectively due to recurrence of the lesion. Conclusion: Radiofrequency ablation is an effective minimally i for treatment of osteoid osteomas. The sa fety of this procedure is denoted due to its low rate of complications. Limitations: Small sample size. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was needed.

In recent years, advancements in the artificial intelligence field, and specifically deep neural networks (DNN), have proved to be a powerful tool t hat can assist in classifying images. These algorithms are based on v ast databases collected and labelled by certified professionals relevant to the studied field. This study's objective was to evaluate the use of deep-learning algorithms to develop a decision support tool for primary physicians, which can classify radiographs into normal and abnormal. The main goal of the study is to create a proof of concept for future radiograph decision-support clas sifiers of limb radiographs. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included patients aged 5- 40 with upper and lower extremity radiographs. The dataset was divided into an abnormal group, which included radiographs containing bone lesions, and a normal control group. Initially 10,000 radiographs matched the original research parameters. After screening by radiologist s, a total of 1469 radiographs from 351 patients were included in the study. 973 images (245 patients) were classified as normal, and 496 images (106 patients) were classified as abnormal. The radiographs were then p rocessed and were used to train several DNNs. The best DNN was chosen based on network sensitivity and accuracy. Results or Findings: The DNN which yielded the best results was found to be MobileNet, with sensitivity of 98.6% and accuracy of 91.5%. Conclusion: This study is an initial proof of concept of the fe asibility of a decision-support algorithm for primary care physici ans in diagnosing limb radiograph abnormality. Limitations: Small sample size due to low prevalence of primary bone tumors. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: This observational prospective study was conducted between February 2018 and August 2019. We screened 1000 routine musculoskeletal MRI examination during this period, 32 of which showed intra-articular synovial masses/mass-like lesions. The selected 32 patients had a mean age of 49.20 \u00b1 2.0 years; all p resented with joint swelling, pain or difficulty of movement according to the joi nt affected. All patients underwent arthroscopy for histopathological correlation. Results or Findings: The final diagnosis was synovial chondromatosis in 14 patients (43.8%); PVNS in ten The conco rdance of MRI to 99.9% correlation was observed between MRI and arthr oscopy in the diagnosis of intra-articular synovial masses/mass-like lesions.

To develop and validate soft-tissue tumour reportin g and data system (ST- RADS). Methods or Background: This is a multi-institutional cross-sectional study of soft-tissue masses. An expert consensus agreement w as reached for ST- RADS categories using the terminology from the WHO classification. Adipocytic tumors, T2-hyperintense and T2-hypointense masses of extremities with a wide spectrum of histologies were assessed. MRI categories were: STRADS 0 - incomplete imaging, I - no lesion identi fied, II - definitely benign, III - probably benign, IV - indeterminate or suspic ious for malignancy, V- highly suggestive of malignancy, and VI - known biopsy-proven malignancy or recurrence. Eight readers evaluated cases, and the ICC and AUC were calculated. Results or Findings: 200 soft-tissue masses were tested. There was good T2- hypointense masses. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of malignancy were 96% and 63%, 93% using standardised terminology musculoskeletal tumours into benign and malignant c ategories and provide a management strategy. Limitations: The cases were presented by PowerPoint presentations among institutions. While this allowed for easy anonymisation and data sharing, real- time windowing and image scrolling were not available, which may have limited detailed evaluation. However, it was ensured that t he representative sections, margins and extents of tumours were included in the imaging presentation. Ideally, this system should be tested and re-tested prospectively before widespread use. Ethics committee approval: Retrospective IRB at local institution.

Diallo; Freiburg/DE Purpose: To evaluate the association of sarcopenia with over all survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in central European patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Our hypothesis is that sarcopenia is associated with shorter overall and progression-free survival. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included patients with MM who were treated in our institution over a period o f 17 years and who underwent non-contrast computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen within 100 days of the date of initial diagnosis. We determined sarcopenia using axial CT reconstructions at the level of third lumbar vertebra and collected data from patients on established clinical myeloma markers. V ariables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and Pearson Chi\u00b2 test . Calculations of OS and PFS were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox proportional hazard regression models. Corrected P- values <0.05 were considered to denote statistical significance. Results or Findings: 226 patients were included (median age: 65 years (range 29-89); 62.8 % male gender; mean BMI: 24.69 (range 14.08-42.45)). prevalence of sarcopenia at baseline was 52.7% (119/226). In univariate analyses sarcopenia was not associated w ith a significant reduction in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.13; p = 0.58) or progression-free survival (HR, 1.07, p = 0.69). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that sarcopenia has no predictive value in central European patients with multiple myeloma. Limitations: This is a monocentric and retrospective study.

Diallo: Nothing to disclose RPS 2110-10 COVID-19 related acute sarcopenia pectoral sarcopenia and muscle wasting are emerging as a new field of interest in patients with newly acquired inflamm atory and catabolic status. It's the decrease in muscle function and mass due t o a stressor event such as infection, trauma or surgery. SARS-Cov-2 infection leads to cytokine storm, the hallmark of COVID-19 infection. This proinflammator y state combined with immobility due to hospitalisation leads to decline in muscle quantity and function. Methods or Background: In this research, we aimed to show this decrease in muscle mass in patients who had been hospitalised due to COVID-19 and who had lost their lives during intensive care. These p atients, mostly older adults, had two chest computerised-tomography scans during their hospitalisation. We measured cross sectional area on axial chest CT of paravertebral muscles at the T12 vertebral level and of pectoralis muscles at above the aortic arch level. The pulmonary involvement was classified according to percentage of lung parenchymal extent of disease. Also, the comorbidit ies of each patient and laboratory results at admission were assessed. Results or Findings: A total of 100 patients were first included, out of which 13 patients got excluded because of the time interv al between two scans or the poor quality of images. The mean age of 87 patients (58 males, 29 females) was 71,94. The CT measurement values are the differ ence between the second and first scans' area of the muscle groups. Mean difference is found to be -5273 mm\u00b2 of paravertebral muscles and -3629 mm\u00b2 of the pectoralis muscles. The overall muscle area is decreased while overall blood levels are changed in favor of inflammatory status. Conclusion: Acute sarcopenia affects hospitalised patients, and its degree is associated with the patient's pre-existing medical condition. Limitations: We didn't have a control group.

Methods or Background: 144 Caucasian women and men suffering from PHPT were recruited from 2011 to 2016. BMD values detected in the femoral neck and lumbar spine and biochemical values were c ollected. Density, thickness, areal and cortical volumetric density were evaluated with 3D-DXA software and standardised by age, biochemical dosag es, anthropometric parameters and bone parameters. Results or Findings: The data showed a significant negative correlation between patients with PHPT and the control group regarding the areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), both at the level of the cortical and trabecular bone. No s ignificant correlation was found when the thickness of the cortical bone was analysed. Conclusion: In this study we found a negative effect of PHT lev els on cortical, trabecular, areal and volumetric bone mineral densi ty, whilst there were no significant effects on cortical bone thickness. Limitations: The main limitations of the present study were the relative small number of patients with PHPT, which needs to be inc reased since the biological effects of PTH on cortical and trabecular bone is still under investigation.

Vogl, *S. Michalik*, C. Mader, V. Koch, K. Eichl er, I. Yel; Frankfurt a. Main/DE Purpose: MRI is the most sensitive tool for the diagnosis of muscle injuries. Premature return to play (RTP) leads to a high re-i njury rate and prolonged period of re-convalescence. The aim of this study w as to correlate MR-rated injury severity to physical conditions at the time of RTP and predict RTP by MRI. Methods or Background: 26 male soccer players with non-contact hamstring injuries underwent 3T-MRI and physical examinations (passive leg raise, active knee extension) at initial injury (within 72 hours) , and, after 3 weeks without physical exercise, follow-up examinations were perf ormed. Three experienced radiologist graded the injuries (mild, moderate and severe) and aimed to perform recommendation for the re-uptake of physical activity based on MRI. Results or Findings: Overall mean MRI measurements were as follows (init ial examination, first follow-up): craniocaudal length of injury decreased, from 9.1 \u00b1 4.5 cm to 5.9 \u00b1 3.7 cm (p < 0.01); and the injure d cross-sectional area regenerated slightly, from 16.4 \u00b1 11.9 to 11.8 \u00b1 11.8 cm2 (p < 0.02). RTP was recommended for 2/26 players based on MRI, while ranges of motion and pain in the functional examination significantly improved and aligned with the values of the contralateral healthy side (p < 0.02). Conclusion: In the follow-up MRI the extent of muscle injury severity is often overrated due to persistent extensive signal altera tion in the muscle, leading to a prolonged recovery time, while functional tests s how significant improvements. The healing process of muscle injuries highlights the discrepancy between physical/functional improvement s and reduced imaged- based monitoring of recovery. RTP prediction based on MRI led to prolonged absence in physical activities. Limitations: The limitations of this study are e.g. the small st udy group and no uniform rehabilitation measure.

Methods or Background: Patients with NETs and (suspicion of) metastasis determined on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT who also underwe nt an abdominal DW-MRI during the disease course between August 2016 and June 2020 were included. Retrospectively, the initial original MRI and PET-CT reports were reviewed. The findings of both modalities were comp ared and categorised as agreed or disagreed on the course of disease (stabl e disease, progressive disease or response to treatment). The clinical imp act was defined as a change of management. The MRI consisted of diffusio n-weighted, T2- weighted, and post-contrast T1-weighted abdomen, and pelvis. The 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT acquisitions were made 45 minutes after intravenous injection of the tracer. Results or Findings: Twenty-three patients were included. The median tim e between imaging modalities was 37 days (range: 1-11 1 days). Twenty patients (87%) showed comparable results on both modalities: 13 patients with stable disease, 6 patients with progression and 1 patient had a good treatment response. For three patients (13%) MRI showed progr essive disease compared to PET-CT. Most patients (22/23) showed no management change after MRI was performed except for one patient wher e DW-MRI detected a second primary colorectal tumour that needed surgic al removal. Conclusion: This study shows that the clinical outcome of monit oring metastasised NETs with MRI and 68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT are comparable. Because MRI compared to PET-CT produces less radiat ion, is most often easier to access and is cheaper, further research i s needed to determine the role of MRI in monitoring metastasised NETs. Limitations: Identified limitations were the small sample size a nd the fact that this was retrospective research. Ethics committee approval: This study has been approved by the ethics committee.

Cabrelle*, K. for colorectal cancer (CRC) staging. Patients with CRC should have genetic characterisation for RAS, BRAF and MMR mutations, as a predictive marker for response to therapies, and as a prognostic indicator for patient outcome. Texture analysis is a technique that extracts information that is not easily depicted by visual inspection. The purpose of the study is to determine whether contrast-enhanced CT texture feat ures relate to, and can predict, the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and specific genetic mutations in CRC carcinogenesis. Methods or Background: This retrospective study analysed the pre-operative CT images of patients with pathological diagnosis o f CRC, who underwent testing for mutations in the KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and M MR genes. Using specific software on the CT image on venous phase of each patient, a region of interest was manually drawn along the CRC in all its volumetric extension. A total of 56 texture parameters were extracted. Text ure parameters were compared between the wild-type gene group and the m utated gene group. A p- value of <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results or Findings: The study included 47 patients with stage III-IV CR C. A statistically significant difference between the mi crosatellite-stable group and the MSI group was found in four parameters: GLRLM R LNU 88.9%, specificity 65.8%). Conclusion: The findings support the potential role of CT texture analysis in detecting MSI CRC on pre-treatment CT scans. Limitations: Identified limitations were as follows: this study was a single centre retrospective analysis; only a small group o f patients were included.

Methods or Background: This prospective study selected patients with suspicion of CRC between April 2021 and August 2021 consecutively to undergo portal venous phase dual-layer spectral com puted tomography. Saturday Abstract-based Programme A B 373 Patients with confirmed CRC by surgery were enrolle d and divided into two groups based on LNM status. Mean attenuation on conventional 120-kVp images (VMIs) at 40-180 keV; iodine concentration (IC) and normalized IC (NIC) were measured for each lesion. The ratio of IC/VNC\u00d7100 ( I/V) was calculated. Each parameter was compared between LNMs and non-LNMs by using the Mann- Whitney U test. Diagnostic performance was evaluate d by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC) with sensitivity and specificity. Results or Findings: There were a total of 117 patients with 60 LNMs and 57 non-LNMs. HUconv, mean attenuation on VMIs at keV, IC and I/V were lower in the LNM group than in the non-LNM group (p<0.05 for all). Attenuation differences between the LNM and the non-LNM group on VMIs were maximal at 40 keV (P<0.001). highest sensitivity for di wi th a specificity of 89%. Conclusion: Quantitative spectral parameters enabled an ideal p redictive performance of LNM in patients with CRC. Limitations: The lack of external validation was an identified l imitation.

Rijsemus*, da Silva, E. Berardi, N. Kok, Aalbers, R. G. H. Beets-Tan, M. Lahaye; Amsterdam/NL Purpose: Nowadays neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is given m ore frequently to colorectal cancer patients (CRC) with peritoneal metastases (PM). However, after NACT lesions are often difficult to score with the current RECIST-criteria because lesions are too small, have no clear borders and/or disintegrated after therapy. This study evaluates a new, imaging based, scoring system: 'the estimated volume index (EVI)'. Methods or Background: Patients with PM from CRC who underwent NACT were included from January 2015 to August 2020. A C T-scan was made before and after NACT and a retrospective analysis was don e by 2 readers. The EVI divides the abdomen into 7 regions (Dutch Region Sc ore); then patients are categorised according to the overall response based on the response present in the majority of those regions. The EVI response could be applied the following way: EVI1 (progressive disease >25%), EVI 2 (mixed response; more than 25% decrease and 25% increase), EVI3 (stable ponse -50%<->-100%), EVI6 (complete response -100%). To validate EVI the results were compared to the median overall survival (OS). Results or Findings: Twenty-nine patients were included (median age of 6 2 years). Twenty-three (79%) patients underwent a CRS -HIPEC and 6 (21%) patients had an exploratory surgery. Median OS was 35 months. For reader 1 the median OS correlated significantly (p=0.007) wi th the EVI scoring. For patients with progressive disease (n=5) the median OS was 6 months vs. 42 months for patients with stable disease, partial, good or complete response (p=0.01). The interrater reliability agreement was 0.672 (p<0.001). Conclusion: These results show that EVI, when validated with more patients and multiple readers, could be a new practical appr oach for treatment response monitoring of CRC patients with PM. Limitations: Identified limitations were the sample size and the use of retrospective data. Ethics committee approval: This study received ethics committee approval.

A. Custers*, D. M. J. Lambregts, G. L. Beets, M . Maas; Amsterdam/NL Purpose: To establish an internationally supported definitio n of a near- complete response (nCR) on endoscopy and MRI follow ing (chemo)radiotherapy for rectal cancer. Methods or Background: An online survey on the definition of a nCR was held, consisting of 21 image features derived from endoscopy, T2W-MRI and DWI, 20 statements, and 20 cases of rectal cancer p atients 8-12 weeks following (chemo)radiotherapy. Ten clinical experts (7 surgeons, 3 radiologists) on organ-preservation for rectal cancer indicated a greement with the items. Consensus was defined as 80% agreement. Results or Findings: Consensus was reached in 8/21 of features, 7/20 statements, and 6/20 cases. Respectively 86% and 80% of experts agreed that a small flat ulcer on endoscopy and small focal spots of high signal on DWI were indicative of a nCR. The experts agreed that t he response on endoscopy is more decisive than the response on MRI, that biopsies are not always needed if a nCR is found, and that a suspicious res idual (lateral) lymph node should be considered an incomplete response. Consensus was achieved on mandatory inclusion of nodal status in defining a nCR. The following cases were deemed a nCR: (1) a flat white scar on endoscopy, homogeneous hypo- intense fibrosis on T2W-MRI, and focal diffusion si gnal on DWI; (2) a flat white scar on endoscopy, heterogeneous irregular fibrosis on T2W-MRI, and a linear focal signal on DWI; and (3) a small (<1cm) flat ul cer on endoscopy, heterogeneous irregular fibrosis on T2W-MRI, and no high signal on DWI. Conclusion: The definition of a nCR varies between centres. These preliminary results can be considered a first step towards defining a nCR to achieve more uniformity regarding selection of pati ents for organ-preservation after neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. Limitations: A limitation of the study was that a small expert p anel with relatively few radiologists was used.

Soomro, retrospectively evaluate the best radiomic features in predicting complete response to neoadjuvant therapy in patient s affected by rectal cancer and to assess the possible correlation between them . Methods or Background: A total of 109 handcrafted radiomic features and 4096 deep radiomic features were extracted from pre -treatment 3D-MRI of 43 patients, using transfer learning from a pre-trained convolutional neural network. The most widely explored 7 supervised machine learning-based classifiers and 6 different feature selection algor ithms were validated and compared utilising all possible radiomic features, in order to examine their effectiveness in achieving an accurate predictive m odel. Cross-validation was performed in 100 rounds partitioning the data as 75% for training and 25% for testing. Results or Findings: Using only handcrafted radiomic features, artificial neural network classifier and Fisher as feature sel ection algorithm delivered the best predictive performance on test data sets w ith the area under the curves (AUCs) [mean\u00b1SD] of 0.79\u00b10.016 and 0.8\u00b10.01, respectively. The best prognostic performance, using only deep radiomic features, was achieved by linear support vector machine (LSVM) classifier and Relief-based feature selection algorithm as 0.8\u00b10.042 and 0.82\u00b10.04, res pectively. When using a combination of both handcrafted and deep radiomic f eatures, almost all classifiers in combination with every feature selec tion algorithm generated better AUC than that obtained individually; the bes t AUCs were generated by the LSVM classifier and Relief-based feature select ion as 0.84\u00b10.025 and 0.87\u00b10.013, respectively. Conclusion: The best predicting models' performance was achieved by integrating both handcrafted and deep radiomic feat ures, i.e. LSVM classifier and Relief-based feature selection algorithms in combination with all classifiers.

J. Herold*, C. Wassipaul, M. Weber, P. Baltzer, as a 'one-stop-shop' examinatio n in staging of colon and rectal cancer. The purpose of this stu dy was to determine, whether multiparametric PET/MRI can improve locoregional staging of rectal cancer (RC) and to evaluate its prognostic value for early recurrence and death after resection. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 49 patients with primary RC who underwent multiparametric 18-F FDG PET/MRI, followed by surgical resection, were included. T and N staging was performed on standard T2w- sequences by two readers. Various parameters were extracted from the multiparametric protocol, consisting of DWI, perfus ion imaging and PET sequences, and were compared to the histopathologic al and radiological staging. Additionally, clinical follow-up data (tum our markers, lab results, physical examination, etc.) as well as follow-up im aging were assessed for signs of recurrence. Statistical analysis (median, mean, 90th percentile, interquartile range of parametric data), ROC curve analysis and multivariate regression analysis was performed for correlation w ith clinical and histological parameters, Cox regression was used for survival analysis. Results or Findings: Locally advanced tumours exhibited significantly hi gher metabolic tumour (MTV) and total lesion glyc olysis. Rate constant (kep) was associated with increased lymph node ratio as w ell as with lymphatic invasion. In the multivariate regression analysis, a combination of MTV and kep best predicted locally advanced RC. Metabolic t umour volume was associated with overall survival and recurrence. Fu rther data will be presented at the congress. Conclusion: Multiparametric PET/MRI including dynamic contrast- enhanced MR perfusion provides additional information on RC tumour biology and tumour involvement of the lymphatic system and may have prognostic value. This can improve identification of locally advanced tumours and hence help in treatment stratification. Limitations: Identified limitations were that this was a single centre study with a rather small patient cohort. Ethics committee approval: IRB: EK Nr: 1403/2015.

N. Boccuzzi*, G. Fontana, A. Barcellini, A. DW I (b1000) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in outcome pre diction of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC) re-irradiated with CIRT. Methods or Background: CIRT has proved to be safe and effective for re- irradiation of unresectable LRRC, and the availabil ity of a pre-treatment stratification of patients could optimise treatment strategy. Clinical and radiological data from 17 consecutive LRRC patients re-irradiated with CIRT, between 2014 and 2020, were retrospectively collect ed. Patients were stratified as 1-year-responder (Re) and 1-year-non- responder (NRe) based on volume changes between pre-treatment and 1-year fol low-up MRI. Each lesion was on pre-treatment b1000 and A DC, and DWI features were extracted (median, inter-quartile, skewness, k urtosis). Statistically significant differences of DWI features were tested with non-paired Mann- Whitney U test ( =0.05). Diagnostic accuracy of relevant features was explored, hence the potential biomarkers were fed t o k-means clustering algorithm for automatic stratification purposes. Results or Findings: The b1000 median values for Re (n=11) and NRe (n=6) were 34.0 [13.0] and 62.5 [23.9] respectively, whil 963.0 [277.0] and 942.5 [339.0] m2/s (median [inter-quartile]). Statistically significant differences between Re and NRe were found for all b1000 features and ADC kurtosis. Only b1000 median and inter-quart ile and ADC kurtosis showed relevant diagnostic accuracy and the k-means accuracy score was 0.88. Conclusion: b1000 median, inter-quartile and ADC kurtosis, show ed remarkable potential for being a biomarker of CIRT response. Further investigations should be carried out on a larger cohort to confirm this data. Limitations: Identified limitation were: the small sample size; non- generalisability of b1000 values, due to its sensit ivity to MR scanner hardware; retrospective nature; all data from a single study centre. Ethics committee approval: An independent ethics committee approved the conduction of this retrospective analysis on the 30th June 2021.

M. J. Lambregts*\u00b9, E. van den Hurk\u00b2, F. Peters\u00b9 , is chemoradiotherapy(CRT). a seque ntial radiotherapy boost (3x1.8 Gy) is given selectively based on the interi m response after 5 weeks of CRT. The aim was to assess the impact of MRI in add ition to digital rectal examination (DRE) in guiding this decision. Methods or Background: This was a retrospective analysis of 48 anal cancer patients treated with CRT\u00b1sequential boost. The int erim response was assessed after five weeks with DRE (when feasible) and T2W-MRI+DWI. On DRE, the response was classified as insufficient when an obvious residual mass was palpable. On MRI, the response was classif ied as insufficient (obvious residual mass on T2W-MRI+DWI) or sufficient ([near-]complete response; fibrosis, no/minor high signal on DWI). T he decision whether to boost (in case of insufficient response) was guided by the findings of DRE+MRI. Results or Findings: In 16/48 patients (33%), DRE was not feasible because of pain. In 8/16 cases, MRI indicated insufficient response; 88% were boosted. In 7 cases, MRI indicated sufficient response; boos t was omitted in 86%. In 1 case, MRI was inconclusive. In 21/48 patients (44%) , MRI confirmed the findings of DRE; in 81% boost strategies were planned accordingly. In the remaining patients, alternative strategies were mai nly guided by patient preference/comorbidities. In 11/48 patients (23%), MRI contradicted the findings of DRE. These were mostly (8/11) cases whe re DRE suspected residual tumour, but MRI indicated a near-complete/ complete response; boost was omitted in the majority (75%). Conclusion: The addition of MRI to DRE seems helpful to assess response during CRT and guide the decision whether or not to give a sequential radiotherapy boost, specifically when DRE is not feasible (\u00b11/3) and in cases where DRE underestimates the response. Limitations: Descriptive retrospective study; small cohort. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was acquired for this study. Funding for this study: Not applicable.

Neeter*\u00b9, H. Raat\u00b2, C. Frotscher\u00b3, K. M. Duvivi er, van Nijnatten\u00b9, M. Smidt\u00b9, J. E. trial comparing contrast-enhanced spectr al mammography (CESM) to conventional imaging in the workup of women recalled from breast cancer screening. Methods or Background: Participants were randomised to either CESM or conventional imaging (i.e., FFDM and/or DBT) as pri mary workup tool with/without supplemental ultrasound. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy expressed as sensitivity and specificity. A secondary outcome was costs associated with diagnostic imaging and biopsi es. Data for primary and secondary outcomes will be collected until the next screening round. Results or Findings: 529 patients were enrolled in the study between 201 8- 2021. 264 were randomised to CESM and 265 to conventional imaging as primary work-up tool. Currently, data from 481 pati ents could be used for analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Preliminary sensitivity was 97.9% for CESM and 97.6% for conventional imaging, and specificity estimates were 74.7% for C ESM and 74.4% for conventional imaging. Ultrasound was performed in 6 8% and 98% of the cases in the CESM and control group. Supplemental MRI was performed for inconclusive findings four times more often in the control group than in the CESM group. Histopathological examination was requi red in 58% and 61% of the cases in the CESM and control group. Conclusion: Diagnostic accuracy of CESM is comparable with that of conventional imaging in women recalled from screeni ng. However, in the control group more supplemental examinations were r equired for diagnosis. The findings support the hypothesis that CESM as initial imaging modality is more rapid and (cost)efficient. Limitations: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the screening rounds interval, thereby extending the follow-up period.

Nicosia\u00b9, contrast-enh anced spectral mammography (CESM) in the prediction of malignancy of breast lesions presenting as microcalcifications compared to lesions presenting as masses, based on the intensity of contrastographic enhancem ent. Methods or Background: 321 patients with 377 suspected breast lesions (BIRADS>3) undergoing CESM in the period from Janua ry 2013 to February 2022 were included. All lesions were assessed using a 4-point scale regarding the degree of intensity of constrastographic enhanc ement (0 = no impregnation, 1 = minimal, 2 = moderate, 3 = marked ). Scores 2 and 3 were considered predictive of malignancy. Histological r esults were considered the gold standard in evaluating the diagnostic performance of CESM. Results or Findings: The sensitivity of the intensity of the enhancement in predicting breast lesion malignancy in CESM for mic rocalcifications (101 lesions) was 53.3%; the specificity was 95.8%; and the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) wer e 84.2% and 82.9%, respectively. The accuracy was 83.2%. For lesions t hat presented as masses (276 lesions), sensitivity was 82.2%; specificity w as 84.2%; and PPV and negative NPV were 95.2% and 55.2%, respectively. The accuracy was 82.6%. Conclusion: The sensitivity of CESM in predicting the malignanc y of lesions presenting as microcalcifications is significantly worse than in predicting the malignancy of lesions presenting as masses. However , the specificity is very high. The overall diagnostic accuracy is therefore satisfactory. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Hogan, *J. V. M. Horvat*, D. Ross, S. Sevilimedu Veeravalli, M. S. Jochelson, L. Kirstein, S. ock, J. Sung; New York, NY/US Purpose: To investigate the utility of contrast-enhanced mam mography (CEM) as an alternative to breast MRI for the evaluation of residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment in patients with breast cancer. Methods or Background: This prospective study enrolled consecutive women undergoing neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer from July 2017 - July 2019. Breast MRI and CEM exams were performed after completion of the neoadjuvant treatment and were read by two breast r adiologists blinded to the results of the other modality. Residual disease and lesion size on MRI and CEM recombined and low-energy images were compared. Statistical analysis was performed using McNemar's and Leisenring's test s where appropriate. Multiple comparison adjustment was made using Bonferroni procedure. Lesion sizes were correlated using Kendall's tau correlati on coefficient. Results or Findings: There were 110 participants with 115 breast cancers . Residual disease (invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ) was detected in 83/115 (72%) lesions on pathology, 71/115 (62%) (65%) low-energy images. When using multiple comparison adjustment ( = < 0.001), no significant differences were detected between MRI combined with low-energy images and CEM in assessing residual disease, modalities was moderate: = 0.36 vs 0.33 for residual disease. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced mammography is an acceptable alternative to breast MRI for the detection of residual disease af ter neoadjuvant treatment. Limitations: Each imaging study was interpreted by only one read er. Only largest dimensions of lesions were considered in the analysis.

Ali*, L. Metaxa, T. Suaris; London/UK (anam.ali@nhs.net) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the enhancement characteristics of malignant and benign breast lesions on CESM meas uring the lesional enhancement as a ratio compared with the background parenchymal enhancement. Methods or Background: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing CESM as part of cancer staging at Barts Health NHS trust between November 2020 and February 2022 was performed. All lesions s een on CESM for which there was a histopathological correlate were inlude d in the analysis. Quantitative degree of enhancement was assessed usi ng a region of interest (ROI) placed manually over of the enhancement area within the lesion. A separate ROI representative of background enhanceme nt (excluding the enhancing lesion). ROI signal values were assessed separately for MLO and CC projections in the early phase. Enhancement calc ulated as ROI signal ratio: [(ROI of lesion - ROI of background) \u00f7 ROI of backg round]. Results or Findings: A total of 55 female patients underwent CESM, with 61 lesions detected. Amongst these, 35 (58%) were assessed to be invasive cancers, 13 (21%) were non-invasive cancers and 13 (21%) were benign. Analysis of enhancement indices showed the following mean ROI signal values: invasive cancers 1.70; non-invasive 1.35; b enign 1.05. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated a correlation between t he degree of lesion enhancement in CESM and malignant and benign lesions. Invasive malignant lesions had a stronger degree of enhancem ent than benign lesions, and an intermediate signal enhancement is seen in D CIS. Quantitative analysis of enhancement levels in CESM is a feasible practic e comparable to MRI in the pre-operative assessment of women with breast cancer. Limitations: Premenopausal patients did not have CESM timed with cycle, possibly affecting the enhancement ratio. Ethics committee approval: This has been peer reviewed locally.

N. Chalazonitis; Athens/GR (christofis.ch@gmail.com) Purpose: (1) To evaluate if the cancer detection rate in our institution for BI- RADS 3 lesions was less than 2% and (2) to assess i f the detection rate could be improved by using contrast-enhanced digital mamm ography (CEDM). Methods or Background: A total of 473 BI-RADS 3 patients depicted on screening mammogram from 2018 to 2020 were collected from our files. All the patients consented to undergo CEDM and biopsy at th eir next hospital visit. Contrast enhancement intensity was categorised as f ollows: (a) type 0: no enhancement; (b) type 1: moderate or intense enhanc ement; and/or (c) type BE: background enhancement. Pathology results confi rmed 473 lesions in total. Results or Findings: 18 (3,81%) out of the 473 lesions were diagnosed as malignant. The mean age of the patients was 56.22 y ears. On the contrary, 455 (96.89%) lesions were benign. The mean age of t hese patients was 51.04. Using CEDM's technique data a total of 5 (1.95%) out of 256 lesions with Type 0 enhancement were diagnosed as malignant and 251 ( 98.05%) were benign. Additionally, a total of 13 (5.99%) out of 217 lesi ons with any type of enhancement were proved as malignant and 204 (94.01%) were proved as benign. No enhancement of a BI-RADS 3 lesion at CED M technique shows 1.95% possibility to be malignant, which is 1.86% b etter than digital mammography alone. Conclusion: Our study indicates CEDM' s added value in BI-RADS 3 lesions evaluation regarding the positive impact on more ac curate staging in the first categorisation. The use of CEDM on a BI-RADS 3 lesi on could potentially predict more accurate benign entities based on thei r type of enhancement and thus play a key role as first-line mammography and reduce the recall rates.

Neeter*\u00b9, Q. Raat\u00b2, J. E. Purpose: To provide a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) versus standard contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonanc e imaging (CE-MRI). CE-MRI is currently considered the most accurate im aging modality for breast cancer detection, but it is not the primary imaging modality in breast imaging. Like CE-MRI, CEM enables tumour visualisation by co ntrast accumulation. CEM seems to be an attractive substitute for CE-MRI for various reasons. Methods or Background: This systematic search focused on the diagnostic accuracy in women with suspicious breast lesions on prior imaging or physical examination and in those who have undergone both CE -MRI and CEM. CEM had to be performed on a commercially available sys tem. The MRI sequence parameters had to be described sufficiently to ensu re that the standard CE- MRI sequences were used. Pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were estimated using bivariate mix ed-effects logistic regression modeling. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves for CEM and CE-MRI were also constructed. Results or Findings: Six studies (607 patients with 775 lesions) met the predefined inclusion criteria. Pooled sensitivity w as 96% for CEM and 97% for CE-MRI. Pooled specificity was 77% for both modalities. for CEM and for CE-MRI. Between-study heterogenei ty expressed as the I2-index was substantial with values over 80%. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of CEM for diagnostic workup in women with suspicious breast lesions is quite similar to that of CE-MRI regarding sensitivity and specificity. However, the pooled DO R estimates indicate higher overall diagnostic performance of CE-MRI compared t o CEM. Limitations: Limited number of studies in meta-analysis.

Methods or Background: Patients with suspicious breast lesions (BIRADS >3) found on digital mammography, ultrasound or mag netic resonance in a period between January 2013 and February 2022 were enrolled. All those patients underwent CESM prior to the breast biopsy. All the lesions were scored using a 4-point scale regarding the degree o f contrast enhancement (0 = no contrast enhancement, 1 = minimal, 2 = moderat e, 3 = marked). Scores 2 and 3 were considered predictive of malignity. The histological results were considered the gold standard in the evaluation of r elationship with the degree of enhancement. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 378 Results or Findings: 377 breast lesions were found in 321 patients. The sensitivity of the degree of contrast enhancement i n the prediction of the malignancy of breast lesion in CESM was 78.7 %, the specificity was 90.6 %, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 94.2% and t he negative predictive value (NPV) was 68.6%. The diagnostic accuracy was 82.8%. Excluding in situ malignant lesions, sensitivity was 82.5%; specifici ty was 90.6%; negative accuracy was 85.5%. Conclusion: The degree of contrast enhancement of the lesions i n CESM may help to predict the malignancy potential of the breast lesions. CESM performance is better in predicting breast lesion w ith infiltrating component. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Pasicz\u00b2, To assess the accuracy of a novel system of ultrasound (US) classification of lymph nodes - Lymph Node Reportin g and Data System (LN- RADS) for differentiation between malignant and benign lesions. Methods or Background: This retrospective multiparametric analysis comprised 512 US examinations (gray scale and colou r Doppler) in oncology patients with suspected lymph node metastases. Afte r evaluation (by two readers) of lymph node diameter, diameter ratios, c ortical thickness, sinus diameter, shape, margin, echogenicity, homogeneity and vascular architecture each lesion was (steatotic node), LN-RADS 3 (reactive node), LN-RAD S 4, consisting of 4a (mild possibility of malignancy) and 4b (high possi bility of malignant) and LN- RADS 5 (definitely malignant). All observations wer e correlated with histopathology results. The diagnostic performance of this classification system was validated using Wilcoxon rank sum test and ROC analysis. Cohen's Kappa statistic test and percent agreement were used to t est interrater reliability. Results or Findings: Pathology results confirmed 282 malignant and 230 benign lymph nodes. Proposed LN-RADS system yielded 84% sensitivity, 86% specificity, 85% accuracy, 88% positive predictive value, 82% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of malignant lym ph node (45 false negative and 32 false positive results were noted, including 6 benign nodes classified as LN-RADS 5). Comparison of morphological features revealed that the largest area under the ROC curve was seen for cortical thic kness (0.87). Cohen's Kappa test showed substantial agreement between rea ders (77.3%). Conclusion: Proposed novel system of classification of lymph nodes (LN- RADS) showed adequate accuracy and positive predict ive value, facilitating diagnosis of malignancy. However, further studies c omprising large patient samples are necessary to validate our results. Limitations: The proposed system incorporates one imaging modali ty (US) and applies only to superficial lymph nodes. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

R. Marticorena Garcia*, T. Sack, C. Neelsen; Berlin/DE (stephan.marticorena-garcia@charite.de) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to improve the respons e to treatment in solid tumours (RECIST 1.1) by adding multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) based viscoelasticy for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes. Methods or Background: In this prospective study 25 benign and 82 metastatic lymph nodes were examined by multifreque ncy MRE at 1.5 T using tomoelastography post-processing at frequencies of 30, 40, 50 and 60 Hz providing shear wave speed (SWS) in m/s as a surrogate of soft tissue stiffness. Short axis diameter (SAD) with a cut-off of 10 mm for determination of a benignity according to RECIST 1.1. was used as the imaging reference standard. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT/MRI was used as the reference standard for the determination of metastatic lymph nodes of histopathologically confirmed primary tumors. Diagnostic performance of MRE was evaluated by ROC-AUC analysis, and predictive v alues by generalised linear mixed models and binary logistic mixed model s. Results or Findings: Metastatic lymph nodes (1.90\u00b10.57 m/s) were stiffer compared to benign lymph nodes (0.98\u00b10.20 m/s) with an excellent AUC=0.95 and best cut-off of 1.32 m/s was calculated. Accord ing to a conservative approach with a specificity of 1.0, the sensitivity (SAD / MRE / MRE+SAD, 0.56 / 0.84 / 0.88), negative predicate value (0.41 / 0. 66 / 0.71) and overall accuracy (0.66 / 0.88 / 0.91) increased by using MRE and again higher combining MRE with SAD. Conclusion: Non-invasive multifrequency MRE has proven to be a suitable imaging technique for quantifying the viscoelastici ty of lymph nodes by generating elastograms with high resolution. Viscoelasticity provides an important contribution to the accurate determination of malignant lymph nodes, particularly in small lymph nodes with a SAD below 10 mm.

Wang*\u00b9, X. L. Hongbing\u00b9, Y. primary tumour and fibroglandular tissue (FGT) based on pharmacokinetic dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and clinical factors for preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer patients. Methods or Background: This study retrospectively enrolled 186 breast cancer patients undergoing pretreatment pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI with positive (n = 93) and negative (n = 93) SLN. Radiom ic features were extracted from tumour and FGT, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, minimal redundancy maximum relevance, least absolute shrink age selection operator and backward stepwise multivariate logistic regress ion were used for feature selection. Logistic regression models of tumour and FGT were constructed. The radiomics signatures were further combined with clinical factors with independent prediction ability for combined model. Prediction performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) , calibration and decision curve analysis. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs ) of models were corrected by 1000-times bootstrapping method and compared. Results or Findings: The AUCs of tumour model and FGT was obtained By f urther FGT signatures with progesterone rece ptor (PR) status, a nomogram was developed and showed better predictive ability for SLN status (AUC 0.839 [95% CI, 0.783-0.895]). The IDI and NRI indices also showed FGT and PR improved the prediction performance of SLN s tatus in breast cancer (all p<0.05). Conclusion: integrating DCE-MRI radiomics signature of tumour and FGT and PR expression has the potential to predict SLN status.

Grueneisen*, M. Herrmann, L. Umutlu; Essen/DE Purpose: To investigate the potential of PET/MR-derived para meters for the prediction of therapy response of isolated limp per fusion with melphalan and alpha-TNF (TM-ILP) in patients with soft-tissue sar comas (STS). Methods or Background: A total of 47 patients with the verification of a s oft- tissue sarcoma manifestation were prospectively enr olled for 18F-FDG PET/MR examination prior to neoadjuvant TM- ILP. The study protocol comprised the acquisition of DG PET- tumour segmentation, 17748 quantitative imaging features were extracted and tested for significance by a \u00b2-test. Statistical modelling was performed using R andom Forests and evaluated by repeated 5-fold cross-validation. Hist opathological results after subsequent tumour resection served as reference standard and patients were categorised as responders/non-responders based on t he grading scale by Salzer-Kuntschik. Results or Findings: Histopathological analysis categorised 28 patients as therapy responders (Grade I-III) and 19 patients as non-responders (Grade IV- VI). For the differentiation between therapy response and non-response to TM- ILP, receiver operating characteristic analysis rev ealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71. Furthermore, statistical analy sis showed a positive predictive value of 76% to identify therapy responders in our patient cohort and a specificity of 74% to correctly define patients as non-responders. Conclusion: Our preliminary results demonstrate the potential t o predict therapy response of soft-tissue sarcomas under TM-I LP with a non-invasive imaging procedure, which has high impact on further treatment and patients' prognosis. Accordingly, besides primary tumour staging, 18F-FDG PET/MRI may have the potential to enhance the comprehensive pre-therapeutic evaluation of STS and improve patient therapy management.

Tolan\u00b9, PIR (polyp identification rate) defines the rate th at polyps are detected at CT colonography (CTC) and is equivalent to the polyp (PDR) at colonoscopy. A higher polyp identific ation rate is a proxy measure of quality of interpretation particularly i f combined with an adequate positive predictive value. We analysed single CTC r eporting by an experienced CT Radiographer in comparison with published standards from the British Society of Gastrointestinal Radiology (BSGAR) 2021 guidelines and experienced gastrointestinal radiologists to evaluate whether this should be developed more widely in healthcare. Methods or Background: Proforma reports for 1798 CT colonography examinations from 2019 were analysed using English Bowel Cancer Screening programme reporting codes. All CTC reporters with m ore than 100 cases were included in analysis. The PIR and PPV were calculat ed using the BSGAR methodology. Results or Findings: 7 reporters were identified who reported 1786 examinations (mean 255, range 144-463). Mean PIR wa s 21.44% (range 14.58-32.10%) with one reporter exceeding the \"adeq uate\" 13% BSGAR standard and remaining 6 exceeding the \"aspirational\" 16% standard. All reporters were above the lower 2 standard deviation limit of the mean while one reporter exceeded the upper 3 SD limit. Mean PP V was 88.67% (range 76.47-100%) with 2 exceeding the minimum 80% BSGAR standard and 4 exceeding the aspirational 90% standard. The radiographer exceeded the aspirational PIR and minimum PPV standards. Conclusion: Significant variation exists between reporters in high performing symptomatic CTC services. Individual professional background does not define performance. Robust methods should be developed to identify and support reporters with lower PIR and PPV to improve outcomes. Limitations: The status of this work as a retrospective, singlec entre study was identified as a limiting factor. Ethics committee approval: A service evaluation waiver was granted.

Methods or Background: We assessed the effect of clinical characteristics (body mass index, obesity, age, gender, diverticular disease, previous abdominal surgery), and procedure-related factors ( type of laxative, fecal tagging agent, the technologist conducting the study) on insufficient colon distention frequency after scanning in two positions in 162 patients (53 (32.7%) men, with the median age 75 years (Q1-Q3 67-80 year s)) who underwent CTC for colorectal cancer screening. Results or Findings: Insufficient distention after two scans was observed in 25 cases among the 162 patients (15.4%). Multivaria ble analysis identified that an increase in age by 1 year increases insufficient distention chances by 1.07 times (95% CI: 1-1.14), and presence of diverticula increases insufficient distention chances by 3.01 times (95% CI: 1.16-7.81 ). The resulting regression model is statistically significant (p=0.001). Conclusion: Chances of insufficient colon distention in CT colonography depend on patients' age and presence of diverticula . The results of our study have important implications for clinical practice, including special training of technicians that can reduce the frequency of insuff icient colon distention and avoid unjustified additional scanning when distenti on is adequate. Limitations: The retrospective design of the study was identifie d as a limitation. In addition, the study does not assess the influence of the insufficient distention frequency on the diagnostic effectivenes s of CTC. Also, the study does not evaluate the effect of an antispasmodic on the insufficient colon distention frequency. A further limiting factor was the manual method of distention with room air.

L. Xie, P. Zhou, *X. Chen*; Chengdu/CN (20shenbaise@163.com) Purpose: To study whether the intravoxel incoherent motion ( IVIM) parameters could be used to assess the neurovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis in resectable rectal cancer. Methods or Background: Retrospective study 103 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent conventional MR sequenc es and IVIM sequence (b=0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1 000, 1200 s/mm2) and who underwent radical surgery within one week of MRI. T umour IVIM parameters (D, D*, and f) were measured and calculated. According to the pathology, patients were divided into four groups, namely, wit hout neurovascular invasion (group 1), only neural invasion (group 2), only vas cular invasion (group 3), both neural and vascular invasion (group 4). the ROIs we re determined on both diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted MR images. Mann- Whitney U tests were used to analyse the differences of parameters (D, D *, and f) between the four groups, and the difference between patients with an d without lymph node metastasis. Results or Findings: The F values in group 1 and group 4 were (157.04\u00b134.47) vs (139.86\u00b127.08) (p =0,015), and they were (161.23\u00b129.68) vs (139.86\u00b127.08) (p =0,009) in group 2 and group 4. Whereas, the differences of other IVIM parameters between those groups all s howed no statistically significant differences (p>0.05). Besides, all of t he tumour IVIM parameters (D, D*, and f) had no significant differences between p atient with and without lymph node metastasis (p>0.05). Conclusion: The F value of resectable rectal cancer on IVIM might be useful for the evaluation of neurovascular invasion. Limitations: The sample is small.

Zhou; Chengdu/CN Purpose: To explore the application value of T2WI imaging-based radiomics features in predicting KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer. Methods or Background: This retrospective study consisted of patients with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer (n=99). Patients underwent KRAS mutation detection and MR-T2WI scan of magnetic res onance before treatment. The patients were divided into a trainin g group (n=68) and a validation group (n=31). Imaging features were extr acted from ROIs using AK software. The training group was dimensionally reduced by using the LASSO A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 381 algorithm, and the radiomics label was established. Univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression and backward stepwise logistic regression were used to construct the rad score mod el, clinical variable model and clinical variable + rad score model. ROC and DC A curve were drawn to evaluate the predictability. Results or Findings: In the training group, there were 36 cases of KRAS mutant and 32 cases of wild type; In the validation group, there were 16 cases of KRAS mutant and 15 cases of wild type. In the tr aining group and the validation group, there was no significant differen ce in the selected clinical characteristics between the two groups with differe nt KRAS gene mutation status (p>0.05). A total of 395 radiological featur es were extracted from the delineated ROIs, and three steady texture features are retained by feature selection to construct the model. The AUC of the tr aining group was 0.789, 0.674 and 0.823; within the validation group it was 0.750, 0.633 and 0.742. The specificity of the training group was 0.812, 0.594 and 0.625; within the validation group it was 0.600, 0.467 and 0.733. The sensitivity of the training group was 0.694,0.722 and 0.889; within the validat ion group it was 0.875, 0.750 0.625. Conclusion: The radiomics model based on preoperative T2WI has a certain potential in predicting KRAS status of colorectal c ancer. Limitations: The number of cases in our training group and validation group is not enough. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the ethics committee.

Reid*, A. M. Lee, R. Dunne, M. M. Morrin; Dubli n/IE Purpose: Learning Objectives 1) To provide a pictorial review of postoperative a ppearances of the rectum and adjacent structures following TAMIS for T1/T2 r ectal tumours. 2) To highlight the potential appearances of postoperative scarring/fibrosis and the importance in distinguishing this from disease recurrence. 3) To describe the evolutional change in MR appearances of the postoperative rectum with time. Methods or Background: Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is increasingly utilised in the management of early rectal cancers (1). Post- operative surveillance plays an important role in t his patient cohort, ensuring early identification of any potential recurrence. W ithin our institution, a tertiary referral centre for rectal surgery, we perform an i nitial rectal MRI 6 months postoperatively with further MRI at 12, 18 and 24 m onths (2). Here we provide a pictorial review of potential postoperative appea rances of the rectum. Results or Findings: A wide variety of postoperative findings can be ide ntified following TAMIS. Fibrosis and scarring along the rectal wall resection site is to be expected. Associated architectural distortion, extending to involve the mesorectal fat, mesorectal fascia and pelvic side w all can be encountered to varying degrees. These architectural changes and th e degree of postoperative fibrosis is often related to preoperative tumour si ze and extent of resection. Fibrosis and the associated T2 signal abnormality generally demonstrate involutional change with time. Diffusion-weighted i maging can be a useful adjunct in distinguishing postoperative fibrosis fr om tumour recurrence. Conclusion: MRI plays an important role in surveillance post-TA MIS and distinguishing tumour recurrence from benign postoperative change is challenging. A good understanding of the potential postoperative appearances of the rectum is essential in allowing the interpre ting radiologist to identify areas of concern. Limitations: TAMIS is a relatively new modality, long term follow-up imaging on this patient cohort is lacking. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Voormolen*, Edegem/BE (maurits.voormolen@uza.be) Purpose: How many and which complications and complaints occ ur up to a month after cerebral angiography. A limitation of c urrent studies is the lack of follow-up after hospital discharge. Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis of electronic patient records between 2006-2012 of 1250 cases of patients who underwent cerebral angiography. Prospective analysis of 78 patients who had cerebral angiography from January 2020 until April 2021 with standardised questionnaires (RAND-36 and EQ-5D-5L) and VAS for pain and general health scores, respectively, pre procedure and 1 day, 1 week and 1 month post procedure. Results or Findings: Complications, mainly neurological, due to cerebral angiography in retrospective analysis occurred in 0.9%. Permanent complications were seen in 0.2%. These results are slightly lower compared to literature. No significant risk factor was found. C omplications occurred mainly in women and patients older than 52 years. Prospect ive study showed 5 patients (6,4%) with transient complaints, particul arly headache and groin haematoma, up to a week post procedure. Overall, 33% of patients indicated an impact on mobility, daily life activities, self care, pain and mental health the first week after angiography. However, patients indicated significantly better health and physical scores one month post procedure compared to before procedure. Conclusion: Cerebral angiography causes very limited (neurologi cal) complications. A third of patients experience trans ient complaints the first week after examination. Patients feel physically and men tally better a month after cerebral angiography compared to before. Limitations: Patient inclusion was limited due to COVID pandemic . Single-centre results. Not all patients returned al l questionnaires in the prospective study. For retrospective analysis, pati ent data had to be available in the electronic patient record.

Nikolaou, G. Gr\u00f6zinger; T\u00fcbingen/DE Purpose: To investigate the safety and efficacy of rotationa l thrombectomy (RT) for the treatment of infrarenal arterial occlusion in a large single-centre cohort. Methods or Background: This retrospective IRB-approved study included 397 consecutive procedures in 294 patients between Apri l 2010 and December 2019. All patients underwent RT (Rotarex\u00aeS, Straub Medical AG) for infrarenal occlusions of native arteries, arterial stents and/ or bypass grafts. Complications, clinical success, and technical succ ess were assessed. Results or Findings: Symptoms were acute, subacute, and chronic in 47.5% , 22.2% and 30.3% of patients, respectively. Rutherford categories three (23.5%) and four (32.1%) were most common. Target l esions were located in arteries the following characteristics: length >20 cm, 61.5%; af ter bypass surgery, 14.9%; prior size was 6F 88.6% and 8F 11.4%. Additional lysis after RT was required in 24.2% of cases. Subsequent balloon angioplasty or drug-eluting balloon angioplasty was performed in 89.5% of cases. Technical and clinical success rates were 90.9% and 90.4%, respectively, with an improvement in ankle-brachial index, from 0.33\u00b10.29 to A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 382 0.81\u00b10.25. A symptom-free walking distance of more than 200 m was achieved in 78.1% of cases after treatment. Complications oc curred in 38.8% of cases, with peripheral embolism being the most common at 22.4% and requiring further treatment in 65.2% of cases. Dissections an d perforations occurred less frequently in 9.6% and 2.7% of cases, respectively. RT had an overall complication rate of 6.8%. Conclusion: Rotational thrombectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic thromboti c occlusions of infrarenal in-stent occlusions and by pass grafts.

P\u00e1ez Carpio*, F. Zarco, C. Purpose: Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty (BPA) has become an e merging and complementary strategy for chronic thromboembolic hypertension (CTEPH) patients who are not suitable for pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy a nd safety of BPA in patients with non-operable or residual CTEPH during the init ial 5-year experience in a single national referral center. Methods or Background: Fifteen consecutive, non-operable, anatomically suitable, symptomatic patients for CTEPH were ident ified and offered BPA between January 2017 and December 2021. Baseline as sessment was performed using pulmonary haemodynamics, New York H eart Association (NYHA) functional class, natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP). Serial BPA sessions were then performed. All procedures were performed jointly by an Interventional Radiologist and an Interventional Cardiologist. The treatment effect was measured by comparing the same values before and 3- 6 months after all BPA sessions. The Society of Interventional Radiology ( SIR) adverse event classification was used to grade procedure-related complications. Results or Findings: A total of 76 procedures were performed, with a median of 5 BPA sessions per patient (range, 4-7). Mean pg/mL, p=0.65) tended to improve too. No deaths or major complications requiring invasive ventilation were r eported. The most common complication was lung injury (mild to moderate hemoptysis or transient hypoxaemia). Conclusion: In our initial experience, BPA significantly improv es cardiopulmonary haemodynamics with an acceptable safety profile in patients with non-operable or residual CTEPH.

Methods or Background: This study was a retrospective assessment of radiological examinations and clinical data of pati ents who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for AIS at our institution between November 2015 and December 2018. We included all the patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy due to an occlusion of a large vessel in the anterior circulation, underwent baseline CTA and who were available for o utcome assessment at 3 months post-procedure. Collateral status assessment was performed on singlephase CTA. Patients were divided into two gro ups based on the collateral status: good collaterals - score 2-3 and poor collaterals - score 0-1. The primary clinical outcome was the functional independence defined as 2 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Results or Findings: A total of 92 patients were included in the analysi s. A group with good collaterals had a significantly higher chance for favourable clinical outcome than a group with poor collaterals (64.9% vs 20.6%). The adjusted odds ratio for 11.4 06 (95% CI: 3.452 - 37.681). Moreover, 90-day mortality was significant ly lower in patients with good collaterals (3.5% vs 23.5%). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurred vs 1.7%). Conclusion: In this singlecentre, real-life study we proved that baseline CTA collateral status is a robust determinant of better functional outcome and lower mortality after endovascular treatment in acute isc haemic stroke.

Foppen*, I. C. Van Der Schaaf, F. H. P. van Lee uwen, D. H. Verlind, L. F. D. van Vulpen, H. Vogely, M. Barentsz; Utrecht/NL Purpose: Haemophilia is characterised by recurrent hemarthrosis due to a lack of clotting factor VIII or IX, causing end-end stag e arthropathy in relatively young patients. Total knee replacement may be compl icated by postoperative bleeds despite costly clotting factor therapy. Preoperative angiographic embolisation is expected to reduce synovial hyperaemia and may limit postoperative hemarthrosis. The aim of this study w as to evaluate the effects of preoperative embolisation on synovial hyperaemia and compare these findings with embolisation procedures for the treat ment of severe hemarthrosis. Methods or Background: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients wi th haemophilia who underwent periarticular catheter angiography between January 2009 and December 2020 were evaluated after written informed consent was provided. Patient characteristics and c omplications within 3 months after surgery were extracted from patient records. Synovial hyperemia on pre- and post-embolisation angiography was scored by an experienced interventional radiologist. Results or Findings: 46 angiography procedures in 27 patients were evaluated. The median age at the time of the angiog raphy was 54.4 14/16 (88%) joints after was reduced by embolisation (92%) with severe j oint bleeding episodes; however, residual hyperaemia after embolisation was more severe compared to preoperative embolisation safely reduces majority of joints.

CT and cine-MRI are the most common imaging modalities for T staging, w ithout any consensus about the superiority of one over the other. The ai m of our study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhance d CT and cine-MRI in the preoperative assessment of mediastinal tumour invas ion of nearby cardiovascular structures. Methods or Background: We conducted a single-centre, prospective study on 37 patients affected by primary malignancy contacti ng the mediastinal structures [49% of cases and cine-MRI, followed by surgery. On CT, a circumferential contact between tumour and vessels >90\u00b0, the absence of an adipose cleavage between the two and blurring of epicardial profile confirmed invasion. Cine-MRI criteria for suspected mediastin al invasion were the absence of sliding motion and of \"India-ink\" artefact between the mass and the adjacent structures. The histological and surgical report were used as reference standard for invasion. Results or Findings: Histopathology confirmed infiltration in 17/27 cases. Cine-MRI showed a significantly higher sensitivity (94.12% vs. 17.65%) and accuracy (64.86% vs. 54.05%) and lesser specificity (40% vs. 85%) in identifying infiltration, with a greater NPV (89% v s. 55%). Conclusion: Cine-MRI provides a more reliable preoperative staging of advanced mediastinal tumours by means of a higher N PV, leading to a better shaping of surgical approach and patient management .

Ground -truth labels consisted of corrected AI segmentations by medical experts, whic h were further reviewed/adjusted by an expert thoracic radiologist . Results or Findings: Our AI algorithm was trained in n=97 and tested in n=24 subjects that were part of the multicenter NVALT19 trial (total n=121). We found a significant correlation between the ground- truth and the AI-predicted volumes of 0.99 (spearman r, p<0.0001), and an over lap between these volumes of 0.84 (DSC, CI: 0.79 - 0.89). Preliminary results suggest 25% volume increase/decrease cutoff for both progre ssive disease and partial response respectively. Compared to mRECIST, AI volume monitoring using these cutoffs was able to detect progression earlie r in n=9/15 cases, at the same time in n=5/15 and later in n=1/15 cases. Conclusion: The results suggest that our AI model reaches excel lent performance in CT-based volumetry of MPM and that automatic AI volumetry is promising for the follow-up of patients with MPM. Limitations: Compared to fully manually annotated CT scans, our method of correcting AI-segmentations results is an overestim ation of the performance of the AI.

Node-RADS was proposed to standardise and improve nodal categorisation. We aimed to assess the performance of Node-RADS scoring in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) agai nst histopathology. Methods or Background: Following ethical approval, staging thoracic CTs of surgically resected NSCLC patients were visually as sessed by two radiologists in consensus. The presence and location of suspicious nodes were noted; the largest visually abnormal and indeterminate node per patient was also scored as per Node-RADS and compared to histopathology. Results or Findings: 65 consecutive patients (68\u00b19 years; 34 male; all S tage I/II) who underwent surgery were included. (18/ radiologist- detected abnormal nodes; all were Node-RADS 4/5, i.e. no histopathologically positive node was scored as Node-RADS 2/3. Of the 26 radiologist-defined indeterminate nodes, 20 (77%) were Node-RADS 2 or 3, i.e., concordant; 4 were Node-RADS 4; 2 were positive in Against a histopathology reference standard, Node-RADS appropriately decreased nodal staging in six patients. Node-RADS also upgraded indeterminate nodes correctly in two patients. Limitations: Only one abnormal node per category was assessed per station per patient.

Matthews, K. Dwivedi, A. J. Swift, J. Taylor, P. Metherall, K. Hocking, Shahin, S. Holt, *C. S. Johns*; Sheffield/UK (chrisjohns@doctors.org.uk) Purpose: Lung cancer is common and has a poor outcome. Ident ification on radiographs (CXR) may help with early diagnosis and improve survival. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to help. We assessed a CE marked AI algorithm that aims to identify malign ant lung nodules on chest radiographs. The algorithm has not yet been tested in an unselected consecutive clinical cohort. We assessed the algori thm's performance in primary-care-referred chest radiographs, acquired i n a large teaching hospital. Methods or Background: A retrospective service evaluation of consecutive CXRs requested by primary care from 1/7/2020 to 26/ 02/21 was performed. The radiologist report was interrogated and assigned as positive or negative for a malignant nodule. Where there was disagreement between radiology report and AI algorithm, a second read was performed by sp ecialist cardiothoracic consultant radiologists. A final endpoint of a diagnosis of cancer made in MDT over the subsequent 6 months was also used. The spe cificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) f or the algorithm and radiologists in the identification of malignant pul monary nodules were calculated. Results or Findings: 5722 CXR were assessed. The algorithm and reporting radiologist identified 1001 and 158 potential malignant lung nodules, respectively. In total, 92 cases were diagnosed wit h cancer. The AI had sensitivity 0.63 (0.52-0.73); specificity algorithm had a similar NPV but a lower PPV and specificity than the reporting radiologist, whi ch could potentially result in significant over investigation. Limitations: Retrospective data; \"real-life\" challenges with ground truth.

Schwarz-Nemec; Vienna/AT RPS 2211-3 Analysis of current practices in the investigation of suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage: is a negative CT head wit hin 6 hours of onset enough to rule out SAH? *R. Banerjee*, M. T. Macmillan; Edinburgh/UK (Rohan.Banerjee@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk) Purpose: The national institute of health and care excellenc e (NICE) propose that patients with a normal CT head within 6 hours of onset of symptoms require no further investigations for suspected sub arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). We aimed to assess current practice in inves tigating SAH and assess the accuracy of CT head for identifying SAH. Methods or Background: Data was collected retrospectively on patients who underwent CT head for suspected SAH in NHS Lothian in May, June and July 2021. Patients were selected if \"SAH\", \"subarachnoi d haemorrhage\" or \"thunderclap\" were mentioned in the CT head request . The reference standard was either lumbar puncture (LP), CT angiogram (CTA) or catheter angiogram (DSA). A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 385 Results or Findings: The final cohort included 157 patients. 44 (28%) patients underwent LP, 19 (12%) CTA, and 5 (3%) DSA. Median time from symptom onset to presentation was 15.52 hours, presentation to CT head request 1.78 hours, CT request to completed 0.77 hours, and completed CT to report 0.45 hours. 33 patients had a negative CT head within 6 hours of onset of symptoms, 4 of which underwent LP (12.1%), 1 CTA (3%). Patients who had CT head within 6 hours, the specificity was 85.7 and negative predictive value (NPV) 100 for detecting SAH. Conclusion: Proposed NICE guidelines could save a significant n umber of investigations for suspected SAH. CT head is specif ic and has a high NPV for SAH within 6 hours. Limitations: The major limitation of this study was the number of patients in the assessment of accuracy. Larger studies could further determine the accuracy of CT head in the investigation suspected SAH.

N. Khoruzhaya*, E. I. Kremneva, Kudryavtsev, A. Vladzymyrskyy; Moscow/RU (khoruanna69@yandex.ru) Purpose: To compare the accuracy of diagnosing stroke and in tracranial hemorrhages (ICH) by clinicians using AI services and by radiologists in the emergency medical service. Methods or Background: Within the framework of the Moscow Experiment on Computer Vision in Radiology, a dataset was created containing 104 anonymised native brain CT scans: 52 with the norm and 52 with the target pathology (stroke and ICH, ratio 1/1). The dataset was verified and processed by AI algorithm with known accuracy characteristics (ROC AUC 0.9). AI performed visual marking of pathological areas of i schaemia and haemorrhage in each study and calculated the probability of hav ing a target pathology. 5 radiologists evaluated the original dataset, 5 clinicians evaluated the dataset with the result of AI work. Responses were collecte d using an online questionnaire. Results or Findings: The first results of the study show that the sensit ivity and specificity of diagnosing stroke and ICH in the radiologist group 90-94%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing stroke and ICH in the gro up of clinicians using AI was 85% and 87%, respectively. When comparing sensitivi ty and specificity between the groups of radiologists and clinicians, a significant difference was not shown (p>0.05). Conclusion: A study was made of the clinical scenario of using AI algorithms by clinicians to assess brain CT for the presence of stroke or ICH in order to make an accelerated decision on treatment tactics. Limitations: The dataset included CT examinations from one scanner model, but had a statistically significant amount of data. Obtaining data after the washout period (1 month) will allow more reliable c onclusions about the effectiveness of AI in emergency care.

Methods or Background: Seventy-seven patients were included in the study. The diagnosis of the sequences was classified into three grades: grade 0 (the sequence has no diagnostic ability), grade 1 (the s equence diagnoses stenosis but does not show focal stenosis itself or membrane formation), and grade 2 (the sequence makes a definitive diagnosis). Stenos is localisations were classified as Cerebral Aquaduct (CA), Superior Medullary Velum (SMV) and SMV+CA. First, the grades were compared without mak ing a differentiation based on localisation. Then, the effect of localisa tion on diagnosis was determined. Results or Findings: In the sequence comparison grade 0 was found 25.4% on the Sag TSE-T2W sequence contrary to other seque nce determine all cases (p<0.05). Grade 2 was detected by HRH-3D-T2W in 98.7% of the cases, while it was detected by VFA-3D-TSE in 69.2% of the cases, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). When investigating localisations, the rate of grade 0 in the Sag TSE-T 2W sequence was statistically higher for the SMV localisation (p<0. 05). Localisation had no effect on diagnosis using the other sequences. Conclusion: In our study, we found that the VFA-3D-TSE and HR-3 D-HT2W sequences were successful in the diagnosis of stenosis. The Sag TSE-T2W sequence has limited diagnostic performance, especi ally at SMV localisation. Limitations: The restricted number of patients is our limitation of the study.

Abeysekera*, B. Ciavarra, J. Wood, J. Yung, K-P . Hwang, C. Walker, J. M. Johnson; Houston, TX/US Purpose: To assess quantitative features of brain MRI in ER and inpatient examinations. Methods or Background: The sample included 496 adults (mean age = 58.6, std 14.5) ER (40) and inpatients (456) receiving br ain MR (281 male, 215 female), including Ax T1, T2, T2 FLAIR, T2*, DWI, T 1 post and 3D T1 post. MRQy software provided quantitative imaging measures. Subjective measures of motion were derived by natural language processi ng (NLP) of radiology reports. ANOVA was assessed for demographic variabl es versus quantitative measures of motion and image quality. The group was separated into quartiles based on quantitative measures and metrics between selected pairs were analysed using a Student's t-test. Results or Findings: Quantitative measures of motion were associated wit h subjective motion measures for T2 FLAIR, T1, 3D T1 post, and T1 post (p < 0.05) but not T2, DTI, and T2*. There was a signifi cant association between motion and male gender (p<0.0001). Motion was not a ssociated with age overall, but there was a significant difference bet ween motion in the third age quartile (62-70, lowest motion) versus the fourth age quartile (71-92, highest motion) (p = 0.045) Quantitative measures of image quality (PSNR, CNR, CJV) were also significant associated with motion (p<0.0001). Conclusion: MRQy revealed that men and older patients have incr eased motion and that increased motion was associated wit h decreases in measures of image quality, including peak signal to noise ratio of the foreground, contrast to noise ratio for shadowing and noise artifacts, a nd coefficient of joint variation between the foreground and background for aliasing and inhomogeneity artifacts. Limitations: Subjective variables of motion and quality were ext racted using NLP and were not qualitatively assessed. Ethics committee approval: The IRB of UT MDACC approved this study.

Haque*, K. Kow, K. S. Tsang; Stoke-on-Trent/UK (mushrulhaque@yahoo.co.uk) Purpose: Demand for medical imaging has significantly increased in the UK with Computed Tomography (CT) becoming the main mod ality used in the assessment of suspected head injuries. We looked at all such CT heads performed in our trust over the course of one month and analysed those that were abnormal to assess for specific links with the clinical factors provided in the history. Methods or Background: A retrospective audit was performed looking at all inpatient CT heads performed over the course of one month between 15th October and 15th November 2021. We then analysed th e reports for the presence of intracranial and/or extracranial injuri es and tried to identify commonly related clinical findings. Results or Findings: 535 CT heads were analysed of which 13.3% (n=71) were abnormal. Almost half of patients (45% n=242) were on some form of anticoagulation and this was found to be the most c ommon indication for requesting a CT head. Of the abnormal scans, bruisi ng around the ears/eyes and retrograde amnesia were the two most common cli nical factors in the history provided, demonstrated in almost 30% of pat ients. 25% of patients found to have an abnormal CT were on some form of a nticoagulation. Conclusion: Within our Trust, being on anticoagulation is by far the most common indication for a CT head overall. However, f acial bruising and retrograde amnesia were found to be the most common clinical factors resulting in an abnormal CT head. Limitations: This audit was limited to a single centre. It would be useful to compare with other centres and their experiences of the same.

Martinoli; Genoa/IT Sonographic classification of Achilles tendon tears and *N. Singla*, S. Choudhary; Birmingham/UK (nehalsingla19@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim was first, to understand basic anatomy of t he Achilles tendon, second, to form a standardised classificati on system of tears of Achilles tendon, and third, to see if the location of the tear or gap in equinus has any impact on management. Methods or Background: We analysed 84 patients who presented to the emergency department following an injury and had a tear on the ultrasound. The study is a retrospective observational study fr om 2009-2021. The tears were further classified on the basis of location an d gap of tear and its correlation with clinical outcome and management. Results or Findings: Age ranges from 22-93 years were included in the st udy, 82% were males. The most common aetiology of tear w as playing sports. 64% of the patients had a full thickness tear. 52% of p atients had a tear in the proximal tendon. Chi square test results proved a s ignificant association between age and tear location and sex and tear loca tion. Out of the 84 patients, only 5 were managed operatively. All 5 ca ses had mid tendon tears. There was significant association between the locat ion of tear and gap in equinus and patients selected for operative managem ent. Also of the 79 patients selected for conservative management, 4 patients had re-rupture and three of those were further operated on. The fourth patient died due to other comorbidities. Conclusion: We can summarise that all patients who had failed c onservative management were managed operatively. The most common ultrasound findings for operative management were mid substanc e tear of the Achilles and a gap of at least >10mm. A further gap of >15mm wer e more suitable for the operation. Limitations: The study was conducted during the covid pandemic and there might be other reasons of delay to surgery. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

A retrospective study with arthroscopic comparison M. K. Meier\u00b9, M. Wagner\u00b2, T. D. related to intraarti cular injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents for direct MR arthrography (MRA) are extremely rare, use of a saline solution could bypass patient concerns and reduce costs. Thus, we compared diagnostic performance of direct MRA of the hip performed with gadolinium contrast agent and saline solution in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. Methods or Background: IRB-approved retrospective study of 140 patients (mean age 34 years, 22% females) with hip pain due to femoroacetabular impingement. 140 patients who either underwent intr hip MRA and subsequent hip arthroscopy were age and gender matc hed. 1.5 T MRI was performed using multiplanar non-fs PD-w TSE sequenc es including standardised application of leg traction (applicati on of 15-23 kg). Two readers assessed labrum- and femoroacetabular cartilage les ions. Arthroscopic diagnosis of chondrolabral damage served as reference. Likert scale and diagnostic performance (accuracy) was compared betw een groups. Results or Findings: Accuracy was comparable between groups for Reader 1 / Reader 2 for of saline MRA in assessing chondrolabral lesions was high and comparable to gadolinium-based MRA underlining the potential role of non-gadolinium based hip MRA. Limitations: One limitation is the retrospective selection of pa tients. Another limitation is that MR arthrography was performed wi th leg traction. Future studies should try to reproduce these finding using conventional direct MR arthrography. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was granted.

Fantoni\u00b9, P. \u00b2Ferrara/IT (daniele.conti@ior.it) Purpose: The aim of this study is a preliminary assessment of cationic contrast agent CA4+ spatial distribution in cartilage of ex vivo bovine samples. Methods or Background: A sub-millimeter scale investigation was conducted on osteochondral plugs (N=18), extracted from tibial and femoral distal ends of bovine stifle joints (n=2). The samples were immers ed in CA4+ solution at fixed concentration for up to 26 hours, and planar images were acquired using a micro-computed tomography apparatus, at different t ime points. The CA4+ A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 387 distribution inside the cartilage and saturation ti me were evaluated. Millimiter scale assessments were performed using a clinical c omputed tomography apparatus on distal-end tibiae of bovine stifle joi nts (N=3). After baseline acquisitions were obtained, samples were immersed i n CA4+ baths at different concentrations (5, 10, 15mgI/ml) for up to 24 hours and imaged. No animals were sacrificed for the aims of this work. Results or Findings: The distribution of CA4+, at sub-millimeter scale, differentiates into three distinct layers inside th e cartilage. It should reflect the spatial distribution of proteoglycans, by which CA4+ molecules are electrostatically attracted. After 24-h diffusion, the iodine concentration reached in cartilage is approximately seven times the CA4+ bath. The saturation time is F95%=2.61\u00b10.83h and T95%=3.14\u00b12.39h, for femoral and tibial samples respectively. Millimeter scale analysis with comput ed tomography confirms contrast enhancement of cartilage after 24-hours im mersion, observed for each contrast medium concentration. Distinct contrast enhancement is reached in different cartilage regions, depending on tissue's local features. Attenuation is observed to increase at higher CA4+ concentration baths ( C5 contrast agent significantly improves cartilage visualisation and its qualitative analysis. The adoption of refer ence assessments (i.e. histology) may enable quantitative measurements of cartilage constituents and features.

D. B. R. Zwiers, G. Kerkhoffs ; Amsterdam/NL (c.d.b.visser@amsterdamumc.nl) Purpose: Anterior knee pain is common, yet the aetiology is often not fully understood. We found dislocation of the anterior intermeniscal ligament (AIL) as a possible cause of anterior knee pain. Dislocat ion was discovered during knee arthroscopy. Literature on the anatomical char acteristics of the AIL is scarce, and to our knowledge there is no data avail able on the clinical relevance or radiologic assessment of AIL pathology . Therefore we aim to learn more about the normal anatomy of the AIL and develop a method to identify dislocation of the AIL on MR imaging. Methods or Background: Preoperative MR images of patients with a perioperatively confirmed dislocated AIL (Group 1) were compared with preoperative MR images of patients without a disloc ated AIL (Group 2). Both groups consisted of 34 patients. In addition to analysing the characteristics of the AIL, spatial measurements were conducted to det ermine the AIL's relative position in the knee joint and identify features that could indicate a dislocated AIL. Results or Findings: Dislocated ligaments were significantly thicker. Th e masterline was found to be a useful tool in detecti ng the position of the AIL. The deviation from the masterline was significantly larger in Group 1 (2.51 vs 1.41 mm). Using a cut-off point of 1.5mm, the masterline test yields a specificity of 74% and sensitivity of 79%. After st ratifying for substantial effusion, the specificity and sensitivity were 96% and 81%, respectively. Conclusion: This study contributed to the current knowledge reg arding the normal anatomy of the AIL. A method was developed t o identify dislocation of the AIL using MR imaging. The test is easily applic able in practice and has high sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic accuracy is higher in the absence of substantial effusion.

Mattone*, S. Perotti, G. Alfieri, G. (monicamattone95@gmail.com) Purpose: Aseptic loosening of cemented prosthetic components is among the most common causes of failure in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) requiring revision surgery. The aim of this study is to analy se the results of a novel experimental model for evaluating the effects of cement polymerisation timing and bone density in trabecular bone penetration dur ing TKA. Methods or Background: Proximal tibial epiphyses were harvested during TKA. After a washing of the tibial epiphyses on the trabecular surface, they were examined with a CT scan to evaluate bone densi ty. Each tibial epiphysis was divided into two hemiportions enclosing the medial and the lateral cancellous bone plane respectively. The two hemiplates were cemented using different polymerisation timings. The samples were subjected to a second CT scan to calculate the maximum and minimum penetrati on peak and the extension of cement penetration area into trabecula r bone. Results or Findings: The extension of the cement penetration area, calculated on 92 CT scans, was on average 69.0 mm2 in the samples processed with early polymerisation timing and 53.4 mm2 in those processed with late polymerisation timing (p<0,0001). At a depth greater than 2 mm the penetrating area was on average 7.0 mm2 and 3.2 mm2 in the samples processed with early and late polymerisation timing , respectively (p<0,02). The maximum cement penetration peak was 4.8 mm and 4.1 mm in the samples processed with early and late polymerisation timing , respectively. Conclusion: The experimental model designed may be suitable to detect significant differences in terms of cement penetrat ion area into trabecular bone using different polymerisation timings. Limitations: There were few samples and intra- and inter-observer variability as well as the time-consuming method were identified as limitations.

Pinto dos workflow l principle in radiology process metrics. Methods or Background: Radiology Information Systems are databases to manage and document medical, administrative, and bi lling information. RIS products may be structured according to the workflow, but they are usually not suited to provide current and retrospective process metrics. RIS databases also store timestamps, which either may be manually set or automatically recorded. However, the information content is usual ly not sufficient to allow for A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 388 a depiction of the process flow. For example, even with accurate arrival time and end time of the exam, it is impossible to calcu late accurate waiting times. Additionally and generally, manually set timestamps are inadequate to build a reliable model of the process flow. Results or Findings: We have developed Radcount, a workflow dashboard that exhibits the progression of radiological exami nation and reporting in a team-specific and visually appealing manner. Radcount extracts automatically recorded and - if unavoidable - manually set time i nformation from RIS and DICOM. Thereby we can build a comprehensive model of the patient flow and occupancy of the imaging machinery. Utilising a mac hine learning algorithm we are also able to predict future patient flow. Radcount is specifically tailored to our RIS environment. A main obstacle for further sc aling is the lack of standardised semantic and logical infrastructure. T he logical construct should be shareable and comparable between systems, instit utions, within a country, and at an international level. Therefore, introduct ion of simple and understandable modelling language is requisite. We found CWL to be suited, because it is already used in complex computational environments. We will be presenting a clinical CWL extension for the radiology workflow. Conclusion: Standardisation of workflow nomenclature is desirable and feasible in radiology.

We present our results from a specifically designed workflow that allows two different radiologists to report the MR scans and contour the lesions on the same day of the MR acquisition. Methods or Background: Sixty scans of men referred for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer were prospectively acquired. One am ongst seven different genitourinary radiologists (all highly experienced in prostate MRI reading) reported the scan and contoured the prostate and th e lesions according to their clinical rota using a semi-automated workflow (MIM\u00ae ) for the first read. Only two out of seven radiologists performed the second read using a customised version of the workflow for quality assurance reasons. A dedicated structured report including a biopsy plan was created with annotated images sent to PACS for use during the multidisciplinary team meet ings and targeted biopsies if needed. Results or Findings: Concordance between the first and the second read occurred in 41 out of 58 scans. In the 19 discordant cases, lesion downgrade occurred in 10 patients (the majority of lesions we re downgraded from Likert 3 to Likert 2). New lesions were contoured in the rem aining 9 patients during the second read. 17 out of 60 patients were biopsied an d cancer (Gleason 3 + 4) was found in 11 patients. Conclusion: A dedicated semi-automated workflow streamlined our one-stop clinic and allowed the radiologists to perform a double reporting of prostate MR scans on the same day, contouring the lesions and producing a standardised structured report that includes the biopsy plan to assist the clinician performing the procedure.

Younis*; Cleveland, WI/US (kh.younis@gmail.com) Purpose: We present a prototype that implements a modular, c loud-based, and interoperable analysis pipeline in reporting workflows of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Different parts of the pipeline can be exchanged due to the modular software architecture for protot yping/testing while ensuring the reliability of the remaining elements and appli cability to different domains. We integrate image viewing, machine learning algori thms results representation, structured reporting, and evaluatio n by using custom user interfaces and different verified ML algorithms. Methods or Background: Our implementation consists of different modules: a PACS connection, a viewer application, a machine learning (ML)-based image interpretation pipeline, a structured reporting edi tor, a traditional annotation/processing pipeline, and a diverse publi cly available database. We use DICOM SR (TID 1500) as a standardised mechanism to store measurements reports for the ML algorithms and manu al annotation to ensure consistent representation and enable repeatability of the effectiveness of evaluation. Mapping of the DICOM SR to other format s such as HL7 FHIR resources ensures the interoperability with other s ystems dispersed at the radiology department and hospital enterprise healthcare system. Modules can be distributed across the network or cloud-based to eliminate the need for expensive hardware and the need for moving large datasets. Results or Findings: A proof of concept with sample MRI database from The Cancer Image Archive for the prostate showed that m easurements data can be converted to the data store for significantly faste r retrieval of relevant data, more consistent quantitative measurements comparison as compared to the traditional system, and more accurate reporting. Conclusion: A standardised, modular, and network-enabled system is a viable tool for integrating artificial intelligence algori thms into clinical workflow, assessing the performance, and improving the qualit y of the department and the AI algorithms by monitoring and giving feedback .

B. Wang*, A. Rashiwala, A. Houston, TX/US (Ethan.Wang@utsouthwestern.edu) Purpose: Automated classification of radiology reports is us eful for medical discovery and innovation. In the oncologic communit y, a subset of ambulatory outpatients with cancer are screened for brain metastases using head CT with and without contrast. To assess the utility of the \"without\" portion of the exam, we sought to automate the classification of head CT reports as positive or negative for disease. Furthermore, we aimed to identify specific disease entities within reports. Methods or Background: 739 reports were extracted on outpatients who received head CT with and without contrast at a des ignated cancer centre. The natural language processing model en_ner_bc5cdr_md, pretrained by SciSpacy for disease entity identification, was the n applied to reports for disease extraction. Entities present in the MalaCar ds human disease database were extracted as well, and extracted entities were eliminated if grammatically linked to a negative modifier. Preliminary model pe rformance was assessed on 299 reports in comparison to human observers. Results or Findings: Our model obtained an accuracy of 0.803 in binary classification. Identification of specific entities yielded a sensitivity of 0.455, specificity of 0.825, accuracy of 0.686, precision of 0.611, and recall of 0.455. Conclusion: Our model can classify head CT reports with good ac curacy and possesses potential in extracting finer-grain data. Further development can help contribute to the detection of important radiographic findings from EHRs. Limitations: Diseases referred to using specialist-specific term inology are often missed, and elimination of false positives is complicated by grammatical heterogeneity in disease negation. Nonetheless, est ablishing clearer links between grammar and semantics and training models on radiology-specific reports could mitigate such issues. Ethics committee approval: Local IRB approval was obtained for this research. Individual patient informed consent was w aived. Funding for this study: This study was department-funded.

Romei, *S. C. Fanni*, E. Rocchi, C. A. A. D'Amor De Liperi, E. Neri; Pisa/IT (fannisalvatoreclaudio@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the structured reporting performance of natural language processing based on a deep learning algori thm starting with free- form radiological reports of COVID-19 lung CT. Methods or Background: Two hundred COVID-19 chest CT of the first wave were reviewed by two experienced radiologists. For each exam, the radiologists wrote a free-form text radiological re port and coherently filled the template provided by the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM), which was used as ground truth. E ach structured report presented with 70 categorical or Boolean's variables (yes/no). Natural language processing based on a semi-supervised and not-scalable convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was implemented. In order to analyse the free-form text reports we adopted a Question & Answering (QA) model, more specifically unified QA, to extract predefined items used to automatically fill the SIRM template. The performance of the model in filling structured reports was then compared to the templat e filled by the two radiologists. Results or Findings: The model performance was measured using two parameters: 1. the mean accuracy for each template filled 2. F1 mean score, which is a harmonised average of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) and is frequently used as an overall measure of natural language processing tools performance. As a result, our model achieved 95.8% for both parameters. For some variables the algorithm showed a suboptimal performance that was inferior to the mean value of accuracy and F1 score, mostly due to reports ambiguity in the free-form ra diological reports. Conclusion: Our approach achieved excellent performance for thi s clinical application, suitable in radiological reporting even in other fields, such as oncology or urgent care. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study and the lack of external validation were identified as limiting factors. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the ethics committee.

K. Venugopal*, S. Mahajan; New Delhi/IN (vasanthdrv@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate if there are statistically significant differences in the outputs of a deep learning algorithm on two inferencing workflows, with different unit-processing methods. Methods or Background: The study was performed on DeepCOVIDXR, an open-source algorithm for the detection of COVID19 on chest x-rays. It is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks developed to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs. The algorithm was evaluated using a dataset of 905 chest x-rays containing 484 COVID-positive cases (as determined via RTPCR test) and 421 COVID-negative cases. The algorithm s upports both batch image processing (workflow1) and single image processing (workflow2) for running inferencing. All the x-rays were inferenced using b oth methods. In batch image processing, images were resized (224x224 and 331x33 1) and then the lung was cropped out, but in single image processing, cr opping was done without resizing of images. Results or Findings: We observed a significant difference in the results for the two inferencing workflows. The AUC for COVID cl assification was 0.632 on the bulk image processing pathway whereas it was 0. 769 for the single image processing. There were discordant results in 334 st udies, 164 were classified as positive in workflow1 whereas negative in workfl ow2 whereas 170 x-rays that were classified as negative on workflow1 were classified as positive in workflow2. Conclusion: We report statistically significant differences in the results of a deep learning algorithm on using different inferenc ing workflows. Limitations: With the rising adoption of radiology AI, it is imp ortant to understand that seemingly innocuous changes in proc essing pathways can lead to disastrous clinical results.

Muscogiuri*\u00b9, A. Tariq\u00b2, M. van Assen\u00b9, Disease Reporti ng & Data System score (CADRADs) extracted from radiology reports and non-curated electronic medical records (EMR) data can be used t o forecast 5-year risk of adverse cardiac events (ACE) using machine learning (ML). Methods or Background: We included CCTA images of 2407 patients. Two groups of ACE, ischaemic (ICD-10: I20-25) and other (ICD-10: I30-39) within 5 years of CCTA were considered as outcome. A natural language processing model was used to extract CADRADs from reports. We designed a multimodal ML model that used EMR data (before CCTA exam). Two fusion models were evaluated: an early-fusion model where features from all EMR modalities were concatenated, normalised, and processed through a p redictor; a late-fusion model where cardiac event probabilities, estimated using individual predictors for each EMR modality, were concatenated and passed through a meta- learner. XGBoost was used for early-fusion and as m eta-learner for late-fusion. We fine-tuned hyper-parameters using grid-search. T he models were evaluated using accuracy and F1 scores. Results or Findings: A total of 331 (14%) and 400 (17%) patients had ischaemic or other ACE. Using CADRADs for outcome p rediction resulted in an accuracy of 0.68 and 0.74 for ischaemic and other A CE. F1-scores for no events were 0.79 and 0.84 for both outcome classes and F1-scores for events were 0.32 and 0.19. The early/late-fusion models resulted in similar accuracies of 0.68/0.62 and 0.75/0.72 for ischaemic and other ACE. F1-scores for no events were 0.79/0.75 and 0.84/0.82 for both outcom e classes and F1-scores for events were 0.38/0.27 and 0.43/0.3. Conclusion: ML-CADRADs and EMR data could predict ACE with moderate accuracy. The EMR model shows better performance for event prediction, since more clinical data was included compared to C ADRADs. Limitations: The retrospective design of the study was identifie d as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: The IRB approved the study.

Ponsiglione*, M. Gambardella, R. Green, V. Cant oni, C. Nappi, M. de M. Petretta, A. Cuocolo, M. Imbriaco; Naples/IT (andreaponsiglione@hotmail.it) Purpose: We aimed to determine the weighted mean native T1 v alues by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) of Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) patients and the standardised mean differences (SMD) as comp ared to healthy control subjects. Methods or Background: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted according to the PRISMA statement to retrieve original studies repor ting myocardial native T1 values in AFD patients and healthy controls. A random effects model was used to calculate SMD, and meta-regression analysis was conducted to explore heterogeneity sources. Subgroup analysis was also p erformed according to scanner field strength and sequence type. Results or Findings: From a total of 151 items, 14 articles were included in the final analysis. Overall, weighted mean native T 1 values were 984\u00b147 ms in AFD patients and 1016\u00b126 ms in controls (P<0.0001), with a pooled SMD of - 2.38. In AFD patients there was an inverse correlat ion between native T1 values and male gender (P=0.002) and left ventricul ar hypertrophy (LVH) (P<0.001). Subgroup analyses confirmed lower T1 val ues in AFD patients compared to controls, with a pooled SMD of -2.54, - 2.28, -2.46 for studies performed on 1.5T with modified look-locker inversi on recovery (MOLLI), shortened MOLLI and saturation-recovery single-shot acquisition, respectively, and of -2.41 for studies conducted on 3T. Conclusion: Our findings confirm a reduction of native T1 values in AFD patients compared to healthy controls and point out that the degree of T1 shortening in AFD is influenced by gender and LVH. Although T1 mapping is useful in proving cardiac involvement in AFD patients, there is need to standardise cut-off values according to imaging equipment and protocols. Limitations: AFD is a relatively rare disease, thus limiting the number of subjects included in the investigations. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Asgari, N. Cavus, M. Patten-Hammel; Hamburg/DE (maxim.avanesov@gmx.de) Purpose: To assess early cardiac manifestations in Fabry disease patients (cFDp) and mapping, LGE and CMR feature tracking (CMR-FT) in all cardiac chambers. Methods or Background: Fifty one patients with FD (cFDp=37; vFDp=14) and 14 healthy controls underwent CMR at including steady-state free precession (SSFP), LGE T1 using biventricular longitudinal strain (LV-GLS/RV- GLS), left ventricular circumferential and radial strain (LV-GCS/LV-GRS), and three atrial phases of longitudinal strain (LA/RATotal, LA/RAConduit and LA/RABooster). Results values (951\u00b151ms p<0.001) was observed compared to controls. In vFDp all parameters were comparable to controls. LV-GCS provided the closest area under the curve (AUC) to native T1 mapping (0.84 vs. 0.92, p>0.05) for discrimination of cFDp versus controls. Significantly lower LV-GLS/LV-GCS was found in male compared to female cFDp (-19\u00b14% vs.-22\u00b14 %,p=0.03). In left atrial (LATotal -GLS) CMR-FT can detect impaired cardiac mechanics of cFD p besides native T1 mapping. Non-hypertrophied female cFDp with normal T1 values LATotal -GLS. The FD-associated variants p.D313Y/p.A143T didn't reveal LGE, T1 mapping or CMR-FT. Limitations: No T2 mapping. No regional strain. Small number of patients due to rare disease.

Methods or Background: A cohort of 466 consecutive DCM patients with LVEF 35% who had undergone enhanced CMR imaging were enr olled in this study. The primary endpoint was a composite of SCD or aborted SCD. The secondary endpoints were all-cause mortality, heart transplantation and hospitalisation for heart failure. The risk factors for primary and secondary endpoints were identified by multivariate Cox analy sis and used to create a nomogram. Results or Findings: During a mean follow-up period of 79.4 \u00b129.5 months , a total of 40 and 61 patients reached the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Multivariate stepwise analyses showed that age, family SCD, NYHA, and LGE 7.7% (HR=6.5; 95%CI, 2.8-15.4) the second ary endpoints (all p<0.05). Nomograms for the adverse events were created by these factors. Conclusion: LGE and GLS are new parameters that identify the ri sk of adverse events in DCM patients with LVEF 35%. The nomogram we created using these parameters provides a novel way to clinically assess and risk stratify these patients. Limitations: First, this is a single-centre, retrospective study that may be subject to referral bias. A randomised, controlled trial with a larger sample size is needed to further validate the results of our st udy. Second, the incidence of adverse events in LGE-negative patients was not inc reasingly high, which limited our risk stratification of LGE-negative pat ients.

Kocharyan*, D. P. Overhoff, G. Thater, T. Papavassiliu; Mannheim/DE (k_arpine@yahoo.com) Purpose: The goal of this study was to estimate left ventric ular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions and to evaluate the diag nostic value of myocardial strain analysis in patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis, depending on the stage of pulmonary disease. Methods or Background: CMR examinations of 74 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (stage I n=17, stage II n=44, stage III n=7, stage IV n=6) were retrospectively evaluated. LV and RV functions were estimated and strain analysis was performed by feature tracking (Circle cvi42). The results were compared to the normal values obtained from 24 heal thy controls. Results or Findings: RV ejection fraction (EF) was decreased within the normal range in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis : stage I 51% (P=0.0008); stage II 54% (P=0.006); ); healthy controls. LV EF was significantl y decreased in patients with stage IV sarcoidosis: 51% vs. 67% (P=0.0009). 3D LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly decreased in patients with stage IV sarcoidosis: -7.98 vs -12.67 (P=0.019). 2D RV global radial strain (GR S) and 2D RV global circumferential strain (GCS) were decreased in pati ents with stage IV sarcoidosis 10.37 -6.13 vs -9.72 (P=0.014), respectively. Conclusion: LV and RV functions and strain parameters depend on the stage of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Myocardial strain analysi s may have additional diagnostic value in detection of cardiac sarcoidosi s and outcome. Limitations: Few patients with stage III and stage IV sarcoidosi s.

The occurrence of atrial involvement in this syndrome i s still unclear. Our purpose was to evaluate atrial injury in TTS using bi-atrial strain analysis with a cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking technique (CMR- FT). Methods or Background: We retrospectively enrolled 20 patients with a clinical diagnosis of TTS who performed CMR within 20 days from the onset of symptoms. Cine sequences were analysed using CMR-FT techniques to measure global longitudinal strain (GLS%), global r adial strain (GRS%) and reservoir and conduit strain of both atria. The sam e analysis was performed on 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls and then c ompared. Statistical analysis was assessed with Mann-Witney and correlat ion analysis; results were considered statistically significant when p<0, 05. Results or Findings: All strain parameters were found to be significantl y altered in TTS patients compared to controls. We fo und no significant difference between the right atrium and the left at rium among TTS. GLS% (- 26,9\u00b12,2 -1,6\u00b10,4 vs -1,3\u00b10,3) of the left atrium were significantly reduced in TTS patients compared to controls (p<0,03 for all param eters). Correlation analysis of GLS%, GRS% and srs also an intermediate c FEvs% (P<0.01; r=0.62, 0.64 and analysis with CMR-FT can identify atr ial involvement in TTS and could be a useful tool for the assessment of contractile dysfunction, risk stratification and monitoring of functional recovery during follow-up. Limitations: Retrospective study; population represented only by females; atrial CMR-FT was performed only on longitudinal vi ews (lack of axial view of atria in cine imaging).

Chengdu/CN (1136738957@qq.com) Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the potential prognosti c value of left atrial (LA) strain in left ventricular myocardial n oncompaction (LVNC) and the influencing factors of it. Methods or Background: A total of 95 patients (57 males and 38 females; mean age 37.47\u00b114.46 years) with a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) diagnosis of LVNC were included. LA volume index (LAVI), LA ejection fraction (LAEF) and LA longitudinal strains were measured an d calculated. The primary outcome was incident heart failure (HF), a composit e of first HF hospitalisation, hospitalisation for worsening HF and death from HF. The associations between LA performance and incident HF were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. The influencing factors of LA strain in LVNC were e xplored by linear regression analysis. Results or Findings: During a median follow-up of 32.17 months, HF occur red in 13 (13.68%) patients. Patients with increased LA VI (LAVImax>38.4ml/m2, LAVIpre-a>35.0ml/m2 and LAVImin>30.1ml/m2), decreas ed LAEF (LA passive EF<19.7%, and LA active EF<28. 8%) and decreased LA longitudinal strain ( s<12.7%, e<9.3%, and a<4.4%) had significantly higher risks of HF (all P<0.05). In patients with L VNC, s was associated with s. Conclusion: Among patients with LVNC, LA reservoir strain was a n independent predictor for incident HF. GLS was an i ndependent effector of LA reservoir strain in LVNC. Limitations: This is a retrospective single-centre study with sm all sample size.

The purpose of this study is to present a method to introduce no-blame culture A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 392 in radiology departments in 13 European countries and the impact on safety awareness. Methods or Background: A no-blame culture has been introduced in radiology departments in a European healthcare organisation by various processes of clinical governance and quality functi ons: incident management; clinical audits; clinical governance calls; learning from excellence. Clinical incident analysis with active participation and open discussion between the involved personnel, identification of the root caus e and agreement on the next steps, was performed monthly. During clinical audit s, the centre teams had the opportunity to actively interact and propose improv ement actions which were agreed and implemented. Clinical governance meetings with each country clinical management team as well as meetings with s takeholders from all countries, promoted sharing of experiences, exchang e of ideas and alignment on the next steps. Excellence reports submitted by peers were used to provide positive feedback to the involved persons and the t eams. Results or Findings: Active team involvement and continuous open communication within and between clinical teams proved to be a positive initiative. The number of incident reports increased by 11.2% in the first 6 months and 16% in a 12 month-period. Country team's involvement in discussion making optimised the improvement areas by 40% while the number of excellence reports was increased by 53%. Conclusion: Change of culture in healthcare organisations is a timely process which requires excellent team communication, detail ed planning and commitment. A no-blame approach leads to improved q uality with positive outcomes on safety and experience. Limitations: Pandemic restrictions limited face-to-face meetings .

Pace\u00b9, L. Rabiolo\u00b9, study is twofold. First, to investig ate interest in knowing radiation dose; second, to individuate an effective communication for dose exposure. Methods or Background: A cross-sectional multicentric data collection from 4 different hospitals, two general and two paediatric ones recruiting 1,084 patients (relative to paediatric). A questionnaire was administered anonymously, composed of a brief explanation of radiation use in medical procedure, a patient data section (sex, age, educat ional and working status), and communicating section with four followed differ ent modalities: first, dose in number (mGy, DAP, CTDI and DLP) obtained from the x -ray apparatus. Second, dose in number with a reference range from national DRL. Third, comparison with x-ray equivalent dose and natural background. Fourth, x-ray symbol and a colorimetric scale (from green to red) . The last section assesses patient's comprehension, interest in dose exposure and preferred communication way. Results or Findings: 1009 patients (75 refuse to fill); 173 participants were relatives of paediatric patients. Preliminary infor mation was declared comprehensible, and patients demonstrate interest i n knowing about radiation dose exposure. Modality with symbols was the most u nderstandable without appreciable socio-cultural differences; modality wi th numbers and reference levels (DRL) was preferred by patients with higher socio-cultural background. \"None of those\" was preferred by one-third of our s ample composed of 4 different clusters: female, over 60yrs, lower socio -cultural level and not employed. Conclusion: There is an interest in knowing the radiation dose exposure. Written modality is simple and effective to satisfy this interest. Iconographic modality is better understood; however, it is neces sary to find a clear and effective explanatory model universally understanda ble. Limitations: Patients are not randomised. Administration of the questionnaire before radiological examination by the staff may influence response.

F. Castro a, G. Saldanha; Almada/PT Purpose: To elucidate radiologists doing research on the str engths and weaknesses of linear models, their assumptions and how to interpret their results using a dataset and R software as examples, but that can be extrapolated to other commonly used statistical sof tware. Methods or Background: Linear models are one of the main statistical methods used in radiological research even when the researchers are unaware they are using it: in fact t-tests and ANOVA are ju st linear models. Knowing the assumptions of linear models and how to diagnose wh en they aren't fulfilled will in turn help radiologists become better users of the main statistical methods while doing research and ease communications between them and statisticians. Results or Findings: Using a dataset to elucidate the main assumptions o f the linear model: linearity, independence, equal varian ce and normality, we will show the main commands in R for running a linear model, how to diagnose its problems and how to interpret the coefficients and confidence intervals that result from it. Conclusion: We hope that after this presentation radiologists w ill be better empowered to start their own data analysis projects using statistical software, understand when linear models should or should not be used and better understand the statistical jargon used when speaking with a statistical consultant during a project.

Di Serafino, *V. Sabatino*, F. Iacobellis, F. Ve Naples/IT Purpose: To evaluate the common sources of diagnostic errors in emergency ultrasound (US) usually found in clinical-radiologi cal practice and the useful tips to recognise and avoid them. Methods or Background: Emergency US is a standard emergency radiological skill, often the first course of actio n of the emergency radiologist that plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic assessm ent of patients in the emergency setting. Emergency US is particularly sus ceptible to the errors and the emergency room is a typical scenario for malpractice claims. Results or Findings: We can recognise and classify ultrasound diagnostic errors in emergency US into three groups, that are: (1) Errors dependent on: environmental factors (crowded emergency rooms, lar ge number of examinations with or without character of appropria teness, rapid diagnosis and management); patient (morphotype, lack of cooperati on); technical skill of the sonographer himself (unsuitable training emergency courses). (2) Errors of interpretation: \"bad\" artifacts (lateral lobe artif acts, mirror effect, doubling artifact, refraction, reverberation, image adaptati on artifact; anisotropy); chest artifacts (not contextualised to the clinical data) ; US setting errors (B-mode and color-Doppler); anatomy and generic conditioning (hyp ertrophic diaphragmatic pillar, bladder pseudo masses, inguinal (3) Errors of underestimation: retrope ritoneum (undergoing FAST exam); spleen (partial visualisation and poor attention or interest), poor quality of images produced; inconclusive and synthetic US report. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 393 Conclusion: Following some rules in technique and interpretation, and always integrating emergency US findings into the broader clinical context, most misdiagnosis can be avoided, and thus patients' saf ety can be enhanced. Being aware of a list of common pitfalls may help t o avoid misdiagnoses. Limitations: No limitations were identified. Ethics committee approval: None.

Sathiyakeerthy*, I. M. R. Kandil, G. Gamtkitsul ashvili, N. Akter, H. Ahmad, A. Khan, R. Gauhar, M. Anwar; London/UK Purpose: To clarify the reliability of the PERC scoring syst em in confirming the low probability in those suspected to have a PE, th ereby minimising the need for CT imaging. Methods or Background: Diagnosis/exclusion of PE can be challenging with overuse of CTPA imaging in diagnosis. The PE rule-out criteria (PERC) is utilised to negate the need for workup. A retrospec tive study was conducted at Princess Alexandra Hospital. The study period was f rom August-November 2020 with a total of 128 patients undergoing CTPA i maging for suspected PE, aged <50 years old (18-49 years of age). PERC scores were collated for patients. Results or Findings: 38.2% of all patients had a PERC score 0 and theoretically did not need further investigation. T he remaining patients had a score 1 (scores ranged between 0-3), thereby validating t he requirement for CTPA imaging. Of these 79 patients, 83.5% did not have PE on imaging. In the patients with a confirmed PE, all had a PERC score 1. Reviewing correlation with D-dimer values, of those with a PERC score of 0, 93.7% had a positive d- dimer (cut off >500ng/ml) whereas 6.3% had a negati ve d-dimer value. Conclusion: Given our study, when applying the PERC scores, it can be concluded that this scoring system reliably identif ied those that did not warrant further investigation. Arguably, the PERC score is more useful than D-dimer values in aiding management and could minimise the number of unnecessary irradiative imaging if used in conjunction. The average cost of CTPA imaging is \u00a385 and potentially \u00a33,825 could have been saved for those with a PERC value of 0 despite a positive D-dimer level. Limitations: Aged >50 excluded. Clinical context is not consider ed in combination with values. Small sample size in a ret rospective study. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by Nil.

I. Ribas Mercau*; Sabadell/ES Purpose: COVID-19 required changes throughout the entire health system and diagnostic imaging departments were no exception. These led to a restructuring of the working dynamics of the radiographers' staff. To ensure that these new needs were met, the staff has to be trained and distributed into different areas. Methods or Background: The purpose of this poster is to describe, detail, and illustrate the different changes and decision-makin g carried out by the radiographers' staff due to the COVID-19, as an example of organisation and coordination in a crisis situation. Results or Findings: The staff was divided into two groups. These carried out the activity alternately weekly. Each group was div ided into two teams: \"COVID-19\" and \"No COVID-19\". Also, they were separ ated on the base of the different risk factors they had. Radiographers with potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 due to underlying pathologies were assigned to perform tests on patients without suspicion of COVID-19. Conclusion: It is essential to recognise the role played by radiographers during the pandemic. They were one of the main acto rs on the front line, who has not only lived through grueling working hours w ith changing guidelines but also endured the stress and emotional pressure that this critical situation entails. Limitations: The lack of experience in similar situations was the most important deficiency. This led to a constant need t o adapt to different situations that presented themselves day after day. The continuous improvisation led to a stressful work scenario that included all actors at all levels. Ethics committee approval: In carrying out this work, the author declares that there has been no financial financing or any confli ct of interest. Funding for this study: The ability to adapt for the professionals in a har d- working environment is worthy of any kind of recognition.

Zhong*, M. Lin, X. Xie; Guangzhou/CN Purpose: To establish and validate a nomogram based on multi -modal ultrasound for preoperative prediction of ular arcinoma (HCC). Methods or Background: A total of 287 patients with HCC undergoing surgical resection were prospectively enrolled, inc luding 210 patients in the training cohort and 77 patients in the test cohort. All patients underwent conventional ultrasound (CUS), contrast-enhanced ul trasonography (CEUS), and shear wave elastography (SWE) examination withi n one week before surgery. Taking the result of the histopathological examination as the reference standard, independent factors associated with MVI i n HCC were determined by logistic regression and a nomogram was established and further evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse the prognostic value of histologic MVI Results echogenicity, tumour shape, peritumoral e nhancement in arterial phase and enhancement level in portal venous phase were independent predictors of MVI (all P < 0.05). The nomogram based on these variables showed good discrimination and calibration with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.821 (0.76 2-0.870) in the training cohort and 0.789 (0.681-0.874) in the test cohort. There was a significant difference in PFS between the nomogram-predicted MV I positive and the nomogram-predicted MVI negative groups in training and test cohort (p<0.001 and p=0.001 respectively). Conclusion: The multimodal ultrasound features were effective i maging markers for preoperative prediction of MVI of HCC and the nomogram might be an effective tool to stratify the risk of recurrenc e. Limitations: This study is a single-centre study, multi-centre v alidation is needed to verify its generalisability before clinic al application.

Sch\u00f6llnast; options, prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor and is al so influenced by histopathological grading. As neoadjuvant therapy m ay be beneficial for patients with poorly differentiated PDAC, a non-inv asive method to assess histopathological grade would be valuable. Therefor e we evaluated the significance of CT-texture analysis (CTTA) in asses sment of histopathological grade of PDAC and compared CTTA texture features between primary and metastatic PDAC. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 120 histopathologically confirmed segmented in non-contrast CT scans for CTTA. Statistical analysis was conducted for 37 2 textural features using Mann-Whitney-U-test, Bonferroni-Holm correction and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 394 Results or Findings: Three features were identified that differed signif icantly between yielded the largest AUC (0.87 +/- 0.04), reaching a sensitivity and specificity of 0.76 and 0.83, respectively, when a cut-off value of 0.482 was applied. Fifty-four features differed 0.72-0.93). ures between primary G2 and G3 tumours that could be used for non-invasive tumour assessment. Extensive differences between the features of primary and metastatic PDAC on CTTA suggest that CTTA of a meta static lesion may not allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the histology of the primary tumour. Limitations: Due to retrospective design selection bias cannot be ruled out. Biopsy material instead of surgical specimen was us ed to determine histopathological grading.

Riedel*, F. Mohn, Szwargulski, Adam, M. Gr\u00e4ser, J. Salamon; Hamburg/DE Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of detecting gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in vitro by real-time 3D multi-colour magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Methods or Background: Small bowel phantoms were 3D printed with a lumen measuring 13.5 mm. The surrounding wall was c onstructed with a hollow layer representing the vascular compartment in a perfused bowel wall. One phantom with separation of the luminal and the vascular compartment served as control. Another phantom was created with a perforation between both compartments representing the source of a bleeding. The lumen was filled with water for single-color MPI and with a tracer s uspension of LS-008 (LodeSpin) for multi-colour MPI. The vascular compartment was connected to a water-filled circulatory system. Phantoms were im aged dynamically (46 Volumes/s) in the MPI scanner (Bruker/Philips) to evaluate the fluid exchange between the vascular compartment and the lumen whil e a bolus of 1 ml Perimag (Micromod) was injected as blood pool tracer. Similar experiments were performed using bovine small bowel specimens w ith GI hemorrhage simulated by an incision in the mucous membrane. Results or Findings: MPI enabled real-time visualisation of the enhancing bowel wall following tracer injection for single-colour and multi-colour experiments. Leakage of the blood pool tracer into the lumen was not observed in the control experiments. In case of simulated bl eeding, real-time MPI enabled the detection of the blood pool tracer in t he lumen. Here, multi-colour MPI confirmed the bleeding by co-registration of both tracers in the lumen at the same location. Conclusion: Both single- and multi-colour MPI are feasible to v isualise GI hemorrhage in a bowel phantom as well as in bovine bowel specimens. MPI might emerge as a useful tool for the radiation-fre e detection of acute and chronic GI hemorrhage. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Heinrichs*\u00b9, F. M\u00fcller\u00b9, \u00b2Hannover/DE placed a significant burden on populat ions worldwide. Countries are suffering the consequences of the pandemic, which are affected by varying determinants, including digitalisation. While the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in many areas of life, we know little about how digitalisation has shaped the cris is and handling thereof. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of digitalisation in the course of the pandemic. Methods or Background: For this purpose, we chose the digital adoption index as a representative score to evaluate its ass ociation with COVID-19, its attributed cases, deaths, and government responses. We used an algorithm based on gradient tree boosting (GTB) to select key predicting features. A mixed-effects model was used to model the heterogen eous nature of data per point in time (March, June, September, and December ). Lastly, a scoping review offered essential insights into recent liter ature. Results or Findings: GTB found potential links between corporate and government digital developments and the stringency of measures taken by the governments. By the end of 2020, we observed that E uropean countries had 4.8 times lower COVID-19 attributed death rates whe n they scored higher in digitalisation (p<0.001). This trend was possibly e nhanced by the significant correlation between the digital adoption index and the gross national income (r=0.749, p=<0.001), as well as the development of a country (r=0.920, p<0.001). Conclusion: We found that the more digitised a country, the les s severe the impact of COVID-19. Our findings encourage the impo rtance of digital transformation in the face of the current pandemic. Limitations: This study is based on COVID-19 outcomes reported by countries. Differences in reporting or inaccurate r eporting of COVID-19 data may have influenced the power of our model.

Purpose: The healthcare sector is one of the most complex industries and may benefit from the adaptation of technological innovations. Radiology has often been the portal for medical advancements. We aimed to reveal the engagement of innovation in the radiological literature compared to the general medical literature. Methods or Background: We have queried the PubMed API for all available innovation-related entries published from 2000 to 2 020. Papers were classified into research fields that comply with innovation: artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and telemedicine. Terms to classify entries into the three research fields were determined by consensus among the autho rs. A journal list of A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 395 radiology and nuclear medicine and other medical fi elds was compiled using the open access Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR ) site. Results or Findings: Our search yielded 194,685 innovation-related entri es published from 2000 to 2020. Most digital technology innovation-related publications were written in the last decade. AI re search had a steep rise in all fields of healthcare with 20,552 publications in 2020 compared to only 2,184 publications in VR and 5,189 in telemedicine. In 2020, 2603 (38.7%) of the innovation publications were published in radiology and nuclear medicine related journals vs 1426 (21.2%) surgery, 1294 (19. 2%) oncology and 566 (8.4%) internal medicine related journals. Conclusion: Radiology and nuclear medicine were at the top of i nnovation related publications with a steep rise at the last years. While AI is at the main focus of radiology and nuclear medicine literature, VR and telemedicine had a limited number of publications. Innovation employme nt may help with the ever- growing workload and improve performance. Hence, understanding of innovation engagement in different medical fields i s of paramount importance. Limitations: The high-level look at the field taken as well as data extraction from PubMed were identified as limiting factors.

The American College of Radiolog y (ACR) data science institute has developed freely available resources to assist practices of all sizes select, evaluate and monitor AI in clinical practic e. Methods or Background: The commercial availability of radiology artificial intelligence algorithms continues to accelerate; however, regulatory approval alone may not ensure AI will function as expected i n real-world clinical practice. To be savvy consumers of AI, radiologists must be able to navigate the growing market of available AI models, evaluate the models for their practices prior to purchase and monitor model performance in clinical use over time. While institutions with robust informatics infrastr ucture may be able to perform these functions, most practices will not be able to do so without assistance. Likewise, a recent survey of ACR members found that a majority would like to have access to tools for AI evaluation and longitudinal performance monitoring. Results or Findings: To meet the growing need of the specialty the ACR has developed a catalog of USFDA cleared algorithms radiologists can use to understand the availability, use case and validation parameters of AI tools available for use in clinical practice. Additionall y, the ACR is making the infrastructure and tools available to allow practic es of all sizes evaluate AI models using their own patient data. Finally, the A CR has developed an AI data registry that practices can use to monitor the performance of AI models deployed in their practices. Conclusion: By providing tools and infrastructure, medical spec ialty societies can assist radiologists select, evaluate and monitor AI for clinical practice. Limitations: Similar tools may be available but require robust h ealth system informatics infrastructure to deploy and use. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was not required.

Though powerful, such filters lack reproducibility. The purpose is t o standardise the computation of convolutional image filters for radiomics analys es. Methods or Background: A reference manual and digital phantoms were provided to participating teams who develop radiomi cs software. We defined 36 tests covering common convolutional filters. Par ticipants provided response maps (RM) for each implemented test after applying a filter to a digital phantom. We aggregated RMs into a consensus-based r esponse map (CRM) by iteratively removing outlying contributions. Str ength of consensus was classified into 4 categories (weak, moderate, stron g, very strong) based on the number of RMs matching the candidate CRM (<3, 3-5, 6-9, 10). Moreover, candidate CRMs required an absolute majority (>50% RMs) to be accepted. Results or Findings: Forty-two researchers from fourteen teams participated in this work. Over the course of 12 months, we obse rved an improved consensus (very strong, 0/36 to 12/36; 4/36 to 8/36; moderate, to 0/36). Currently (Oct. 2021), 15/36 tests do not show a majority consensus. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that radiomics analyses util ising convolutional filtering can significantly differ du e to implementation decisions. Through increase in participation and by resolving ambiguities, we managed to improve consensus between software packages for sev eral filter families. However, a comprehensive standardised radiomics wor kflow including convolutional filters is not yet fully achieved. Limitations: We did not obtain CRMs for Gabor and Riesz transfor m filter tests, indicating their current lack of reproducibi lity. Moreover, integration of convolutional filtering into a radiomics workflow i s currently being assessed, with pending results. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was not required.

S. Kelly*, Lawlor, P. Mathur; Dublin/IE (brendanskelly@me.com) Purpose: To use deep learning to identify radiopaque markers as part of a colonic transit study and to predict time to completion of the study on both a population- and patient-specific basis. Methods or Background: This retrospective cohort study included all patients undergoing a colonic transit study in a single inst itution from 2010 to 2020. We trained and tested deep learning models based on a Siamese network architecture to classify images according to the pr esence or absence and the number of radiopaque markers and to identify interv al change. We also employed time-series methods based on these data to predict the total duration of the study. Saliency maps were interrogated for explanations of false positives and false negatives. Results or Findings: 568 images of 229 patients (143, 62% female, mean age 57) patients were included. For binary classifi cation, the best performing model (Siamese DenseNET trained with contrastive lo ss with unfrozen weights) achieved an accuracy, precision and recall of 0.988, 0.986 and 1. On a per-patient basis, an LSTM trained on outputs of a Gaussian process regressor outperformed basic statistical curve fitt ing with a MAE of 1.93 compared to 5.22 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Siamese networks perform well at identification of radiopaque markers in colonic transit studies. For time series prediction, advanced methods improved performance for personalised predi ction.

Second, to allow feature exploration using visualis ation tools and creating machine learning models for classification and surv ival tasks. This is achieved via an open-source web-based platform without the need for programming. Interactive visualisation is crucial for exploring links between radiomics features and patient outcomes but is absent from many availa ble radiomics tools. Methods or Background: We used an existing open-source web-based tool (Kheops) that enables users to create, manage and s hare collections of DICOM images. In addition, we developed a user-frie ndly companion web platform (QuantImage v2) for radiomics feature extr action and management, predictive model building and validation, as well a s interactive data visualisation. Results or Findings: After creating a patient cohort using Kheops, users extracted radiomics features using QuantImage v2 fr om CT/PET/MR images. Interactive visualisation tools assisted users in f eature selection for training machine learning models, e.g. by allowing users to filter features by imaging modality, region-of-interest & feature categories. Finally, the platform enabled real-time training and comparison of predictive mod els for classification and survival analysis tasks using several algorithms. T he iterative process of feature exploration and predictive model building allowed identifying outliers, revealed intraclass group heterogeneity, and helped novice users to build better-performing models relying on fewer predictor s. Conclusion: The developed platform empowers clinical researcher s with no background in programming to investigate and test r adiomics models via an easy-to-use web interface. The novel feature visual isation functionality helps identify salient features that produce well-perform ing predictive models. First user tests are encouraging, with feedback highlight ing the ease of use and usefulness of the freely available tool.

Perkonigg*, J. Hofmanninger, C. G. Langs; Vienna/AT Purpose: To develop a machine learning method for effectivel y choosing examples for ground truth labelling to adapt models to new scanners and image characteristics in a continuous stream of medical imaging data. Methods or Background: The proposed approach continuously trains models on a stream of imaging data by recognising shifts i n image acquisition characteristics and selecting optimal examples for labelling. Those examples are stored in a rehearsal memory to keep a machine learning model up-to- date, while at the same time not forgetting previou s knowledge. A style embedding is extracted from each image to assign it to a pseudo-domain. Those pseudo-domains are used to balance the rehear sal memory and training procedure. The benefits of the method were evaluate d for cardiac MR image segmentation in 2D. Results or Findings: A total of 7230 2D MR slices of the Multicentre, Multivendor & Multidisease Cardiac Image Segmentati on Challenge (M&Ms) challenge dataset from four different scanners were used for evaluation. Results showed that the method is capable of learni ng on a continuous stream, while keeping the number of required manual annotat ions low. The mean dice scores for the four scanners were 0.81, 0.73, 0.80 and 0.68 respectively, compared to continual training on the stream without the proposed method (0.82, 0.71, 0.76, 0.56) or a static model (0.81, 0.69, 0.72, 0.34). Conclusion: The proposed method was capable of training models on a continuous stream of imaging data, with a limited l abelling budget and outperformed baseline methods. Limitations: Variability in annotator accuracy was not evaluated in this study.

We aimed pretreatment radiotherapy planning computed tomography (CT) radiomics could distinguish the ients with no response or no downstaging after nCRT from those with response and downstaging after nCRT. Methods or Background: Patients with LARC who were treated with nCRT were retrospectively enrolled between March 2009 an d March 2019. Traditional radiological characteristics were analy sed by visual inspection and radiomic features were analysed through computation al methods from the pretreatment radiotherapy planning CT images. Diffe rentiation models were constructed using radiomic methods and clinicopathological characteristics for predicting non-response to nCRT. Model performance was assessed for classification efficiency, calibration, discriminat ion, and clinical application. Results or Findings: This study enrolled a total of 215 patients, including 151 patients in the training cohort (50 non-responders and 101 responders) and 64 patients in the validation cohort (21 non-responder s and 43 responders). For predicting non-response, the model constructed with a machine learning method had higher performance with area under the c urve (AUC) values of 0.92 and 0.89 as compared to the model constructed with the logistic regression method (AUC: 0.72 and 0.71 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively). Both decision curve and calibration curve analyses confirmed that the machine learning model had higher predicti on performance. Conclusion: Pretreatment CT in predicting non-response to nCRT and could be helpful to assist in treatment planning for LARC patients.

The diagnostic accuracy of DWI in differentiating between pCR and non-pCR groups w as calculated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results or Findings: A total of 36 patients were analysed (pCR, higher in in group pCR compared to non-pCR (median value of 265 [195.8, 334] and 103 [53.5, 187], respectively p=0.026), while no association w as found between pre-TNT tumour volume and pathological response. DWI regional downstaging after therapy (r=0.473, p=0.048), and less significantly with the reduction of tumour volume (r=0.434, p=0.072). AUC of DWI in differentiating between pCR and non-pCR patients was 80.9%, with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 81.3%. Conclusion: High DWI values on pre-treatment MRI were strongly associated with a better outcome in patients with LARC, both i n terms of pathological response and in loco-regional downstaging after TNT , suggesting the use of DW-MRI as a potential predictive tool of response t o therapy.

B. Grotenhuis; Amsterdam/NL (b.geubels@nki.nl) Purpose: To the diagnostic aspects and management of locoregional nodal regrowth in rectal cancer patients following Watch-and-Wait (W&W). Methods or Background: 33 rectal cancer patients with suspicious lymph nodes (LN) on MRI during follow-up in W&W were retr ospectively identified. The diagnostic trajectory and treatment outcome was analysed, with special attention to MRI details. Results or Findings: The primary rectal tumour was managed with (chemo)radiation in 25 (76%) patients (of whom 17 h ad cN+), and with primary local excision in 8 (24%). At first restaging MRI, all 17 patients with cN+ had no remaining nodal disease. Median time to suspicious LN detection on MRI following W&W was 10 (8-23) months; 26% were new and 74% were pre- existing LN with growing or changing aspect. At tim e of LN detection, 26 (79%) patients had no endoscopic luminal abnormalities. A fter first detection, the MRI was repeated once in 13 (39%), and up to 4 times in 2 (6%) patients. In 9 (27%) patients endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsies were attempted of which 4 failed; PET-CT was performed in 5 (15%), an d 12 (36%) patients underwent no additional imaging. 9 (27%) patients r eceived (chemo)radiation and eventually 32 (97%) underwent TME-surgery. Medi an time between suspicious LN detection and TME-surgery was 3 (1-5) months. In 11 (34%) patients positive LN were found in the surgical TME -specimen and in (39%) mesorectal tumour deposits; in (15%) no tumour was found and in 3 (9%) the pathological outcome is unknown. Conclusion: MRI is an essential follow-up tool to detect nodal regrowth in rectal cancer patients following W&W. Because of the difficulty to obtain histological proof and avoid an unnecessary resecti on, there is however still the clinical need to improve the diagnostic accurac y.

Ruggiero*, S. Vicini, ( CTC) service using polyp detection rate quality measurement. Methods or Background: We retrospectively analysed consecutive patients who underwent CTC from July 2015 to September 2018. In all patients a reduce bowel preparation (100 g of Macrogol and 60 ml of hyperosmolar iodinated contrast media for fluid tagging) and no dietary restriction was administered the day before the examination. PDR was calculated, considering only polyps 6 mm, for the entire population and after the stratification in sub- groups according to age (<65 vs 65 y), gender and symptoms (asymptomatic vs symptomatic). All positive patients at CTC under went endoscopy to confirm the presence of polyps. Polyps were scored accordin g to the location, dimension and quality of the bowel preparation. Dif ferences between sub- groups were evaluated with chi-squared test. Results or Findings: In total 1.446 patients (627/819 M/F, mean age 62.45 \u00b1 14.22 years) were analysed. preparation was o ptimal in 1392 patients (96.3%). PDR of total population was 9.19%. PDR was significantly higher in older (p=0.025) and males (p=0.014). PDR was not si gnificantly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p=0. 052). Conclusion: CTC without diet restriction for bowel preparation is effective in detecting colorectal polyps, with PDR comparable to those previously reported in literature. Limitations: It was not possible to use OC as reference standard in all participants, which could have raised ethical concerns regarding the need to refer to OC even patients with negative CTC findings. The quality of colon cleansing was assessed exclusively by subjective analysis. This reflects the current lack of a standardised objective evaluation scale for CTC.

Among the different sequences, particular interest has be en reported on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and the related apparent dif fusion coefficient map. However, no standardised cut-off has been established. The aim of this work is to assess inflammation degree through measurements obtained within intestinal mural thickening on DWI images at high b -values and correlation to those of mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and psoas m uscle. Methods or Background: A singlecentre retrospective study was conducted on 59 patients between September 2018 and July 2021. The inclusion criteria were: adult age, proven diagnosis of CD, MRE and il eocolonoscopy performed at an interval not superior to 4 weeks. Measurement s have been made by two radiologists with calculation of three ratios: Bowel/Lymph node (BL), Mann-Whitney and Jonckheere-Terpstra (J-T) tests were performed for assessing correlation among the ratios, differences between surgical and non-surgical patients, and correlation between ratios and endoscopic classes. Results or Findings: In non-surgical patients a significant positive cor relation has been found among the endoscopic score and the t hree demonstrated an increasing monotonic trend for BP and BL ratios and the four -CD classes. Within the surgical patients group, a positive corr elation was found between the BL-ratio and BP-ratio (rS= 0.539; p=0.014). Conclusion: Bowel DWI ratios can be considered as a fast approach for assessment of active inflammation degree in non-sur gical CD patients. Limitations: The small sample size was a limitation.

The presen t work investigates key physico-chemical MR-Imaging fea tures of the new Gd- chelate. Methods or Background: The complex stability was tested for Gd release in human plasma over 15 days. The T1-relaxivities in w ater and human plasma were measured at different field strengths (up to 4.7T). A 4D MR-angiography (MRA TWIST) study was performed with a clinical 1.5T scanner in healthy Goettingen minipigs. Two different doses of BAY 1747846 (0.025 and 0.03 mmol Gd/kg) were compared to the standard dose (0.1 mmol Gd/kg) of gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol. Results BAY 1747846 showed high kinetic inertness and no Gd release over 15 days in human plasma under physiological conditions. Compared to clinically av ailable GBCAs, highly pronounced T1-relaxivities were observed in water and human plasma at field strengths used in clinical practice (r1: 47.2 mM-1\u00b7 s-1 per molecule corresponding to 11.8 mM-1\u00b7s-1 per Gd at 1.41T in human plasma). In the 4D- MRA study similar signal enhancement profiles were observed for BAY 1747846 at approximately 70% reduced Gd dose compar ed to standard high relaxivity. The high relaxivity of BAY 1747846 offers the opportunity of a substantially lower Gd dose, while reaching the sam e MR signal enhancement compared to the marketed GBCAs gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol at a standard dose. Limitations: The animal models cannot replicate pathological conditions or non-disease related heterogenities in human patient s.

Author Disclosures: Gregor Jost: Employee: Bayer AG Employee: Bayer AG Thomas Jessica Lohrke: Bayer and volumetric the accumulatio n of in the basal nuclei: a Sassari/IT Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether v olumetric and radiomic changes may occur in the areas of most fre quent gadolinium accumulation (basal nuclei), by comparing two groups of patients, one composed of subjects suffering from multiple sclerosis and subjected to multiple administrations of gadolinium and one comp osed of healthy volunteers, not suffering from neurodegenerative di seases and never exposed to magnetic resonance contrast medium. Methods or Background: For this retrospective study, 51 patients, aged between 30 and 40 years, were recruited to perform a follow-up of multiple sclerosis. Twenty volunteers of the same age group were then recruited as a control population, who had never performed gadolinium-based contrast agents. MRI examinations were performed with a standardised protocol, with FLAIR axial sequence acquisitions. Results or Findings: The radiomic data detected didn't show statisticall entropy were, respectively: -0.34 in group 1 and -0.41 in group 2 (p = 0.152), 0.32 in group 1 and 0.31 in group 2 (p = 0.576), 1.86 in group 1 an d 1.88 (p = 0.562), 2.63 in group 1 and 2.71 in group 2 (p = 0.142). About the volumetric data, volume of pallidus and putamen was slightly lower in group 1 (10.51 cc) than in group 2 (13.18 cc), but this difference was not statistical ly significant (p = 0.124). Conclusion: The data obtained show that gadolinium does not cause detectable alterations by radiomics and this suppor ts the hypothesis that its presence does not cause clinically evident damage. Limitations: The limited sample and this study's retrospective nature were identified as limitations. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Lee, *D. Kim*, C. Suh; Seoul/KR (piintoretto@gmail.com) Purpose: myelography wi thout intrathecal gadolinium for CSF leakage in patients with newly diagnosed spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and to v alidate a published scoring system for predicting CSF leakage. Methods or Background: This retrospective, observational, single-instituti on study included patients with newly diagnosed SIH between March 2015 and April 2021. Patients were included if they (a) had newly diagnosed SIH and (b) underwent initial brain MRI and preprocedural MR my elography with two- and three-dimensional turbo spin-echo sequences. Patients who underwent spine surgery or procedures including epidural injection and acupuncture were excluded. Detection rate was defined as the proport ion of patients with a true- positive MR myelography result among all patients w ith confirmed CSF leakage. The interobserver agreement for the MR myelography results between two radiologists was analysed using weighted kappa statistics. Results or Findings: A total of 136 patients (mean age, 48 years; 70 wom en) with suspected SIH were included. Of these patients , 120 (88%, 120/136) were confirmed to have CSF leakage. Of the patients with confirmed CSF leakage, 90 (75%, 90/120) had epidural fluid collection. The detection rate of MR myelography for CSF leakage was 88% (105/120). The interobserver agreement between the 2 readers for detecting CSF l eakage ( = 0.76) or epidural fluid collection ( = 0.77) on MR myelography was high. Among 24 patients with normal brain MR imaging results, 16 had CSF leakage (67%, 16/24). Conclusion: Noninvasive MR myelography without intrathecal gadolinium should be considered to detect CSF leakage in patients with suspected SIH. Limitations: The limitation was the retrospective and singlecent re design. Ethics committee approval: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained.

Gadoteridol at the same dos age was also administered to healthy (non-SN) male rats. Urea an d creatinine plasma levels were monitored to assess renal function. Blood, cer ebrum, cerebellum, liver, femur, kidney(s), skin and peripheral nerves were harvested for Gd determination by ICP-MS at 28 and 56 days after the end of dosing. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 399 Results or Findings: Urea and creatinine plasma levels were about 2-fold higher in SN rats than in healthy rats at all timep oints. At 28 days post-dosing, Gd contents in peripheral nerves of gadobutrol and gadoterate-treated SN animals were 5.4 and 7.2 times higher (p<0.001) tha n in gadoteridol-treated SN animals. Similarly, Gd levels were 5 and 6 times higher (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) in kidneys of gadobutrol and gadoterate-treated SN animals than in the kidney of gadoteridol-treated S N animals. Gd levels were similar in cerebrum, cerebellum, skin and liver of SN animals receiving gadobutrol or gadoterate, being about 2-fold higher than in gadoteridol-treated SN animals. Gd levels were 1.2 and 1.5 times higher in femur of gadobutrol and gadoterate-treated SN animals than in gadoteridol-treated SN animals. Lower Gd levels were determined 56 days post-dosing both in SN and healthy rats for all GBCAs and tissues, except femur. Gd levels were higher in all tissues of gadoteridol-treated SN animals compared to gadoteridol-treated healthy animals. Conclusion: Lower Gd levels were determined in SN rats in all t issues and at all timepoints for gadoteridol compared to gadobutr ol and gadoterate. Limitations: Not applicable Ethics committee approval: Not applicable Funding for this study: Not applicable Author Clinical dose of gadobutrol (0.075 mmol/kg) for contrast-enhanced CNS adult patients known/suspected CNS pathology underwent contrast-enhanced MRI with standard-dose gadoterate (0.1 mmol/kg); if an enhancing lesion was identified, MRI with reduced-dose gadobutrol (0.075 was pe rformed radiologists scored three primary lesion efficacy variables: contrast enhancement, border delineation, and internal morphology. The mean reader scores were used for all analyses. Noninferiority was based on reduced-dose gadobutrol minus unenhanced achievi of standard-dose gadoterate minus unenha nced for all three efficacy variables. To substantiate the findings, a post-hoc analysis directly comparing the combined (contrast-enhanced plus unenhanced) im age sets was performed. Results or Findings: 141 patients received both agents and were analysed for efficacy. Noninferiority was confirmed for all three primary efficacy variables (p0.025). The mean scores for the combined images dif fered by less than 1% so a post-hoc analysis for equivalence of reduced-dose gadobutrol and standard-dose gadoterate was performed using two one-sided tests with a 5% margin and supported equivalence for all three vari ables (p 0.025). Number of lesions detected, diagnostic accurary and image quality were similar. Conclusion: A 25% reduced dose of gadobutrol and a standard dos e of gadoterate provide comparable efficacy in adults wi th known/suspected CNS pathology. Limitations: Study treatment was not randomised, however, the st udies were scored in a randomised blinded evaluation. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by local ethics committees.

D. Gr\u00fcnewald, C. Koch; Frankf urt evaluate the predictive value of volumetric BMD assessment of the gy CT (DECT)-based volumetric material decomposition as an indicator f or the 2-year occurrence risk of osteoporosis-associated fractures. Methods or Background: L1 of 92 patients who had undergone third- generation dual-source DECT was retrospectively analysed with dedicated DECT postprocessing software using material decomposition. The incidence of osteoporotic fractures within 2 years after measurement was evaluated. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to calculate cut-off values and logistic regression models were used to determi ne associations of BMD, sex and age with osteoporotic fractures. Results or DECT-derived mg/cm\u00b3 yielded 85.45% and 89.19% specificity for the prediction to sustain osteoporosis-associated fractures within 2 years af ter measurement. DECT- derived BMD was significantly associated with the occurrence of new fractures, indicating a protective effect of increased DECT-de rived BMD values. Overall AUC was 0.9373 (CI 0.867-0.977, for the di fferentiation of patients that sustained osteoporosis-associated fractures wi thin 2 years of BMD assessment. Conclusion: Retrospective DECT-based volumetric BMD assessment can accurately predict the 2-year risk to sustain an os teoporosis-associated fracture without requiring a calibration phantom. L ower DECT-based BMD values are strongly associated with an increased ri sk to sustain fragility fractures. Limitations: Most patients of our study cohort underwent CT of t he spine following previous trauma or because of chronic pai n. Therefore, due to hospital policy, many of these patients received pr ior x-ray imaging that could not exclude an acute vertebral fracture and caused a preselection bias towards patients that are at risk to sustain vertebral frac tures.

W. Y. Tong, K. Eckl, underdiagnosed in routine computed tomography (CT) because of poor visual bone density quantification. Pre-symptomatic diagnoses could prevent irreversible complications, and reduce mortality and healthcare costs. We aim to develop an osteoporosis and osteopaenia d etection pipeline for routine CT by calculating the hydroxyapatite (HA)/c m3 and T-score derived from Hounsfield Units (HU) in vertebral bodies. Methods or Background: In this prospective, multicentric trial, we perform ed repeated measurements on seven different CT systems of bodies with known density of HA and a commercial quantitative CT phantom to generate HU reference values for T-score calculation. We then a nalysed the precision of measurements and their possible correlations to the scanner type, tube voltage and reconstruction kernel. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 400 Results or Findings: Our results show a scanner-independent HA measurement accuracy of 87.4\u00b10.7%. The average diff erence of two different Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS scanner was 2.9% at a ground truth of 100mg HA. Kernel dependence was excluded by a mean measurement error increase of 0.08%, whereas Pearson CHI\u00b2 test demons trated a statistically significant (p-value 0.0065) association between tube voltage and measurement error with regard to the reference body . The average measurement error at a ground truth of 100mg HA inc reased from 1.63% at 80kV at 140kV. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a scanner-independent, high HA quantification accuracy. However, quantification is dependent on tube voltage. Subsequently, this needs to be accounted for when applying the pipeline to routine CT scans for HA acquisition. Limitations: The reproducibility of our results, and how they fa re against dual- energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements, mus t be further evaluated.

M. Sconfienza; Milan/IT Purpose: Unlike the arms, leg dominance does not appear to e xert a significant effect on BMD between the right and lef t femur. Evidence of a difference between two femurs in a scoliotic patient are supposed due to the presence of a loading imbalance on the lower limbs. Our aim was to investigate if a significant difference in areal BM D (aBMD) and volumetric BMD (vBMD) exists between femurs in patients with scoli osis, and whether this difference is related to spine convexity. We also c ompared such differences in patients without scoliosis. Methods or Background: Abdominal CT examinations were retrospectively reviewed. We used the ''asynchronous'' calibration of the CT images to obtain BMD values from QCT (Mindways Software Inc., Austin , TX). Differences between aBMD and vBMD of femurs were assessed using the Student's and Wilcoxon's signed-rank, according to the antero-posterior CT localiser to c alculate the Cobb angle. Results or Findings: Our final study cohort consisted of 263 subjects, 2 25 of them without scoliosis (85.6%) and 38 with scoliosi s (14.4%). BMD comparison between left and right femur of scoliotic patients - without considering the side of scoliosis - showed no statistically significant differences at all sites. When considering the convexity or concavity of scoliotic curve, we found a statistically significant difference at total femur , values were lower on the convexity side. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a difference in femoral BMD exists between the two femurs of scoliotic patients undergoing QCT analysis of the hip. If this data is confirmed by a larger study, bilateral femoral DXA acquisition may be proposed for these patients. Limitations: The study's retrospective nature was identified as a limitation.

Werner*\u00b9, B. Krauss\u00b2, \u00b2Forchheim/DE Purpose: lung cancer changes in bone marrow attenuation assessed via dual-energy CT-base d virtual non-calcium (VNCa) imaging of the axial skeleton. Methods or Background: We performed retrospective region-of-interest based attenuation measurements in VNCa bone marrow images of the axial skeleton derived from 93 unenhanced reduced dose du al energy CTs of the thorax and abdomen of 31 patients. Each patient had received one pretherapy baseline exam and two consecutive follow-up exams ( FU1 and FU2). Concurrent haematologic laboratory data were available for every exam. Twenty-two patients receiving highly myelotoxic tre atment (Group A) were compared to 9 patients receiving less toxic substances (Group B). Results or Findings: Median bone marrow attenuation at baseline/FU1/FU2 was HU (IQR 12.2)/-43.8 HU (15.7)/-38.5 HU (I QR 18.5) in Group B. In both subgroups the reduction of the mean attenuatio n between baseline and FU1 was statistically significant; differences betw een FU1 and FU2 and between groups were not. Attenuation measurement results are supported by haematological laboratory data. Leukopenia rates at FU1/FU 2 were 50%/54.5% in Group A and 0%/22% in Group B. Respect ive anaemia rates were 90%/86.4% in Group A and 66.7%/55.6% Group B. Conclusion: Both highly myelotoxic as well as - to a smaller degree - less myelotoxic systemic therapy led to a significant dr op in bone marrow attenuation with no significant tendency towards su bsequent elevation. The results suggest that in this clinical setting an in crease in bone marrow attenuation should be regarded as suspicious for tumour infiltration. Limitations: Limitations include a relatively small cohort, some heterogeneity regarding time of follow-up and treatment regimens and the lack of inter- and intrareader reliability analysis.

Author Disclosures: Bernhard Krauss: Employee: Siemens Healthcare GmbH Marius Horger: disclose Sebastian Werner: Nothing to disclose RPS 2310-11 The effect of gadolinium (Gd) and gadolinium-based GBCAs in MRI is associated with Gd retention in bone tissue. Hence, to understand the long-term role of Gd on bone metabolism, effects of free and chelated Gd on osteoblasts (OBs) were studied in vitro. Methods or Background: Murine OBs were with empty chelators DTPA or DOTA alone or combined with free Gd. Cell viability (XTT assay) and differentiation (alk aline-phosphatase, ALP) was analysed on day 5. Results or Findings: Gd and GBCA showed significant effects on proliferation at highest concentrations tested. Free Gd inhibited OB differentiation more efficiently than chelated Gd and ALP activity was s ignificantly reduced at 12.5 M. In comparison, GBCAs lead to significant decline of ALP activity at concentrations higher than 100 M. The nonionic-linear complex induced the strongest dose-dependent inhibition of OB different iation followed by the ionic- linear and macrocyclic. Cultures supplemented with DTPA revealed a decrease of viability and ALP activity, this effect was neutralised by addition of Gd. In contrast, DOTA did not affect OB proliferati on or differentiation. Both empty chelators reversed the inhibitory effect of G d on OBs. Conclusion: Gd and GBCA did not affect OB viability, but inhibi ted cell differentiation dose-dependetly. The negative effec t of GBCAs on OB differentiation (Gd-DTPA-BMA>Gd-DTPA>Gd-DOTA) corre sponds to their thermodynamic stability (Gd-DTPA-BMA<Gd-DTPA<Gd-DOT A), indicating that the effect is attributable to Gd release from the c omplex. This Gd release also explains the higher concentrations necessary to dec line ALP activity in GBCA- supplemented cultures. Limitations: Further studies are ongoing to understand the effec t of GBCA on bone metabolism, OBs represent only one of several players.

Methods or Background: A total of 174 patients with GIST (wt-GIST=52) were retrospectively identified between January 201 1 to October 2019. A sarcopaenic nomogram was constructed by multivariat e logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by di scrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. Genomic data was obtaine d from our own specimens and also from the open databases cBioPort al. Data was analysed by R version 3.6.1 and clusterProfiler (http://cbioportal.org/msk-impact). Results or Findings: There was a significantly higher incidence (75.0% v s 48.4%) and more severe sarcopaenia in patients with wt-GIST than in patients with mu-GIST. Multivariate logistic regression anal ysis showed that sarcopaenic score (fitted based on age, gender and skeletal muscle index), and muscle fat index were independent predictors fo r higher risk of wt-GIST (p<0.05 for both the training and validation cohort s). Our sarcopaenic nomogram achieved a promising efficiency with an AU C of 0.879 (95% CI: 0.816-0.943) for the training 5% CI: 0.8324-0.9873) for the validation cohort with a satisfying consistency in the calibration curve. Favourable clinical usefulness was observed using d ecision curve analysis. The additional gene sequencing analysis based on bo th our data and the external data demonstrated aberrant signal pathways being closely associated with sarcopaenia in the wt-GIST. Conclusion: Our study supported the use of CT-based assessment of sarcopaenia in differentiating the wt-GIST from the mu-GIST preoperatively. Limitations: Our study was inherently limited by its retrospecti ve nature and singlecentre design.

G. Klompenhouwer; Amsterdam/NL RPS 2305b-2 Artificial intelligence support system to improve t he diagnostic accuracy of radiologist in differentiating colon carcinoma a nd S. R. Braren; Munich/DE Purpose: Differentiating between colon ac ute diverticulitis (AD) on computed tomography (CT) images is often a difficult task, particularly when complicated changes like perforation are present. As a result, guidelines recommend colonoscopy after 4-6 weeks to exclude ca rcinoma. Deep learning algorithms may improve the diagnostic accuracy of r adiologists distinguishing both entities. The aim of our study was to develop and evaluate a deep learning algorithm as a second reader in the differ entiation of AD and CC on CT images. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study portal venous CT scans of 589 patients with AD (n=269) and CC (n=320) were acquired. Patients were splitted into a training, validation and testing cohort. A bounding box was cropped for each scan including the wall thickening, mesenterial surrounding and locoregional lymph nodes. A 3D-CNN was develope d and trained on the bounding boxes and validated on the testing cohort. Finally a reader study was performed with differently experienced radiologists (n=6), who classified the test dataset with and without algorithmic support. Results or Findings: The CNN reached a sensitivity and specificity of 80 % and 86% respectively on the test dataset in differentiating CC and AD.

Most BD-IPMN represent low-risk lesions (without worrisome features [WF] or high-ri sk stigmata [HRS] according to the Fukuoka criteria). Since it is difficult to predict the course of low-risk BD- IPMN, regular follow-up imaging is recommended, whi ch can create societal costs and significant patient burden. Our objective is to identify imaging features with deep learning that may help to predic t imaging progression of low-risk BD-IPMN on MRI. Methods or Background: Using the patient database of our tertiary referral center, we retrospectively identified patients with low-risk BD-IPMN analysed all follow-up MRI scans for progression of the lesions, defined as development of new WF/HRS or cyst growth of 20 % / 2 mm on MRI. Lesions with progression within 50 months and lesions without progression on follow-up MRI for 50 months were included. Of 70 identified lesions, 43 lesions showed no imaging progression and 27 lesions showed imaging progressi on. All lesions were manually segmented on the T2-HASTE-images of the baseline MRI scans. We trained a DenseNet (DN) on the segmented baseline i mages with the presence of imaging progression at 50 months as outcome. Results or Findings: Our results indicate that the DN may predict a poss ible malignant progression at an early stage (Accuracy, Recall, F1 score between 60 % and 70 %). Conclusion: Predicting imaging progression of low-risk BD-IPMN with deep- learning is feasible. We assume that the classifica tion metrics might be relatively low due to our small cohort size and could be improved by larger studies.

Busard\u00b9, S. Benson\u00b9, A. local tumour progression (LTP) is reported in 6-46% . Early identification of patients at risk for LTP may avoid delay in additional treatment. We aimed to validate a previously published clinical-radiomics model (c-statistic: 0.78 95%CI: 0.58-0.84) to identify patients at risk for LTP in an independent external cohort. Methods or Background: 53 patients (n=79 CRLM) treated with TA were retrospectively included. Clinical features were collected. Portal-venous CT images 2-8 weeks after TA were used for segmentation. Radiomics features (with different Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filters ) as used in the previous A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 402 model were extracted from the ablation zone (AZ) an d a 10 mm periablational rim (PAR). The three multivariable stepwise Cox reg ression models (clinical- only, radiomics-only, clinical-radiomics-combined) were applied on the data and performances (concordance [c]-statistics) were compared to the previous results. Results or Findings: After a median follow-up of 26 months (range 6-149) , LTP occurred in 25 ablation zones (32%). Both the c linical-only and radiomics- only models demonstrated poor predictive performanc e with c-statistics 0.53 (95%CI: 0.41-0.65) and 0.50 res pectively. combined treatment, AZ_Uniformity_LoG-1.5, AZ_Skewness, PAR_Mean_LoG-0. 5, PAR_Skewness_LoG-0.5 and PAR_Uniformity_LoG-1.5, and yielded a poor predictive performance, with a c-statistic of 0.50 (95%CI: 0.39-0.62). Conclusion: Previously published clinical and radiomics models could not predict LTP in CRLM after TA in an independent external cohort. This inability to reproduce the earlier findings could be explaine d by overtraining and scanner differences. These results underline the im portance of external validation. Singlecentre radiomics models could be hospital specific and currently prohibit clinical use. Limitations: The small validation cohort was identified as a lim itation.

The dilatation of the main pancreatic duct caused by a stenosis due to PD AC is generally detected on portal venous phases CT scans. However, the detection of the duct dilatation, difficult to see on portal CT, can have low sensitivity. Given this context, we show how deep learning can help to automatically detect pancreatic duct dilatation. Methods or Background: We used a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm to predict the duct dilatation based on portal CT s cans annotated by expert radiologists. The model was calibrated on our private cohort composed of 627 patients. These patients had a histologically confi rmed PDAC diagnosis, and 41% of them were showing a dilated duct. In addition, we tested the method on a public dataset composed of 281 subjects diagnosed with either a tumour or a cyst, among which 49% had a dilated duct. Results or Findings: We trained the model on 527 patients from our private cohort and validated it on 100 unseen patients, lea ding to a 0.95 AUC (95% CI 0.944-0.956), with 93% sensitivity and 82% specific ity at the cut-off point maximizing the Youden's index. We also applied it on the 281 independent patients from the public dataset and obtained an AU C of 0.913 (95% CI 0.911- 0.917), with 93% sensitivity and 75% specificity at cut-off. Conclusion: Our results showed high performances on two independent cohorts, suggesting the interest of deep learning t o help radiologists detecting the main pancreatic duct dilatation. Ultimately, this could lead to an earlier diagnosis of PDAC and therefore improve patients' prognosis. Limitations: The approach should be further validated on multice ntric data in a reader study.

The value of deep learning in a m ulticentre-setting for response prediction of locally advanced rectal cancer to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy *B. D. Purpose: To evaluate a state-of-the-art multi-task deep lear ning (DL) approach in a multicentre-setting for its performance in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Methods or Background: This study included 83 LARC patients collected retrospectively at four different medical centers between 2015 and 2018. All patients underwent nCRT followed by surgery and his topathologic evaluation of tumour regression. A trained radiologist manuall y segmented the on pre- axial, high-resolution T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance images (MR-images). A Siamese network with two U-Nets joined at multiple layers was developed to predict pCR based on pre- and post- nCRT T2w-/diffusion weighted MR-images. After prepr ocessing, 72 patients were selected as training, 11 as validation data. T o assess predictive performance, the trained network was applied to an external clinical routine dataset of 46 LARC patients acquired without study conditions. Results or Findings: The training and test datasets differed significant ly in terms of their composition, e.g. T-/N-staging, the time interval between initial staging, nCRT, re-staging, and surgery, as well as with respect to imaging parameters, such as resolution, echo/repetition tim e, flip angle and field strength. The area under the receiver operating cha racteristic curve was 0.60 in the external test cohort for predicting pCR. Conclusion: Even though initial results are promising, the perf ormance of the used DL model in a multicentre-setting is substanti ally reduced compared to a previously published single- or two-centre-setting. Before translating DL approaches into clinical routine for screening, tre atment response assessment and surveillance their predictive performance remai ns to be verified in larger multicentre-studies. Limitations: Larger training datasets along with dedicated low-quality datasets, including normalisation of se quence variations may improve performance.

Dell'Aversana*\u00b9, of the radiomic features obtained from the EOB-MRI phase to evaluate the clinical outcomes aft er hepatic metastasectomy, recurrence, mutational status, hist ological characteristics and the surgical resection margin of the tumour. Methods or Background: For each segmented volume of interest 851 radiomics features were extracted as median values using PyRadiomics. Non- parametric test, intraclass correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linear regression modelling and pattern r ecognition methods (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), ar tificial neural network (NNET), and decision tree (DT)) were considered. Results or Findings: The best predictor to discriminate expansive versus infiltrative front of tumour growth was HLH_glcm_MaximumProbability extraxted on VIBE_FA30 (accuracy of 84%). The best predictor to discriminate tumour budding was inverse variance obtained by the original GLCM matrix extraxted on VIBE_FA30 (accuracy of 89%). The best predictor to differentiate the mucinous type of tumour was the HHL_glszm_ZoneV ariance extraxted on VIBE_FA30 (accuracy of 85%). The best predictor to identify tumour recurrence was the LHL_glcm_Correlation extraxted on VIBE_FA30 (accuracy of 86%). The best linear regression model was obtai ned in the identification of the tumour growth front considering the height text ural significant metrics by VIBE_FA10 (accuracy of 89%). Considering significant texture metrics tested with pattern recognition approaches, the best perfo rmance for each outcome was reached by a KNN in the identification of recur rence with the 3 textural A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 403 significant features extracted by VIBE_FA10 (AUC of 91%, an accuracy of 93%). Conclusion: Radiomics can identify some prognostic features as biomarkers that could influence the choice of treatment in pat ients with colorectal cancer liver metastases.

Sawall; Heidelberg/DE RPS scatter frequencies caused by c oarse anti-scatter grids in x-Ray CT \u00b2Heidelberg/DE Purpose: To estimate and remove high frequencies in scatter signals transmitted through coarse anti-scatter grids (ASGs ). Methods or Background: CT such as in photon-counting CT, may have anti-scatter grids wit h a grid spacing being an integer multiple of the detector pixel size. For ex ample, an ASG field may comprise a 2x2 matrix of detector pixels. The shadi ng caused by the grid affects each of the pixels within a grid field diff erently. Although scatter is a low frequency effect, this pixel-dependent shading results in high frequencies in the scatter signal transmitted through the ASG. These m ay cause ring or Moir\u00e9 artifacts in the reconstructed images. We trained a modification of our deep scatter estimation (DSE, [Med. Phys. 46(1): 238-249]) network to predict the modulated scatter signal which can then be subtract ed from the measured data. To train MatrixDSE, scatter signals were obtained by Monte Carlo simulation of patient CT data. To mimic the ASG mod ulation the simulated scatter is multiplied 2x2-pixel-wise with a random 2x2 matrix whose coefficients are within 0.5 and 1.0 that change with the detector position and view number. The MatrixDSE-corrected data are then reconstructed and evaluated in image domain. Results or Findings: DSE and MatrixDSE reduce scatter artifacts from a mean (across all patients) mean absolute error of about 10 HU to about 1 HU. MatrixDSE is further able to correct the ring artif acts, that originally had a mean amplitude of about 20 HU to an amplitude of less than 1 HU. Conclusion: MatrixDSE can estimate ASG-modulated scatter frequencies in CT data and correct both for the scatter artifacts and for the ring artifacts caused by the modulation. Limitations: Our results are based on patient-based simulations only. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Dedulle\u00b9, systems go beyond dose rec ording and address several quality aspects. Such an advanc ed functionality is the assessment of blind scan, i.e. the extent of scan l ength beyond the localiser borders. Without localiser information, tube current modulation (TCM) is not optimally applied, with repercussion on doses such as to the thyroid during chest CT. In this Belgian multicentre study, the bl ind scan in chest CT examinations was investigated. Methods or Background: Anonymised data of chest CT examinations performed in two years in seven hospitals from 14 C T scanners were collected. All participating centres use the same dose managem ent system (DOSE, Qaelum). The blind scan (upper and lower, towards n eck and abdomen respectively), scan length, and other information about the examinations were extracted by DOSE and analysed. A Kruskal-Wallis test (significance level 0.05), was used to compare the data of the differen t centres. Results or Findings: Overall, 51629 CT series were included. The centres use significantly different scan lengths (p<0.05), with median lengths ranging from 35 cm to 42 cm. There was lower blind scan in less than 1.5% of the series in all centres; the frequency of upper blind scan is substantial for all centers, ranging from 5% to 21%, with significantly different median values ranging from 16 mm to 20 mm. The difference in frequency of series with blind scan above 30 mm is considerable, ranging from 1% t o 6%. Conclusion: There are significant differences in the frequency and amount of blind scan. Results indicated that there is room fo r optimisation. Education on the impact of the blind scan might improve applied scan techniques.

Methods or Background: 366 prospective patients (mean Fat Free Mass (FFM) 46.7 kg (23.0-78.3), mean age 61.3 years (18. a standardised multiphase liver CT examination (kVp range 80-120) in a multicentre imaging network. The contrast dose (gI) to be injected for an optimal liver parenchymal enhancement (40-60 Hounsf ield Units (HUtarget)) was estimated prior to the exam by an in-house developed algorithm. The algorithm calculated the gI based on impedencemetri c-determined FFM, exam tube voltage and contrast media concentration (350_AccupaqueTM/370_IopamirolTM mgI/ml). Lower lim its were set in the algorithm to avoid off-label usage of the contrast media (AccupaqueTM : 30 gI, IopamirolTM : 0.5 ml/kg). The liver enhancement of each patient was measured by difference between portal and unenhance d parenchyma attenuation (HUliver) and compared to HUtarget thro ugh median and interquartile range (IQR). Total amount of iodine d ose was estimated by median and IQR and stratified per contrast media concentration, KVp and gender. Results or Findings: Median HUliver was 53.5 HU (IQR= 48.5-60.5) with 68 % of patients having an enhancement between 40-60 HU. Median iodine dose was 27.8 gI (IQR = 23.7-30.2). Per contrast media t ype, median iodine dose was 30.5gI/26.7gI for 350/370 iodine concentration (p<0.001) with an associated enhancement of 57.5/53.0 HU respectively . Per 80/100/120 kVp, median iodine dose significantly increased (p<0.01) from 18.6/27.8/36.3gI. Per gender, women needed a significantly lower (p<0.01) dose than men (24.8 vs 30.1 gI). Conclusion: The algorithm enabled a diagnostically appropriate and reproducible median liver enhancement of 53.5 HU, i ndependently of patient habitus, contrast concentration or tube voltage. Lo wer limit iodine dose due to off-label use caused a higher than needed contrast dose for one contrast type.

Skornitzke*, N. Determining the optimum trade-off between temporal sampling rate (t) and tube current, i.e. image noise, with respect to precision of CT perfusion measurements. Methods or Background: Digital perfusion phantoms were simulated by forward-convolution of an arterial input function averaged over 67 patients with a deconvolution model for 10 values of blood flow ( 30-120ml/100ml/min), 4 values of mean transit time (4-10s) and 4 values of flow-extraction product (10- 40ml/100ml/min), with 10 steps of temporal sampling rate ( t = 0.5-5.0s) and 57 levels of added image noise (standard deviation = 1-57HU), performing 128 repetitions for each setting. Phantoms were evaluat ed on a commercially available workstation with deconvolution (blood flow [BFD], blood volume [BVD], flow-extraction product [FED]), maximum-slop e models (blood volume [BVP], flow-extraction product [FEP]). Results were exported, mean and standard deviation (SD) over repetitions were calculated for each setting, and influence of t and noise was tested by analysis of covariances (ANCOVA). Optimum t with corresponding noise, defined by minimum SD of perfusion parameters, was determined along an iso-dose line of constant radiation exposure throug h reference values t = 2.0s and noise = 20HU. Results or Findings: Average mean and SD for perfusion signific ant influence of t and noise on mean and SD for all parameters (p<0.0001). Optimum t was 1.5s (noise = 23.1HU) for acquisition parameters differ based on perfusion model but results generally favour longer t, allowing for reduced image noise by increased tube current when keeping radiation dose constant.

RPS 2313-6 Advanced physics-based image quality assessment of a commercial super resolution deep learning reconstruction algor ithm for cardiac radiology applied to a wide volume tomogra phy system *K. Boedeker*\u00b9, Learning Reconstruction (SR-D LR) presents a new and unique image quality performance space. T he purpose of this study is to characterise a commercial SR-DLR, relative to conventional hybrid iterative reconstruction, with both standard and advanced metrics for cardiac wide volume CT acquisitions. Methods or Background: A 20cm Catphan was scanned on a wide volume CT scanner (Canon Aquilion ONE Prism) with a standard cardiac 0.275 sec protocol and reconstructed with a commercial SR-DLR and hybrid iterative reconstruction. The SR-DLR uses high-dose CT data acquired on a commercial high resolution CT system (Aquilion Prec ision) as the training target. The Precision has a 0.25 mm detector elemen t size, in-plane and longitudinal, at isocenter. Simulated low-dose norm al resolution data was used as the training input. A task-based low contrast detectability (LCD) model observer evaluated LCD and false positive/false negatives rates associated with noise and low contrast signal. The contrast-based modulation transfer function (MTF) and Noise Power Spectra (NPS) were d etermined. The NEQ(f) was used to characterise dose efficiency and task performance, such as ability to determine change in object size. Results or Findings: Limiting resolution for clinical field-of-field inc reased by 5-8 lp/cm and the magnitude of the MTF, on average, doubled while noise was simultaneously decreased by 45-50% and LCD remained equivalent between algorithms. SR-DLR resulted in a lower false positi ve/negative fraction. NEQ increased across all frequencies. NEQ applied to a high contrast size discrimination task demonstrated significant improv ement in distinguishing two objects 1 mm different in diameter. Conclusion: SR-DLR improves spatial resolution while reducing noise and maintaining LCD relative to conventional reconstruc tion, including false positive/false negative rates. The spatial resoluti on improvements increase dose efficiency and increase task performance for n on-LCD tasks. Limitations: The fact that a single SR-DRL algorithm was studied was identified as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Methods or Background: A library of 363 phantoms (168 paediatric and 195 adult) were used. The library was designed to represent characteristics of the whole patient population. It covers a wide range of ages from newborn baby to adult with weights of 10 to 125 kg and heights of 85 to 190 cm. Values of Dw were assessed for each phantom using a MATLAB devel oped in house for this purpose. The values were calculated over six regions of the trunk that represent CT protocols applied in the clinic. The r egions studied were chest, abdomen, pelvis, chest-abdomen, abdomen-pelvis, and the trunk. Five equivalent monoenergetic beams, which represented t ube potentials of 80-140 kVp, were used. Results or Findings: The differences between Dw values assessed for the various spectra were found to be insignificant. For all phantoms, the differences were within \u00b12% over the scan regions, with the majority of differences being less than 1%. The differences wer e not affected by the size or gender of the patient. Conclusion: Dw was recommended by the AAPM to replace dimension-based metrics to estimate size-specific dose estimate (SS DE) for an individual patient. Although Dw values were affected by the ar ea attenuation, results of this study showed that impact of tube potential on Dw of the trunk regions was minimal. Since assessment of Dw requires advanced c omputational tools, the results suggest that energy-independent Dw values c ould be established and linked to effective dimeter, which can be simply me asured for an individual patient. Limitations: Equivalent monoenergetic beams were used to simulat e various spectra. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Methods or Background: From September 2017 to June 2020 and after protocol optimisation according to clinical indicat ion and body mass index (BMI) class (< 25; 25), 824 chest and 3153 abdomen CT series were collected from 6 high-end CT scanners (Group 1, G1) . As of October 2020 a DL reconstruction algorithm was installed and 1222 chest and 5037 abdomen CT series collected (data till September 2021, G2). LcDRLs were calculated as A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 405 the third quartile of the median CTDIvol and DLP values for each CT scanner for G1 and G2, and compared. The evolution of the c DRLs with and without DL reconstruction was evaluated in terms of percent ch ange. The G2 LcDRLs were also compared to Swiss NDRLs (P50 (achievable) ). Results or Findings: The average LcDRLs for G2 BMI<25 for CTDIvol/DLP was -43%/-46% G2 BMI25 average LcDRLs CTDIcol/DLP reduction was -39%/-54% for chest and -23/-26% for abdomen. Highest LcDRLs CTDIvol dose r eduction for BMI < 25/ 25 classes was observed for emphysema (-68%/-71%) a nd kidney stones (- 60%/-55%) clinical indications. For chest, G2 LcDRLs compared to P50 NDRLS were lower in all indications and BMI classes for CTDIvol (range 1.6- 5.1 vs. 6.0 mGy) 210 LcDRLs lower than P50 in all indications and BMI classes for 10 mGy) and DLP (96.1-425.4 vs. 470mGycm). Conclusion: DL reconstruction algorithms combined with protocol stratification allows further optimisation of CT doses which remai n lower than national P50 DRLs for chest and abdomen CT examinations.

Methods or Background: A LUNGMAN thorax phantom (Kyoto Kagaku, Kyoto) is mounted on a linear motion stage to be sc anned on a TrueBeam (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) flat detec tor-based CBCT system. The phantom's chest is fixated on the couch while t he abdominal and the bronchial tree inserts are moved in steps of 0.8 mm into the chest using the motion stage to cover a total motion amplitude of 3 5 mm. At each step, we acquire CBCT scans with 900 projections over 360\u00b0 each at 100 and at 125 kV tube voltage. 3D-printed tumours and metal markers are used as inserts. We sample a set of projections according to geometry a nd respiration of a real scan to synthesise a 4D CBCT with a known ground tr uth. Results or Findings: The 4D CBCT synthesis results in realistic streak artifacts. It is possible to model the effect of ir regular respiration of patients up to an amplitude of 35 mm. The effect of MoCo on small structures, the tumour's shape and metal artifacts can be compared to the gr ound truth. Conclusion: The proposed method synthesises realistic 4D-CBCT m otion from multiple phantom measurements. It can thus ser ve as a ground truth for the evaluation of image reconstruction, motion corr ection or motion compensation algorithms. Limitations: The phantom used consists of two rigid parts that c an be moved relatively to each other. The motion simulated in t his study is AP motion only. Thus it does not fully represent the anatomical mot ion present in real patients. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable Funding for this study: The study was supported by Varian Medical Systems.

The properties of those phantoms in imaging and dosimetry need to be tested and verified. Methods or Background: A transaxial thorax section with a thickness of 2.5 cm and the breast of a female phantom (CIRS, Norfol k, Virginia) were reproduced with a m odelling (FDM) 3D-printer (3ntr Different tissues were s egmented from CT-images of the original phantom based on their Hounsfield-unit s (HU). The following materials were used, based on a previous study on t heir tissue equivalence: polylactide (PLA) for muscle and for the lung-tissue (using infill-density); polyethylene-terephthalate-glycol (PETG) for the ca rtilage and Granite-PLA for the bone structures. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was used for the breast. HU values of the tissues were determined by means of CT-scans of the phantom using either the original or the printed se ctions and breasts; absorbed dose was measured at different locations using TLD- 100 rods (Bicron- Harshaw, Cleveland, Ohio). The results were compared to one another. Results or Findings: The original phantom parts were reproduced easily i n their organ placement. Regarding imaging properties , CT densities were higher in muscle tissue (100 HU) and for lung tissue (140 HU) and lower in bone structures (180 HU). For the bone such differences are ascribable to the difficulty of finding an appropriate 3D-printable s urrogate material. The attenuation behaviours in soft tissues can be lower ed by decreasing the infill density. Absolute doses agreed within 10% differenc e. Conclusion: Anthropomorphic phantoms can be printed with all relevant tissues. Depending on the intended use, printing ma terials - if available - must be carefully selected with regard to their physical properties, based on tissue reference values.

A. S. Brendlin\u00b2; \u00b9Chapel Hill, NC/U S, The structural similarity index (SSIM) is a valuabl e tool to assess the similarity between two images and can also be used to measure objective image quality if the reference image is considered perfect quality. However, it is challenging to apply it directly to images that contain noise, such as medical images. In particular, if the noise in the two imag es is independent, its contribution in the numerator of the contrast comparison function of SSIM will be zero because the covariance between the noises w ill be zero. On the other hand, in the denominator, where the variance of eac h image is calculated separately, the contribution of noise remains. Ther efore, the SSIM is underestimated. In this study, we propose a modified SSIM for the evaluation of 3D images that contain noise, such as CT images. Methods or Background: The sum of the noise variances contained in the two images appearing in the denominator of the cont rast comparison function was replaced by the absolute value of the differenc e of the variances. To achieve this, the noise in each of the two images t o be compared was calculated by subtracting the adjacent images since CT image data is composed of slice images. The ACR phantom was scann ed twice at different doses between 0.6 and 32.2 mGy, and the same dose i mages were evaluated using the conventional and the proposed SSIMs. Results or Findings: We confirmed that the lower the dose and the noisier the image, the more the SSIM was underestimated by the conventional method. In contrast, our improved method improved the underest imation. Conclusion: We proposed an improved SSIM for 3D medical images. We confirmed that the SSIM could improve the underesti mation. Limitations: The study was performed on phantom.

Savoldi*, V. E. Contarino, S. Criscuolo, A. M. Petroboni, F. Lo Russo, C. Cinnante, F. M. Triulzi, G. Conte; Milan/IT (anna.savoldi@unimi.it) Purpose: magnetic susceptibility of normal-appeari ng white matter (NAWM) and disease white matter (DWM) in Multiple S clerosis (MS) using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM); to correlate QSM values with clinical ) and chain (sNfL) levels. Methods or Background: Fifty-nine patients with a first demyelinating epis ode were enrolled: 42 Relapse-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), 12 Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PMS) and 6 Clinical Isolated Syndrome (CIS). They underwent neurological examination, quantification of CSF A and sNfL levels, and brain MRI. They were clinically evaluat ed every six months and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Multipl e Sclerosis Severity Scale (MSSS) were calculated. Volume fractions of NAWM (N AWM-VF) and (NAWM-QSM) and DWM (DWM-QSM) were calculated on brain MR images. Results or Findings: NAWM-QSM was lower than DWM-QSM at both baseline and follow-up (p<0.001); no difference was found between baseline and follow-up MRI in terms of NAWM-QSM (p=0.25) and DWM-QSM (p=0.26). At baseline, patients with higher NAWM-QSM showed l ower CSF A levels ( =-0.38, p=0.004). NAWM-QSM to CIS (p=0.024) and RRMS (p=0.02), NAWM-VF was lower in PMS compared to RRMS (p=0.02) and CIS (p=0.001). Disease phenotypes did not differ in terms of DWM-QSM, DWM-VF, CSF A and sNfL levels. NAWM-QSM was the only independent predictor of early subtle microstructural changes in NAWM of MS patients and is a promising biomarker to predict disease progression. Limitations: Studies with a larger cohort and longer follow-up w ill be needed. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

Petroboni: Nothing to disclose RPS 2411-3 Quantitative T1-mapping of multiple sclerosis lesio ns using magnetic fingerprinting Donatelli*\u00b9, Purpose: patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), contrast enhancement in demyelinating lesions is considered a marker of blo od-brain barrier breakdown and active inflammation. It is visible in conventional post-contrast T1-weighted MR images as the result of the contrast-related T1 relaxation time shortening (T1), but it is usually not quantified. Here we used quantitative T1 mapping derived from a recent implementation of Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) to detect contrast enhancing lesions (EL) and measure T1 in both EL and non-enhancing lesions (NEL). Methods or Background: We enrolled 12 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who underwent a 3T-MRI exam of the brain for clinic al purpose. Besides conventional sequences, a 3D whole brain MRF acquis ition (1.1 mm isotropic voxel) was performed both before and after contrast administration. After obtaining MRF-derived quantitative T1 maps, for eac h exam the pre- and post- contrast T1 maps were co-registered and a T1 map was obtained by voxelwise subtraction. Then, T1 maps were visually inspected to detect T1- shortening related signal changes and T1 was measured in EL, representative NEL and normal-appearing white matte r (NAWM). Results or Findings: At visual inspection of conventional images, two patients had EL, two each; three of these lesions were clear ly visible on T1 map. In quantitative analysis, T1 was significantly higher in EL than in NEL and l ower in NAWM than in both NEL and EL (p<0.001). Conclusion: MRF-derived T1 mapping reveals enhancing MS lesions with both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Moreover, T1 values measured in NEL may indicate a subtle blood-brain barrier disru ption in some of them. Limitations: The small number of patients and the inclusion of r elapsing- remitting MS only were identified as limitations. Ethics committee approval: The local ethics committee approved this study.

RPS 2411-4 Imaging of cns infections in patients with acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome. *S. N. Naik*, H. C. Chadaga, S. Patwari, A. Kumar, V. H P, B. Singh, D. C, R. Hassan, A. A. Makai; Bangalore/IN Purpose: 1. To understand the direct impact of HIV on the br ain and its imaging features. 2. To understand the treatment related complications in patients with acquired immune- deficiency syndrome. 3. Understand the characteristic MR Findings to differentiate the var ious opportunistic infections in patients with acquired immune-deficie ncy syndrome. Methods or Background: HIV is a highly neurotropic virus that causes both direct and indirect effects on CNS. Complications a rise from the HIV infection itself, from opportunistic infections due to immune -suppressed status and treatment related complications. Also, the imaging spectrum in patients with HIV-AIDS is diverse and can seem daunting to the un trained eye, so we try to simplify it for better understanding and to aid the clinician in making the accurate diagnosis. In our study, we have selected 50 cases of patients with HIV related CNS complications, which were character ised on MRI by neuro- radiologist with 11 years of experience and co-related with CSF analysis. Results or Findings: 1. HIV-encephalitis: Symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in deep white matter, spares corti cal U fibers, Neuroparenchymal atrophy inappropriate for age. 2. PML: Asymmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities out of proportion to mass fibers 3. CMV: Periventricular T2/FLAIR 1. Immune reconsti tution syndrome: New enhancement and mass effect of the pr e-existing white matter lesions. Conclusion: Radiologist's awareness about various spectrum of i maging pattern in HIV-AIDS helps to come to an accurate di agnosis and helps the clinicians in further management. Limitations: The retrospective nature of the study was identifie d as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Methods or Background: A cohort of 51 COVID-19 recovered patients divided into mild group (n=19, MG) and severe group (n=32, SG) according to WHO guidelines, as well as age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls (n=31, NC) were involved. All patients had no speci fic neurological manifestations at acute stage and 3 months' follow up. Changes of the gray matter (GM), white mater (WM) and CBF were investig ated using advanced MRI and state-of-the-art post-processing protocols. Results or Findings: The severe group patients had more decreased GM thickness, decreased CBF, as well as decreased WM t ract volume and length compared to NC in widespread brain regions, especially in the frontal and limbic systems. The changes in brain structure and CBF were highly correlated with the inflammatory markers. Conclusion: The brain was sensitive and responsive to the impac t of COVID- 19, even though there were no obvious neuropsychological symptoms. The abnormalities in these brain areas need to be monit ored in the process of complete recovery, which could help clinicians to u nderstand the potential neurological sequelae of COVID-19. Limitations: First, the sample size is relatively small. Second, patients had no specific neurological manifestation and so, to avoi d cross-infection, the head MRI was not performed during the acute phase. Third, a follow-up study should be conducted to see whether brain anatomical and fu nctional changes progress or regress. Ethics committee approval: This prospective study was approved by the Clinical Institute Ethics Committee and written inf ormed consent was obtained from each participant.

Napolitano*\u00b9, A. Arrigoni\u00b9, A. have been i ncreasingly acknowledged. Concurrently, Cerebral Microbleeds (C MB) have been observed in the brain. The aim of the study was to characterise CMB patterns on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations. CMB volume was qu antified and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. Methods or Background: Consecutive patients hospitalised with COVID-19, who showed neurological manifestations and underwent brain MRI from March to May 2020, were included. MRI was performed on a 3T scanner with a standardised protocol that included SWI. The CMB bu rden was assessed by a semi-automatic SWI processing procedure specificall y developed for the purpose of this study. Odds ratios (OR) for cerebral microbleeds were calculated among age, sex, clinical and laboratory data by logistic regression analysis. Results or Findings: Among the 1760 COVID-19 patients admitted to the ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital between 1 March a nd 31 May 2020, 116 exhibited neurological symptoms requiring neuroimaging evaluation. 63 patients underwent brain MRI and were included. Fou rteen patients had cerebral microbleeds (CMB+ group). CMB+ patients ha d higher prevalence of CSF inflammation (p=0.020), higher white blood cell s level (p=0.020), higher than the CMB- group. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, CRP (OR = 1.16, p = 0.011) showed association with CMB. Estimated CMB v olume decreases with age (Rho=-0.38; p=0.18); it is positively associated with CRP (Rho=0.36; associated with lymphocyt es (Rho=-0.52; p=0.07). Conclusion: CMB is a frequent imaging finding in COVID-19 and s eems to be related to pro-inflammatory status. Limitations: This is a retrospective study and only hospitalised patients with neurological symptoms underwent MRI.

Nanda*, N. Sachdev; New Delhi/IN (civunanda@gmail.com) Purpose: To assess white matter alterations in patients of m igraine by using diffusion tensor imaging. Methods or Background: This was an observational comparative study that was conducted in the department of Radiodiagnosis, Dr. RML hospital from 1st November 2020 to 31st March 2021. Adult migraine patients (<50 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were included in t he study. DTI was performed on a 3 Tesla MR scanner, along 64 isotropically distributed diffusion sensitising directions. Results or Findings: Our study revealed significantly lower (p<0.05) FA values in migraine patients in the anterior limb of left internal capsule, body of corpus callosum (CC), posterior limb of right inter nal capsule (PLIC) and bilateral thalami and mean MD values of anterior li mb of bilateral internal capsule (ALIC), posterior limb of left internal capsule, left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and bilateral cingulum, compared t o healthy controls. A significant correlation (p<0.05) was found between the type of migraine, average duration of episodes, frequency of attacks and severity of migraine as per migraine disability assessment test. Conclusion: Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in unders tanding of the pathophysiology of migraine from vascular etiology to neurological mechanisms. Changes in FA and MD values can be compared with values obtained in the healthy population, which aids in t he assessment of the extent of neurological damage. Thus, DTI is an excellent t echnique which can elucidate the tracts involved in migraine, thereby assisting not only in diagnosis but also enabling disease prognostication and guidi ng treatment strategies. Limitations: Our study had a few shortcomings including a small sample size due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, manually drawn regions of interest were used for the calculation of DTI parameters while few studies using tract-based spatial statistics analysis have been conducted.

Ca ssano\u00b2; \u00b9Pavia/IT, \u00b2Milan/IT Purpose: The purpose of our study is to create a predictive model that identifies the features, mainly based on imaging, t hat can predict the upgrade rate of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) t o invasive carcinoma or worst grade DCIS in patients undergoing vacuum-assi sted breast biopsy (VABB) and subsequent surgery. Methods or Background: A total of 3100 VABBs were retrospectively reviewed, among which we reported 295 low-grade DCI S who subsequently underwent surgery. We developed a nomogram for predicting the upstage at surgery, according to a multivariate logistic regression model. Patients were categorised into five classes, based on predicted probabilities ( 2%, 2-5%,5- 10%, 10-25% and >25%) Results or Findings: The overall upgrade rate to invasive carcinoma was 10.8%. At univariate analysis, the risk of upgrade was significantly lower in patients with greater age (p= 0.018), without post- biopsy residual lesion or with a smaller post-biopsy residual lesion size (p<0.001), and in the presence of DCIS in specimens with microcalcific ations (p= 0.002). At multivariate analysis, patients with disease in specimens without microcalcifications and with post-biopsy residual l esion were instead significantly associated with the upstage at surger y (respectively OR 0.33, 95% OR 95% CI 1.58-32.2) Accordi ng to our final nomogram, the predicted probability of upstage at s urgery was lower than 2% in 58 patients. Conclusion: By selecting a population with a low risk of upgrading (<2%), we may identify patients with low-grade breast cancer in which surgery may be safely spared. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Ploumen, C. M. de Mooij, van Nijnatten*; Maastricht/NL (Thiemo.nijnatten@mumc.nl) Purpose: In approximately 45% of invasive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST), ductal carcinom a in situ (DCIS) is present. Recent studies suggest response of DCIS to NST. The purpose was to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current evidence on diagnostic performance of mammography, contrast-enh anced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for resp onse evaluation of DCIS in patients treated with NST. Methods or Background: PubMed and Embase were searched for studies investigating NST response of breast cancer, including information on DCIS, with the imaging modalities mammography, CEM or MRI . Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two revi ewers. Response evaluation of DCIS was assessed per imaging modalit y. A meta-analysis was conducted on studies reporting sufficient data to c alculate pooled sensitivity and specificity for detecting residual disease betw een two definitions of pathological complete response (pCR) (ypT0 versus y pT0/is). Results or Findings: Thirty-one studies were included. Eleven mammography studies showed calcifications are frequently associ ated with DCIS, however, residual calcifications do not necessarily indicate residual disease. Two CEM studies and 21 MRI studies demonstrated differences among imaging findings of residual DCIS, in which approximately 50% showed residual enhancement. A meta-analysis of 16 MRI studies confirmed higher pooled sensitivity (0.86 versus 0.82) and lower pooled specificity (0.61 ver sus 0.68) for detection of residual disease when DCIS is considered pCR (ypT0/ is), because of more false positives due to enhancement of DCIS. Combini ng imaging findings of calcifications and residual enhancement might improve detection of residual DCIS. Conclusion: Diagnostic performance of imaging modalities for re sponse evaluation of DCIS to NST is insufficiently accurat e. Combining imaging findings of calcifications and enhancement might be promising to distinguish residual DCIS from pCR.

Methods or Background: Forty-one breast cancer patients with 42 primary tumours and 26 pathologically proven clinically node-positive (cN-positive) disease were prospectively included. PET/MRI was performed before, halfway and following NST. Qualitative response evaluation following NST was based on FDG-activity on PET and residual enhancement on MRI. The quantitative variables maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax ) on PET and signal enhancement ratio (SER) on dynamic contrast enhance d (DCE)-MRI were determined on each exam and their percentage change was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the optimal cut-off values for quantitative variabl es in predicting residual disease. Diagnostic accuracy in predicting residual disease of the primary tumour in all patients, and residual axillary disease in cN-positive patients, was assessed. Results or Findings: Pathological complete response (pCR) of the primary tumour occurred in 16 (38.1%) of all, and axillary pCR in 14 (53.8%) of cN- positive patients. Accuracy of the qualitative eval uation was 73% for primary tumour and 62% for axillary response. For primary t umour response, combining the percentage decrease in SUVmax and SER halfway NST achieved an accuracy of 74%. Additionally, combinin g the absolute as well as the percentage decrease in SUVmax halfway NST improved accuracy for axillary response prediction to 91%. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 409 Conclusion: Qualitative PET/MRI shows promising results for pri mary tumour but not for axillary response prediction. Diagnosti c accuracy for axillary response prediction can be improved by combining qu antitative variables from longitudinal imaging.

Rucci*, A. R. Mattei; Rome/IT (carlottarucci@gmail.com) Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the added value of CEM in preoperative staging of breast cancer confirmed by surgical histological sample. Methods or Background: From January 2018 to June 2021, 340 patients with strongly suspected diagnosis of breast malignancy based on assessment with Digital Mammography (DM) and Ultrasound (US) (BIRAD S 3, 4, 5) were retrospectively included. After performance of biop sy by core biopsy or Vacuum Assisted Breast Biopsy, patients were scheduled for primary surgery and were invited to undergo CEM as an additional pr eoperative procedure. Two readers with respectively 10 and 20 years of ex perience, blinded to pathology and clinical information, independently evaluated CEM findings. The following major endpoints were evaluated: findings of additional lesions, additional number of biopsies performed, sensitivit y and specificity of CEM and changes in surgery treatments (mastectomy instead o f lumpectomy or bilateral surgery instead of unilateral). Results or Findings: The final population included 156 patients (26 - 83 years), 312 breasts examined for a total of 165 les ions. CEM correctly identified 21 additional lesions for a total of 186 lesions (+ 13.5%) with 21 additional biopsies and a change in surgical management in 14/156 (8.9%) patients. Regarding per breast analysis, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of CEM were 94,9%, 97,6% and 91,8%, respectively. Conclusion: Results imply an added value of CEM in preoperative staging of breast cancer and contribute to our knowledge on CE M as an additional imaging method to standard investigation with digit al mammography and ultrasound.

Neeter\u00b2, CEM's accuracy in preoperative staging of ILC, comparing its performance to MRI. Methods or Background: All ILC cases of two hospitals diagnosed between 2013-2021 were collected. For both CEM and MRI, tum our diameter was assessed. Histopathology served as gold standard. W e calculated mean differences in tumour size assessment measured on C EM and MRI in Bland Altman plots. Also, we calculated the diagnostic pe rformance of CEM and MRI to detect multifocal or contralateral breast cancer s. Results or Findings: In the participating centers, CEM was introduced in 2018 and 2019, identifying 379 ILC cases. 187 (49.3%) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Mean patient age was 64.8 years (SD 10.7). Mean tum our diameter was 22.8mm (SD 17.5mm). Multifocal or contralateral breast cancer foci were and 10.2% of the cases, respecti vely. Preoperative staging was performed using MRI or CEM in 176 (94.1%) or 22 (11.8%) of the cases, respectively. Eleven cases received both examinations. Mean difference between measurements for MRI was +2.8mm (95% 94.1%) to detect multifocal disease w ere superior to MRI (82.6% and 76.0%). Sensitivity and specificity of M RI to detect contralateral disease was 94.7% and 89.2%. For CEM, both sensitiv ity and specificity were 100%. Conclusion: Accuracy of tumour size measurements is similar for CEM and MRI in ILC cases. Diagnostic accuracy of CEM to det ect multifocal or contralateral breast cancer might be superior to MR I. The number of ILC cases that were evaluated using CEM was limited, which mi ght have affected results. Limitations: Limited number of ILC cases. We are currently inclu ding additional ILC cases from a third centre that had C EM since 2013. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was waived.

Methods or Background: This retrospective study included 28 patients diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent NAC and operation. The kinetic and morphologic features on conventional and ultraf ast DCE-MRI before and after NAC were compared with pathologic features and response. Results or Findings: Twelve patients (12/28, 42.9%) showed pCR. The accuracy of MRI in predicting pCR was 0.833 in area under the receiver operating curve. Residual tumour size measured on d elayed dynamic phase better predicted histologic residual tumour size, c ompared to that on initial phase, especially for overall invasive and in situ cancer than invasive cancer (ICC 0.703 for overall cancer and 0.421 for invasiv e cancer). pCR group showed smaller tumour size (p=0.02), smaller angiov olume the absence of lymph node metastasis (p=0.023) on pre-N AC MRI and a more decrease on tumour size (p=0.001), angiovolume (p=0.002), maximum slope on kinetic curve of ultrafast MRI (p=0.032). Lymph node metastasis on pre- NAC MRI was an independent predictor of pathologic response, regardless or tumour size (p=0.035). Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) showed more angiovolume on pre-NAC MRI (p=0.015) and more delay ed washout percentage on post-NAC MRI (p=0.018), compared to non-TNBC. Conclusion: Small tumour size, vascularity, and the absence of lymph node metastasis were significant factors for pCR.

Patients we re treated with 3 session, once a week of ESWT. Results or Findings: At baseline, (T0) statistically significant differe nces were found in SWE velocity between the affected side and healthy side with higher value in healthy side with value equal to 3.8 (1.5; 5.1) ms-1 and 4.7 (4.07;7.04) ms-1 respectively (p=0,006; z=2,758), while no significant differences were found for strain ratio (p=0.656; z=0.445). One mont h after ESWT treatment (T1) the strain ratio of the affected side increased, with median value equal to 0.89 (0.3-1.5) at baseline to 1.16 (0.3-1.6) at 1 m onth and decreased at three months (T2) with median value equal to 0.82 (0.38-1.12). No statistically significant differences were found. Significant dif ferences were found in shear wave velocity over time, with an increase of SWE velocity after shock-wave treatment (p=0.04), results showed significant diff erences from T0 to T2 with median value varying (1.5-5.1) ms-1 at bas eline and 5.23 (4.55-6.74) ms-1 respectiv ely (p=0.003). Conclusion: Shear Wave Elastography seems to be more accurate t o assess soft tissue stiffness, it provides more objective r esults and less technical variation than compression elastography. SWE seems effective tool to assess ESWT treatments efficacy. Limitations: Interoperator variability and the small study popul ation were identified as limitations.

Methods or Background: Clinical outcomes of patients who had percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle tenotomy of t he long head of biceps tendon (LHBT) were analysed. 15 patients (mean age 77, SD 6.3, range 67- 87) with significant LHBT pain or instability were treated. Under local anaesthetic, LHBT tenotomy was performed using a 19 gauge white needle under continuous ultrasound monitoring until it was no longer visible. Pain was recorded before and at least 2 months post-procedur e and Oxford Shoulder Scores (OSS) were recorded. Results or Findings: Follow-up data obtained in 11 patients. Complete tenotomy achieved in 10 patients. One patient with incomplete percutaneous tenotomy proceeded to arthroscopic surgery. Pre-ten otomy VAS score post-tenotomy VAS at day one was 5\u00b13.4 (p=0. 0397), at one week was 4\u00b12.8 (p=0.0053), and at 8 weeks was 2\u00b12.0 (p=0.000 1). Pre-tenotomy OSS was 19\u00b15 and post-tenotomy at 8 weeks was 38\u00b18 (p=0.0012). No patients had weakness in elbow flexion or limited daily acti vities due to LHBT tenotomy. No adverse outcomes complications were reported. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous LHBT tenotomy is a f easible, safe and effective treatment for patients with pain secondary to long head of biceps tendinosis or instability. This minimally invasive approach may be of particular relevance for elderly or infirm patients to avoid the potential risks of arthroscopic surgery. Limitations: Our cohort size is relatively small but was suffici ent to reach statistical significance. Larger studies will be necessary to further define the risk of complications related to this procedure.

P. Luo*; Tianjin/CN (luo4pin@163.com) Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether there was wat er content change in the medullary cavity of occult rib fractu res by spectral CT. Methods or Background: The reconstructed spectral CT data was water/HAP material images. The water content of medullary cav ity in subtle and occult rib fractures and corresponding symmetrical parts of contralateral ribs were measured retrospectively, and calculated changes. B y comparing with patients without trauma, the absolute value of the differenc e of bilateral rib water content was measured and calculated. Independent sample T test was adopted to compare the consistency of water content in normal ribs' medullary cavity. Intergroup comparison and pairwise comparis on was applied on the difference of water content among subtle, occult fr actures and normal ribs, followed by calculated ROC curves. p<0.05 was consi dered a statistically significant difference. Results or Findings: 100 subtle, 47 occult fractures and 96 normal bilat eral ribs were included. The water content of the medull ary cavity in the subtle and occult fracture was 31.06\u00b115.03 mg/cm3 and 27.83\u00b111.40 mg/cm3 higher than that in the symmetrical parts, respectively. The di fference of water content in normal bilateral ribs was 8.05\u00b16.13 mg/cm3 but with out difference (p=0.096). The increased water content of fractured ribs was h igher than that of normal ribs (p=0.000), but there was no difference between subtle and occult fractures (p=0.497). According to the classification based on whether the ribs were fractured or not, the AUC was 0.94. Conclusion: It was confirmed by spectral CT that the water cont ent in medullary cavity increased obviously when occult ri b fractures occurred. Limitations: The sample size was small and the study was based o n singlecentre data. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the Tianjin hospital ethics committee: 2021YLS018.

Popp*, A. X. Sinzinger, S. Bette, K. Rippel, F. Braun, J. A. Decker, C. Scheurig-Muenkler, T. J. Kroencke, F. Schwarz; A ugsburg/DE (daniel_popp@t-online.de) Purpose: To investigate the usefulness of virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) reconstructions derived from scans on a novel photo n-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) for artifact reduction in patients status post spinal fixation. Methods or Background: Here, we present initial data from 10 patients stat us post posterior spinal fixation who were scanned as part of routine clinical care on a novel dual-source photon-counting detector CT (NAEOTOM Alpha, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, sets of VMI-reconstructions were performed from 60-190 keV in 10 keV increments . The mean and the standard deviation (SD) of CT-values in 12 defined locations around a pair of pedicle screws on one vertebral level and the SD of homogenous fat were measured and used to calculate an artifact index (A I). Results or Findings: The lowest AI was observed at 110 keV increasing in both lower and higher keV-VMI-reconstructions. For high-artifact regions in close proximity to the screws the difference in AI was significant at energy levels \u00b120 keV. For instance, between the screw heads, AI at 110 keV was 34.0\u00b111.4 increasing to 63.1\u00b122.7 (p=0.002) and to 54.7\u00b118.1 (p=0.015) at 90 and 130 keV, respectively. Overall AI was highest between pedicular screw heads and dorsal to the screw heads and decreased i n regions more distant to the screws. Conclusion: Virtual monoenergetic reconstructions derived from PCD-CT datasets substantially decrease artifacts of spinal fixation metal and thus facilitate the evaluation of peri-implant regions. Interestingly, artifact index was lowest at energy levels ranging from 100-120 keV suggesting this as the ideal window for artifact minimisation. Limitations: The small sample size, this work being a singlecent re, retrospective study as well as the lack of a control group (conventional CT) were identified as limitations.

Dust; Hamburg/DE (k.maas@uke.de) Purpose: To evaluate the applicability of dynamic MRI to con trol surgical correction of patella maltracking in patients with patellofemoral instabilities. Methods or Background: Patients who presented with symptoms of patellofemoral instability (PFI) and patellar maltr acking (PM) between December 2019 and November 2020 were included. Incl usion criteria were reported patellar dislocation and/or persistent feeling of instability after dislocation, a positive (reverse) J-sign as well as clinically increased mediolateral translation. Exclusion criteria were P FI without PM and a limited range of motion (<0\u00b0 extension, <90\u00b0 flexion). All patients were examined using a 3 T MRI with repeated active flexion (40\u00b0) and full extension of the affected knee joint preoperatively and at least 3 months aft er the surgical treatment. Common anatomical risk factors for PM (tibial-tuber osity-to-trochlear-groove- static MRI sequenc es. Dynamic measurement of dynamic mediolateral translation (dMPT) and patella tilt (dPT) were assessed. Results or Findings: 18 Patients (3 males, 15 females, average 23 years) were included in the study. Primarily addressed pat hologies for PM were lateralised-tibial-tubercle, trochlea dysplasia, patella (12.3\u00b17.5 mm vs 5.4\u00b14 .5 mm p=0,028, r=0,585) and the patellotrochlear distance in extension were significantly reduced (15.86 \u00b1 7.55 Postoperative TT-TG, TT-PCL TT-TG correlated with dMPT (p=0,040, r =0,519). Conclusion: Dynamic MRI is a reliable tool to control surgical success, following surgical correction of patella maltracking. Dynamic patellar translation correlated with TT-TG, which enhances its clinical value.

Various biochemical and biophysical processes might be involved in cartilage degradation in different cartilage zones. Thus, the aim of the study was the investigation of T2 relaxation times separately in the deep, intermediate and superficial layers depen ding on the severity of chondromalacia. Methods or Background: 171 (15.1\u00b11.8 years) patients with mild and severe patellar chondromalacia and 51 healthy volunteers ( 14.7\u00b12.2 years) underwent MRI examination including axial T2 mapping (TSE, 6 TE from 13 to 78 ms, voxel size 0.4\u00d70.4\u00d73 mm). T2 were quantified from w hole cartilage and with layer segmentation. One-vs-rest logistic regression was used to create the classification model for chondromalacia severity de termination. Results or Findings: In the superficial layer, no differences between gr oups were found. In the deep and intermediate layer, the 2 significantly increases with the degree of chondromalacia. By contrast, for the whole cartilage only severe chondromalacia shows significant increase in T2 values. Sensitivity and specificity of the created classification model inc reases with the growth of the feature number from 58% and 52% for the whole carti lage assessment to 69% and 61%. Conclusion: Consideration of the differences in the water conce ntration, collagen matrix organisation and anisotropy in the different cartilage zones by the segmentation into layers can significantly incr ease the clinical efficiency of the T2 mapping. This approach increases sensitivity and specificity of chondromalacia stage determination by 17% compared with whole cartilage assessment. Limitations: The main limitation of our study is unbalanced pati ent distribution by groups (the number of subjects with mild chondromalacia is 3-5 times higher than in the severe and control group).

Kaniewska*, J. M. Getzmann, E. Deininger-Czerma k, R. Guggenberger; Zurich/CH (malwina.kaniewska@usz.ch) Purpose: Compare image quality and diagnostic confidence of standard and post-processed motion-insensitive propeller MRI network (DL-CNN ) for assessment of the shoulder joint. Methods or Background: Image quality and diagnostic confidence of standard propeller and sequences using a DL-CNN pos t-processing were assessed. Analysis of shoulder structures was performed. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios were calculated. Wilcoxon signed- rank test was used for comparison. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 412 Results or Findings: 25 MRI of the shoulder joint (18-80y) were analysed. Mean acquisition time for standard vs DL-CNN propel ler MR sequences was 16 min vs 7 min 30 s. Images acquired with standard vs DL-CNN sequences showed a perfect image quality in 20% and 80%, and a good image quality in 66% and 17% of all cases. There was overall a highe r diagnostic confidence for evaluation of shoulder structures DL-CNN sequen ces. Pathologies were rated slightly higher for degeneration of the carti lage (n=4) and degree nces. Delineation of the subacromial bursa was possible in 16 cases only wit h DL-CNN. There was excellent agreement between sequences in evaluation of the AC joint. SNR and CNR was higher for DL-CNN sequences Conclusion: Propeller MRI sequences of the shoulder joint based on a DL- CNN show a higher diagnostic performance and superi or image quality compared to standard sequences resulting in higher diagnostic confidence. Due to significantly shorter scan times and higher SNR and CNR compared to standard sequences, use in clinical routine should be considered.

Methods or Background: Metal artifacts impair image quality in postsurgical imaging. A new type of CT with photon-counting detector may reduce these artifacts. A bovine knee with a fracture and stainl ess-steel plate and screws was imaged in a whole-body research PCD-CT at 120kV and 140kV and in a dual source CT (DSCT) at single energy Sn150kV (SE) and dual energy 80/Sn150kV (DE) (SOMATOM Count Plus and SOMATOM For ce, Siemens Healthcare, Germany). Different sharp kernels (Br59-Br64) were used. PCD- CT images were reconstructed as 72 and 150keV and D SCT images with and without metal artifact reduction algorithm (iMAR). iMAR and tin filter was unavailable on the PCD-CT. Four image sets for each scanner were analysed. Four radiologists rated the anonymised images on a 5-point scale regarding visualisation of the fracture line, bony structure close to and further from the screws as well as metal artifact severity (maximum 5x13=65 points). Mean scores were analysed using the Friedman test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni's correction. P-values of 0.0001 were considered statistically significant. Results or Findings: PCD-CT 140 kV 150 keV Br60 (40 points) and Br64 (38 points) images got the highest mean grades and were significantly better than SE Sn150 Br59 (33 points) but not DE -0.3 Br59 iMAR (35 points) images. PCD-CT 72keV images got the lowest grade (19 points ) and were statistically worse than all the rest. Conclusion: PCD-CT images reconstructed as high keV were better than or as good as, the best DSCT images even without the p resumed advantage of tin filter and metal artifact reducing algorithms. PCD-CT is a promising method to reduce metal artifacts. Limitations: This was an animal specimen study.

A preoperative establishme nt of the tissue responsible for the chordee can aid the decision making and pro gnostication process. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the factors responsible for chordee in each individual case by assessing the stiffness of the ventral penile tissues. Methods or Background: We evaluated nine cases of hypospadias using B- mode ultrasound and strain elastography. Strain ela stography was used to determine the stiffness of ventral penile tissues i ncluding and the corpora cavernosa. Clinical data regarding the severity and type of deformity, and t he subsequent treatment course were recorded. Results or Findings: Strain elastography was able to determine the stiff ness of spongiosal tissue and urethral plate. Three pati ents with mild chordee showed an average strain elastography value of the spongiosal tissue as 0.5. Four patients had moderate chordee and had an average spongiosal strain value of 2.775. Two patients with severe chordee and showed an average spongiosal strain value of 2.8. In addition, the co rporal bodies were stiff in 4 cases (avg strain 3.8) with mild to moderate chordee. However, the cases with severe chordee showed reduced corporal stiffness (0 .75). The findings of our study correlate well with clinical findings and showed a relationship between the severity of chordee and the stiffness of spongi osal tissue. An interesting finding of reduced corporal stiffness in cases of s evere chordee was also seen, suggesting a causal relationship between the two. Conclusion: A preoperative diagnosis of the presence, aetiology and severity of chordee aids in better clinical decision making and patient counselling. Limitations: The fact that cases were limited and age-matched controls were not evaluated was identified as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: Ethics committee approval was granted.

Pecoraro*, E. V. Panebianco; Rome/IT (pecoraro.martina1@gmail.com) Purpose: MRI of the prostate is the gold-standard for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Nonetheless, MRI still misses around 11% of clinically significant disease. The aim was to c omprehensively integrate tissue and circulating microRNA profiling, MRI biom arkers and clinical data to implement early detection. Methods or Background: In this prospective cohort study 76 biopsy-na\u00efve patients underwent MRI and MRI-directed biopsy. A s entinel sample of 15 patients was selected for a pilot molecular analysi s. Weighted gene co- expression network analysis was applied to identify microRNAs drivers of csPCa. Mi-croRNA-target gene-interaction maps were constructed, and enrichment analysis performed. The ANOVA on ranks t est was used. The diagnostic power of each miRNA was evaluated in ter ms of the ROC probability curve analysis. Results or Findings: Disease status was associated with under-expression of the miRNA profiled; a correlation was found with AD C and normalised ADC values (r=-0.64, associated p=0.02), and with PI-RADS assessment score (r=0.73; p=0.02); a linear correlation was found with A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 413 biomarkers of diffusion and perfusion.

ROC analysis showed an accuracy >90%. Conclusion: Provided a validation of the identified microRNAs o n a larger cohort, we propose a diagnostic paradigm shift that sees molecular data and MRI biomarkers as pre-biopsy triage of patients at risk for PCa. This approach will allow for accurate patient allocation to biops y, and for stratification into risk- group categories.

Spiesecke*, J. Mang, T. Fischer, B. Hamm, M. H. Lerchbaumer; Berlin/DE Purpose: The acute rupture of the tunica albuginea the corpora cavernosa is known as penile fracture (PF). While rapid surgi cal therapy leads to improved functional outcome, the role of imaging pr ior to surgery is still under discussion. The aim of this study was to gain further knowledge concerning the role of imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and ultrasound [US]) in the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspicion of PF. Methods or Background: MRI and US examinations performed in our institution between 2000 and 2021 were compared to imaging reports with either intraoperative finding or final clinical diagnosis. Inclusion criteria were a) patient age 18 years, b) available information on trauma histor y and clinical findings on admission, and c) confirmed final urological diagnosis. Besides diagnostic accuracy, typical imaging findings such as penile haematoma, tear of the tunica albuginea including location and involvement of corpus spongiosum were reported. Results or Findings: Overall, 46 out of 88 patients included (54.5%) had a confirmed diagnosis of PF, predominantely right-sid ed. A total of 69 MRI and 31 US examinations were included. Sensitivity and s pecificity were 91.9% (95%-CI: 45.4 - 88.3%) and 100.0% (95%-CI: 81.6 - 100.0%) for US, respectively. Overall, both modalities detected penile haematoma disproportionately often compared with the frequenc y of penile fractures. Conclusion: The findings suggest that MRI is more suitable to c onfirm a PF and determine the exact localisation of a tunica al buginea tear, while US is a adequate tool for ruling out a PF. Limitations: A limitation of our study is its retrospective desi gn, although this is a rational approach when investigating a rare pathology such as PF.

Bicchetti, M. Pecoraro, tem (VI- RADS) score accuracy in predicting muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BCa), in a multicentric national setting. To correlate the c linical and pathology features of bladder cancer with VI-RADS scoring. Methods or Background: Patients with BCa suspicion were offered MRI before TURBT. According to VI-RADS, a cutoff of 3 or 4 was assumed to define muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Trans -urethral resection of the were compa red with preoperative VI-RADS scores to assess accuracy of for and NPV were calculated. Performance was assessed by ROC curve a nalysis. The univariate analysis was performed including clinical and pathology data and the overall VI-RADS categories. A multivariate logistic regress ion model, adjusted for age and sex was implemented to determine the clinico-pathological features that had independent effect on MIBC. Results or Findings: 148 patients were enrolled (median-age [IQR] was 71 [64-77]). MRI showed sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for discriminating NMIBC from MIBC of about 89-91%, 88-90%, 75-78%, an d respectively (according to the different cut-off). AUC was 0.93-0.95. In the multivariable logistic assi gned with a preoperative VI- RADS score of 4-5 was associated with an increased probability of muscle- invasiveness at final pathology. Other positive predictors were represented by macro-haematuria and smoking. Conclusion: VI-RADS assessment scoring proved to be an accurate preoperative tool in predicting bladder cancer invasiveness, in a multicentric setting where MRI acquisition and reporting-related biases can be overcome. In addition, it proved to be an independent predict or of muscle-invasiveness, which might implicate a shift towards a more aggres sive selection approach of patients' candidate to deep TURBT, to avoid delayed time to cystectomy.

Methods or Background: 98 patients undergoing RARP for prostate cancer were scanned with TPUS preoperatively and at four t ime-points postoperatively (3, 6, 9, 12 months). Images were performed using a low frequency curvilinear array abdominal transducer, with TPUS images and real-time video acquired in the dorsal recumbent and standing positions at rest , during PFC and during VS manoeuver. The feasibility of the technique was ass essed and TPUS urodynamic measurements were evaluated including the bladder neck angle at rest and following PFC/VS, and the degree of bladder neck ascent/descent, which was recorded as a resultant vector (in mm). Results or Findings: Preoperative measurements for each of the proposed parameters were technically feasible in more than 8 5% of patients. At postoperative scans the technical feasibility of as sessing parameters pre- and post-PFC and VS manoeuvre was high in both the supi ne and standing positions (>90%). The average membranous urethral l ength reduced postoperatively (12 mm at 12 months), compared to preoperatively (15.2 mm). Postoperatively there was a general trend for an increase in the average angle of change during PFC (17.1\u00b0) and VS (16.2\u00b0) and a i ncrease in the degree of bladder ascent post PFC and increasing bladder desc ent post-VS with increasing postoperative time. At 12 months the ave rage bladder neck vector movement was 7.2 mm (supine) and 8.5 mm (standing) ascent during PFC, and -5.5 mm (supine) and 6.5 mm (standing) descent during VS manoeuver. Conclusion: TPUS offers a reliable, accurate, noninvasive, cost -effective modality for the evaluation of postoperative continence and may be a useful adjunct for guiding pelvic floor exercises in order to preserve continence.

Several qualitative and quantitative clinical (age, PSA, PSAD, percentage of PCA infiltration) and mpMR I parameters (ADC value, signal increase on high b-value images, PCA diameter, extraprostatic extension [EPE], cross-zonal growth) were evaluated and correlated within the four groups. Based on combined descriptors, MRI grading groups (mG1-mG3) were defined to predict PCA aggressiveness. Results or Findings: In total 200 patients (mean age 68 years, median PS A value 8.1ng/ml) were analysed. Between the four groups, statistically significant differences could be shown for age, PSA , PSAD, and for MRI parameters cross-zonal growth, high b-value signal increase, EPE, and ADC (p < 0.01). All examined parameters revealed a signifi cant correlation with the histopathologic biopsy ISUP grade groups (p < 0.01) , except PCA diameter (p = 0.09). A mixed linear model demonstrated the stro ngest prediction of the respective ISUP grade group for the MRI grading sys tem (p < 0.01) compared to single parameters. Conclusion: MpMRI yields relevant pre-biopsy information about PCA aggressiveness. A combination of quantitative and qualitative parameters (MRI grading groups) provided the best prediction of the biopsy ISUP grade group and may improve clinical pathway and treatment planning. Due to the high prevalence of higher-grade PCA in patients within m G3 a timely re-biopsy seems indicated in cases of negative or post-biopsy low-grade PCA. Limitations: Before using MRI grading groups, one should verify that these definitions are suitable for the individual settings. It might be interesting to prove MRI grading in a prospective study design. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

Ueda\u00b9, *Y. To compare the capability for distinguishing malignant from benign areas among CEST imaging, DWI at standard and super high b values and combined discriminators in suspected prostatic canc er patients. Methods or Background: 60 suspected prostatic cancer patients underwent T2WI, DWI at b value as 1500 (DWI1500) and 3000 (DW I3000) s/mm2 and CEST imaging at a 3T MR system and pathological examinations. According to the pathological results, 56 areas were determined as malignant, and 56 out of 664 areas were computationally selected as benign. On each CEST imaging, magnetisation transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) at 3.5 ppm map was generated from z-spectra by analyses (ADC1500) i n each area were determined. Student's t-test was performed to compare all quantitative indexes between two areas. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to investigate the discriminating factors. Then, diagn ostic performance was compared among all methods by ROC analysis. Finally , sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were compared among all methods by McN emar's test. Results or Findings: Each index had significant difference between two a reas (p<0.05). Multivariate regression analyses identifi 0001) as for combined quantitative discriminators. Area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy of combined quantitative predictors were s ignificantly better than those of others (p<0.05). Conclusion: CEST imaging is considered as valuable as both DWIs and should best be combined with DWI3000 for distinguis hing between malignant and benign areas in suspected prostatic cancer pati ents.

Do*, S. Cho, B. S. Choi, S. H. H. Baik, Y. J. B ae, L. Sunwoo, C. Jung, J. H. Kim; Seongnam/KR Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of T2-fluid- attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign for predic tion of a patient with 1p/19q non-codeleted low grade glioma, and identify the causes responsible for the heterogeneity. Methods or Background: A systematic literature search in the Ovid-MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed for studies reporting the relevant topic before November 17, 2020. The pooled sensitivity an d specificity values were calculated. Meta-regression analyses were also perf ormed to determine factors influencing heterogeneity. Results or Findings: For all the 10 included cohorts from 8 studies, the pooled sensitivity was 40% (95% CI 28-53%), and the pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI 95-100%). In the hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curve, the difference between the 95% confidence and prediction regions was relatively large, indicating heterogeneity among the studies. Higgins I2 statistics demonstrated considerable het erogeneity in sensitivity (I2 = 83.5%) and specificity (I2 = 95.83%). Among the potential covariates, it seemed that none of factors was significantly assoc iated with study heterogeneity in the joint model. However, the spec ificity was increased with all the factors based on the differences of the composi tion of the detailed tumours. Conclusion: The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign is a near-perfect specif ic marker of IDH mutation and 1p/19q non-codeletion. Limitations: First, we assumed that MRI sequence acquisition par ameters could be confounders in interpreting the presence o f T2-FLAIR mismatch sign; however, most studies did not present the detailed parameters. Second, the definition of T2-FLAIR mismatch sign was not identi cal across the studies, despite being similar. Third, all cohorts of the included studies were retrospective, resulting in a risk of selection bias. Ethics committee approval: The requirement was waived because of the retrospective nature of this study.

PET with tumour specific markers may be helpful. This prospective study aimed to compare the newer marker 18 F-fluorothymidine (FLT) with 11 C-methionine (MET) in the discrimination between a recurrent int racranial tumour and treatment-induced changes with PET. Methods or Background: 20 patients with intracranial tumours (17 high- malignant tumours) treated with surgery, radiothera py and in 15 cases chemotherapy, presenting with a new enhancing lesion on MRI were recruited. After standard examinations, all patients underwent MET-PET and FLT-PET. The results were compared to the definite diagnosis achieved by histopathology or follow-up at 6 months. Measurements were made by two independent observers. The means of their measureme nts were used in the analyses. The mean standardised uptake value (SUV) of the area of maximum uptake in the suspected tumour was normalised to th e mean SUV of the contralateral cortex (T/N ratio). Diagnostic efficacy was determined through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analy sis. Results or Findings: 11 patients had tumour recurrence and 9 patients ha d treatment-induced changes. 6 patients (5 tumour rec urrence, one treatment- induced change) had histopathological diagnosis. Da ta of one MET-PET were lost. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 for F LT-PET and 0.77 for MET- PET. T/N ratios 3.60 and 1.64 were chosen as cut-of f values in FLT-PET and MET-PET, respectively. 17/20 lesions (85%) were cor with FLT-PET and 80% and 67% with MET-PET, respectively. Conclusion: Results in this small material indicate that FLT ma y be a useful marker in discriminating recurrent tumours from tre atment-induced changes.

In this prospective study, we compared IVIM with dynam ic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI for differentiation of intracra nial tumour recurrence from treatment-induced changes. Methods or Background: 60 patients, previously treated with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy for intracranial tumours (48 high-malignant tumours), with a new contrast enhancing lesion, or with increase in size of a known contrast enhancing lesion, were included. The final diagnosi s was the diagnosis at 6 months after inclusion from either neuropathological examination (n=19) or clinical diagnosis based on all available clinical and radiological follow-up (n=41). The patients were examined at 1.5 T with routine MRI sequences, DSC perfusion for calculation of blood volume (rCBV) and a multiple b-value diffusion-weighted sequence for calculation of the perfusion fraction (f) using IVIM technique. Measurements of rCBV and f were mad e in perfusion hot spots in the area of contrast enhancement by two independent observers. Means of their measures were used in analyses. Meas ures of rCBV were normalised to normal appearing contralateral white matter. Results or Findings: Forty-four patients had tumour recurrence and 16 ha d treatment-induced changes. Mean normalised rCBV was 3.52 for tumours and 1.79 for treatment-induced changes (p=0.002). Mean f was 0.090 for tumours and 0.058 for treatment-induced changes (p=0.002). ROC analysis showed area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (rCBV) and 0.72 (f). Cut-off values of 2.26 for rCBV and 0.073 for f yielded equal values for s ensitivity (73%), specificity (75%), and accuracy (73%). Conclusion: with IVIM and DSC yields si milar differential diagnostic value for differentiation b etween intracranial tumour recurrence and treatment-induced changes.

E. zone involvement (SVI) and evaluate the prognostic value of by using a pre-existing survival nomogram in a prospective brain tumour registry. Methods or Background: This retrospective study identified patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma from a prospective brain tumour registry (NCT NCT02619890). The subventricular zone involvement ( SVI) was defined as presence of contrast-enhancing lesion within 5 mm of ventricular wall, assessed by two neuroradiologists indepedently. The associations of SVI with overall survival (OS) were evaluated and a survival model was created with clinical predictors - age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, extent of resection, and MGMT promoter methylation status by using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Performanc e of the SVI-updated survival model was compared with that from the RTOG nomogram (doi:10.1093/neuonc/now208) using c-index and area under the curve (AUC) of the time-dependent receiver operating characteristi c analysis. Results or Findings: A total of 203 patients (median age, 60 years; 91 women) were evaluated. SVI was adversely associated with OS (hazard ratio, 1.98 [95% CI: 1.30, 3.02; P=.001]). The overall per formance was superior in the SVI-updated model compared with the RTOG model (c-index, 0.706 vs 0.684). Moreover, the SVI-updated model had an value zone involvement is an independent adverse prognostic factor in patients with IDH-wild type gl ioblastoma. The approach has advantages in terms of survival model update and guiding clinical management. Limitations: This was a retrospective study.

Kim, To identify whether imaging-based risk stratificati on enables prognostication in patients with diffuse glioma, NO S (Not Otherwise Specified). Methods or Background: Data in patients classified as diffuse glioma, NOS through the revised 2021 WHO classification between January 2011 and December 2020 were included. From presurgical CT and MRI, integrative analysis was performed by two neuroradiologists to assign gliomas to the three imaging-based risks considering tumour location, ma rgin, contrast- enhancement pattern, necrosis, hemorrhage/calcifica tion, internal cyst, and T2/FLAIR mismatch. The free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of each risk were shown using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Performance of the imaging-based survival model wit h other predictors - age at diagnosis, extent of resection, adjuvant treatment, histological type and WHO grade - was compared with that of the historical molecular-based survival model (N Engl J Med 2015 DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa1402121) using the time- dependent receiver-operating-characteristic analysi s. Results or Findings: A total of 220 patients (median age, 46 years; inte r- quartile range, 35-55 years; 130 males) were evaluated. Distinct prognostic stratification was achieved according to the three imaging-based risks (log-rank test, p<.001). The imaging-based survival model achieved high prognostic values with 1-year area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 792 for PFS and 0.676 for OS, similar to the molecular-based model (AUC 0.74 for PFS and 0.87 for OS). For long-term prognostication, the imaging-based survival model showed high performance in performance in diffuse glioma, NOS , which aids to guide patient referral when molecular diagnosis is not av ailable.

P. classification amalgamates histological biomarkers for the diagnosis of diffuse glioma. T2-FLAIR mismatch is a validated radiological correlate for the diagnosis of IDH mutant 1p19q non- codeleted astrocytoma. Central FLAIR suppression may be inhomogeneous, corresponding to regions of intra-tumoural heteroge neity, the true nature of which remains uncertain. Methods or Background: 128 IDH mutant diffuse gliomas were reviewed (2014-2019) for T2-FLAIR mismatch sign, including m ultiparametric MRI, and correlated with molecular and histological data. Results or Findings: 9 showed true T2-FLAIR mismatch, all astrocytomas, grade II 5/9 (55%) and grade 4/9 (45%), median follow-up 7.1 \u00b1 3.3 years. Multiparametric MRI was performed in 6. 3/6 showed a normal index choline/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr), the other half sho wed mildly raised Cho/Cr 1.37 - 1.56 on short TE single voxel spectroscopy. 2/6 s howed significantly raised peak Cho/Cr 2.14 - 2.33 on short TE 2D chemical shi ft imaging (CSI). These abnormal areas on CSI were highly visually correlat ed with intra-tumoural ADC/T2 hypointensity and FLAIR hyperintensity. None showed hyperperfusion blood volume, rCBV >2.0) or enhancement. Conclusion: T2-FLAIR mismatch is infrequently seen in astrocytoma, but 100% specific when present. Correlating standard st ructural with intra- tumoural regions of tumoural heterogeneity, suggesting the greatest vol ume of cellularity/activity in specific areas of the core. These areas were target ed for biopsy, and also corresponded to areas of recurrence if not completely debulked. Structural MRI and spectroscopy are complementary to an integrated molecular and histological grading approach in the new WHO 2021 c lassification. Limitations: Small numbers due to tumour rarity.

When presenting as a single lesion, brain metastasis can have similar conventional imaging appearances to gl ioblastoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the accuracy of radio mics and machine learning for distinguishing between glioblastoma and brain m etastasis, on contrast- enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI). Methods or Background: Retrospective analysis was undertaken of 106 treatment-na\u00efve lesions (53 IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, 53 brain metastases) with a diameter greater than 10 mm. Lesions were manually segmented on volumetric CE-T1WI and after pre-processing steps, 107 quantitative shape- based, first order and second order radiomic featur es were extracted for each lesion using PyRadiomics. A multi-step nested data processing and machine learning pipeline was created to perform feature selection within bootstrapped cross-validated recursive feature elimination with a random forest algorithm, followed by five-fold cross-validation with a Naive Bayes classifier to validate the final model. Results or Findings: The most predictive features included two shape-bas ed features (least axis length, sphericity), and one f irst order feature (energy). The glioblastoma group showed significantly higher leas t axis length, lower sphericity, and higher energy (p<0.001). The combin ed final model had an AUC negative predictive value 88.7% (78.6-94.4). A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 417 Conclusion: A machine learning-based radiomics model using shape-based and first order features from a single whole tumour segmentation mask on CE- T1WI can differentiate between IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and metastasis with a moderately high accuracy. Limitations: Multi-institutional data and the use of clinical features, semantic features, multiple sequences or advanced parameters and perilesional environment mask may help improve diagnostic accuracy further.

T. Fernandez Taranilla*, E. Salvador, P. Martin Medina, A. Hilario, J. Sepulveda, V. M. P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda, Madrid/ES (maiteftr@hotmail.com) Glioblastoma is still the most common malignant brain tumour with a very short expected survival; even with early treat ment. The main goal of this study is to determine if there are differences in s urvival depending on residual tumour volume (RTV) and preoperative tumour volumes . The secondary goals were to determine if outcomes are different for pat ients who underwent partial resection vs complete resection and to identify if certain tumour locations were associated with better outcomes. Methods or Background: 128 primary wild-type glioblastoma patients from different institutions were retrospectively reviewe d. Pre- and post-contrast 3D T1 weighted images were evaluated to determine pre- and postoperative tumor volumes. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on bot h volumes, type of surgery and tumour's location. Spearman correlation s were used to investigate the association between postoperative tumour volume and survival. Results or Findings: There were no significant differences in survival i n patients with higher preoperative tumour volumes, however, patients with RTV< 7cc had an increased survival of 9,30 months c ompared with higher RTV (p<0,001). Extent of resection >51% increased survi val by 10 months compared with lower percentages of resection (p<0,0 01). Total and subtotal resected patients increased survival months comp ared with just biopsied (p<0,001). Basal ganglia and corpus callosum were t he locations with the worst survival compared with brain lobules locations (p=0 ,003). Eloquent and near eloquent regions had worse survival compared with t umour in non-eloquent areas. Conclusion: Patients with RTV< 7cc exhibit significant better s urvival independently of presurgery tumor volume. Even subt otal resection could increase survival when total resection is not possi ble and location of the tumour is an important prognostic factor of final o utcome. Limitations: The main limitation of the study is its retrospecti ve design, which may cause a selection bias.

Standard high-resolution MRSI is prohibit ively long and strategies for accelerating data acquisition are needed. In this work we developed a new MRSI method that combines fast non-cartesian k-spac e trajectories with compressed-sense acceleration at 7 Tesla. Methods or Background: A new sequence (ECcentric Circle ENcoding TRajectorIes for Compressed-sensing - ECCENTRIC) was implemented on a 7T MRI (Terra, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with an excite-acquire a 3.4x3.4x3. 4 mm3 spatial resolution. The acquisition time was 9 min 20 s. MR SI data were reconstructed with a low-rank compressed-sense model and fitted w ith LCModel. 9 glioma patients (2 GBM, 6 anaplastic were scanned. Results or Findings: High-resolution metabolic maps provide structural details for tumour boundary and heterogeneity similar to anatomical imaging. In addition to typical metabolites such a N-acetyl-asp artate and choline, good quality glutamate, glycine and myo-inositol. Conclusion: ECCENTRIC MRSI is tool for high-resolution metabolic imaging for brain tumours and other neurological di seases. MRSI has high specificity for molecular mechanisms of disease and may enable precision medicine in patients. MRSI can be repeated without limitations for safety risks, does not require radioactive tracers and is a cheaper alternative than other molecular imaging modalities.

C. Feuerriegel*\u00b9, S. Kronthaler\u00b9, Y. N. Leonhar M. A. S. Gersing\u00b9; \u00b9Munich/DE, \u00b2Hamburg/DE Purpose: To evaluate the performance of single echo Dixon wa ter-fat imaging and computed tomography (CT)-like imaging based on a single-TE UTE (sUTE) MR sequence for imaging of vertebral fractur es as well as degenerative bone changes of the spine in comparison to conventi onal CT and MR sequences. Methods or Background: 30 patients with CT images of acute vertebral fractures were examined using a 3T-MRI, including a sUTE sequence as well as short-tau-inversion-recovery (STIR) and T1-weigh ted sequences. Dixon water-fat separation was performed by solving the s moothness-constrained inverse water-fat problem. By removing the unwanted low-frequency phase terms, additional CT-like susceptibility-weighted i mages were created. Two radiologists evaluated the semi-quantitative and quantitative morphological features of fractures and degenerative changes on C T and MR-images. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 418 Results or Findings: Of 58 fractures detected, 24 were identified correc tly as acute fractures with an oedema detected on the wate r-fat separated UTE images, using STIR and T1w sequences as standard of reference ( 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.00). For morphologi cal assessment the overall agreement between CT-like SW-images and CT was subs 0.88 (95%CI 0.73-1.00). Conclusion: Detection of vertebral fractures as well as the mor phological assessment of fractures and degenerative bone changes were feasible and accurate using water-fat separated images as well as CT-like SW-images, both derived from the sUTE-Dixon technique. Simultaneous ly extracting water-fat images and CT-like images from one single MR sequence could be highly useful for clinical examinations due to a reduction of overall examination times and radiation exposure. Limitations: sUTE Echo-time was 0.14ms, which might not be achievable on older scanners. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Methods or Background: Fifty patients with various spinal pathologies were prospectively enrolled. Each patient underwent TSE and TSE-DL sequences using a 3-fold and 4-fold acceleration. The number of signal averages was reduced in TSE-DL images to a factor of \"1\". Image evaluation was performed by two radiologists in a blinded and a randomised m anner. An interchangeability analysis and an image quality-based analyses were performed. Interchangeability was tested using the individual-equivalence- index regarding various spinal pathologies, which w ere analysed on each vertebra. A decrease in interobserver agreement of 5% when one reader used TSE-DL compared with when both readers used the standard protocol was considered clinically significant. Interreader and intrareader agreement were assessed using Cohen's-Kappa. Image-quality cr iteria were: sharpness of anatomical structures (intervertebral discs, spinal canal, facet joints and neuroforamina), artifacts, noise, overall image-quality, and diagnostic confidence. Results or Findings: Mean patient age was 46\u00b118 years. Thirty-eight exam s were performed at 1.5T and twelve exams at 3T. TSE- DL enabled up to 73% reduction of acquisition time. A high-degree of int erchangeability between both protocols was noted (individual-equivalence-index r anged between 1-3 %). For TSE-DL, noise was rated significantly superior by b oth readers (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between both protocols regarding all other image quality criteria. Conclusion: The data-driven TSE-DL is clinically feasible and i nterchangeable with standard TSE for detecting various spinal path ologies. TSE-DL provided excellent image quality and diagnostic confidence w ith a significant reduction of examination time by 70%. The DL technique might set the stage for ultr a- fast spine MRI.

Khil*, preoperative MRI and ndings of herniated disc in cervical spine (C-spine) and to c ompare the diagnostic performance of two new MRI signs in the diagnosis of the ruptured disc. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included patients who underwent C-spine MRI and surgery for disc pathology with intraoperative confirmation of ruptured disc (September 1, 2016 to January 31, 2021). Two radiologists evaluated whether the disc was extruded or ruptured during two reading sessions: session 1 without signs (criterio n 1) and session 2 with additional two new MRI signs (sign 1= ghost; sign 2= mushroom) suggesting ruptured disc (criterion 2). All ruptured discs evaluated on session 2 were included in extruded discs. Using surgical findings as the reference standard, the diagnostic performance of two criteria was anal ysed by the validity and McNemar's test. Interobserver agreement was measure d for each MRI sign. Results or Findings: A total of 91 patients with 131 discs were enrolled (mean age, 56.02\u00b112.93; range 26-88; 62 men), out of thes e, 62 were surgically confirmed with ruptured disc. When the MRI diagnosi s was based on Criterion 1 alone, extruded disc was diagnosed with 62.9-79.0% sensitivity, 81.2-95.7% specificity, and 80.2% accuracy; for ruptured disc, 35.5-45.2% sensitivity, 94.2- 97.1% specificity, 67.9-71.0% accuracy were found. However, based on criterion 2, extruded disc was diagnosed with 96.8% sensitivity, 72.5-78.3% specificity, and 84.0-87.0% accuracy; the same values were noted for ruptured disc. For ruptured disc, sensitivity and accuracy v alues were significantly different between criteria 1 and 2 (p<0.001). Inter observer agreements were substantial (0.74-0.79 vs 0.68-0.79 in sign 1 and 2, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Detection of \"ghost sign\" and \"mushroom sign\" on pr eoperative MRI can lead to more accurate diagnosis of clinical ly ruptured disc.

B. To evaluate the reliability of a novel MRI method f or assessment of fatty infiltration of the paraspinal muscles (FIPM) and its association with the clinical symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Methods or Background: Axial T2-weighted routine MR images of 243 patients with symptomatic LSS were evaluated by four independent investigators. Muscle fat index (MFI) was calculate d by dividing the signal intensity of the psoas muscle with that of the mult ifidus and erector Goutallier fication System (GCS). Observer reliability was assessed by Intraclass Cor relation Coefficient (ICC) for MFI (AC1) for GCS. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses (adjusted for age, sex, weight, and smoking) were performed to assess the associations between F IPM, and pain and disability reported by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) and a numeric rati ng scale for back and leg pain. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 419 Results or Findings: Inter- and intraobserver reliability was good or ex cellent for MFI (ICC range 0.87 to 0.99) but varied from fair to almost perfect for GCS (AC1 range 0.35 to 0.93). The results of the regres sion analyses suggested associations between FIPM assessed by both methods and the clinical measures. Compared to GCS, regression models including MFI suggested slightly stronger association with ODI and ZCQ. Conclusion: MFI is a highly reliable quantitative method for ev aluation of FIPM by using routine spine MRI, demonstrating associati ons with pain and disability in patients with LSS. Limitations: Including patients with symptomatic LSS may lead to an overestimation of the associations between FIPM and clinical symptoms.

Modugno*, G. Negro, A. Dell'Amore, R. Rea, C. Giraudo; Padua/IT (modugno.a@libero.it) Purpose: To assess the role of muscle composition and radiom ics in predicting allograft rejection in lung transplant ( LT). Methods or Background: The last available chest computed tomography before surgery of patients undergoing LT in our ter tiary center was retrospectively examined. One radiologist with four years of experience in chest and musculoskeletal imaging segmented the spi nal muscles of each patient at the level of the 11th dorsal vertebra covering a volume of 1 cm height by an open source software (3D Slicer, www.slicer.o rg). The same software was applied to extract 33 radiomic features of firs t and second order. Factor analysis was applied to select highly correlating f eatures; the prognostic value of the selected features for allograft rejection wa s investigated by logistic regression analysis. If a significant prognostic role emerged, then the diagnostic value of the model was computed by ROC c urves. Muscle composition expressed in Hounsfield Unit (Hu) was c ollected by the same software. The applied level of significance was 0.05 for all analyses. Results or Findings: Ninety-seven patients were examined (29 women; mean age 50.4\u00b113 yrs old). Thirty-seven patients underwe nt LT for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, 21 patients showed all ograft rejection. The mean Hu value of the examined spinal muscles was 36.6\u00b18. The following features were selected by the factor analysis: cluster promi nence, lmc2, gray level non- level non-uniformity, and inverse variance. The radiomics-based model including also Hu demonstrated that only the feature lmc2 acts as a predictor of allograft r ejection (p=0.021). The model showed 76.6% accuracy and the lmc2 value of 0.19 demonstrated 81% sensitivity and 64.5% specificity in predicting LT rejection. Conclusion: The radiomic feature lmc2 was demonstrated to be a predictor of allograft rejection in LT.

I. Rozalli, Y. T. Lim, W. Y. Chan, *F. B. Fadzli *, T. Li Kuo, K. Rahmat; Kuala Lumpur/MY (farhana.fadzli@yahoo.com) Purpose: To investigate the association between the lumbar paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration and muscle size with the severity of LSS. To examine the diagnostic accuracy of qualitative visual gradi ng in evaluating paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration. Methods or Background: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative disc disease that commonly affects older adults. Th e relationship between morphometric changes of lumbar paraspinal muscles w ith LSS is scarcely studied. Seventy symptomatic patients who underwent lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were enrolled. Severity of lumbar central canal stenosis (LCCS) at L3/L4 to L5/S1 levels was graded as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2) and severe (Grade 3). Paraspinal muscle morphometric parameters including visual grading of fatty infilt ration, fatty infiltration percentage (FI%) and functional muscle cross-sectional area (FCSA) of erector spinae (ES) and multifidus (MF) muscles were measur ed at L3/L4 to L5/S1 levels using simplified 3-tier classification. Associations between the paraspinal muscle parameters and severity of LSS were examined. Diagnostic accuracy of the visual grading of fatty infiltration was det ermined using quantitative FI% as reference. Results or Findings: There were statistically significant low positive correlations (rs < 0.3) observed between the visual ly graded paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration and severity of LCCS in ES at L4 /L5 and MF at L4/L5 and L5/S1. Significant association was also found between the severity of LCCS and FI% at those same levels. FCSA of MF was smalle r in patients with Grade 3 LCCS compared to other grades at L4/L5 and L5/S1. Qualitative visual grading of fatty infiltration was accurate on all p araspinal muscles compared with quantitative measurement. Conclusion: There were significant associations between the sev erity of LSS and paraspinal muscle fatty infiltration as well as MF atrophy at L4/L5 and L5/S1. Limitations: The small number of patients was identified as a li mitation. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee (MEDIC No:201782-5456).

Methods or Background: 40 patients with Low Back Pain (LBP) (22 males, 18 females; mean age 46.15 chemodiscolysis. Thirty-one sex- and age-matc hed as controls and were treated by CT-guided periradicula r injections. All patients were assessed clinically trough the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and radiologically , by using a 3Tscanner, for evaluating the intervertebral disc area (IDA) and t he T2-mapping values of the IVD before, at 1-month, and 6-months follow-up. Results or Findings: The mean pre-treatment T2 relaxation time values we re 38.80\u00b14.51 ms, 44.05\u00b10.91 ms, and 45.45\u00b114.11 ms for the anterior annulus fibrosus nucleus pulposus (NP), and posterio r annulus fibrosus (pAF), respectively, with a significant increase at the level of the NP (p<0,05) at the 1- month follow-up. The 6-months follow-up showed a re duction with normalisation of intradiscal T2 relaxation time val ues showed a significant correlation of NP values with both the reduction of IDA (0.81, p<0.001) and the improvement of clinical scores (0.86, p<0.001). In the control group, despite the clinical improvement, we did not find significa nt IVA reduction nor significant T2 values changes after treatment. Conclusion: T2-mapping may be a useful indicator to predict dis c chrinkage and the clinical response to CT-guided 02 - 03 injection. Limitations: The study population was limited.

H. Alanazi*, L. Rainford, A. Cradock; Dublin/IE Purpose: The study aims to determine the percentage of Lumbar Spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (LSMRI) referrals which were not indicated for scanning and compare radiology clinical decisions t o iRefer adherence. Methods or Background: Clinical indications were extracted from 1021 LSMRI referrals. Two review groups were involved: t hree MRI radiologists and three MRI radiographers. Radiologists were asked to assign the referrals' appropriateness as indicated or not indicated for i maging based on their clinical judgement. The radiographers were asked to follow i Refer guidelines to assign the appropriateness. Majority voting for each refer ral was applied to both review groups and agreement between reviewers in each group was measures using Kappa analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify specialties associated with high rates of referring indicated referrals. Results or Findings: 21.7% and 11.9% of the referrals were found not indicated for MRI for radiologists and radiographer s, respectively. Not indicated referrals from general practitioners reached 17%-18% of the total referrals received from them. Agreement between radiologists was fair: Kappa =0.23, and between radiographers was also fair: Kappa = 0. 26. Neurosurgery was associated with the highest rate of referring indic ated referrals across both review groups: oncology referrals raised the highes t number of open comments. Conclusion: Findings indicate the importance of both guidelines adherence and clinical judgement to optimise practice. Involv ement of MRI radiographers in referrals auditing can offer substantial support to radiology services. Limitations: Selection bias may existed as the data was retrospe ctively collected. Very limited written comments were provi ded on not indicated referrals by reviewers, therefore, the ability to f ollow-up on reviewer decisions was limited.

Picasso, F. Zaottini, *F. Genoa/IT Purpose: The aim of this study was twofold: i) to describe t he normal ultrasound (US) appearance of the Great Auricular N erve (GAN) and its divisional branches along their course across the posterior triangle of the neck and in the face region; ii) to investigate the potential of US in disclosing pathological findings affecting the GAN in patients with sensory disturbances in its territory following partial or total parotidect omy. Methods or Background: The effectiveness of US in recognising the GAN and its divisional branches was firstly tested by i njecting latex under US guidance in n:2 face specimens. A series of n:30 he althy volunteers was then evaluated with a 33-9MHz US probe to establish an appropriate scanning protocol for the GAN and its divisional branches. F inally, a cohort of n:18 patients with sensory disturbances in the territory of the GAN following partial or total parotidectomy was examined with US. Results or Findings: In cadavers, US-guided latex injection confirmed th e correct identification of the GAN and its anterior and posterior divisional branches. In 86.7% of volunteers the GAN was seen s plitting in an anterior and a posterior branch along its course superficial to the sternocleidomastoid. At this level, GAN diameter averaged 1.3\u00b10.2 mm. In 13.3% of volunteers the nerve bifurcated before emerging from the posterior margin of the muscle. In both cases, the posterior branch resulted significantly larger than the anterior (p<.001). Pathologic abnormalities of the GAN were detected and characterised in all of the patients. Conclusion: Ultra high-resolution US is an effective diagnostic tool to identify the GAN and its terminal branches and allows to det ect nerve pathologic changes in patients with iatrogenic damage followin g parotidectomy. Limitations: The small number of patients examined was identifie d as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: The present study is in accordance with the Helsinki criteria.

Recently, Tomographic Ultrasound (tUS) has made it possible t o transform standard ultrasound systems into a tomographic imaging devic e comparable to multiplanar imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. The purpose of this prospective multimodal study is to compare the volumetric results of 3D tUS to MR-N (including MR-Tractography). Methods or Background: 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with peripheral neuropathies underwent high-resolution t US and high-field MRN. A PIUR tUS infinity system was used to convert a sequ ence of 2D ultrasound images into high-resolution tomographic 3D ultrasound volume. Peripheral nerves were reconstructed using an automatised trac king algorithm. MRI was performed using a high-field 3 Tesla MR system. Det erministic tractography was used to perform the nerve tract reconstruction (b-values of 0 and 700 s/ mm2, 16 diffusion encoding directions). Results or Findings: The results from the MR-N (including MR-T) and the tUS provided comparable results. In cases of heavily pathologically altered nerves tUS was able to depict the structurally altered ner ve in 3D, while MR-T failed to do so, due to changes in the nerve anisotropic char acteristics. 3D reconstruction of small nerves (diameter >2mm) was superior using tUS. Conclusion: tUS can reliably visualise normal peripheral nerves , as well as pathologies. tUS can therefore be considered a reli able technique for diagnostic assessment of peripheral nerve pathologi es, and therefore could be used as a complement to MR-N in the imaging of more superficial peripheral nerves and their pathologies, due to its high-resol ution ultrasound-based approach.

Author Disclosures: Gerd Co-Author CT-like MR-derived images for the assessment of craniosynostosis and other pathologies of the paediatric skull *Y. N. S. Kronthaler, C. D. C. Karampinos, B. J. Schwaiger, M. Makowski, I. I. I. W oertler, A. S. Gersing; Munich/DE (yannik.leonhardt@tum.de) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of CT-like images based on a 3D T1SGRE sequence for the visualisation of the paediatric skull and for the identification of pathologies such as prematurely f used cranial sutures or fractures. Methods or Background: In 20 patients with suspected craniosynostosis (mean age 1.26\u00b11.38 years, 10 females), MR imaging was performed including CT-like images and 3D reconstructions derived from a T1SGRE. Image quality and osseous pathologies were evaluated by two radiologists. The results were compared to the diagnosis derived from the other im aging modalities (radiography, CT, ultrasound) and from the intraope rative findings. Additionally, we included two more patients that presented with s kull fractures (0.5 and 6.3 years, both male). Results or Findings: Of the 22 patients, 8 had a metopic, 4 a coronal and 2 a sagittal craniosynostosis. Two patients showed a complex combination of craniosynostoses. The agreement between the diagnos is made based on the T1SGRE and the final diagnosis was substantial (Coh en's 0.89[0.67, 1.00] for A B and 0.78 [0.50, 1.00] for radiologist 2). Of the patients with skull fractures, one presented with a \"ping pong\" skull f racture and one with a fracture of the right temporal bone. Both radiologi sts could identify the fractures correctly. Conclusion: The visualisation of the paediatric skull and the assessment of sutures and fractures using a CT-like T1SGRE MR-seq uence is feasible and comparable to other imaging modalities and may help to reduce the radiation exposure in paediatric patients. Limitations: There was an average acquisition time of 4 minutes 55 seconds, termination of the image acquisition due to motion artifacts or agitation of the child being a possibility. Moreover, our patient cohort size was fairly small. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the local institutional review board (Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty, TU Munich).

Vourtsis*, A. Kachulis; Athens/GR Purpose: This study prospectively evaluated the performance of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS), hand-held breast ultrasou nd (HHUS), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as adjunct to digital mammography in women with dense breasts. Methods or Background: Under an IRB protocol that required a written consent, a total of 2000 women with heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts (aged 52.2\u00b19.4 years, range: 34-88 years) were recruited. Concurrent 2D mammography in the MLO projection, DB T in MLO and CC projection, ABUS and HHUS were performed. All exami nations were independently evaluated by two experienced radiologists. Results or Findings: This study cohort revealed 53 cancers (36 invasive carcinomas and 17 DCIS) of which 45/53 cancers were seen on mammography (29 invasive and 16 DCIS). ABUS detecte d 43/53 cancers (36 invasive and 7 DCIS), of which 7 invasive carcinomas were not seen on mammography. DBT identified 47/53 cancers (32 invas ive and 15 DCIS). ABUS detected 4 invasive carcinomas not seen on DBT , but 9 cases of DCIS not seen on ABUS were found on DBT; ABUS identified 1 case of DCIS that was not evident on DBT. Both ABUS and HHUS showed a n excellent agreement. Overall, ABUS detected an additional 3.5 invasive cancers per 1000 women, while 35.6% (16/45) of cancers seen on mammography and 31.9% (15/47) seen on DBT were DCIS. Conclusion: The outcome of this prospective study shows that AB US detected additional invasive cancers not seen on mammography or on DBT in women with dense breasts. ABUS showed a comparable perfor mance with HHUS in breast cancer detectability. Limitations: Prospective evaluation for the assessment of interv al cancer rates is needed.

Methods or Background: Recalled women aged 40-80 were enrolled to undergo CEM alongside standard assessment (SA: tomosynthesis, additional views, and/or ultrasound). Exclusion criteria were breast symptoms, breast implants, allergy to iodinated contrast agents, ren al failure, and pregnancy. One of five radiologists (6-30 years of experience) independently evaluated SA or CEM, recommending biopsy or 2-year follow-up. The McNemar's test was used to compare the biopsy rate of the CEM-base d work-up with the SA- based biopsy rate. Sensitivity, specificity, positi ve and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for recombined CEM (rCEM, i.e., assessing only the contrast enhancement) for lesions with available biopsy report. Results or Findings: Between January 2019 and July 2021, 206 women (median age 57 years, interquartile range 50-65) were enrolled at two centres, with 223 suspicious findings. Overall, 134/223 findings were referred for biopsy, 85/223 by both SA and rCEM, 44/223 by SA al one, 5/223 by biopsy rate biopsy rate of SA (57.8%, 51.3-64.1%). Considering the 127/134 biopsies with available reports (48 benign and 79 malignant lesions) rCEM showed 87.3% in situ, all of them detectable on low-energy CEM images. Conclusion: Compared to SA, the rCEM-based work-up would have avoided biopsy for 39/223 (17.5%) suspicious findings. The inclusion of low-energy images in exam interpretation may provide optimal overall CEM sensitivity. Limitations: This work's nature as a non-randomised study was id entified as a limitation.

S. Alshabibi, *M. E. Suleiman*, R. Heard, K. Tap ia, P. Brennan; Sydney/AU Purpose: The effects of time of day, previous night's sleep, and excessive workloads on vigilance and general performance are well understood across many domains, but few studies have evaluated their effects on radiologist performance when diagnosing breast cancer. Methods or Background: Radiologists read test sets at conference workshops. In study 1, we analysed 197 reading assessments using five test sets with timestamps to determine whether time of d ay influenced specificity, lesion sensitivity, and JAFROC. Study 2 examined 133 reading assessments to determine whether sensitivity, specificity, lesi on sensitivity, ROC AUC, and JAFROC were influenced by the previous night's hour s of sleep. Study 3 assessed the performance of 10 radiologists on thre e series of 20 test cases presented without breaks to determine whether the order in which a series was read (i.e. fixed-series sequence) affected sensitiv ity, specificity, lesion sensitivity, or ROC AUC. We also examined interacti ons between the fixed- series sequence and radiologist experience (annual number of readings). Results or Findings: 1) Adjusting for experience and fellowship, we found lower specificity in the late morning and late afternoon than the early morning and mid-afternoon. 2) Less experienced radiologists with 6 hours of sleep had lower ROC values than those with >6 hours, but experienced radiologists were unaffected. 3) Linear interactions between experience and fixed-series sequences were found for sensitivity and lesion sen sitivity - experienced A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 422 readers improved during the last test case series w hile less experienced readers deteriorated. Specificity and ROC AUC were unaffected. Conclusion: Time of day, previous night's sleep, and high repor ting volume without breaks can affect radiologist performance, with important implications for planning radiology schedules and fostering accurate reporting.

Anaby*, G. Zimmerman Moreno, N. Nissan, E. Frie dman, M. Sklair Levy; Ramat Gan/IL Purpose: Facilitate early of breast cancer (BC) in BRCA-carriers based on computational analysis of breast MRI scans . Methods or Background: BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are at a high-risk for developing BC, likely to be high-grade with an aggr essive progression and an early age onset. A surveillance scheme including annual MRI (from 25 years of age) reduces advanced-stage diagnosis. In a retrospective visualisation of breast MRI scans from ~1 year prior to the diagnosi s of BC in 42 BRCA- carriers, enhancing lesions were visualised in ~60% of the cases. However, cancer was revealed only ~1 year later at the next annual MRI scan. We hypothesised that quantitative computational analys is of MRI with AI techniques may enable focusing and flagging radiologically suspicious regions ~1 year before diagnosis. Breast MRI scans of the f ollowing BRCA-carrier groups at two time-points were considered: (1) 42 patients at BC diagnosis and ~1 year before (2) 40 cancer-free patients at consecutive time-points, ~1 year apart. and ~250 \"curveology \" and \"deep radiomics\" features were extracted from corresponding regions in the scans from ~1 year before. A selection of 10 features was performed us ing feature's AUCs (Area Under ROC Curve), followed by Jansen-Shannon divergence analysis. The predictive power was tested by an SVM model on the full- and reduced-sets of features. Results or Findings: Using the 10-feature set, in 34/42 (~80%) cases, BC was successfully identified in the scans ~1 year pr ior to diagnosis. In the comparison group 13/40 (33%) cancer-free carriers w ere misclassified as positive. This limitation is subject to future work . Conclusion: These preliminary results support the feasibility of \"Earlier than Early\" BC diagnosis in BRCA-carriers, potentially i mproving the detection abilities of an expert's visual inspection signific antly.

James*, Michalopoulou, I. Darker, Y. Chen; N ottingham/UK To compare the performance of radiologists and radi ographer readers in a national breast screening programme. Methods or Background: Workforce issues have meant that appropriately trained radiographers (technologists) are used as r eaders in the UK breast screening programme (NHSBSP) where double reading o f mammograms is standard of care. It has been suggested that radiog raphers may exhibit a decrease in specificity with an increase in recall rates and reduced PPV compared to radiologists. However, previous studies took no account of the experience of readers within each professional group. Results or Findings: Individual performance and experience data for 224 radiologists and 177 radiographers, participating as readers in the NHSBSP in England, were obtained for the years 2015 and 2016. Mean cancer detection rates (CDR) for radiologist and radiographer reader s were 7.8 and 7.5 per 1000 women screened respectively. CDR did not vary significantly by professional group or years of experience (p=.075 and p=.871 respectively). Mean recall rates for radiologists and radiographer readers were 5.0% and 5.2% respectively. Recall rates showed no significa nt variation based on the readers' professional group (p=.627), but did decrease with increasing reader experience for all readers regardless of profession al group (p=.001). There was no significant variation in PPV between radiologists and radiographers (p=.417) with and 16.1% for radiologists and radiographers respectively. There was a significant increase in P PV with increasing years of experience regardless of a reader's professional gr oup (p=.02). Conclusion: There were no significant differences in the perfor mance of radiographers and radiologists as readers in the UK breast screening programme, supporting the approach to routinely use radiographer readers in the double reading workflow. Limitations: Findings are likely only generalisable to screening programmes where double reading is the standard of care.

Therefore, expert opinion- based surveillance guidelines suggest annual magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography starting from age 25 and 30, respectively. We investigated the yield of BC surveillance in PHTS w omen. Methods or Background: This retrospective study included PHTS women who visited our expert centre. Performance measures of combined modalities, MRI alone and mammography alone were analysed, along with measures of first vs follow-up rounds. Characteristics of BCs d etected during vs outside surveillance were compared. Results or Findings: During a total follow-up time of 134 women-years, 156 surveillance rounds were performed among 39 women ( median age at first examination: 38 years [range, 24-70]). During surveillance, 7/39 women were diagnosed with BC (cancer detection rate, 44.9 per 1000, 95% CI [19.8- 93.8]). The median age at first BC detection was 43 years ( range, 31-55). The specificity of the overall programme was significantly higher in the follow-up rounds as compared to the first-round (86.5%, Sensitivity of mammography alo ne was 50.0%, while sensitivity of MRI alone was 100%. BCs detected dur ing surveillance were more often early-stage as compared to BCs detected outside surveillance (p<0.005). Conclusion: Our findings support offering annual BC surveillanc e to PHTS women from age 25 onwards, as surveillance contributes to the detection of early-stage BC. The specificity of the overall prog ram was moderate in the first round but increased in follow-up rounds. The additi onal value of mammography was limited. Limitations: The limited number of patients precluded the evaluation of potential variations in the surveillance yield over time. There was also possible selection bias.

Heindel\u00b9; \u00b9M\u00fcnster/DE, \u00b2Enschede/NL Purpose: There is currently no consensus on how much mammogr aphic breast compression should be applied for optimal results. Detailed studies on compression practice in Germany are not available. We aimed to evaluate mammographic compression practice differences between screening and diagnostic examinations and between mammographic sy stems of different vendors within the screening programme in Germany. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 423 Methods or Background: Mammographic compression parameters were retrospectively (October 2018 - September 2019) obt ained for craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique Dim ensions). Data were analysed using (generalised) linear mixed models. Results or Findings: In total 58,098 mammographic views were included n=29,634 views, site-2: n=24,534 views, site-3: 3,930 views). The force (marginal standard screening site-1 as compared to diagnostic site- 3. The breast thickness (site-1: 62.40\u00b10.20 mm, sit e-3: 63.34\u00b10.46 mm, p=0.058) was lower for screening examinations. Vendor comparison revealed a large average dose difference (site-1: 1.75\u00b10.01 mGy, site-2: 0.87\u00b10.01 mGy, p<0.001). Against expectations, in site-1, wit h the highest average dose, the average force (site-1: 109.54\u00b10.20 N, site-2: also notably higher than in site-2. The breast thickness was lower in site-2: 59.47\u00b10.22 mm, p<0.001). Conclusion: Mammographic compression parameters differ between diagnostic and screening examinations as well as between vendors within the screening program, which may impact image comparabi lity and patient experience. Limitations: No correlation with image quality was performed. Despite similar technician training between sites, mammographic procedure execution may differ.

G. Wallis*\u00b9, A. cancer registry and screeni ng services allocate a screening history to all English breast cancers. Data for women screened between 2010 and 2016 show that the 24 to <36month interval cancer rate is paradoxically only slightly higher t han that of 12 to <24months. When plotted by month, the rate plateaus between 24 and 28 months and falls after 33 months. It has been presumed that this is a function of actual time between screen and re-screen/invitation. In preparation for more detailed analysis, we piloted a correction to address this hypothesis. Methods or Background: Interval cancer data for women screened from 2008 to 2009 were obtained from the National Cancer Regi stration Analysis Service. Months since last invitation for the women invited for screening in January through March of 2011, 2012 and 2013 were obtained from breast screening repository data and used to correct the population denominator to recalculate interval cancer rates. Results or Findings: 5.5% of women were invited within 24 months of thei r previous invitation, 13.0% by 30 months and 97.4% by 36 months. Crude interval cancer rates were 0.56 per 1000 women scre ened at 0-<12 months, 1.20 for 12-<24 months and 1.37 for 24-<36 months. After correcting the denominator, the rates were 0.56, 1.24 and 1.73 per 1000 respectively and no plateau was seen. Conclusion: Correcting for actual time between screens has a me asurable impact on interval cancer rates. This needs to be accounted for in comparisons of interval cancer rates. It could also be an impor tant confounder in all screening trials. Limitations: In this pilot, the screening year was not the same as the years used to derive the correction.

Heindel, S. Weigel, L. plus synthesised 2D mammograms (DBT+s2D) increases screening 2D full-field digital mammography (2D-FFDM). Methods TOSYMA study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03377036) was designed as a diagnostic superiority trial comparing DBT+s2D and 2D-FFDM in the quality- controlled, population-based, biennual German mammography screening program. Seventeen screening units recruited women of the eligible age group, 50-69 years, attending the routine mammography screening program. Women were assigned by 1:1 randomisation to either the intervention (DBT+s2D) or the control arm (2D-FFDM). Based on a multivendor approach, DBT systems of 5 medical device manufacturers were used. An ada ptive design with one interim analysis was applied to compare two hierarc hically ordered primary endpoints between the study arms: 1) the detection rate of invasive breast cancers, and 2) the 24-months cumulative incidence of invasive interval cancers in screen-negative women. Results or Findings: Between July 2018 and December 2020, a total of 99,689 women were recruited. Study results regardin g the difference in screen- detected invasive cancer detection rates between DB T+s2D and 2D-FFDM and further secondary outcomes will be presented. Conclusion: First study results will provide evidence regarding the expected increase in invasive cancer detection by DBT. This increase, however, needs to be balanced against the potential for overdiagnosis. Limitations: For this purpose, follow-up data on interval cancer s will be evaluated in an additional funding period of the st udy until 2025.

Romero Castellano\u00b9, L. P. M. Aguilar Angulo\u00b9, work aims to analyse the current breast screening protocol of a reference hospital and identify its p otential improvements by the introduction of a novel microwave-based imaging sys tem (MammoWave) for early breast cancer detection. Methods or Background: A biennial mammography-based (tomosynthesis) breast screening programme in asymptomatic women ag ed 45 to 69 years is carried out in our centre, based on a double-reading by two independent radiologists, who agree a final BI-RADS assessment if initial consensus is not achieved. MammoWave was proposed as complementary t est to a set of volunteers, whose output about the microwave exam has been collected by an on-site questionnaire. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) was asked to evaluate overall participants' satisfaction with the microwa ve exam. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 424 Results or Findings: Currently, frequent mammographic false positives (mostly on dense breasts) require a re-call for the patient to ask for unnecessary additional exams. MammoWave could be a promising tool for overcoming this key limitation, due to the overall good system's performance and the results of the on-site questionnaires, whic h show an excellent acceptance by 155 trial participants, with an average NPS of 9.50 (out of 10) and with all women (100%) reassured about this novel technology and willing to recommend the exam. Conclusion: This microwave system shows an acceptance with an excellent average NPS. Its introduction could avoid key issues that tomosynthesis cannot solve currently: re-calls and patient psychological stress, additional unnecessary mammography exams that lead to x-ray ov erdose and, consequently, higher costs for health systems.

N. van der Heijden\u00b2, R. \u00b9Amsterdam/NL, The diagnosis of asbestosis lacks diagnostic criter ia and generally depends on the multidisciplinary team conference, a discussion that often illustrates high interobserver variability. In the Netherlands, patients are eligible for financial compensation when a panel of three in dependent pulmonologists diagnoses asbestosis, which increases the time to diagnosis. We aimed to develop a rapid, automatic, non-invasive method supporting the diagnosis of asbestosis using primarily CT imaging with addition of pulmonary function tests (PFT). Methods or Background: We designed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to diagnose asbestosis based on CT scans of Dutch pati ents with high occupational exposure to asbestos. The ground-truth for the algorithm consisted of the verdict of three independent exper t pulmonologists. If there was no unanimity, the uncertainty was reflected in the ground-truth for the AI model. The regions of interest to the AI model were visualised through saliency maps. We compared the AI to three PFT metrics: vita l capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity for ca rbon monoxide (DLCO). Results or Findings: We trained the AI on CT scans in the training set (n=415). On the independent test set (n=88), the AI system yielded an AUC of 0.87 (p<0.001). Combining the AI and the highest 78% NPV. Conclusion: Our AI system to classify asbestosis solely based on CT scans reached excellent performance. Adding the DLCO to t he AI classification score yielded the highest diagnostic performance. Prospec tive validation of this score is ongoing. Limitations: Ground truth consisted of non-invasive law-driven c lassification of asbestosis instead of biopsy. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by the institutional board.

Ultra Short Echo-Time Magnetic Res onance Imaging (UTE- MRI) sequences were developed for lung parenchyma. We compared a UTE- MRI sequence with CT in ILD assessment and Pulmonar y Function Tests (PFT) correlations. Methods or Background: 27 SSc patients with ascertained suspected ILD underwent UTE-MRI and CT. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated in consensus the extents of ILD, Ground Glass Opacities (GGO), R eticulations, Honeycombing and Consolidation. The extents were computed as the mean percentage of lung involvement evaluated at five le vels, to the nearest 5%. ILDs were divided in limited (<20%) or extensive (> 20%), according to the literature. The ANOVA test was adopted to compare C T and MRI extents. The Cohen's k was exploited for the agreement in distin guishing between limited and extensive disease. The Pearson correlation coef ficient r was adopted for alterations extents correlations with PFT. Results or Findings: Mean ILD, wer 8.2%. Honeycombing and Consolidation extents were <1% and considered no further. ILD and GGO extents on UTE-MRI and CT were similar (p>0.5), reticulations (p<0.04).

Sun*; Changchun/CN (dr_hssun@163.com) Purpose: To assess the value of the elastic registration met hod in evaluating the development of lung fibrosis in patients with i diopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is based on the detection of lung cont raction by elastic registration of chest high-resolution CT images. Methods or Background: Patients with IPF who had undergone at least two supine high-resolution CT plain scans with pulmonar y function tests (PFTs) within 3 months between January 2015 and May 2021 w ere retrospectively studied. Elastic registration was performed on baseline and follow-up CT images to obtain deformation maps of the whole lung. Jacobian determinants were calculated from the deformation fields and rep resented on colour maps to describe morphological and functional deterioration . Correlations of Jacobian A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 425 values with PFT and pulmonary vascular changes were assessed by Spearman correlation method. Results or Findings: A total of 69 patients were included in the researc h. Jacobian maps demonstrated constriction of the lung parenchyma marked at the posterior lung base in patients with IPF who deteriorated on visual and functional assessment. The Jacobian logarithm was s ignificantly reduced in patients with deterioration compared to patients wi th stable disease. Jacobian values were positively correlated with changes in f orced vital capacity (p<0.001), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( p<0.001), pulmonary vascular and the number of vascular branches (p<0.001). Conclusion: Elastic registration based on CT scans is helpful t o assess the morphological and functional deterioration of lung lesions in patients with IPF and correlates with changes in pulmonary vascular v olume and the number of vascular branches. Limitations: This was a retrospective study with an uneven range of time intervals between baseline and follow-up CT scans.

Hamid, S. Alam, S. Yasmin, N. Gul, A. Sharif, M. Asif, M. M. Abdullah, Z. Sohail; Peshawar/PK (ummara_81@hotmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate reporting of HRCT chest in patients wit h suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in accordance w ith ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines. Methods or Background: Diagnosis of IPF requires exclusion of known causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT. Guidelines for the diagnosis of IP F published by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Soci ety/Japanese Respiratory Society/Latin American Thoracic Association (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) in September 2018 provided new c riteria for UIP patterns on HRCT; In the appropriate clinical context, presence of typical or probable UIP on HRCT is suff icient for a diagnosis of IPF. 100% of thoracic HRCT reports in patients with suspected IPF/ ILD should be categorised into one of four categories as per A TS/ERS guidelines. This audit was done by retrospectively assessing HRCT reports in the Radiology Department of Rehman Medical Institute Peshawar ove r a period of one year from January 2019 to December 2019 in suspected IPF / ILD. A total of 60 patients' reports from the hospital's database were assessed. Results or Findings: Out of 60 patient reports 42 (72%) of the HRCT reports had been reported according to ATS/ESR guidelines. Among these 42 reports (76%) were labelled as definite UIP/probable UIP pa ttern and 10 (24%) were of alternative diagnoses, with definite diagnosis or differentials. 32 (53.3%) of our patients were males and 28 (46.6%) were females, at a mean age of 60 years. Conclusion: We concluded from our results that only 72% reports of HRCT chest were in accordance with ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guid elines, which did not meet the required target of 100%. Radiologists' training is planned and a re- audit would be done after 1 year. Limitations: A larger group study should be done.

Dai, C. Wang; Beijing/CN (yxy18161659153@126.com) Purpose: To determine the feasibility of pulmonary MR imaging with ultrashort echo time (UTE-MRI) for lung assessment using high- resolution computed tomography (HRCT) as the reference standard, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Methods or Background: Lung MR imaging was performed with a 1.5T system as UTE-MRI acquisitions. Two radiologists in dependently evaluated HRCT and MR images for various morphologic abnormal ities of IPF. The image quality difference between HRCT and UTE-MRI w as compared with a Wilcoxon-rank sum test. Kappa and weighted kappa an alysis were used to measure intra- and interobserver and intermethod agreements. Sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of UTE-MRI for detecting pulmonary fibrosis. Results or Findings: A total of 35 patients with IPF who underwent UTE-MRI and HRCT were included in this study. The image quality of HRCT was higher than UTE-MRI(HRCT vs UTE-MRI: 4.9\u00b10.3 vs and UTE-MRI for ev aluating the image signs of pulmonary fibrosis were determined UTE-MRI. The sensitivity of UTE-MRI in the identification of pul monary fibrosis (n=35) was 97.2%, when compared with HRCT. Conclusion: UTE-MRI is inferior to HRCT in imaging the details of lung parenchymal. However, our study does show that ther e is a potential role for the UTE sequence as an alternative radiation-free i maging modality in patients with IPF. Limitations: The sample size was small.

Fellner; Lin z/AT of high-resolution comp uted tomography (HRCT) features with the change of pulmonary functi on test (PFT) biomarkers after 6, 12 and 24 months in fibrotic interstitial lung disease patients. Methods or Background: HRCT findings of 106 consecutive ILD-board patients were semi-quantitatively evaluated in a st andardised approach: six distinct lung were scored for honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, Forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusi on capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were assessed at the time of the im aging and after 6, 12 and 24 months. Association of the baseline HRCT scores and the change of the PFT biomarkers were evaluated using Spearman co rrelation coefficients and graphical presentation. Results or Findings: The extent of nodules, ground glass opacities and consolidations on the initial imaging wit h PFT improvement; Conclusion: The extent of typical features of fibrosis ret iculation, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing in initial HRCT imaging predict a progressive fibrosing phenotype, while inflammatory findings like ground glass opacities and consolidations correlate with PFT imp rovement and may suggest a response to anti-inflammatory therapies. Limitations: The main limitations that need to be addressed are the retrospective and explorative approach and the limi ted sample size.

Martini; Zurich/CH (lisa.jungblut@usz.ch) photon-counting detect or computed tomography (PCD-CT) in radiation dose reduction com pared to conventional energy-integrated detector CT (EID-CT) based on image quality and assessment of interstitial lung disease in sclerode rma patients (Scc-ILD). Methods or Background: Forty-five patients with scleroderma who year were retrospectively included. The split-dose images on EID-CT were generated with two tubes at a fixed tube voltage at 100 kV and adjusted amperage to generate 66% and 33% dose scans. The 100% dose scan was generated out of the two split-dose images. PCD-CT scans were performed in the high-res olution (HR) mode at 120 kV. Images were assessed qualitatively by indep endent readers (overall image quality, noise, fibrosis assessment) on a fiv e-point Likert scale. Quantitative assessment was done by noise measurements in subcutaneous fat, defined as the standard deviation of attenuati on. Results or Findings: The PCD-CT and the 33% dose EID-CT scans resulted in similar dose values (0.73 vs. 0.77 mGy*cm, p=0.177) while there was significantly less dose in PCD-CT than in 66% dose EID-CT (0.73 vs. scan (130.64 vs. 128.61 HU, p=0.734) and per formed significantly superior (p<0.001) to the 60% dose scan (p<0.001). Diagnostic performance for the detection of Scc-ILD of PCD-CT was comparab le to the 100% dose scan and superior to the 66% and 33% dose scan (p<0.001). Conclusion: PCD-CT allows for 66% dose reduction in the assessm ent of Scc-ILD while maintaining image quality and diagnos tic performance compared to EID-CT.

Tiralongo*, S. Purpose: To investigate relationship between HRCT indexes and Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs), and between HRCT indexes and semi-quantitative analysis in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) ILD patients. Methods or Background: 22 SSc patients having at least one HRCT and PFTs (acquired nearest to the CT) were retrospectiv ely investigated. Patients were classified as having a diffused (dcSSc) or lim ited (lcSSc) form of the disease according to their skin involvement, and di vided in early stage or intermediate/late stage. A semi-quantitative analys is was obtained applying Warrick and Wells scores to the various HRCT alterations. Histogram-based analysis was performed providing HRCT indexes - kur tosis, skewness, High Attenuation Areas (HAA%) and mean lung density (MLD ). Strength of association between HRCT indexes and PFTs values, s emiquantitative scores and HRCT indexes were investigated using Pearson co rrelation. Stages of diseases were analysed using a U-test. ANOVA variance was performed to investigate the fluctuation of mean values of HRCT indexes, semiquantitative scores and PFTs. Results or Findings: Moderate correlations were found between kurtosis and PFTs, and between skewness and PFTs. Also HAA% and PFTs showed moderate correlation. We found inverse strong correlation between MLD and DLCO, and a moderate correlation between MLD and FV C. Comparing early stage versus longstanding group - the U-test do not show statistical differences for HRCT indexes. Moderate correlation was found between Warrick scale and HRCT indexes. A good correlation was observed between MLD and HAA% and global extent of disease assessed by Wells score; weak correlation was found for kurtosis and skewness. AN OVA analysis, including mean values for FVC, HRCT indexes and Wells score, reported an F value of 1712.71. Conclusion: In line with the literature, our results provide ev idence that quantitative indexes could be a useful tool in disease severity evaluation.

R. Chaudhari*\u00b9, intersti tial lung diseases on radiological patterns on HRCT, and to correlate radiological patterns of ILDs with clinical symptoms and with histopathological p atterns on cryobiopsy. Methods or Background: In a prospective observational study from November 2018 to May 2020, 50 patients who had signs and symptoms of ILD who later underwent HRCT and transbronchial cryobio psy for further diagnosis were enrolled. The clinical symptoms and HRCT findi ngs were noted. The HRCT findings were then classified into different p atterns. Lobar involvement and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were also noted and a radiological diagnosis was given. The patient later underwent tr ansbronchial cryobiopsy. Histopathological diagnosis was considered as gold standard and the radiological diagnosis was correlated to it and the clinical symptoms and the diagnostic accuracy of HRCT was calculated. Results or Findings: On HRCT pattern and histopathological correlation, it was found that 34 patients were correctly diagnosed on HRCT giving a positive predictive value of 68% (p<0.001). When analysing each subtype of ILD, it was found that the diagnostic accuracy of HRCT in diagn osing UIP is the key to diagnosi ng interstitial lung diseases. In spite of a small study at a singl e centre, HRCT did show adequate accuracy in diagnosing certain types of ILD. The trend seen in this study can be a stepping stone for initiating larger studies where a larger sample size is given and more types of ILD are studied and that can help us understand the radiological characteristics further and can guide the radiologist to narrow down a particular diagnosis. Limitations: The small sample size, this work's nature as a single center study and the fact that the present study is limited to t ransbronchial cryobiopsies and lacks consideration of its failure rate were identi fied as limitations. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Salgado; Antwerp/BE prediction by compre hensive quantitative analysis of preprocedural CTA provides superior pre diction of mortality compared to conventional risk scores in TAVR *T. S. Emrich*, G. Aquino, J. A. Decker, V. U. J. Schoepf, A. Varga-Szemes; Charleston, SC/US (emrich@musc.edu) Purpose: To assess the predictive value of a comprehensive, preprocedural cardiac CT-based risk score for mortality in transc atheter aortic valve (TAVR) (n=168; 78.5\u00b18.8 years, 52.4% male) were retrospectively evaluated in this 24-months follow up study. Mortality was the primary endpoint. Pre-TAVR CTAs w ere analysed to calculate left and right ventricular long axis strain, left atrial ejection fraction, and tricuspid diameter. A binary score was created for each parameter and summed up into a comprehensive CT score ranging between 0 and 6. Groups were defined as follows: score 0 (Gr 0), 1-3 (Gr 1) and >3 (Gr 2). Survival analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox-regression. Harrell's c-index was used to evaluate risk models. Results or Findings: There were 38 deaths (22%) over the 24-month follow - up. Mortality was significantly different among the CT risk score groups: survival was 100% in Gr 0, 81% in Gr 1 and 44% in G r 2 (Logrank p<0.001 for both). CT risk score (HR 4.6; 95% CI 2.2-9.4; p<0.001) was independently associated with mortality after multivariate adjust ments for clinical parameters. When adjusted for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score, CT Score (HR 4.3;95% CI 2.2-8.4; p<0.001) remained significantly predictive. Adding CT score to the STS score significantly impr oved its from 0.637 independently predi cts post- TAVR mortality and is superior to clinical parameters only. CTA-based functional assessment improves risk prediction and has the potential to influence post-treatment surveillance in TAVR patients. Limitations: The nature of this work as a singlecentre, retrospective study was identified as a limitation. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the local IRB committee (Pro00092078). Funding for this study: Not applicable Author Disclosures: Verena Brandt: Nothing Combined Coronary CT-Angiography and TAVI pl anning: morphological of ructive ed CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) to correctly class ify coronary CT-angiography (cCTA) studies without morphological signs of obstr uctive coronary artery disease (CAD) acquired during pre-TAVI evaluation. Methods or Background: Background: CAD is a frequent comorbidity in patients undergoing TAVI. Current guidelines recomm end its assessment before TAVI. If significant CAD can be excluded on cCTA, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) may be avoided. Patients prior to TAVI frequently have a high load of plaque and a high calcium score, making the exclusion of significant stenoses difficult, particularly for no n-expert readers. It has been proposed that CT-FFR may guide reader confidence in such cCTAs. Methods: 116 patients without significant stenosis (50% diameter) on cCTA as part of pre-TAVI CT were included. These patient s were examined with an electrocardiogram-gated CT scan of the heart and hi gh-pitch scan of the vascular access route. All patients were re-evaluat ed with ML-based CT-FFR (threshold=0.80) blinded to cCTA. ICA served as the standard of reference. Results or Findings: ML-based CT-FFR was successfully performed in 94.0% (109/116) of all patients, including 436 vessels. W ith CT-FFR 76 patients and 126 vessels were falsely reclassified as having significant CAD, respectively. With CT-FFR 2 patients and no vessels were correctl y reclassified as having significant CAD, thus the reclassification on patie nt level was only coincidental. Conclusion: ML-based CT-FFR could potentially be used as a guid e to the less experienced cCTA reader. However, unselectivel y applied, CT-FFR may vastly increase the number of false positive ratings compared to morphological scoring in patients before TAVI.

Langenbach*, K. Klein, Wienemann; Cologne/DE (CT -FFR) or resting full-circle ration (RFR) in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR) is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR derived from TAVR-planning CT compared to invasive RFR in patients with relevant AS and intermediate c oronary stenosis. Methods or Background: Preliminary results on patients with relevant AS undergoing ICA with pressure wire assessment and ro utine contrast-enhanced pre-TAVR CTA without an additional coronary CTA. CT -FFR analysis was performed using on-site CT-FFR software (Siemens Healthineers, Inc) by two radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging. Results or Findings: 23 patients were investigated using RFR and CT-FFR. The mean age of the subjects was 81.0 \u00b15.6 years. O f these patients, 9 (39.1%) were female. No complications were observed during CTA or pressure wire assessment. The RFR showed a significant correlation with CT-FFR (Pearson =0.72, Per-patient receiver operator curve using RFR 0.89 as the reference standard analysis showed a l arger area under the curve (AUC) for CT-FFR 0.81 (95% CI 0.62-0.99, p=0.013) for (95% .80) and CTA >70% Conclusion: results indicate non-invasive CT-FFR as sessed by routine pre-TAVR CTA as a feasible method superior to qualitative analysis of the coronary arteries in CT and ICA in assessing th e hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions in patients with relevant AS. T his might help to reduce the number of unnecessary pre-TAVR ICA in the presence of intermediate coronary stenosis.

T. S. Emrich\u00b9, To evaluate diagnostic performance of CCTA-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) for detection of h aemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with seve re aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement potentially avoid additional pre-TAVR invasive coronary angiography ( ICA). Methods or Background: Patients with severe AS (n=95, 78.6\u00b18.8 years, 53% female) undergoing preprocedural TAVR-CT follow ed by ICA were included and retrospectively analysed. CCTA dataset s were evaluated using CAD-RADS classification. measurements were c omputed using an on-site algorithm. A combined algo rithm was developed for decision-making to determine if ICA is needed based on pre-TAVR CCTA: (1) all patients with CAD-RADS 4 are referred for ICA; (2) patients with CAD- RADS 2 and 3 are evaluated utilising CT-FFR and sent to ICA if CT-FFR 0.80; (3) with CAD-RADS <2 or CAD-RADS <4 and normal CT-FFR are not referred for ICA. Results or Findings: In 12 patients (13%), significant CAD was diagnosed in ICA and treated with PCI. Twenty-eight patients (30%) showed CT-FFR 0.80 and 24 (86%) of those were reported to have a maxim um stenosis 50% during ICA. Using the proposed algorithm, haemodynamically significant CAD could be identified with a sensitivity, specificity , and positive and negative predictive value of 100%, 78%, 40% and 100%, respec tively, (68%) . Conclusion: Combination of CT-FFR and is able to ident ify haemodynamically significant CAD pre-TAVR and bears potential to significantly reduce the number of needed ICAs. Limitations: The retrospective, singlecentre nature of the study was identified as a limitation; in addition, invasive FFR was not performed in all coronary lesions as this decision is at the discretion of the cardiologist. Thus, angiographic stenosis assessment on ICA served as t he reference standard. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee (IRB number #Pro00092078).

N. A. Serafini, *G. A. Strazzarino*, D. Tore, M. Gatti, R. Faletti; Turin/IT Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of coronary com puted tomography angiography (CCTA) for the evaluation of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients referred for trans catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods or Background: EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE and CENTRAL were searched for studies reporting accuracy of CCTA for the evaluation of obstructive CAD compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A bivariate random-effects model was used to analyse, pool and plot the diagno stic performance measurements across studies. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive (+LR) and negative (-LR) likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and hierarchical summary ROC curve (HSROC) were evaluat ed. Prospero id: CRD42021252527. Results or Findings: studies included. In the intention-to-diagnose patient-level analysis sensit respectively, -LR 3.0 (2.1-4.3) and 0.05 (0.03-0.09), with 60 (30-121). The HSROC had AUC = 0.96 (0.94-0.98). No difference in sensitivit y was found when comparing single-heartbeat scanner CTs to others [96% (91-98%) vs 97% (94-99%); (43-71%); p<0.0001]. Conclusion: CCTA proved to an excellent diagnostic accurac y for assessing obstructive CAD in patients referred for TAVI. Routine CCTA in the pre-TAVI work-up could save more than 40% of ICAs. The use of single- heartbeat scanners can further improve such data. Limitations: A relatively low number of studies met the selectio n criteria. Only a fraction of the studies reported the analyses at patient level, either by considering non-analysable segments as positive or by excluding them. Almost all studies included are retrospective cohorts, onl y one is prospective and none a randomised controlled study. In addition, many of the included studies are small in size.

Methods or Background: Background: CAD is a frequent comorbidity in patients undergoing TAVI. If significant CAD can be excluded on cCTA, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) may be avoided. Although cCTA is a very sensitive test, it is limited by relatively low spe cificity and positive predictive value, particularly in high-risk patients. Methods: 460 patients (79.6\u00b17.4 years) undergoing pre-TAVI CT were included and examined with an electrocardiogram-gated CT scan of the heart and high- pitch scan of the vascular access route. Images wer e evaluated for significant CAD. Patients routinely underwent ICA (388/460), which was omitted at the discretion of the local Heart Team if CAD could be effectively ruled out on cCTA (72/460). CT examinations in which CAD could n ot be ruled out (CAD+) (n=272) underwent additional ML-based CT-FFR. Results successfully performed (216/272) of all CAD+ patients and correctly reclas sified 17 patients as CAD negative. CT-FFR was not feasible in 20.6% because of reduced image quality (37/56) or anatomic variants (19/56). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94.9%, 52.0%, 52.2%, and 94.9%, respectively. The additional evaluation ed CT-FFR increased accuracy by +3.4% (CAD+: +6.0%) and raised the total number CAD to 43.9% (202/460). Conclusion: ML-based CT-FFR may further improve the diagnostic performance of cCTA by correctly reclassifying a co nsiderable proportion of TAVI-patients with morphological signs of obstructi ve CAD on cCTA. Thereby, CT-FFR has the potential to further reduce the need for ICA in this challenging elderly group of patients before TAVI.

A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 429 Methods or Background: Eighty-eight consecutive patients candidate to TAVI, 19 (22%) LFLG e 69 (78%) HG according to data, were enrolled. A multiparametric TAVI-planning CT p rotocol was implemented including a time-resolved volumetric reconstruction of aortic valve (AV) and cardiac chambers and 5-minutes late contrast enhanc ement scan with left ventricle (LV) extracellular volume (ECV) map reconstruction. Quantitative CT- derived variables were: AV area, AV calcium score ( AVCS), (AVRV), end diastole, EDV) and ejection f raction (EF). Measurements were generated by semi-automatic post- processing on dedicated softwares. Results or Findings: Mean gradient in LFLG group was 30 mmHg [IQR, 22.5 - 35.5] vs 46 mmHg [IQR, in HG group (p<0. 0001). At CT-scan, mean ESV on overall population ml (\u00b154,9), EDV 161 ml (\u00b155), mean AVRV g (\u00b148,5) and AVCS was (\u00b11994). longitudinal strain vs -16%, p<0.05) between LFLG and HG groups. ECV had a significant negative correlation LV-EF (R=-0,253 p=0.017), mean transvalvular (R=-0.226; p=0.035). Conclusion: CT-scan protocol may provide additional information about myocardial remodelling and tissue characteris ation in patients with different AS functional stages.

Methods or Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential complicati on of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). A thero-embolisation linked to catheter manipulation in the supra-renal aorta i s a possible pathogenetic mechanism of AKI after TAVR. We collected PO-MSCT, baseline, procedural, and post-procedural characteristics of 222 consecut ive patients who underwent TAVR at a single, high-volume, Italian centre. PO-MSCT was performed using a dedicated TAVR protocol with an ECG-triggered hig h-pitch spiral acquisition using a second-generation dual-source recorded aortic valve calcium score (AV-CS), aortic plaque bidimensional measurements, total renal volume (TRV), presence of significant ( 50%) renal artery stenosis (RAS), suprarenal AB (quantified using a \"plaque analysis\" software). Calcific plaque was subcategorised on a voxel-level basis into 3 st rata: low-(351-700 HU), mid-(701-1000 HU), and high-calcium (>1000 HU, term ed 1K plaque). Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for other univariate predictors (male sex, baseline eGFR, baseline ejection-fraction, baseline mean aortic gradient, and RAS) was done. Results or Findings: Patients who developed AKI had higher suprarenal AB (17.6\u00b15.1% 13.9\u00b14.3%, p<0.001), TRV analysis suprarenal AB > 15.0% as the optimal threshold to predict an increased risk of AKI. Conclusion: Suprarenal AB is associated with AKI, and this association is strengthened as the percentage of calcified plaque increases. Quantitative and qualitative preoperative MSCT assessment of aortic atherosclerosis may help in early identification of patients at high risk for AKI who could benefit from higher perioperative surveillance.

Methods or Background: We investigated 113 consecutive patients from the prospective arm of the RETORIC study who underwent brain MRI one week and 6 months after TAVI. To determine the occurrenc e and distribution of periprocedural cerebral ischaemic lesions averaged diffusion-weighted images (trace) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps from the DTI dataset were used. We evaluated the aortic CT angiography scans performed before TAVI implantation and assessed the periprocedural factor s. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify the i ndependent predictors of TAVI-related ischaemic lesions. A neurocognitive ev aluation was performed before TAVR, at discharge, and at 6- and 12-month f ollow-up. Results or Findings: After TAVI, a total of 944 new cerebral ischaemic l esions were detected in 104 patients (92%). The median isc lesion volume was m edian lesion number of 6 (2- 10) per patient. Most lesions (796/944, 84%) were s ubcortical. The vast majority of ischaemic lesions were clinically silent (95%); 5% of patients had stroke, proven by MRI. The number of valve positioning and ballon predilatation during TAVI implantation showed a sig nificant correlation ischaemic brain lesion volume (p<0.05), and b alloon predilatation showed a correlation with stroke (p<0.05) on mul tivariate analysis. Conclusion: Although periprocedural ischaemic lesions are frequent, most of them are clinically silent and did not have a signi ficant impact on neurocognitive functions. The number of valve posit ioning and predilatation showed correlation with total ischaemic brain lesio n volume and balloon predilatation during TAVI was associated with strok e.

Methods or Background: 391 consecutive TAVI patients with CT scan (81\u00b16 years, 57.5% male, STS- PROM score 4.4\u00b13.6%) and abdominal muscle retrospectively quantified. Tw o definitions of CT-defined sarcopaenia previously adopted in TAVI studies were compared [PMA] at the L4 vertebra level: level: \"SMI- sarcopaenia\"). The primary A B Abstract-based Sunday 430 endpoint was long-term all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were Valve Academic Research Consortium-2-defined in-hospital and 30-day outcomes. Results or Findings: SMI- and PMA-sarcopaenia were present in 192 (49.1% ) and 117 (29.9%) patients, respectively. After a median of 24 (12-30) months follow-up, 83 (21.2%) patients p=0.391), was associated with all-cause mortality independent ly of age, sex and in-study outcome predictors. PMA-defined sarcopaenia provide d additive prognostic success, early safety, clinical e fficacy and 30-day all-cause death were unaffected by sarcopaenia status regardl ess of definition. Conclusion: PMA-sarcopaenia (but not SMI-sarcopaenia) is highly predictive of worse clinical outcomes among TAVI patients, suggesting its use as a reference standard. The prognostic information prov ided by PMA-sarcopaenia is independent of the tools currently adopted to pr edict post-TAVI mortality in clinical practice.

Methods or Background: As part of an in vitro study, a QIBA phantom was scanned at a 3T scanner by DWIs with both methods a nd reconstructed with and without DLR. Then, ADC of each phantom was eval uated on all data sets. As part of an in vivo study, 41 patients (malignant vs benign: 17 vs 24) were obtained T2WI and both DWIs. Then, each DWI was rec onstructed with and without DLR. SNR and ADC of each suspected lesion w as measured. Moreover, deformation ratio (DR) of each suspected lesion was calculated as follows: (ROI area difference between each DWI and T2WI)/ (ROI area on T2WI). As part of the in vitro study, correlation of ADC between each DWI and standard reference was statistically assessed. As part of the in vivo study, each index was compared among all datasets by Student t-test. Following a ROC-based positive test, diagnostic performance was compared among all datasets via McNemar's test. Results or Findings: Each correlation coefficient was excellent on in vi tro study (0.95<r<0.99, p<0.0001). Within the in vivo s tudy, DRs and SNRs of FASE with and without DLR were significantly improv ed as compared with EPI with or without DLR (p<0.05). When applying each threshold value, FASE with and without DLR were significantly more specific an d accurate than EPI with and without DLR (p<0.05). Conclusion: FASE is superior to EPI for image quality and diagn ostic performance improvements on DWI in this setting.

M. A. A. Cova; Trieste/IT Purpose: We to identify preoperative MR imaging charac teristics of mylohyoid muscle that could predict insecure (posit ive or close) margin in surgically treated floor of mouth squamous cell car cinomas. Methods or Background: Between March 2010 and March 2021, 81 consecutive patients with diagnosis of squamous cel l carcinoma of the floor of mouth underwent surgical intervention at our instit ution. Among these, 52 with preoperative MR imaging and postoperative pathologi c reports after surgery were included. Two neuroradiologists evaluated retr ospectively the preoperative MR imaging scans to predict the tumour spread through the mylohyoid muscle using a 7-point scale respectively in T2w, STIR and T1w+Gd images: (1) distance between tumour and mylohyoid 5 mm; (2) distance < 5 mm but no contact; (3) tumour in contact with myloh yoid; (4) bulging of mylohyoid; (5) thinned and/or irregular mylohyoid; (6) full-thickness signal alteration; (7) signal alteration trough mylohyoid in submandibular space. Among the subgroup of score 4-5-6-7 (31) a single s equence blind assessment was repeated to evaluate which one has the highest accuracy. Results or Findings: A score of >4 could predict an insecure margin with sensibility of 90.91% (C.I. 0.59\u00b10.99) and specific ity of 60.98% (C.I. 0.45\u00b10.75), resulting in a limited positive predict ive value (38.46%, C.I. 0.21\u00b10.59), but a remarkable negative predictive value 0.78\u00b10.99). The interobserver agreement of MR imagi ng scores was excellent, as proved by a Cohen's Kappa Coefficient of 0.83 (C .I. 0.72\u00b10.95). In the subsequent monoparametric assessment, T2wi showed t he highest specificity imaging scoring-system for t he mylohyoid muscle is a promising predictor of the surgical margin in floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma.

Luo; Beijing/CN (baodan1020@sina.com) Purpose: To develop validate a radiomics-based model for predicting radiation-induced temporal lobe injury (RTLI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by using MR imaging before treatment. Methods or Background: A total of 216 patients with NPC between January 2017 and May 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were randomly allocated to a training (n=156) and validation coho rt (n=60). A total from pretreatment contrast-enhanced MRI. A radiomics signature was gener ated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) r egression algorithm, Pearson correlation analysis, and univariate logist ic analysis. Clinical features were selected with logistic regression analysis. Further validation of the radiomics signature as an independent biomarker was performed by using multivariate logistic regression. A radiomics nomog ram was constructed and assessed with respect to calibration, discrimination, reclassification, and clinical usefulness. Results or Findings: The radiomics signature, composed of three radiomic s features, was significantly associated with RTLI. T he proposed radiomics model demonstrated favourable discrimination in bot h the training 0.88) and cohort (AUC, tures, higher AUC were achieved (AUC 0.93, 0.97), as well as a better cali bration and improved accuracy of the prediction of RTLI. The clinical-ra diomics model showed excellent predictive performance of RTLI in patient s within different clinical- pathologic subgroups. Conclusion: A radiomics model derived from pretreatment MR of t he temporal lobe has good performance for predicting RTLI in NP C and may help to improve clinical decision making.

Burck*, E. J. Fillmann, J-E. J. Vogl, S. Martin; Frankfurt a. Main /DE Purpose: To evaluate an iterative metal artifact reduction ( iMAR) algorithm in patients with head and neck cancer. Methods or Background: We included 49 patients (33 men and 16 women; mean age, 62.3 years) with dental hardware who underwent CT for staging of head and neck cancer. CT images were post-processed with standard iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) and dedicated iMAR technique for improved metal artifact reduction. Evaluation of quantitative image quality parameters included signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) of tumour lesions as well as densities of the streaking artifacts (dark bands). Qualitative image quality was assessed by two radiologists using 5-point Likert scores. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Cohen' s Kappa. Results or Findings: SNR and CNR values of tumour lesions significantly improved using the iMAR technique compared to standard image reconstructions (SNR 3.5 vs 4.1; CNR 5.9 vs 4.6; p< 0.02). The density of the streaking artifacts increased from 83.7 HU to 79.1 HU (p<0.01). Moreover, iMAR images were rated superior regarding image quality, reduction, and lesion delineation (all p<0.01). Interrater Our data suggest that image reconstructions with iMAR technique substantially improves image quality and lesion detection of head and neck cancer in patients with dental hardware. Limitations: Our study followed a retrospective study design. We evaluated a limited sample size and did not compare our data to iMAR algorithms from other vendors, non-iterative MAR algorithms or dual -energy CT with monoenergetic reconstructions.

Cardobi*, R. Nocini, G. D'Onofrio; Verona/IT (nicolo.cardobi@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare Path Tracin g (PT) to traditional Volume Rendering technique (VR) in post operative assessment of head and neck complex surgery followed by free flap bone reconstructions. Methods or Background: In this retrospective study, 39 patients (mean age 58.18) who underwent head and neck complex surgery with free flaps bony reconstructions were included. All exams were acqui red using a 64 Multi- Detector CT (MDCT). The images were independently r eviewed by four observers, respectively a radiologist, 1 head and neck surgeon and 2 otorhinolaryngologists with different degrees of ex perience in bone flap reconstructive surgery. Every observer evaluated the images according a 5- point Likert scale. The parameters evaluated were i mage quality, anatomical accuracy, bone flap evaluation and metal artifact. Mean and medial values for all the parameters across the observers were calcul ated. Scores of both reconstruction methods were compared using a Wilcox on matched-pairs signed rank test. Interreader agreement was calculated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results or Findings: PT was considered significantly superior to VR 3D reconstructions by all readers (p<0.0001). Interrea der agreement was moderate to strong across three readers with a maxi mum agreement for image quality of = 0.546 (VR) and 0.537 (PT), for anatomical accuracy of = 0.518 A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 432 (VR) and 0.320 (PT), for bone flap evaluation of = 0.657 (VR) and 0.670 (PT), for metal artifacts of = 0.596 (VR) and = 0.628 (PT). The fourth reader showed no significant agreement between the other o bservers. The agreement was stronger with PT images compared to VR images. Conclusion: PT reconstructions significantly improve the postsu rgical evaluation of bone free flap reconstructions follow ing major head and neck surgery.

J. van der Hulst*, R. W. Jansen, W. Schats, R. G. H. Beets-Tan, M. van den Brekel, J. A. Castelijns; Amsterdam/NL (h.vd.hulst@nki.nl) Purpose: This systematic review was conducted with the objec tive of exploring the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on di scerning HPV-status. Methods or Background: Most-studied distinction within in the Head and Neck Squamous-Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is derived from an infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs). HPV+ tumou rs are characterised by a significantly more favorable outcome. Non-invasiv e methods with the ability to reliably detect HPV-subtype would significantly advance prognostication and treatment planning. A wide-scoped systematic search was conducted in the PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase and Web of Science databas es for original articles published until 20.08.2020 on MRI predicti on of HPV-status in primary HNSCC lesions. Standardised mean differences were c alculated as well as Tau-squared estimates of total heterogeneity and Hi ggins inconsistency index (I2 test). Results or Findings: A total of 15 MRI studies were included, encompassi ng 10 studies describing diffusion-weighted imaging (D WI), 2 on Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) features and 5 studies reporting MRI-derived radiomics features and/or models. Lower mean ADC value was overall correlated with HPV+ HNSCC in 6 of the 10 articles. Overall volume and ADCminimum were inconsistent or non-significant. Th e amount of research on DCE and IVIM parameters is still too limited to dra w conclusions, though some value of Ktrans could be inferred. Radiomic features have been moderately successful in discerning HPV status to some extent stand-alone and/or combined in models in 3 of 5 studies, a variety of different radiomic approached was utilised. Conclusion: MRI is able to depict imaging differences between H PV-subtypes. Mean ADC is currently the most established stand-al one parameter. Radiomic models are not yet structured, but have the potenti al of providing options for the future to depict more complex tumour biology. Limitations: Study design: review.

De Tobel*, eneva/CH (jannick.detobel@gmail.com) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of different time signal intensity curve (TIC) types to distinguish head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) recurrence from benign post-treat ment changes. Methods or Background: 156 consecutive HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy \u00b1 surgery (n=132) versus surgery only (n=24) examinations during follow-up. Histopathology a nd/or follow-up formed the standard of reference. TICs measured in regions of interest (ROIs) were classified into type 1-5. TIC type distribution and diagnostic performance were evaluated. Results or Findings: Among the 261 ROIs analysed, 54 corresponded to recurrences and 207 to benign changes. There were 2 01/261 (77%) type 2, 52/261 (20%) type 3 and 8/261 (3%) type 4 TICs. Type 1 and 5 were not observed. TIC type distribution differed in recurre nces versus benign changes (p=0.006). Treatment type (radiotherapy \u00b1 surgery v ersus surgery only) did not affect TIC type distribution in recurrences (p=1.00 0), but did in benign changes (p=0.007). Overall sensitivity, specificity, positi ve predictive value and negative predictive value to detect recurrence were 61%, 19% 79% for type 4, respectively. Conclusion: Treatment type affects TIC type distribution in ben ign post- treatment changes but not in recurrences. Due to their low positive and negative predictive values, the utility of TICs to detect recurrent HNSCC is limited. Limitations: The studied ROIs only represented selected suspicious parts of the lesions. Furthermore, we only focused on TIC ty pe and we did not analyse quantitative DCE parameters.

V. Gorolay*\u00b9, Although endoscopic biopsy is recommended for primary diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a proportion of lesions are hidden from endoscopic view. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has an established role in locoregional staging and has been shown to detec t endoscopically occult tumours. This meta-analysis investigates the diagnostic performance of MRI for detection of NPC. Methods or Background: A systematic review was performed until May 2021 of studies which examined the diagnostic performanc e of MRI for detection of NPC in patients at-risk or suspected of having NPC. Studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of the index test (MRI) with a reference standard (histopathology) were included. The primary outcome was accuracy for detection of NPC. Random effects models were used t o pool outcomes for sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR) and negative LR. Bias and applicability were assessed using the modified QUAD AS-2 tool. Results or Findings: Eight studies were included involving 1092 patients of whom 333 were diagnosed with NPC. MRI demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 97.8% detection of NPC. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that MRI has a high pooled sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value for detec tion of NPC. MRI may be an important diagnostic tool for high-risk patients pr ior to endoscopic biopsy, and avoid biopsy in patients with a low post-test probability of disease. Limitations: The main limitation of this review is risk of selec tion bias due to inclusion of retrospective studies and one case-control study, with limited reporting of study randomisation strategy. Most stu dies were performed in regions where NPC is endemic. Ethics committee approval: Not required. Funding for this study: None received.

A. Qureshi*, S. Tahir, features assessed on pretreatment computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and event free sur vival in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma. Methods or Background: Patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma referred to a specialist tertiary centre between 2011 and 2017 we re included. The number of abnormal lymph nodes, the presence of necrotic nodes, matted lymph nodes and radiologically determined extracapsular spread (ECS) were assessed by a radiologist with 1 year's experience and reviewed by a radiologist with 7 years' experience. A directed acyclic graph was constructed to identify the confounders, competing exposures and mediators for each of the imaging features. Cox regression models were created for each imaging feature and direct adjustment for confounders and competing exp osures performed. Results or Findings: 352 patients (273 male, 79 female, median age 57 years [range 24-84 years]) were included with a median follow-up period of 31 months (range 2-104 months). Eighty-six patients (24.4%) had an event (progression/relapse/death) during follow-up. 280 patients had baseline MRI and 72 patients had baseline CT. 49 patients had matted nodes, 227 had necrotic nodes, 130 had radiologically determined E CS and the median number of lymph nodes was 2 (range 1 to 10). The pr esence of matted lymph nodes had the highest hazard ratio, 1.73 (p = 0.048). Conclusion: Out of the nodal imaging features explored the pres ence of matted nodes had the highest HR for event free surv ival with a 73% higher likelihood of an event. Limitations: The lack of data surrounding socioeconomic status, alcohol intake and the limited numbers of non-white ethnic groups are likely to introduce bias into the models.

Rondi*, M. D. Piazza, D. Farina; Brescia/IT (paolo.rondi92@gmail.com) Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of MRI, acquir ed with surface coils, in detecting cartilage invasion in recurrenc es occurring after transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). Methods 30 histologically proven laryngeal cancer recurrences after TLM were studied on a 1.5 T MR sc anner using surface coils. All patients underwent salvage total or supracricoi d laryngectomy. MRI protocol consisted of TSE were used in uncooperativ e patients). Two expert head and neck radiologists performed the analysis t o assess inter-operator agreement. Results or Findings: Cartilage invasion was detected in 18/30 cases (13 thyroid cartilages, 3 cricoid, 2 arytenoid). Intero bserver agreement for all cartilage invasion was good (Choen's kappa 0.76). O verall diagnostic performance reported a sensitivity of 76%, specific ity of 93%, PPV of 72% and NPV and 93%, respectively. Conclusion: MR with surface coils is sufficiently accurate in d etecting cartilage invasion by recurrent laryngeal cancer after TLM. T he high NPV may be exploited to increase the possibility to personalis e treatment patients allowing voice-sparing surgical procedures in selected cases . Limitations: Low number of cases, which influence the statistica l power of our results. The entity of cartilage infiltration was n ot graded and minimal lysis was considered in the same way as full-thickness invasi on.

An analysis of factors affecting neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and correlation with local tumour progression *A. Della Corte*\u00b9, C. Sallemi\u00b2, (MWA) is known to induce changes in the immune landscape after treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). This study aims at identifying which technique- and dise ase-related factors may predict post-treatment changes in neutrophil-to-lym phocyte-ratio (NLR) as well as their impact on local tumour progression (LTP). Methods or Background: From October 2018 to August 2020, 144 consecutive patients underwent MWA of 164 HCCs with a 2450Hz/100W generator. Fourty-four nodules (40 patients) met inclusion criteria for analysis (percutaneous approach, availability of pre- and po st-treatment inflammatory markers, follow-up > 6 months, technique efficacy, absence of complications). Data were collected regarding technique, disease and tumour-related features, as well as NLR prior to therapy and at 1-month foll ow-up. Results or Findings: After a median follow-up of 22 months, LTP occurred in 17 nodules (38.6%). At univariate analysis, risk factors for LTP increase and non- viral cirrhosis were the only independent predictor s (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). NLR increase occurred in 23 patients (57.5%). In this subgroup, higher rates of female gender (p=0.026), higher mean baseline NLR (p<0.0001) and lower mean delivered energy (p=0.008) were observed. Upon ROC curve analysis, an energy cut-off > 1296 J/mm a llowed prediction of NLR decrease at first with 74% sensitivity an d 64% specificity (AUC=0.73). Conclusion: Systemic inflammation and immunity contribute to de velopment of LTP after MWA, as NLR increase in response to ablation was an independent predictor. The amount of delivered ener gy seems to influence change in NLR, reinforcing the concept of immune ablation. Limitations: There was a limited population size and this was a retrospective study. Ethics committee approval: The study was approved by the IRBs in full respect of the declaration of Helsinki and later am endments. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

D. Santos\u00b2, M. B. B. Pitton\u00b9, D\u00fcber\u00b9, R. Kloeckner\u00b9, F. \u00b9; \u00b9Mainz/DE, \u00b2Cologne/DE Purpose: Clinically evident portal hypertension (CEPH) is a estimate of the hepatic vein pressure gradient. CEPH was previously identified as a prognostic factor for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC). However, little is known about the prognostic influence of CEPH on the long-term outcome of patients with HCC that undergo transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). This study investigated the prevalence and prognostic influence of CEPH in a Western population of patients with HCC undergoing TACE. Methods or Background: This study included 349 treatment-na\u00efve patients that received initial TACE treatment at our tertiar y care center between January 2010 and November 2020. We assessed the inf luence of CEPH on median overall survival (OS). We compared the effec ts of CEPH to those of well-known prognostic factors. Results or Findings: CEPH was present in 227 (65.0%) patients. The media n OS times were 10.3 months for patients with CEPH and 16.7 months for patients without CEPH (log rank p=0.079). Median OS without a present surrogate was 16.7 months, while patients with one respectively more than two present CEPH surrogates had a median OS of 10.7 months and 9.4 months (log rank p=0.083). Of the CEPH defining fac tors, only ascites reached significance in a univariate analysis. Conclusion: CEPH was present in almost two thirds of the patien ts with HCC undergoing TACE. In our study, patients with CEPH h ad an impaired survival. However, no significance was reached in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis yielded other factors that seem to be more important for OS stratification. Thus, when TACE treatment is oncologically reasonable, patients should not be excluded from TACE treatment due to t he presence of CEPH alone. Limitations: The singlecentre nature of the study and its retros pective design were identified as limitations.

Methods or Background: In total, 303 patients (64f, 239m) were treated wit h 521 sessions 250 patients MR-guided lesions, t echnical success, complete ablation, local tumour progression and OS rates were evaluated in all cases. Results or Findings: Mean tumour diameter was 2.16 cm in the MWA group vs 2.4 cm in the LITT group. Technical success was achieved in all ablations in both groups. Complete ablation was achieved in 97.7% of the tumours in the MWA group and in 98.7% in the LITT group. In the MW A group 6% of the patients and in the LITT group 3.8% developed local tumour progression. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates starting at the date of ablation were 86.6%, 53.4% and 40.4% in the MWA 85%, 17% n the LITT group, respectively. (p-value: 0.001). No peri-procedural deaths were reported in both groups. Conclusion: Image-guided thermal ablation like LITT and MWA are both effective and safe for the local treatment of HCC. Patients in the MWA group had an overall longer survival time, but with higher rate of local tumour progression than the patients in the LITT-group.

Methods or Background: After 3.5 (0-15) transarterial ver metastases of different origin (n=31) receiving MRI+MRE prior to and 24h-post MWA. Retrospective lesion analysis included pre-/post-ablative tumour size measurement, MAP T1/T2 and stiffness via MRI+MRE. F or assessing the effectiveness, the following parameters were establ ished: ablation excess, ablation intensity, cumulative energy during MWA. F our regions-of-interest (ROI) were established to determine tissue ablation response: entire liver, tumour, ablation zone, healthy paraenchyma. Results or Findings: HCC vs metastases showed significantly increased duration of MWA, cumulative energy applied, tumour stiffness pre-MWA. Total liver stiffness increased from 3.3\u00b11.5 kPa to 3.4\u00b11.6 kPa, total liver MAPT1 from 607.9\u00b190.3 to 645.7\u00b175.2 ms, total liver MA PT2 from 66.2\u00b110.5 ms to 68.9\u00b110.9 ms.

Ablation zone stiffness strongly depended on its ar intensity (r=0.421) and healthy paraenchyma stiffness (r=0.32 2). Cumulative energy applied moderately correlated to Conclusion: MRE+MRI offers benefits for evaluating MWA response and detects early changes. Limitations: The fact that there was no follow-up, the small cohort, the lack of a control-group, as well as different cancer and tr eatment stages (some had chemotherapy/some hepatectomy) and different stages in MWA protocol (but no big influence on investigated tumour) being involved were identified as limiting factors.

It showed promise as a prognostic index for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (H CC) undergoing resections. This study evaluated the prognostic ability of the CALLY index for patients with HCC undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TAC E). Methods or Background: We retrospectively identified 280 treatment-na\u00efve patients with HCC that underwent an initial TACE at our institution, between 2010 and 2020. We compared the CALLY to established risk factors in univariate and multivariate regression analyses for associations with median overall survival (OS). Results or Findings: A low CALLY was associated with a low median OS (lo w vs high CALLY: 9.0 vs 24.0 months, p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the CALLY remained an independent prognostic predictor (p=0.008). Furthermore, all factors of the CALLY reached significance in univariate and in-depth multivariate analyses. However, the concordance ind ex (C-Index) of the CALLY (0.60) was similar to the C-indices of establ ished immunonutritive and inflammation scoring systems (range: 0.54 to 0.63). Conclusion: In conclusion, the CALLY showed promise as a strati fication tool for patients with HCC undergoing TACE. Notably, the CALLY index was not superior to other immunonutritive and inflammation scoring systems in predicting the median OS. Thus, future studies should reevaluate the mathematical calculation of the index, particularly the contributions of individual parameters.

Methods or Background: Fifteen hepatic malignancies (9 HCCs, and 6 metastases from breast (3) and pancreas (2) carcinomas) in 8 patients, with a size ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 cm underwent percutaneous ablation using microwaves for 14/15 lesions and radiofrequency (1/ 15), under the only guidance of augmented reality (R.A.W. Endosight, Mi lan, Italy) during patient's free breathing. After applying radiopaque orientati on reference sensors on abdominal skin before acquiring preliminary CT scans, segmentation and 3D reconstruction of CT scans were performed with dedi cated software. Through commercially available smartglasses (Oculus Rift-S, Facebook Technologies, USA) paired with Zed Mini cameras (Stereolabs, San Francisco, USA), 3D visualisation of target tumour, ablation device (through markers with no repetitive pattern applied to introducer coaxial needle), and device tip-to-target geometrical center trajectory line was achieved and superimposed over the patient's body. Results or Findings: Time needed for segmentation and 3D reconstruction ranged from 12 to 17.2 minutes, and for tumour targeting from 3.2 to 5.7 minutes. Targeting accuracy ranged from 2.1 to 4.5 mm (mean 3.2 + 0.7). One ablation device insertion was performed for each ta rget tumour. Technical success was achieved for all tumours. No intra- or periprocedural, major or minor adverse events occurred. Conclusion: Augmented reality alone can guide interventional pr ocedures in real clinical conditions with great precision, quic kly and with significant reduction of radiation dose to patients and operators compared to CT-guided procedures. Limitations: This was a singlecentre study with a small number of patients. Ethics committee approval: This study was performed at two tertiary referral centres for liver diseases with the approval of the local Institutional Ethics Committees.

Xiao*; Changsha/CN Purpose: To compare the treatment efficacy and downstaging r ate of combined transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and microwave (MWA) patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond the Milan Criteria (MC). Methods or Background: A total of 231 patients with unresectable HCC beyond the MC who underwent either TACE-MWA (n=91) or TACE alone (n=140) at four medical institutions were included. Factors potentially influencing overall survival (OS) and progression f ree survival (PFS) were included in the Cox regression analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed between patients treated with TACE-MWA an d TACE alone. Differences in OS and PFS were compared with the log-rank test. Patients who met the University of California, San Francisco (UC SF) criteria were considered to assess the probability of downstaging to the MC. Downstaging rate was compared between the two groups. Results or Findings: In multivariate analysis, patients treated with TAC E alone was an independent predictor of poor PFS (p=0.011) and OS (p<0.001). After one-to-one PSM, a total of 146 patients were matched. Both PFS (p=0.043) and OS (p=0.002) were significantly higher in patients treated with TACE-MWA than those of TACE alone. The downstaging rate was also higher in patients with TACE-MWA than those of TACE alone (p=0.039). Conclusion: TACE-MWA may offer a survival benefit in terms of O S and PFS in HCC patients beyond the MC compared with TACE al one. Additionally, TACE-MWA may provide a higher probability of downst aging to the MC than TACE alone, which may increase the chance for HCC p atients to receive liver transplant. Limitations: First, this is a retrospective study with a small s ample size. Second, the survival benefit of liver transplant after successful downstaging was not evaluated.

Methods or Background: Between June 2014 and September 2020, a total of 198 patients with 280 HCC lesions who underwent transarterial lipiodol injection (TLI) plus thermal ablation at three medi cal institutions were included. The lipiodol retention pattern was classified into complete retention and incomplete retention based on the unenhanced CT at the time of ablation. The primary outcome was local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) for lesions, and the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS) for pat ients. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed using a caliper width of 0.1 between two groups. The differences in LRFS and OS between the two groups were compared with the log-rank test. Results or Findings: A total of 133 lesions presented with a complete li piodol retention pattern, while 147 lesions presented with incomplete retention pattern. After a PSM analysis of the baseline characteristics of the lesions, 121 pairs of lesions were matched in each group. The LR FS was significantly higher for lesions with complete retention than for lesions with incomplete retention (p=0.030). After a PSM analysis of the baseline characteristics of patients, 74 pairs of patients were matched in each group. There was no significant difference in OS between the two groups (p=0.456). Conclusion: The lipiodol retention pattern may influence thermal ablation for HCC lesions. However, a survival benefit of the lip iodol retention pattern for HCC patients was not observed and needs further confirmation. Limitations: The retrospective study design, the limited follow- up period and the small sample size were identified as limiting f actors.

Baditescu; Bucharest/RO RPS 2602-2 The Savi*, Bicchierai, proli feration of ductal epithelial cells without the invasion of the baseme nt membrane. It can be considered as a precursor of invasive carcinoma and a diagnosis of DCIS lead to an increased risk of developing new breast cancer. The aim of our study was to estimate the role of Contrast-Enhanced Digit al Mammography (CEDM) in presurgical evaluation of DCIS, without associat ion with microinvasive or invasive carcinoma, evaluating its sensitivity and specificity in identifying index lesions and any additional lesions. Methods or Background: All patients diagnosed with DCIS, who performed CEDM as a preoperative staging method, afferent over a three-year period, from 2017 to 2020, were included. Patients with a high background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) or a post-biotic haem atoma, as potential confounding elements for the enhancing evaluation, were excluded. Results or Findings: 109 patients for 111 total index lesions were evaluated, of which 70 were microcalcifications, 33 a nodule, 8 a distortion. CEDM led 16 (14,8%) patients to undergo a new biopsy: 8 lesions were B2, 4 were a B3 and 2 were a B5 (DCIS). CEDM changed the surgical appro ach in patients. In the histological post-operative 32.5% (36/111) G3. shown that for a nodule-like index lesion or opacity the risk of nonenhancing is statistically (p 0.004) lower than for microcalcifi cations. In the case of a G3 lesion, the risk of nonenhancing was significantly (p 0.0002) lower than the other types of grading, with a sensitivity of 91.67% CI95% 77.53-98.25%. Conclusion: In our experience, CEDM has shown to have an import ant role in the presurgical staging of pure DCIS with good sens itivity and specificity, in particular showing a high significance in the indiv idualisation of higher grade G3 DCIS. Limitations: A larger study group should be required. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received for this study.

Depretto*, C. De Berardinis, G. Della Pepa, L. Suman, C. Ferranti, M. Scaperro tta; Milan/IT (cathie.dp@gmail.com) Purpose: The purpose of our study is to evaluate on a large scale the performance of pre-operative magnetic seed localisation of non-palpable breast lesions. Methods or Background: We prospectively collected data on all patients undergoing image-guided magnetic seed localisation from September 2019 to October 2021. We analysed imaging findings, histological results, and type of surgery. The primary outcome was the successful loc alisation rate. Secondary outcomes were: the successful placement rate, the ease of percutaneous positioning, the procedural complications, and the reintervention rate. Results or Findings: A total of 550 magnetic seeds were placed in 539 patients by four radiologists under ultrasound (506) or stereotactic (44) guidance. All seeds were detectable transcutaneousl y in all breasts sizes and at all depths by seven surgeons with a success rate of 100%. 96% of the seeds were correctly placed into the target lesions (only 4% were dislocated). All radiologists have shown good compliance during the procedure, and there were no complications or safety issues. The re-oper ation rate was 6.3 %. Conclusion: Image-guided localisation with magnetic seeds is an easy, safe, reliable, and effective method for localising non-p alpable breast lesions. Both radiologists and surgeons reflected that the technology was intuitive to use and that it can be widely applied as the first option i n pre-operative localisation in breast units. Limitations: The trial is a single-centre study. Additionally, i t was conducted by dedicated breast cancer radiologists and surgeons, and it may not be generalisable to all institutions.

A. D'Angelo*, following conservative mastectomy is associated wit h good oncological outcomes. The mastectomy skin flap thickness is the most important factor in predicting outcome and complications. First aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of the Automated Breast Volume Scanner (ABVS) compared to mammography, handheld ultrasound (HHUS) and MRI in the preoperative evaluation of breast tissue thickness. Secondary aim was to compare the breast thickness obtained 6 months afte r surgery to the previous preoperative as well as intraoperative findings to investigate a change in thickness. Methods or Background: Between June 2020 and June 2021 patients eligible for conservative mastectomies and DTI reconstructio n were consecutively enrolled in this prospective single-institutional s tudy. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 years old or older, preoperative imagi ng evaluations performed in our center. Measurements of breast tissue thickness were obtained by ABVS, HHUS, mammography and MRI. The intraoperative breas t tissue coverage measurements were the gold standard. The Bland-Altm an analysis and plot were used. Results or Findings: 75 patients were enrolled. 93 breast mastectomies w ere performed. The difference between ABVS and intraope rative measurements was -0,084 mm (-2,5%). Mammography and MRI tended t o overestimate mastectomy skin flap thickness of about respectivel y 11.41% and 1,22 mm (+ 10,4%). HHUS showed a good level of agreement with an overall overestimation of + 9,42%. Follow-up was conducted on 28 patients corresponding to 36 measurements obtained through A BVS and HHUS. The breast tissue thickness tended to decrease after surgery (-2,6 mm (- 32,4%) with ABVS and - 1,75 mm 23,6%) with HHUS). Conclusion: ABVS could be the modality of choice for the preope ratory evaluation of breast tissue thickness in DTI recons truction. Limitations: Only a small sample size was followed up.

Salwa Yahya Ahmed*, A. A. H. Radwan, Abdel Cairo/EG Purpose: To compare chest and CESM in detection of multifocal, multicentric or bilateral breast dis ease in patients candidate for CT chest as a part metastatic workup with feasibili ty of MDCT chest to be a replacing diagnostic tool allowing locoregional and systemic staging with a single examination, reducing costs and excess patie nts radiation exposure. Methods or Background: This study included 113 female patients candidate for contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomogr aphy (MDCT) of the chest as of their metastatic workup (stage II or higher). Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) and multi-detector CT c hest were performed for all patients. Results or Findings: The study is a retrospective study that included 113 female breast cancer patients candidate for CT staging. 106 of the patients had unilateral carcinoma and 7 of them had bilateral ca ncer. A total of 120 breasts were evaluated. The CT findings were correlated wit h CESM findings regarding the multiplicity and bilaterality of the disease. T he sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of the CT in tiplicity were 97.44%, 100%, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of the CT in the detection of bilateral disease 93.20%, and patients candidate for MDCT chest as a part of their metastatic workup can omit further need for C ESM.

Aydos, of combined quantitativ e PET/MRI parameters of primary tumour with the clinical and histopathological findings in newly diagnosed breast invasive ductal carcinoma (I DC) patients with clinical stage T1 tumours. Methods or Background: The data of 102 patients with IDC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI for primary staging were evaluated retrospectively. Maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax), metabol ic tumour volume glycolysis (TLG) minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) values of primary tumours were obtained fr om PET/MR images. The SUVmax/ADCmin, MTV/ADCmin and TLG/ADCmin ratios wer e calculated to obtain combined quantitative PET/MRI parameters. The status of nodal and distant metastasis and histopathological data were also recorded. Results or Findings: Metabolic PET parameters and combined imaging parameters were significantly higher in patients wi th axillary lymph node metastasis compared to those without metastasis (p< 0.001, for all). For the comparison between patients with and without extraaxillary nodal metastasis, it was found that only MTV/ADCmin and TLG/ADCmin demon strated significant differences between two groups (p < 0.05 for both), with higher values in metastatic group. Although metabolic PET parameters and combined imaging parameters had higher values in patients with distant metastasis compared to those without distant metastasis, only combined PET /MRI parameters demonstrated significant differences between two gr oups (p<0.001 for all). SUVmax/ADCmin had significantly higher values in gr ade 3 tumours, in hormone receptor negative tumours, in tumours with HER2 overexpression and with higher Ki-67 indices (> 20%) (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: The combination of quantitative parameters that rel ated to tumour metabolism and cellularity correlated with clinical and histopathological findings in IDC patients with early stage breast tumors. Com bined parameters simultaneously obtained by both PET and MRI seem to be a promising tool in predicting poor prognostic factors. Limitations: Limitations were identified retrospective.

Methods or Background: PubMed and Embase were searched for studies that compared maximum standardised uptake values (S UVmax) between breast cancer patients positive and negative for ER or HER2, or that compared SUVmax between subtypes based on ER and HER2 status . Two reviewers independently screened the studies and extracted th e data. Summary standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 438 Results or Findings: Thirty-nine studies describing 5564 patients were included for final analysis. Mean SUVmax was signif icantly higher in 1462 ER- patients 95% CI 0.55 0.0001) and significantly lower in 3278 H patients than in 1526 HER2-positive patients 95% - = 0.0046). Additionally, mean SUVmax was significantl y lower in 275 ER- positive/HER2-negative patients than in 194 HER2-positive patients (SMD - 0.26, 95% CI -0.45 -0.07, P = 0.0062), significantly lower in 334 ER- positive/HER2-negative patients than in 189 triple negative patients (SMD - 0.95, 95% CI -0.18 -0.72, P < 0.0001), and significantly lower in 494 HER2- positive than in 614 triple negative patients (SMD -0.39, -0.62 -0.17, P = 0.0005). measured by SUVmax is signifi cantly influenced by ER and HER2 status in breast cancer patients. Moreover, mean SUVmax significantly differs between subtypes with uptake in ascending order from ER-positive/HER-negative, HER2-positive and tr iple negative breast cancer.

Moderator A. Ljimani; RPS 2607-2 Diffusion arterial spin labell ing for the noninvasive evaluation of persistent post-contrast acute kidney injury and arterial spin labelling (ASL) facilitated the assessment of serial alterations in persistent post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) Methods or Background: We randomly divided 24 rats into four PC-AKI groups (days 1, 3, 7, and 13, n = 6/group), with an additional six control animals. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging, DKI, and ASL analyses. Mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (Kr), a nd renal blood flow (RBF) maps were normalised to baseline to calculate adjusted RBF, MK, Ka, MD, FA, and Kr values. Findings: In the inner stripe of the outer medulla, when compared with controls, decreased FA and MD levels were observed on days 1, 3, and 7, and a distinct elevation in MK and Kr on days 1-13, and a persistent decrease in RBF on days 1-13, and a prominent increase in Ka on days 7 and 13 in PC-AKI animals (all p<0.05). Ka and MK signif icantly elevated in PC- AKI animals when compared with controls from days 1-13 (all p<0.05). Renal histological data indicated severe tubular and glom erular injury at days 1-13 in all PC-AKI groups. Conclusion: ASL and DKI may be noninvasively and longitudinally used to detect PC-AKI and predict further outcomes. Limitations: Our study was limited by baseline variations in ren al functional parameters among rats.

H. Lerchbaumer, T. Fischer, *P. Spiesec ke*; for short-term follow-up. To clarify unclear B-Mode Son ography findings, contrast- enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) allows more detailed evaluation of the microcirculation. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the diagnostic performance of CEUS in the diagnostic of pathologies of renal transplants. Methods or Background: A systematic query of CEUS examinations of renal transplants between 2008 and 2020 in our institution was performed. Following inclusion criteria were definded: I) patient age 18 years and II) confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy and histopathology or imaging finding. Exclusion criteria were: I) study examination of CEUS and II) another indication than dedicated examination of renal transplant. Results or Findings: Overall, N = 78 patients were included in the stati stical analysis. Analysis revealed high sensitivity (92.2% , 95% -CI 71.9 - 96.1%). Sensitivity and specificity resulted in the sub-coh ort of tumors (n = 23 participants) in 100% (95%-CI 80.6 - 100.0%) and 74 .1% (95%-CI 35.9 - 91.8%) and in a sub-cohort with non-focal findings (n = 55 participants) Ultrasound contrast agents do not impair renal func tion and are therefore attractive to use in patients after renal transplant. Due to the superficial location of the grafts, they are much m ore accessible to US than autologous kidneys, which again advocates the use o f CEUS. Our study results suggest a relevant role for CEUS in the clarification of findings requiring contrast agent application in renal transplants. Limitations: The study is retrospective.

Lorbeer\u00b2, the relationship of adipose tissue (AT ) compartments assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and renal function parameters in a western general population without history of prior renal function impairment. Methods or Background: From the general population, 377 subjects underwent T1-DIXON whole-body 3Tesla-MRI. Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous creatinine (Cr), cystatin-C (CysC) and using standardised tests. Est imated glomerular filtration rates (e-GFR) and cystatin-C (e-GFRcys). Results or Findings: After multivariate adjustment for known risk factor s including measures of obesity, VAT volume was inver sely associated with eGFRcys In con trast, SAT with CysC, uMA and eGFRcys (all p>0.096) . Stratified analyses according to body mass index (BMI) yielded confirmation of these findings also in Stratified analyses according to sex did not provide any gender differe nces. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 439 Conclusion: VAT is positively associated with CysC and inversel y associated with eGFRcys, which might suggest a direct involvem ent of VAT in increased metabolism of CysC and therefore in impaired kidney function. Volumetric fat quantification by MRI may provide additional inform ation for better risk stratification regarding renal function impairment in obesity.

Ljimani*, T. Thiel, J. Schweitzer, T. Boege, H-J. Wittsack, R. Westenfeld; D\u00fcsseldorf/DE Purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate changes of perfusion and oxygenation properties in renal tissue due to radiographic contrast media (XCM) by arterial spin labelling (ASL) and blood ox ygen level dependent (BOLD) MRI. Methods or Background: 15 patients with history of severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (5 females and 10 males, mean age 76. 3 \u00b1 8.1 years) undergoing coronarography with administration of XC M were scanned pre and post-intervention on a clinical 3T MR-Scanner. Renal clinical parameters were collected for all included patients before and 48 h post-intervention. For renal ASL, paracoronal FAIR-TrueFisp sequence (TR/TE 4.0/ 2.0 ms, TI 1200 ms, 30 averages) were acquired. For renal BOLD, paracoronal for both methods and region-of-interest- based analysis was performed. The results were anal ysed by R and correlated to renal clinical parameters. Results or Findings: Considering the renal damage after the intervention, the patients were divided into two groups: patient with out renal involvement (non- CIN, n = 10) and with contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) group (n = 5). Mean renal blood flows measured by ASL in cortex and med ulla show a significant decrease before and after administration of XCM in patients with CIN (p<0.05). Resembling results occur for BOLD. Interestingly, perfusion values correlated significantly with acquired renal clinical paramete rs of the CKD patients (p<0.05). Conclusion: Perfusion and oxygenation properties in renal tissue assessed by functional MR perfusion imaging might reflect renal changes due to administration of nephrotoxic XCM and might be a us eful tool for the improvement of renal surveillance in high-risk pati ents.

Guo; Xi'an/CN (1291068604@qq.com) Purpose: evaluate the accuracy of using virtual unenhance d (VUE) images in dual-energy CT to measure the volume of urinary stones in comparison with true unenhanced (TUE) examination. Methods or Background: 83 patients with urinary stones who underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CTU were included (Table 1). TUE and VUE images at nephrographic (VUE(NP)) and excretory phase (VUE(EP)) were analysed. Stone volume was calculated using th e tool provided by AW.4.7. VUE(EP) images were divided into three grou ps according to the degree of residual iodine (Fig 1). Wilcoxon test was used to compare the stone volume between TUE and VUE groups. Results or Findings: 104 urinary stones were detected on both the TUE images and VUE images. Stone volumes determined on the VUE(NP) images and VUE(EP) images with none or mild iodine residuals were systematically smaller than those of the TUE images with volume me asurement differences of 17%, 16%, and 22% for the above three types of images, respectively. However, stone volume on the VUE(EP) images with se vere iodine residuals were not different from the TUE images (Table 2 and Figure 2) due to the contribution of the iodine residuals. Conclusion: Compared with the TUE images, VUE images in dual-en ergy CT underestimate the volume of urinary stones by about 20%, and the incomplete removal of iodine in VUE(EP) images may artificiall y reduce the volume measurement difference.

Methods or Background: 37 MM-patients and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers without any history of renal damage were examined on a 3T whole- body MR-scanner (MAGNETOM Prisma, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) tensor arterial spin labelling ( ASL) and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD). The frequently used clinical parameters, including glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total 24-hour pr oteinuria (TPU), affected and (FLCs) levels were correlated with assessed mpMRI parameter. Patients were divided in groups due to their renal impairment due to MM. Results or Findings: All acquired MR-parameters correlated significantly with eGFR, respectively (p<0.05). BOLD correlated with IG and FLCs, and medullary FA with TPU and IG levels, respectively (p<0.05). Significant difference between mean medullary BOLD, ASL and DTI values could be shown in patients with severe renal impair ment compared to less impaired patients. BOLD, medullary DWI and DTI valu es of healthy controls were significantly different from MM patients. Conclusion: mpMRI exhibit a good correlation with frequently us ed clinical parameters for evaluation of MM specific renal changes. Especially the possibility to differentiate between mild and sever e renal MM damage indicate mpMRI as potential important diagnostic tool for as sessment of MM specific renal changes.

The number , volume of brain (fractional anisotropy=FA; mean, axial, radial diff usivities=MD, AD, RD, respectively) were calculated in (p<0.007) and ANOVA covarying for (p<0.0167). Results or Findings: IBLs were frequent (95%). In 4 regions significant AD reduction was detected (genu, body, splenium, right PHG; p0.0023), with a significant decrease of MD (body of CC: p=0.0006) a nd FA (splenium: p<0.0001). Significant RD and MD reduction was found in both CG (p 0.0053). ANOVA confirmed significant effect of female sex on AD and MD reduction (body, right CG) and AD reduction (left CG); p 0.0254. Significant effect of ILL on the following DTI metric changes was also found (AD, MD-body; MD-left CG; p0.0050 for all). Conclusion: The trend of DTI metric changes is opposite to the general trends reported in various neurodegenerative conditions, s uggesting that TAVI might improve cerebral microstructural integrity, especially in women and lower ILL. Limitations: 1) DTI is a mathematical representation of the underlying structure, not always reflecting true anatomy. 2) O nly 7 tracts with reliable manual correction of the automated segmentation wer e studied. 3) Possible selection bias as patients with an improved general /cognitive state are more likely to participate at follow-ups.

Bani Lyon/FR (apbanisadr@gmail.com) Purpose: To investigate the impact of brush sign and cerebral collateral status on infarct growth after successful thrombectomy. Methods or Background: The HIBISCUS-STROKE cohort includes patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with thrombectomy after MRI triage and, undergoing a follow-up MRI at Day-6 including FLAIR images to quantify final infarct volume (FIV). Successful revascularisation was defined as a mTICI score 2B. Infarct growth was calculated by subtracting t he final FLAIR images from the admission DWI after co-registration and, considered significant (SIG) when expansion > 11.6mL. Brush si gn was assessed on T2* images and was defined as abnormal visualization of medullary veins. Cerebral collateral status was assessed using the hypoperfus ion intensity ratio, which is the volume of Tmax 10s divided by the volume of Tmax 6s. Good collaterals were defined by a hypoperfusion intensi ty ratio < 0.4. Results or Findings: Eighty-eight patients were included, of whom 30 (34.1%) had a brush sign and, 42 (47.7%) good collaterals. The brush sign was associated with higher relative cerebral blood volume (p=0.05), larger penumbra (p<0.001), infarct growth a (p<0.001), larger penumbra (p=0.05) and, lower FIV (p<0.001). Collateral status was not associated with brush sign (p=0.18) or infarct growth (p=0.72). Nineteen (21.6%) patients experienced SI G. In multivariate regression, only the brush sign remained infarct growth after s uccessful thrombectomy. Limitations: The design was retrospective and monocentric.

Therefore, we con ducted the study to explore the impact of sinovenous outflow patency on radiosurgical outcomes of TSDAVFs. Methods or We 83 TSDAVFs treated with radiosurgery. Two neuroradiolo gists blinded to the therapeutic outcomes served as imaging evaluators o n pretreatment angiography and MRI. The sinovenous outflow of TSDA VF was scored using combined conduit score (CCS), ranging from 0 (total occlusion) to 8 (full patency). The patients' follow-up MRI and angiography images were evaluated for the presence of TSDAVF obliteration. Cox regres sion and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to determine the correlatio ns between the variables and outcomes. Results or Findings: Among the 83 cases, 60 (72%) achieved obliteration after radiosurgery at a median latency period of 24.5 months. After adjustment for aggressive presentation, cortical venous reflux , straight sinus reflux, and optic nerve sheath enlargement, a CCS of >6 remained predictive of TSDAVF obliteration (hazard ratio: 2.335, p 0.007). of obliteration were 80% and 53.6% fo r TSDAVFs with a CCS of >6 and 6, respectively. Conclusion: TSDAVFs with a CCS of >6, indicating a nearly paten t sinovenous outflow, were more likely to be obliterated after radiosurgery. The evaluation of sinovenous outflow patency may help i n predicting treatment outcomes and making therapeutic decisions. Limitations: The small sample size and retrospective design may have led to selection bias. Ethics committee approval: This study was approved by an ethics committee.

Cerebral vasospasm is its most severe com plications. The study was designed as a cross-sectional study. It include d all patients 18 years, with 1st time diagnosed aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, treated with endovascular embolization, at The following variables were examined: socio-demographic data, CT findings, laboratory analysis (maximum recorded and nadir values): blood count, coagulation tests and biochemistry analysis. The impact of these vari ables on the two main outcomes was investigated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results or Findings: In total, 66 patients were enrolled. The univariate analysis showed that intraventricular haemorrhage i n CT, maximum recorded INR and leucocytes were strongly associated with ce rebral vasospasm increasing its chances by 3.5 (95%CI=1.28-9.81), 4. 1 (95%CI=1.45-11.56), 6.7 (95%CI=2.10-21.71). The multivariate analysis showe d that delayed ischaemic neurological deficit, haemorrhage in the 4th ventri cle, and the maximum recorded urea were strongly associated with intrahospital mortality, increasing its chances by 16.3, 12, and 12.6 times, respective ly. Conclusion: The effect of elevated INR on cerebral vasospasm in our study may reflect a similar effect of systemic inflammati on on the coagulation cascade, and may have a therapeutic effect. Monitor ing of renal function and urea levels in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoi d haemorrhage is important as maximum recorded urea is significant r isk factor for intrahospital mortality, as well as intraventricular haemorrhage.

Methods or Background: Six radiologists with 3 different levels of experience retrospectively evaluated 60 CT angiographies for t he presence of intracranial arterial aneurysm, with confirmed positive findings in 30 cases. Each radiologists reviewed the angiography datasets twic e: once on a dedicated medical-grade workstation and again, after an inter val of 3 months, on a commercially available mobile consumer-grade device . Diagnostic performance, reading efficiency, and subjective scorings including diagnostic confidence were analysed and compared. Results or Findings: Diagnostic performance was comparable on both devices regardless of the readers' experience level s, and no significant differences in sensitivity (66-87.5%) and specifici ty (79.4-87%) (p = 0.157-1) were found. The results obtained with both devices were also comparable in terms of subjective assessment across all reader gr oups. However, reading efficiency was significantly poorer when the mobile device was used. Conclusion: Diagnostic performance was comparable on both devic es, while efficiency was lower on the mobile device. Limitations: Since the same datasets were read twice by each radiologist for comparability, a memory effect may theoretically oc cur. To minimise such an effect, a 3-month waiting interval was chosen and t he datasets were presented in a different order during the second reading.

Vosko\u00b9, S. Sahebdivan\u00b2, C. \u00b3Tulln/AT, Fremont, CA/US Purpose: Acute stroke is a neurological emergency regarding rapid therapy based on brain imaging differentiation between haem orrhagic and ischaemic lesions. Computerised tomography and magnetic reson ance imaging are method of the choice, but mostly located in hospital facilities. Bioelectromagnetic tomography (BET) seems to be abl e to detect brain lesion due to dielectric properties of brain tissue without radiation. Methods or Background: We performed a singlecentre, limited scale exploratory feasibility clinical study using a BET in 10 volunteers and 30 patients with acute stroke after clinical examinati on and reference imaging: computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI). Safety, sensitivity and specificity of BET was analysed. Results or Findings: 40 participant were enrolled in the study, of whom 10 healthy volunteers (HV) and 30 patients with acute stroke (6 haemorrhagic and 24 ischaemic). 5/10 HV measurements had to be excluded from the further analysis due to measurement mistake. In 5 HV, 5 val id BET scans were obtained and all five were true normal without signs of ischaemic, nor haemorrhage. Among all patients, 9 scans in ICH and 38 scans in AIS patients underwent image processing. BET was true positive i n 9/9 ICH scans and true positive in 37/38 AIS scans, 1 scan was non conclus ive. The haemorrhagic exclusion analysis showed a 100% of sensitivity, 97.7% of specificity, 98.1% of accuracy, and 0.0% false omission rate. Conclusion: Electromagnetic tomography is a safe and feasible m ethod used in acute stroke patients. Characteristic BET-patter ns were calculated for cerebral ischaemia and haemorrhagic stroke. Limitations: Further studies are needed to examine/confirm the s ensitivity and specificity in acute stroke patients with different locations and size of cerebral lesions.

Yang, H. Xu, Z. Yang; Beijing/CN (hao_ren@ccmu.edu.cn) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the preli minary study of the DCE-MRI of exchange model on the staging of liv er fibrosis and to compare the differential ability of DCE imaging and MRE in the staging of liver fibrosis. Methods or Background: The subjects were NAFLD patients who underwent MRE and DCE in our hospital. All patients had liver biopsy results. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to compare the correlation between MRE and DCE and liver fibrosis. ROC was used to evaluat e the efficacy of DCE and MRE in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Results or Findings: The correlation coefficient between PS parameters of DCE and liver fibrosis was -0.76, the correlation c oefficient between FP parameters of DCE and liver fibrosis was -0.75, and the correlation coefficient between liver stiffness and liver fibrosis of MRE w as 0.83. Some parameters of DCE (PS, FP) were slightly higher in AUC than in MR E stiffness values in the diagnosis of the presence or absence of liver fibrosis, but there was no statistical difference. Conclusion: MRE has good diagnostic efficacy for all stages of liver fibrosis in NAFLD. DCE has certain advantages over MRE in the diagnosis of early fibrosis, and DCE is expected to be a new tool for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis.

Klom Amsterdam/NL what extent colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) show typical imaging characteristics, such as arter ial rim enhancement, moderate hyperintensity to liver on T2W-MRI, diffus ion restriction and non- enhancement in hepatobiliary phase, on gadoxetic-ac id-enhanced MRI before and after chemotherapy. Methods or Background: From November 2015 until February 2021, we retrospectively identified 247 patients with gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI before and/or after chemotherapy for pathologically proven CRLM. 664 CRLM were included, with a maximum of 5 CRLM per patient . MRIs with low image quality and mucinous CRLM were excluded. MRI pre-chemotherapy was available in 654 CRLM(n=157 patients), MRI post-chemotherapy in 160 CRLM(n=49 patients) and both pre- and post-therapy MRI in 150 CRLM(n=41 patients). Two expert radiologists assessed size, l ocation, enhancement patterns, signal intensity on multiple sequences, h yperintensity on DWI. Results or Findings: On pre-chemotherapy MRI, only 58% of CRLM showed peripheral rim enhancement, the others appeared hom ogenous (30%) or heterogeneous (12%) on Diffusion found in 87% of CRLM. On post-chemotherapy MRI, CRLM showed similar patte rns on contrast series with peripheral enhancement (47%), homogeneous (32% ) or heterogeneous (8%) appearance, or T2W-MRI, CRLM presented less moderately hyperintense (76%) and more often isointense (24%). Post- chemotherapy, diffusion was found in CRLM. All CRLM (100%) were unenhancing on hepatobiliary phase, bot h before and after chemotherapy. Conclusion: CRLM do not always show typical imaging characteris tics on gadoxetic-acid-enhanced MRI like arterial rim enhancement and diffusion restriction, especially after chemotherapy.

A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 443 Methods or Background: This is a singlecentre study. We evaluated 166 patients with different etiologies of chronic liver disease (CLD) with QElaXto 2D-SWE and TE. The fibrosis stage was assessed with the \"rule of 5\" for TE and the \"rule of 4\" for QElaXto 2D-SWE. Cohen's kappa test was used for the agreement between the 2 techniques. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify the cut-o ff value to rule-out cACLD, using TE as the reference method. Results or Findings: We found a good concordance between the 2 techniques (weighted k = 0.81). The best cut-off value between QElaxto 2D-SWE and TE in assessing LS. Since the cut-off of 6.9kpa is low er than the one proposed by the \"rule of 4\", we suggest the implementation of i n-house cut-off, which should be evaluated by further analyses. Limitations: Firstly, the patients had different CLD etiologies, mostly HCV and NAFLD. Secondly, the majority of patients (74%) had a fibrosis stage of F0-F1 and F2, with only few patients with F3, which might have limited our analysis.

Methods or Background: A dynamic, 3D printed hepatic artery phantom perfused with pulsatile flow was scanned with 2D ph ase-contrast and flow at 0.6-, 0.8- and 1-mm isotropic resolution wi th navigator acceptance windows of \u00b12 to \u00b18 mm. Twenty volunteers were scanned at 0.8- and 1-mm 4D flow with a \u00b14 mm acceptance window and 2D PC. H aemodynamic parameters at the common hepatic, proper hepatic, gastroduodenal, left and right hepatic branches were extracted. Mean percent error (MPE) compared to ground truth was calculated in-vitro; percent visibility of vascular branches and interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa and coef ficients of variation (CV) were evaluated in volunteers. Results or Findings: MPE of average area, flow, velocity and peak veloci ty at the highest spatial resolution and narrowest accept ance window were -8.0 %, - 4.7%, -2.6%, and These changed to -10.4%, -6.6%, -1.9%, and -8.8% at the widest navigator acceptance window and to 49.9%, 30.6%, - 14.6%, and -17.6% at the lowest spatial resolution. 4D flow at 0.8- and 1-mm resolution were successful in 14 and 18 volunteers, with overall vessel visibilities of 90% and 71%, interobserver agreement of kappa = 0.66 and kappa = 0.70 and CVs of 20.0% and 30.7% for area, 34.9% and 51.9% for flow, 26.5% and 44.7% for average velocity and 36.9% and 39.4% for peak velocity, respectively. Conclusion: 4D flow with high spatial resolution and moderate m otion suppression can accurately and reproducibly measure hepatic arterial flow.

Methods or Background: Children scheduled to undergo contrast-enhanced MRI of the Central Nervous System (CNS cohort) or o ther organs (Body cohort) were included in 3 age groups (12-17, 7-11 and 2-6 years) and four blood samples were collected after gadopiclenol adm inistration (0.05 mmol/kg). A population PK modeling was used with the CNS cohort and adult subjects from a previous study. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded, and efficacy was assessed for all children. Results or Findings: Sixty children in the CNS cohort and 20 in the Body cohort were included. The two-compartment model wit h linear elimination from the central compartment developed in adults was sui table for children. PK parameters were similar between adults and children. Terminal half-life was 1.82 h for adults and 1.29 to 1.77 h for children. Median clearance ranged from 0.08 L/h/kg in adults and 12-17 years to 0.12 L/h/k g in 2-6 years. Median central and peripheral volume of distribution were 0.11-0.12 L/kg and 0.06 L/kg, respectively, for adults and children. Simulations of plasma concentrations showed minor differences and median area under the curve was 590 mg.h/L for adults and 403 to 582 mg.h/L for children. Two patients (2.5%) experienced AEs considered related to gadopi clenol (non-serious): a mild QT interval prolongation and a moderate maculopapular rash. As for diagnostic efficacy, there was no difference among the paediatric age groups. Conclusion: Gadopiclenol PK in children aged 2-17 years seems s imilar to that observed in adults. Thus, there is no indicati on for age-based dose adaptation. Gadopiclenol had a good safety profile in these patients. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

S. Esser, Tsiflikas, Gatidis, In neuroblastoma, high metabolic 18F-FDG-tumour-vol ume is associated with highly viable tissue and poor progn osis. MR-studies including diffusion-weighted imaging have shown that extent o f diffusion restriction is related to tumour cell differentiation and response to chemotherapy. The purpose was to evaluate the correlation between standard-uptake-value and apparent-diffusion-coefficient in neuroblastic tumours by voxel-wise-analysis. Methods or Background: Prospective, observational PET/MRI study, all patients diagnosed with NB at baseline and after ch emotherapy were included. After image-registration/and tumour-segmentation, m etabolic and functional tumour volumes were calculated from ADC and SUV val ues using a dedicated software allowing voxel-wise analysis. Under the me ans of thresholds each voxel was assigned to one of 3 virtual-tissue-groups: highly viable (lowADC and highSUV), possibly benign (highADC and lowSUV), and intermediate with highADC and highSUV or lowADC and lowSUV. Additionally, values of ADC and SUV were correlated after clustering of multipl e Gaussian distributions. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 444 Results or Findings: From 43 PET/MR, 17 examinations of 14 patients met the inclusion criteria. Eight examinations at basel ine, 9 for response assessment. The proportion of tumour volumes were 16, 35, 48% (v ,b, i) at baseline and 6, 68, 26% after treatment, respectively. ADC and SUV showed a negative correlation prior and after to treatment ( R=-0.332, -0.401; P<0.0001) in the cluster, which contains more than 70% highly viable voxels. Patients with progression under therapy had a relevant part in this cluster. In contrast, ADC and SUV correlated positively in the cluster dif ferent quality of tumour-tissue before and after therapy. Only in volumes, which correspond to highly viable tissue, expected negati ve correlation of lowADC and highSUV was found representing redundant inform ation. Limitations: Positive correlation in \"equivocal\" voxels could be due to cell differentiation or inflammatory/necrotic processes.

Aim to describe CTSS of th e COVID-19 infection in paediatric oncology patients (POP), to find a cut-o ff value of CTSS that can differentiate mild cases that can be managed at hom e and moderate to severe cases that need hospital care. Methods or Background: A retrospective cohort study included 64 (POP) with confirmed COVID-19 infection. They were classified clinically into mild, moderate, and severe groups. CT findings were evalu ated for lung involvement and CTSS was calculated and range from 0 (clear lung) to 20 (all lung lobes were affected). Results or Findings: Overall, 89% of patients had haematological malignancies and 92% were under active oncology treatment. The CT findings were ground-glass opacity (70%) and consol idation patches (62.5%). In total, 85% of patients had bilateral lung involv ement, ROC curve showed that the area under the curve of CTSS for diagnosing severe type was 0.842 (95% CI 0.737-0.948). The CTSS cut-off of 6.5 69% specificity, with 41.7% (PPV) and 96.9% (NPV). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, mortality risk was higher in patients with CT score > 7 than in those with CTSS < 7. Conclusion: Paediatric oncology patients, especially those with haematological malignancies, are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Chest CT severity score > 6.5 (about 35% lung invol vement) can be used as a predictor of the need for hospitalisation. Limitations: No comparative group including normal immunocompetent paediatric patients, so the generalisability in the paediatric group was not being allowed.

One major disadvant age of WB-MRI is its long acquisition time. Revolutionary technological developments enabled an acceleration of MR-sequences. The purpose of our st udy was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic confidence of novel MR s equences to accelerate WB- MRI in paediatric patients. Methods or Background: A total of 90 patients (inclusion criteria: 7 years- old, diagnosis of cancer or CPS) are to be included in this institutional review board-approved, prospective study. To date, 28 pati ents were included, who underwent WB-MRI staging at a 3T MR scanner with our standard WB-MRI protocol including a standard T2-weighted (T2w) Tur bo-Inversion Recovery- (T1w) DIXON. Additionally a T2w HASTE in coronal ori entation with either compressed sensing (CS) or deep learning (DL) and a T1w VIBE DIXON with CS are acquired and compared to the standard sequen ces. Three readers independently evaluated the images of the sequences concerning image quality and diagnostic confidence (image quality, s harpness, noise, artifacts) on a Likert-Scale ranging from 1 to 5. Results or Findings: In all examined patients, HASTE and VIBE with DL an d CS were successfully acquired. The first results sh owed comparable image quality, extent of artifacts and sharpness, as well as reduced noise compared to standard sequences. For a normal sized adolescent, scan time could be reduced from 9:39 min (TIRM) to at least 3:30 min ( HASTE). Conclusion: Using new MRI sequences with CS and DL for WB-MRI i n paediatric patients is feasible and may allow for a remarkable time saving in paediatric WB imaging. Limitations: Preliminary results. Ethics committee approval: Approved by the local ethics committee. Funding for this study: No funding was received.

O. Croes*\u00b9, M. F. Boomsma\u00b9, I. M. study was to assess paediatri c fluoroscopic dose levels based on exposures in Dutch clinical pr actice, as the current paediatric fluoroscopic DRLs need an update accordi ng to European Guidelines on DRLs for Paediatric Imaging (PiDRL) and are only available for the age categories 0, 1 and 5 years. Methods or Background: Dose area product (DAP)-values were retrospectively collected from paediatric patients (0-18y) who had undergone a fluoroscopic examination between 1-1-2017 and 1-6-2021 in nine Dutch hospitals (total 1047 examinations). The protocols involved were those recommended in the PiDRL guidelines: micturating cy stourethrography (MCU), intestinal with contrast enema (LowerGI). In case the period of the provided data was shorter than the time interval of the study, dose information data w as partly duplicated to meet the chosen study time interval. In accordance with the PiDRL recommendations for sparse data the 75th percentile of the median DAP values of each hospital were fitted to an exponenti al dose-age curve which values were compared to European DRLs. Results or Findings: For MCU the proposed DRL curve was a factor 3.7 to 12 lower compared to the current Dutch DRLs (0y: 30 \u00b5G ym2, The proposed DRL curve was for UpperGI a factor 2.5 to 4 and for LowerGI a factor 1.4 to 7 lower compared to the current European DRLs. Conclusion: Our study shows that the current dose levels for paediatric fluoroscopic imaging are substantially lower than t he current DRLs for MCU, UpperGI and LowerGI. Therefore, our data indicates that determination of new national DRLs for MCU, UpperGI and LowerGI seems absolutely necessary. Limitations: Not applicable. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

However, the impact of FU-US in patients with inconspicuous initial computed tomography (CT) remains unclear. We therefore aimed to evaluate the impact and therapeutic relevance of FU-US in paediatric polytrauma patients with inconspicuous i nitial Background: We retrospectively identified all paediatric polytrauma patients who underwent initial CT between February 2009 and May 2019. We included only patients with both inconspic uous CT without abdominal injuries or free intraabdominal fluid and standardi sed FU-US. For the establishment of the final clinical diagnosis, the discharge report, other imaging examinations and surgical records were reviewed and served as standard of reference. Results or Findings: We identified 217 paediatric polytrauma patients (98 girls; age 9.7\u00b14.8 years) who underwent abdominal C T. One hundred and thirty-three patients (61%) had inconspicuous CT fi ndings and US girls; age 9.2\u00b14.9 years) within 1.4\u00b10.9 day s. FU-US revealed no specific posttraumatic pathologies, only minimal intraabdominal fluid in 34/128 patients (26%), which was solely present as pelvic fluid in 29/34 of patients (85%) and within the Koller and/or Morison pouch in the remaining patients. The presence of intraabdominal fluid had no impact on further clinical management and no subsequent parenchymal injury was detected. Conclusion: FU-US in paediatric polytrauma patients with incons picuous initial abdominal CT did not reveal additional relevant fin dings and thus had no impact on clinical management. Hence, FU-US in paediatric polytrauma patients with inconspicuous initial abdominal CT is not routinely required. However, in case of equivocal CT findings or abnorm al clinical/laboratory findings it may still be considered as a non-invasi ve and ionising radiation-free FU-imaging method.

Elshami*\u00b9, (welshami@sharjah.ac.ae) risk is associated with ionising radiation a nd is related directly to the increasing absorbed radiation dose. Studies indicate that with transition to digital radiography, there has been p oor collimation practice consequently resulting in electronic image cropping by some radiographers during paediatric radiography. The advantages of collimation should be investigated to disseminate convenient use among radiographers and create awareness. Methods or Background: The study examined the extent of the effect of collimation on cancer risk to neonates undergoing anteroposterior (AP) chest examination using Monte Carlo Simulation. Using Monte Carlo Simulations, series of cancer risk were measured for neonate underwent AP chest radiography. The minimum radiation field size in the series was set in line with the European guidelines. The field size was increas ed by 1cm for 5 times. Monte Carlo Simulations were employed for the compu tation of cancer risk serially (increasing by 1cm) on all sides and in the head-to-feet direction from the minimum field size recommended by the European guidelines. Results or Findings: Increasing the field size increases cancer risk to the breast, colon, liver, lung cancer. Similarly, the r isk of leukemia and other cancers increased. Conclusion: Using optimum field size is recommended to reduce u nnecessary radiation doses. Therefore, radiographers should be aware of the consequences of excessive field size in cancer risk .

Purpose: Visual inspection of dopamine transporter SPECT imaging improves diagnostic confidence for Parkinson's disease (PD) but depends on readers' level of expertise. While artificial Intelligence ( AI) can provide valuable support, its performance heavily depends on availability and quality of training data. We aim to investigate the performance of AI to detect PD in heterogenous imaging datasets, collected with different equipment and at various locations. Methods or Background: We selected two local SPECT datasets (avg. n=115 images each) that differed in equipment and imaging characteristics, and a larger one (n=598) from the Parkinson Progression M arkers Initiative (PPMI). Then we built a deep learning approach and assessed its performance when trained and tested on each dataset individually wit h data preprocessing (spatial normalization and image augmentation). Finally, we studied the fusion of the different datasets using balanced merging and trans fer learning (TL). Results or Findings: For local datasets, data preprocessing improved the average accuracy (acc) of 84% by +5% - especially f or the most heterogenous dataset. The training combining all datasets result ed in accuracies ranging from 88% to 96% when tested on each dataset. The be st performance was measured with the augmented PPMI dataset (acc. 96%) , which was successfully used to initialise the training of the local datasets based on TL. Conclusion: The developed AI showed very promising results, alt hough intra- dataset variability in small datasets hindered AI p erformance, which could be mitigated with data preprocessing. Limitations: Issues related to size imbalance and image heteroge neities between datasets could not be totally addressed, demanding further investigation, especially in advanced transfer lear ning and fusion of imaging and patient data.

Cast elijns\u00b9, \u00b9Amsterdam/NL, \u00b2Boston, MA/US Purpose: Clinical implementation of radiomics is hampering due to several factors. One of these factors is the need for time- consuming whole tumour delineations. Substitution of faster, easier or rea dily available delineations might increase clinical adoption of radiomics. Ther efore, this study investigates if alternative delineations can substitute 3D whole -tumour contours in the prediction of locoregional control (LRC) in squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) T1-weighted MRIs of 177 OPSCC primary tumours using six different manual delineation strategies. Logistic regression and rec ursive feature elimination were used to build models predictive of LRC. Models were trained and tested based on data from each separate delineation (metho d 1), trained and tested based on features extracted by an experienced obser ver and tested on A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 446 alternative delineations (method 2). Additionally, method 2 was repeated with the exclusion of shape features (method 3). Predict ion performance was assessed using area under the receiver operation ch aracteristic (AUC) curve. Results or Findings: Models trained on delineations performed by an experienced observer perform better (AUC: 0.74) com pared to alternative delineations in method 1 (AUC: 0.40-0.56) as well i n method 2 (AUC: 0.56- 0.67). Removal of shape features decreased model pe rformance of the expert radiologist (AUC: 0.54). Testing this model on alte rnative delineation shows higher performances on alternative tumour contours, such as the largest axial diameter (AUC: 0.63) or a sphere of a diameter of 4mm placed in the most solid tumour area (AUC: 0.72). Since these models w ere only able to predict one class, prediction using these models is worthle ss. Conclusion: Fast, easier or readily available tumour contours c annot substitute full 3D tumour delineations in radiomic models predictive of LRC in OPSCC. Limitations: Not applicable.

Wasserthal; Basel/CH Purpose: Determination of myelin development is an essential part of pediatric neuroradiology practice. Our goal is to automate th e estimation of myelin maturation with a deep learning algorithm. Methods or Background: T1w and T2w MRI images of the brain from 1002 children aged 0-36 months were retrospectively eval uated (01.01.2011- to \"myelin age\". A 2D input was generated from side-by-side MR I slices of the whole brain. Images were randomly resized by 20% to preve nt the network from learning the age-dependent brain size. 778 images w ith normal myelin maturation, where chronological age was identical t o \"myelin age,\" were selected for the training set. 224 images containing both healthy and sick subjects were chosen for the test set. 5-fold cross -validation was applied for hyperparameter optimisation. The test set was also evaluated by two radiologists to compare the model's performance wit h that of the human rater. Results or Findings: Myelin age within 1-month of chronological age is considered normal, and lower myelin age is consider ed delayed. The model had a mean absolute error of 1.5 months. The model achieved 93% accuracy in predicting myelin age in children with normal my elin maturation (212 cases). In children with delayed myelin maturation, the alg orithm only showed 28% accuracy (12 cases). However, this task was inherently ambiguous, as human raters achieved only 52% agreement in detecting del ayed cases. Conclusion: Our model can predict the corresponding myelin maturation age in infancy and early childhood with high accuracy. When myelin maturation was delayed, both the raters and the algorithm show ed lower performance. Limitations: The study included a scarcity of cases with delayed myelination.

Shankar*\u00b9, S. Jain\u00b9, D. Singh\u00b2, N. Kumar\u00b9, relatively common nding on prenatal ultrasound and a soft marker requiring a specialist referral for a detailed search of associated anomalies. We p ropose a deep learning system (DLS) for the automated quantification and s creening of suspected ventriculomegaly to assist novice operators to prov ide timely referrals. Methods or Background: On 514 259/39), we trained (ground-truth: points provided by fetal medicine specialists [FMS]) a DLS to automatically predict the caliper points for measuring the atrial width (AW) of the lateral ventricles. The predicted AW me asurements were then classified into normal or suspected VM based on cli nical guidelines (ISUOG). The suspected VM cases were further classified into prominent, mild, and severe categories. We assessed the DLS performance (vs. FMS) in the automated measurement (mean error [ME] and screening (sensitivity [Sn], specificity [Sp], accuracy [Ac]; with 95% CI). Results or Findings: On an independent test set of 226 images (186 cases ), the MEs (in mm) in DLS AW measurements were 0.47+-0.56 (normal, 143 cases), 0.41+-0.37 (prominent, 18 cases), 0.71+-0.7 7 (mild, 20 cases), and 0.77+-0.97 (severe, 5 cases). Further, the normal a nd suspected VM cases were discriminated with a Sn, Sp, and Ac of 95.18% We successfully developed and validated a DLS for t he automated quantification and screening of suspected VM cases. Its clinical translation can help expecting mothers in low-resource/remote settings to receive timely referrals for detailed examination. Limitations: Bilateral VM cases were excluded from the study. Th e study had a limited dataset size (only mid-trimester cases).

However, multi-centric validation of these radiomic signatures is needed t o prove generalisability for clinical implementation. This study aims to validat e a previously published single-centre radiomic signature to predict cell carcinomas (OPSCC) pati ents using an independent external dataset. Methods or Background: The validation cohort consists of 149 OPSCC patients. Radiomic features were extracted from pri mary tumour volumes on postcontrast T1-MRI. ComBat harmonisation was perfo rmed to transform these features towards the feature space of the published dataset. Performances were assessed using area under the curve (AUC). Statistical differences between patient demographics were calculated using the Independent Student t-test. Results or Findings: Clinical characteristics were comparable between th e published and validation cohort for age, gender, sm oking status, nodal status. Differences were shown for positive HPV tumor status vs 69%, cancer subsit e (p<0.053). Both cohorts had a LRC rate of 80% of the patients. Perf ormance of the published radiomic model (AUC: 0.74) decreased when the model was validated in an external cohort (AUC: 0.5). A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 447 Conclusion: The previously published single-centre radiomic mod el is not generalisable when validating on an independent ext ernal dataset. Differences between cohorts regarding patient population, scan acquisition or pre- processing might induce a too large source of noise limiting reproducibility.

Ibbeken\u00b9, F. \u00fcbeck/DE, Purpose: There is an increasing interest for simultaneous anatomic analysis and 3D airway segmentation in patients with obstruc tive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Hence, we sought to analyse image and semiautomated segmentation quality of a 3D MRI protocol in patien ts with OSAS. Methods or Background: 25 patients with (45\u00b113 years, 11 female, BMI 27.6\u00b14.5) and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15.4\u00b110 were examined after IRB approval and consent using an isotropic 3D T1 TSE sequence on a 3T MR scanner (Ingenia, v5.4, Philips) with a 16-channel surface coil. The effective isotropic resolution was 0.58mm. The fiel d of view was adapted to each individual's anatomy and was typically 200x250x180mm. Parallel imaging with an effective factor b=4.5 was applied to achie ve a clinically acceptable acquisition time below 3 min. Each sequence was rep eated 6 times in different jaw positions partially with a protrusion spint. 3D airway segmentation was performed using ITK-SNAP (www.itksnap.org, v3.8.0, open-source). Diagnostic image quality of reference structures was visually graded from 1 (very good) to 5 (unusable) in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypoph arynx, and larynx; apparent os were quantified. Results or Findings: Good or very good image quality was confirmed in 74/100 stations (74%), only 22/100 and 4/100 stations showed moderate or significant artifacts. No study was unusable. Semi- automatic 3D segmentation of the pharynx and proximal larynx was successfully performed in 24/25 datasets with only few post-processings; in one cas e, nearly complete manual segmentation was required due to artifacts. Conclusion: Accelerated 3D T1 TSE MRI is well suited for simult aneous anatomical imaging and semi-automatic airway segmentation in OSAS patients. Swallowing artifacts may in some cases co mpromise quality such that manual segmentation or post-processing is required instead of semi-automatic segmentation. Limitations: Not applicable.

S. Martin*, F. Kouakoua, Frankfurt a. Main/DE (simartin@outlook.com) Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impac t of a CT-based iterative metal artifact (iMAR) algorithm on image quality in patients with head/neck abscess and dental hardware. Methods or Background: Dual-energy CT images of 80 patients with dental hardware and head/neck abscess were reconstructed w ith an iMAR algorithm. Two senior radiologists specialised with 6 and 10 y ears of experience evaluated standard and iMAR reconstructed CT images for subjective and objective image quality, metal artifacts, and delineation of the abscess based on a 5-point-rating-scale. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the Cohens Kappa. Results or Findings: Compared with standard CT images, iMAR showed a significant artefact reduction from -480 HU to 53 H U in all patients (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of 38 patients with abscess and m etal artifacts on equivalent anatomic levels showed a significantly higher objective and subjective noise reduction for iMAR images (P = 0.005 and P = 0.028). Furthermore, iMAR images were rated superior regarding image quality, artifact reduction, and abscess delineation. Interr ater agreement was excellent for overall image quality ( = .88), artefact reduction ( = .91), and lesion ( = Conclusion: CT image reconstructions mprove image quality and lesion delineation of head/neck abscess in patients with dental hardware.

Khan; Islamabad/ PK (raanakanwal@hotmail.com) Purpose: To assess quality of carot id computed tomographic angiography (CTA) of patients injected with contrast material into their left arms versus patients injected with contr ast material into their right arms. Methods or Background: After IRB approval, a total of 500 consecutive carotid angiography of patients were retrospectivel y examined in the period extending from Jan 2019 to Jun 2021. We randomly selected 250 patients for each right and left arm contrast injection. Patient s with perivenous streak artifacts and contrast material reflux into the vei ns of the neck and upper thorax were included. Images were reviewed on PACS. Relati onships between the injection site and presence of perivenous streak ar tifacts and venous reflux were determined. Results or Findings: Out of 500 patients, 121 (24.2%) were female, where as, 379 (75.8%) were male with a mean age of 55 years. Perivenous streak artefact was seen in 17.7% (89 patients) in right a rm group, whereas left arm patients showed this artefact in 24.1% (121 patient s). Similarly, reflux was reported in both arms with right being 11.5% (58) and left 19.5% (98). Venous reflux into the neck and upper thoracic veins was also more frequent with left arm injections. We found that perivenous streak art efact and reflux were more common in patients who were injected with contrast into left arm as compared to that into right arm. A B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 448 Conclusion: Perivenous beam hardening streak artefacts and veno us reflux could not be prevented with injection. However, pat ients who were injected with contrast material in their right arms showed f ewer artefacts, thus allowing for better quality images on CTA.

Pistoia*, R. Picasso, F. (federicopistoia1@gmail.com) Purpose: Surgical interventions involving the face carry a not high but significant risk of facial vessels iatrogenic lesio ns. Computed tomography angiography is the noninvasive imaging tool general ly employed in preoperative vascular mapping. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution Ultrasound (US) in mapping facial a rtery and facial veins and to identify US-based anatomical landmarks useful to av oid facial vessel iatrogenic lesions. Methods or Background: Facial artery and vein of n=45 healthy volunteers (mean age 33) were scanned using an ultra-high frequency, 8mm footprint, 22- 8MHz hockey stick. The ability of US in studying fa cial artery and the origin of their facial branches and facial veins has been che cked. Furthermore, 4 fixed points have been identified along facial artery and facial vein course which could be potentially used as landmarks in the operative setting to avoid facial vessel iatrogenic lesions. Results or Findings: High-resolution US was able to map facial artery and the origin of its facial branches, and facial vein in all 45 volunteers. The 4 points identified as landmarks demonstrated a statisticall y significant reproducibility (P<0.01) among the healthy volunteers. Conclusion: High-resolution US is suitable to assess and map facial artery and veins. The use of US-based landmarks could potentially reduce the risk of facial vessel iatrogenic lesions. Finally, US enabl es a real-time evaluation in the operative room. Limitations: The study was limited by a small number and low mea n age of the studied population.

We assessed whethe r a combination of multiple diagnostic imaging tests could improve diagnostic performance. Methods or Background: This IRB-approved prospective single-center study enrolled participants presenting with a suspected diagnosis of GCA from December 2014 to October 2017. Participants underwent high-resolution 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), temporal and extr a-cranial arteries ultrasonography (US) and retinal angiography (RA), prior to a temporal artery biopsy (TAB). Diagnostic accuracy of each imaging m odality alone, then a combination of several imaging modalities, was eval uated. Several algorithms were constructed to test optimal combinations using the McNemar test. Results or Findings: Forty five patients (24 women and 21 men, mean age 75.4+/-16 years) were enrolled. 43/45 (96%) patient s had ophthalmological symptoms. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 25/45 ( 56%) patients. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI, US and RA alone were Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative values ranged from 0.95-1 several imaging tests, res pectively. The diagnostic algorithm with the overall best diagnostic performance was the one starting with MRI, followed either by US or RA, with a sensi tivity and specificity of 100 %[CI95% 78-100]. Conclusion: We showed that a combination of several imaging examinations was highly predictive for diagnosing GCA and could be used in daily practice. Limitations: First, the overall number of patients remains low. Second, this study was performed in a tertiary centre specialisi ng in ophthalmological and neurological diseases.

Heikkinen*, V. J. Nurminen, J. Velhon J. Hirvonen; (jaheik4@gmail.com) Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high diagnosti c accuracy in evaluating the extent of disease in odontogenic inf ections. We sought to characterise the prevalence and reliability of MRI findings in these patients and whether MRI can identify the tooth responsible for the infection. Methods or Background: A retrospective cohort study reviewed 106 emergency neck MRI scans of patients with odontogenic infections. We studied whether MRI can accurately identify the abs cess and the underlying infected tooth/teeth and associated bony changes in a blinded multi-reader setting. Also, we correlated various MRI edema patt erns and abscess diameter to clinical results and outcomes, such as the surgi cal approach (intraoral vs. extraoral). Results or Findings: The study included 106 patients with odontogenic infections. Of these, 77 patients (73%) had one or more abscesses. Imaging showed sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0. 95, 0.84, and 0.92, respectively, for MRI diagnosis of an odontogenic abscess. MRI showed bone marrow edema in the majority of patients, and multi -reader assessment showed good reliability. MRI was also able to accur ately predict the causative tooth. Patients without recent dental procedures ha d more severe illnesses. Among imaging findings, mediastinal edema was the s trongest predictor for extraoral surgery. Conclusion: Emergency neck MRI can accurately describe the sour ce and extent of abscess formation in odontogenic infectio ns. These results should increase the utility and reliance of MRI in clinical decision-making. Limitations: This study was retrospective in nature.

Pre-operative early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas could lead to avoiding extensive advanced cancer treatment and overdiagnos is in lung cancer screening programme. Methods or Background: A total of 260 patients with 260 SSNs confirmed with surgically pathologic proof were retrospectively reviewed from February 2016 to March 2020. The study subjects (N=260) were divided into the training cohort (N=195) and the validation cohort (N=65) wit h a ratio of 3:1. In this study, our purpose was to develop and to validate LASSO-derived nomogram integrating clinical-semantic-radiomic features, an d compare the predictive ability with clinical-semantic, semantic, and radiologists' performance. Results or Findings: In the training cohort of 195 SSNs, there were 106 invasive lesions and 89 pre-invasive lesions. We developed a LASSO-derived combined nomogram prediction model based on six pre dictors to predict invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma lesions in SSNs. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded P values of 0.394 and 0.787 in the training and validation cohorts respectively, which indicated good calibration power in this model. Conclusion: In conclusion, this nomogram could help clinicians to identify invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma lesions for guida nce of the personalised medicine and making more informed decisions in SSNs management Limitations: This study had limitations. First, this study was a retrospective study, and only surgically resected SSNs were enrol led. Therefore, the selection bias was inherent to our study design.

Dadnam*; Cardiff/UK Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether high- risk patients who were radiologically diagnosed with community-acquir ed pneumonia (CAP) were having follow-up chest x-ray imaging as per The British Thoracic Society (BTS). Methods or Background: The BTS has published guidelines on high-risk patients having follow-up imaging, particularly those over the age of 50 and smokers are considered high risk for lung cancers m imicking an unresolved pneumonia. The standard practice is that 100% of these patients should have follow-up thoracic imaging to identify infective re solution or not. Data was collected retrospectively on high-risk adult patients radiologically diagnosed with a CAP. The reports of these patients were then reviewed to identify if a radiologist had: made a clear diagnosis of infectiv e changes and/or clearly stated whether follow-up would be advised. These patients' records were then reviewed to see if follow-up imaging had been arranged. Results or Findings: 55 patients were identified with a CAP on CXR. Only 23 (42%) of these had follow-up imaging as per BTS gui delines. Of the 55 identified, 13 had a written report which identifie d both a diagnosis of pneumonia and appropriate advice for follow-up and 11 of those had this arranged (85%). Conclusion: We identified that national standards are not being met, but the results do demonstrate that by having a trained radiologist providing a diagnosis and recommendation leads to a higher inci dence of appropriate follow-up, if not arranged by the hospital then pic ked up by their community physician. This simple modification can lead to greater adherence to national standards and earlier diagnosis of lung cancers and therefore improved patient outcomes.

Zanca\u00b2, K. Carpentier\u00b9, H. El Snoeckx\u00b9; \u00b9Edegem/BE, \u00b2Heverlee/BE Purpose: The research objective was to assess the value of deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) compared to iterative r econstruction (ASIR-V) in terms of lung nodule morphology perception in chest CT. Methods or Background: CT images were acquired using an anthropomorphic chest phantom (Lungman, Kyoto Kagak u) containing 6 spherical, 6 lobulated and 6 spiculated 3D printed solid nodules (volume range 28-392 mm\u00b3) at six dose levels (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 3, 6 mGy). The images were reconstructed with ASIR-V 60% and DLIR (TrueFidelit y high level) at 1.25 mm slice thickness. Images were randomly read by 5 experienced chest radiologists who were asked to score the nodule's i mage quality (IQ) on a five- point scale (1=poor, 5=excellent). Readers were bli nded for dose and reconstruction algorithm. Percent score frequency w as calculated per reconstruction algorithm and dose level. An IQ of 3 was considered diagnostic. Results or Findings: Overall, IQ was higher for TrueFidelity compared to ASIR-V, with 94% of the DLIR cases having an IQ 3, versus 84% for ASIR-V. Spherical nodules had a significant better IQ score compared to lobulated nodules, for both reconstructions (p=0.003). When s tratifying per dose level, the percent frequency of IQ 3 for ASIR-V/DLIR algorithms was: 0.2 chest CT performs equally or better with TrueFidelity compared to ASIR-V, for all nodule types. At very low dose levels (0.2-0.8 mGy) DLIR outperforms ASIR -V, while at higher dose levels (1.5mGy), DLIR and ASIR-V are comparable in terms of nodule perception.

Methods or Background: In this prospective study, standard and low-dose chest CTs (270 mA and 60 mA) and MRI with UTE were used to examine consecutive participants who met ACR appropriatenes s criteria for lung cancer screening with low-dose CT. Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a 5-point visual scoring system by two board-certified radiologists. All nodules were then evaluated in te rms of their lung-RADS classification using each method. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was r ated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and sensitivity was compared by means of McNemar's test. Moreover, weighted kappa statistics were used to determine the agreement of lung-RADS c lassification obtained with each method with standard reference generated from standard-dose CT evaluated by two radiologists who were not included in image analysis session. Results or Findings: 205 participants with 1073 nodules were enrolled. Sensitivity of pulmonary MRI with UTE (sensitivity= 87.9%) was higher CT (sensitivity=87.0%, p=0.004), with no evidence of a difference in figure of merit among them (p=0.25). Agreements for lung-RADS between all modalities and standard B Abstract-based Programme Sunday 450 Conclusion: In a lung cancer screening population, pulmonary MR I with UTE was comparable to standard or low-dose CTs for Lung-RADS classification.

Author Disclosures: Yui: Employee: detection with adjacent slic es: raising hope for early detection and reducing false positives per sc an *S. Lopez*, K. Mannevy, Y. Diascorn, B. ice/FR Purpose: We aim to detect lung nodules a year before actual diagnosis while reducing the number of false positives per scan (FP /scan). Methods or Background: We apply 2D RetinaNet to detect lung nodules integrating adjacent slices on axial axis. Then, we apply a 3D false positive reduction algorithm and merge results. The algorithms had been trained and validated on 888 CT scans from LIDC dataset and tes ted on CT scans of 1198 patients from NLST subset, taken the year of diagnosis and also a year before. We only consider nodules with a diameter below 60mm . Results or Findings: On NLST subset, we of malignant nodules and 79% of benign nodules the year of diagnosis. A year before NLST diagnosis, we detect 93% of already visible maligna nt nodules and 78% of benign nodules. The missed nodules were close to th e mediastinum. In both cases, the number of false positives per sc an is only 6, which is half of the false positive rate in the state of the art art icle (https://www.ersnet.org/ news-and-features/news/artificial-intelligence-diagnose-lung-cancer-a-year- earlier/). The total process takes less than 2 minutes per scan, which could be done in parallel with a radiologist's analysis. Conclusion: Our contextual approach helped to detect all report ed malignant nodules from NLST subset the year of diagnosis and a year before, when they were not near to the mediastinum. The false positiv e rate is half compared with state of the art for a similar sensitivity. Limitations: The missed malignant nodules should be addressed in a separate algorithm to ensure a detection of 100% of malignant nodules. In addition, the algorithm should be tested on a di fferent population and more recent images. Ethics committee approval: Not applicable.

Ebner; Bern/CH Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate the effect of dose reduction on the performance of a deep-learning (DL)-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system regarding pulmonary nodule detection i n a virtual screening scenario. Methods or Background: 68 anthropomorphic chest phantoms were equipped with 329 nodules (150 ground-glass, 179 solid) of four sizes (5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm) and scanned with nine tube voltag e/current combinations. The examinations were analyzed by a commercially av ailable DL-based CAD system. The results were compared by Cochran's Q test or chi-square test. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the i mpact of tube voltage, tube current, nodule size, nodule density and nodule loc alisation. Results or Findings: The combination with the lowest effective dose (E) and unimpaired detection rate was 80kV/50mAs (sensitivi ty: 0.66 mSv). Logist ic regression revealed that tube voltage and current had the greatest impact on the detection rate, while nodule size, density and localisation had no signif icant influence on the software's performance. Conclusion: The optimal tube voltage/current combination propos ed in this study (80kV/50mAs) is comparable to the proposed combinations in similar studies. Tube voltage and tube current have a signi ficant impact on the performance of the DL-based CAD software in pulmonary nodule detection regardless of their size, composition or localisati on. Limitations: The study used chest phantoms instead of actual pat ients (e.g. no influences of background pathologies such as fib rosis, emphysema, pneumonia or pleural effusion). Relatively small gr oup sizes of the different dose combinations. Only perfectly spherical lesions with a homogenous density were used in this study, which do not resem ble the average lung cancer, which may also present as an irregular or part-solid lesion.

In addition, 30 patients who underwent ECG-gated unenh anced and contrast- enhanced coronary CT-angiography with the same PCD- CT without or minimal coronary calcifications were included. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) from PCD-CT data were reconstructed at 55-80keV in 5keV- intervals. We measured fat attenuation in the phantom and EAT attenuation of patients on both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced scans. The FAI of the RCA, LAD, and CX were calculated in patients. Results or Findings: In the phantom, attenuation values of fat increased with keV-level (34% increase for the small size, r=0.98, p<.001; and 22% for the large size, r=0.99, p<.001). Fat attenuation values on 70keV VMI were similar to those measured on EID-CT. In patients, EAT attenuation was significantly lower in unenhanced compared to contrast-enhanced s cans at all keV-levels (p<.05). Significant correlations were found between EAT attenuation (r=0.67, p<.001). Significant correlations were als o found between the FAI and keV-levels for the RCA (r=0.24, behaviour of EAT determined on a PCD-CT indicates a dependency of attenuation on keV-levels and contras t enhancement. 70keV VMI are most appropriate for measuring pericoronary inflammation and yield comparability with polychromatic images. Limitations: Sample size with 30 patients is rather small. We di d not assess the effect of different tube voltages on PCAT attenuation.

We investigated the additive value of EAT volume to coronary plaque quantification and CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) to predict lesion-specific ischaemia. Methods or Background: Patients (n=128, 60.6\u00b110.5 years, 61% male) with suspected CAD who had undergone invasive coronary a ngiography (ICA) and CCTA were retrospectively analysed. EAT volume and plaque measures were derived from CCTA using a semi-automatic software approach, while CT-FFR was calculated using a machine-learning algorithm. The predictive value and discriminatory power of EAT volume, plaque measures , and CT-FFR to identify ischaemic CAD were assessed using invasive FFR as t he reference standard. Results or Findings: Fifty-five of 152 lesions showed ischaemic CAD by invasive FFR. EAT volume, CCTA 50% stenosis, and CT-FFR were significantly different in lesions with and without hemodynamic significance (all p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed predictive value for lesion-specific ischaemia of these parameters: EAT volume (OR 2.93, (OR 4.56, p=0.002), and CT-FFR (OR 6.74, p<0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated incremental discriminatory value with the addition of EAT volume to plaque measures alone (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.62, p<0.05). CT-FFR (AUC 0.89) showed slightly over EAT volum e with plaque measures (AUC 0.84), however, without significant difference (p>0.05). Conclusion: EAT volume is significantly associated with ischaem ic CAD. The combination of EAT volume with plaque quantification demonstrates a predictive value for lesion-specific ischaemia simi lar to that of CT-FFR. Thus, EAT assessment has the potential to improve the the rapeutic management of CAD. Limitations: Retrospective study with a limited number of patients. No follow- up.

RPS 2603-4 Potential role of epicardial adipose tissue as a subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) before and after treatment with anthracyclines in a population of breast cancer (BC ) patients, and in controls not treated with anthracyclines, to detect a potent ial role of EAT density as a biomarker of changes related to chemotherapy cardiotoxicity. Methods or Background: We reviewed BC patients treated with anthracyclines who underwent CT before (CT-t0) and after (CT-t1) chemotherapy, and age- and sex-matched controls who underwent two CT examinations at comparable intervals. On non-contrast scans, EAT was segmented contouring the pericardium and thresholdi ng between -190 and -30 Hounsfield Units (HU), and SAT and VAT with two reg ions of interest with 15- mm diameter thresholded between -195 and -45 HU. Results or Findings: 32 female patients and 32 controls were included. T here were no differences in age (p=0.439) and follow-up duration (p=0.162) between patients and controls. Between CT-t0 and CT -t1, EAT density decreased in BC patients (-66 HU, IQR -71 to -63 HU , versus -71 HU, IQR -75 to -66 HU, p=0.003), while it did not vary in contr ols (p=0.955). SAT density increased from CT-t0 to CT-t1 in BC patients (-107 HU, -100 HU, p=0.014), wher eas it did not change in controls (p=0.477). VAT density did not vary in eit her BC patients (p=0.911) or controls (p=0.627). Conclusion: EAT density appears to be influenced by anthracycli ne treatment for BC, well-known for its cardiotoxicity, shifting towards lower values indicative of a less active metabolism.

T. Huber*, S. C. Gr\u00e4ni, A. Lam, T. Reichlin; Bern/CH (adrian.huber@insel.ch) Purpose: To investigate the predictive value of an increased left atrial enhancing adipose tissue volume fraction (E-EATvf) on cardiac CT to predict 1-year atrial fibrillation recurrence following pul monary vein isolation. Methods or Background: 208 consecutive with pulmonary vein isolation were included. The left atrial epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume was segmented between -15 HU and -195 HU on pre-procedural cardiac CT scans, including a pre-contrast and an arterial phase scan. The left atrial E-EATvf was defined as the ratio of the segmented enhancing left atrial EA T volume in the arterial phase and the total EAT volume in the native phase. Association of a E-EATvf above the mean with 1-year atrial fibrillation recu rrence was analysed based and multivariate model. Results or Findings: Atrial fibrillation recurrence occurred in 76 patients after 1 year (37%). Patients with a left atrial E-EATvf a bove the mean (E-EATvf above 0.33) (Log-Rank p=0.003). In E-EAT vf remained a significant predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence (p=0.01 8) after correction for age, sex, body mass index, left atrial volume, EAT volume and type of atrial fibrillation. Conclusion: An increased left atrial E-EATvf on cardiac CT is a strong predictor of 1-year atrial fibrillation recurrence, independent of age, sex, body mass index, left atrial volume, EAT volume and type of atrial fibrillation.

Methods or Background: Clinically active r-axSpA patients (11 male, 5 female, mean age 38.6\u00b112.0 years) prospectively underwent Na[18F]F PET/MR images of the SIJ (n=16 patients) and the wh ole spine (n=10 patients) at BL and FU. Three independent blinded readers (1 for PET/MRI, 2 for conventional MRI) evaluated all images. Inflammation (bone marrow edema, BME), structural lesions (fat lesions (FL), scleros is, erosions and ankylosis) and Na[18F]F uptake were recorded on the level of acroiliac joint quadrants (SIJ-Q) and vertebral quadrants (VQ). Chi-Square test was applied for comparisons between time points. Results or Findings: Overall, 11 male and 5 female patients (mean age 38.6\u00b112.0 years) were followed up over a mean of 4. 6 (3-6) months. A total of 128 SIJ-Q and 920 VQs were analysed at each timepoi nt. At BL, in th 65.3% with showed decrease of 1 Na[18F]F uptake. In VQ, Na[18F]F uptake was found in 81.5% with sclerosis, 41.9% with FL and 33.7% 53. 3% with FL and sclerosis showed decrease of Na[18F]F uptake. Conclusion: Anti-TNF treatment led to a significant decrease of osteoblastic activity within 4 months, which was most prominent at sites with inflammation. These data support the early anti-inflammatory treatment initiation for prevention of radiographic progression in axSpA. Limitations: No limitations were identified.

Mazini*, M. Dietz, M. V. Dunet; Lausanne/CH (bianca.mazini@chuv.ch) Purpose: Beyond large vessel occlusions, small vessel diseas e (SVD) plays a crucial role in cardiac and brain ischaemia. Howeve r, little is known about potential interrelation between both. We aimed at assessing the interrelation between cardiac and brain SVD by using quantitative Rb-82 cardiac PET/CT and brain MRI. Methods or Background: We retrospectively evaluated 186 patients without cardiac/brain large vessel disease, of whom 29 had pure cardiac SVD and 157 had no cardiac SVD as defined by cardiac perfusion PET/CT and coronarography. All underwent both a cardiac Rb-82 PET/CT and a brain 1.5T or 3T MRI (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Left-ventricle myocardial blood flow (LV-MBF) and flow reserve (LV-MFR) were recorded from Rb-82 PET/CT, while Fazekas score, white matter lesion (W Mab) volume, deep grey matter lesion (GMab) volume, and brain morphometry using the MorphoBox prototype software were derived from T1-/T2-weighte d images. Groups were compared with Kruskal-Wallis test, and the potential interrelation between heart and brain SVD markers was assessed using Spea rman's correlation coefficient. Results or Findings: Compared with healthy controls, patients with cardi ac SVD had lower stress LV-MBF and MFR (p<0.0019) but similar Fazekas scores and WMab volumes (p>0.45). In patients with cardiac SVD, but not in controls, increased rest LV-MBF was left-putamen Z-score reduct p=0.009).

Fathala*; Riyadh/SA Purpose: (FUO) is a diagnostic chall enge. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients who present with FUO. Methods or Background: Overall, 105 consecutive patients (61 men and 44 women) with a mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age of 51 (\u00b1 35) years and a diagnosis of FUO underwent 18FDG PET/CT scans. The value of 18FDG PET/CT in determining the etiology of FUO was asses sed. Results or Findings: PET/CT results were classified into four groups: gr oup 1 comprised patients with true-positive results (n = 51; 49%), in whom abnormal 18FDG uptake identified the final diagnosis; group 2, patients with false- positive results (n = 24; 23%), in whom 18FDG uptak e was not consistent with final diagnosis; group 3, patients with true-negati ve results (n = 10; 9.5%), in whom the 18FDG uptake was normal and no final disease was established; and group 4, patients with false-negative results ( n = 20; 19%), in whom 18FDG uptake was normal and final disease was established. Of the 51 patients with true-positive PET/CT results, 51% had an infection, 35% had malignancies, and 14% had inflammatory processes. T he sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value s, and accuracy were 72%, 29%, 68% and 33%, and 58%, respectively. Conclusion: Our findings show that 18FDG PET/CT contributes to the establishment of the final diagnosis of FUO in many patients (72%). Our results support the use of 18FDG PET/CT in the initial assessment of FUO.

Author Disclosures: Ahmed Fathala: Nothing to disclose RPS 2606-7 Estimation of early therapy effects within the tumo Purpose: The prognosis of cancer is strongly dependent on the immune cell infiltration within the emerging tumour microenviro nment (TME). The protein complex S100A8/S100A9 has been recognised as an ess ential regulator of the TME and is associated with poor overall prognosis. In this study, we evaluated early therapy effects on the TME in syngeneic murine breast cancer via S100A9-specific in-vivo or Murine 4T1 cells were implanted orthotopically in = 43). Tumour size-adapted fl uorescence reflectance imaging was performed 0 conventional chemo- (Doxorubicin, A second in-vivo imaging was performed 5 days after therapy began. Furthermore, early changes of S100A9-activit y after one week under immune checkpoint inhibition (anti-PD-L1, n=7 vs. r at IgG2b as isotype control, n=3) were evaluated. Results were correlated via im munohistochemistry and FACS. Results or Findings: While there were no differences in tumour growth ov er the entire study period (p=0.48), tumours treated w ith Bevacizumab had significantly lower fluorescence intensities (FI) t han tumours under Doxorubicin therapy (2.60 vs. 15.65 AU, p < 0.0001). FI for Dox orubicin were significantly increased as compared to placebo (8.95 AU, p=0.01). Under anti-PD-L1 treatment S100A9 activity significantly decreased c ompared with the control group (224.29 AU and 124.57 AU, p=0.0264). Conclusion: S100A9-specific imaging enables the early detection of therapeutic effects via a visualisation of immune c ell activity in the TME, even before clinically detectable changes in tumour size occur. Therefore, it may serve as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for early therapeutic effects. Limitations: Further experiments are needed for a translational approach.

Overall response was determined based on Lugano cri teria with up to 6 target lesions. The sum of the product of diameters (SPD) was used to represent initial tumour burden and its per cent change over time (depth of response, DoR). Deauville Scores at 3 months were applied as metabolic response parameters. Additional response criteria (RECIL, LY RIC) were applied to compare the overall response status. Results or Findings: 29 patients were included (median age: 64 years, 59% male) with mean baseline SPD of mm^2. Accordi ng to Lugano criteria, 11 patients (38%) had overall progressive disease, 2 patients (7%) a partial response and 16 patients showed a complete response (55%). Discordance in overall response classification was observed when a pplying other response criteria. DoR, Deauville scores, overall response according to RECIL and Lugano criteria at 3 months were each able to strat ify OS (all with p<0.05). Conclusion: Imaging response criteria for lymphoma show conside rable discordance in the context of CAR T-cell therapy. O ur data indicate a potential prognostic value of quantitative imaging parameters for OS stratification, which should be further investigated as novel imaging endpoints. Limitations: Since CAR T-cells represent a new form of therapy, there is a lack of data on long-term follow-up. Ethics committee approval: Ethical committee approval was obtained.

C. I. Hoyer\u00b9, S. Lennartz\u00b9, N. Abdullayev\u00b9, F. F of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis and plaques as well as the image quality of extracr anial carotid arteries between a novel relaxation-enhanced angiography wit hout contrast and triggering (REACT) sequence and contrast-enhanced m agnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS ). Methods or Background: This was a retrospective, single-centre study of 105 consecutive AIS patients (65.3\u00b118.7 years, 42 femal es) who received a stroke protocol at 3T in clinical routine including Compressed SENSE (CS) accelerated (factor 4) flow-independent 3D isotropi c REACT (fixed scan time: 02:46 min) and CS accelerated (factor 6) 3D CE-MRA. Three radiologists assessed scans for the presence of ICA stenosis and plaques (including hyper- /hypointense signal) with concomitant diagnostic co nfidence (DC) using 3-point scales (3=excellent). Vessel quality, artifacts, and image noise of extracranial carotid arteries were rated on 5-point scales (5=ex cellent/none). Results or Findings: REACT achieved a sensitivity of 89.8% and specifici ty of 95.2% for any and of 93.5%/95.8% for clinically rel evant (50%) ICA stenosis while yielding a to CE-MRA comparable DC (mean 2.76\u00b10.45 vs. 2.72\u00b10.49, P=.0305). REACT showed an almost perfect intersequence agreement with CE-MRA regarding the assessment of the disease grad e (Cohen's Kappa of 0.90). Using REACT, readers detected more plaques overall (n=57.3 vs. 47.7, P=.0001) and plaques of hyperintense signal (n=12.3 vs. 5.7, P=.024) with higher DC (2.77\u00b10.47 vs. 2.57\u00b10.66; P <.0001) compared to CE-MRA. Vessel quality of all segments combined (4.61\u00b10.66 vs. 4.58\u00b10.68, P=.0299) and artifacts (4.51\u00b10.70 vs. 4.44\u00b10.73, P>.05) were com parable between the sequences with REACT showing a lower image noise (4.43\u00b10.67 vs. 4.25\u00b10.71, P<.0001). Conclusion: In AIS, REACT provides a high sensitivity and speci ficity for detection of ICA stenosis and an improved depiction of plaques while yielding an equal vessel quality compared to CE-MRA.

Shen*, S. Xia; Tianjin/CN Purpose: The decrease of cerebral blood flow is inevitably accompanied by tissue oedema. The increase in water content of brain tissue is manifested as a prolonged T1 relaxation time. Our purpose was to ev aluate the relative T1 (rT1) value in different ischaemic regions and the relationship between rT1 value and ischaemia in patients with ischaemic stroke use a noninvasive quantitative T1 mapping derived by STAGE . Methods or Background: We restrospectively included eighty-three ischaemic stroke patients undergoing STAGE and DSC- PWI examination from January 2017 to December 2020. The ischaemic core and the hypoperfusion regions were segmented based on the the ADC threshold value less than 620x10-6 mm2/s and the time to max (Tmax) respectiv ely. T1 value were measured in ischaemic and contralateral regions, the rT1 value was caculated from the ratio of T1 value on the ischaemic side to the contralateral side. One sample t-test and GEE were used to account for the change of rT1 value in the different hypoperfusion regions. The relationship b etween the rT1value and time to onset in ischaemic core were assesed. Results or Findings: In all ischaemic regions, the mean rT1 value were different from 1 (P<0.001). GEE results revealed that, with hypo-Tmax>4s as a control, the rT1 value in other hypoperfusion areas increased (Wald X2=24.7, P<0.001). The rT1 value in the ischaemic core was orrelated with the onset time (rs=0.45 P=0.004). Conclusion: T1 mapping based on STAGE may provide valuable data for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of oedema progression in patients with ischaemic stroke. Limitations: The measurement of the severity of hypoperfusion only relies on Tmax, the final tissue state cannot be determined b ecause of lack of follow-up.
