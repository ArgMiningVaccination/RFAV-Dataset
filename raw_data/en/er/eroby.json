Acupuncture can regulate immune function and treat the underlying cause of the disease by reducing symptoms, speeding up the healing of infection and normalising the body's immune response. It works by stimulating specific portions of the autonomic nervous system through selected acupoints, which in turn causes responses in the immune system. Acupuncture can cause a rise in levels of interferon, on of the immune system's messenger hormones. Below you see three points that you can massage at home and they can help with boosting your immune system. Large Intestine 11 - Quchi Location - Large Intestine 11 is located at the end of the crease formed when you bend your arm. It is the outside end of the crease, the point is usually tender on most people. Use the image below to help locate it. This point tonifies the immune system and is effective in treating cold and flus and heat in the body such as fevers and sore throats. Stomach 36 - Leg Three Miles Location - Stomach 36 is located about 4 fingerbreadths below the bottom of your kneecap and directly outside your shin bone (tibia). The point is normally quite large and tender. Massage both the left and right point on each leg at the same time. Stomach 36 is one of the most powerful points for boosting immunity and digestion, making sure you are absorbing all the nutrients you are taking in and stimulating your digestive tract to recover after antibiotics. It really help to build your energy reserves. Lung 7 - Broken Sequence Location - Lung 7 is located about 2 fingerbreadths below your wrist crease on the thumb side. There is a bump that protrudes at this point called the styloid process. The point is located just on the underside of the bone. Lung 7 does not have as much of a tender sensation as the other 2 points so don't worry if you don't feel as much. The point really helps to strengthen your bodies resistance and it is especially effective in the early stages of infection including chills, fever, congestion, sore throat and coughs. How and when to stimulate the points? These points boost the immune system and improve digestion so you have a better chance of absorbing all the nutrients you are taking in. You can stimulate the points both morning and evening. You should put pressure on the points for about 10 seconds and then release for 10 seconds and repeat this 5 or 6 times, this way you are spending roughly 2 minutes on each point. You want to use enough pressure with your thumb or index finger that it feels slightly uncomfortable but not so much that it is painful. Good luck and let us know if you have any questions.
