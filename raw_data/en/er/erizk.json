These answers to frequently asked questions about bullying based on information from the American Academy of Pediatrics and <a href=\"https://www.stopbullying.gov/\">Stopbullying.gov</a> should help parents and children better understand this unwelcome, destructive behavior. </p> <p><strong>What is bullying?</strong></p> <p>Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged children that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power. The behavior is also repeated, or has the potential to be repeated. </p> <p><strong>What are the types of bullying?</strong></p> <p>There are a number of different types of bullying:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Verbal.</strong> Saying or mean <ul> <li>Leaving out someone on purpose</li> <li>Telling other children not to be friends with someone</li> about someone</li> gestures</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Cyberbullying.</strong> Takes place in digital media through text, apps, email or online social media/gaming sites. Cyberbullying is unique in that it may be persistent, permanent and hard to notice and can harm everyone involved. Some cyberbullying is unlawful or criminal, but laws and policies differ in each state. This form of bullying may include: <ul> <li>Sending, posting or sharing negative, harmful, false or mean content about someone else</li> <li>Sharing personal or private information, causing embarrassment or humiliation</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>What roles do kids play in bullying?</strong></p> <p>Kids play various roles in bullying. Understanding these roles can help adults address and prevent bullying behaviors. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Kids who bully.</strong> These children engage in bullying behavior toward their peers and require support to change this behavior and address any other challenges that may be influencing it. </li> <li><strong>Kids who are bullied.</strong> These children are the targets of bullying behavior and may require help learning strategies to respond to it. </li> <li><strong>Kids who assist.</strong> These children may not start the bullying or lead it, but they serve as an \"assistant\" to children who are bullying. They may encourage the behavior and occasionally join in. </li> <li><strong>Kids who reinforce.</strong> These children aren't directly involved in the bullying behavior, but they provide an audience. They often laugh or give support to the bullies. This may encourage it to continue. </li> <li><strong>Outsiders. </strong>These children remain separate from the bullying. They neither reinforce the bullying nor defend the child being bullied. Some may watch what is going on, but don't provide feedback to indicate they're on anyone's side. Just providing an audience may encourage the bullying behavior. These kids often want to help, but don't know how and need to learn how to be more than a bystander. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What are the effects of bullying?</strong></p> <p>Bullying can affect everyone \u2014 those who are bullied, those who bully and those who witness it. Bullying is linked to negative health outcomes, including mental health issues, physical symptoms and/or impaired school performance. </p> <p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p> <p>Parents, school staff and other adults in the community can help kids prevent bullying by talking about it, building a safe school environment and creating a community-wide bullying prevention strategy. </p> <p>When adults respond quickly and consistently to bullying, they send the message that it's not acceptable.

Reassure the kids involved, including bystanders. </li> <li>Model respectful behavior when you intervene. </li> </ul> some common mistakes to avoid: </p> <ul> <li>Don't ignore bullying and think kids can work it out without adult help. </li> <li>Don't immediately try to sort out the facts. </li> <li>Don't force other kids to say publicly what they saw. </li> <li>Don't question the children involved together, only separately. </li> <li>Don't make the kids involved apologize or patch up relationships on the spot. </li> </ul> <p>Seek help from law enforcement or medical staff if: </p> <ul> <li>A weapon is involved </li> <li>There are of serious physical injury</li> <li>There are threats of hate-motivated violence, such as racism or homophobia </li> <li>There is serious physical harm</li> <li>There is sexual abuse</li> <li>Anyone is accused of an illegal act, such as robbery or extortion \u2014 using force to get money, property or services</li> </ul> <p>Cyberbullying may require different strategies than in-person bullying, remember to: </p> <ul> <li>Honor minimum age requirements for site use or creating a profile to make sure you're not sending mixed messages about online safety by falsifying ages. </li> <li>Openly communicate with your children/adolescents about their online use. </li> <li>Become educated and proficient in the technologies your children/adolescents are using. </li> <li>Create an online-use plan at regular family meetings to discuss online topics, and check privacy settings and profiles for inappropriate posts.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHome Physical Activity OptionsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Christina Chen5 tips to gain control the U.S. population suffers from some form of chronic pain, which can cause distress, limit daily activities and lead to debility. This is seen more often in older adults, where health issues, such as degenerative joint disease and diabetes, may cause additional pain and neuropathy. Living with longstanding pain can be frustrating, affecting our moods, relationships, stress and quality of life. </p> <p>Successful management of chronic pain is a multifaceted process, much of which is influenced by our ability to realign our lives in a meaningful direction, despite physical limitations. These five lifestyle tips can help you gain control of chronic pain: </p> <p><strong>Develop healthy sleep habits</strong></p> <p>Sleep deprivation can worsen the pain experience. This often becomes a vicious cycle with uncontrolled pain leading to poor sleep quality and quantity, which in turn leads to more pain. Solving chronic insomnia can involve working closely with your doctor to understand your barriers to falling asleep \u2014 and staying asleep. </p> <p>There are many creative strategies to helping you regain restorative sleep. One excellent resource is the book, <em>No More Sleepless Nights</em> by Peter Hauri, that may help you better understand how to achieve restful sleep. </p> <p><strong>Stay active and find creative ways to do the things you love</strong></p> <p>It's hard to imagine staying active when you're in so much pain. This is how people become trapped in a cycle of decline. Don't let your pain affect your joy in day-to-day activities. If you like biking, you can continue to do so, but maybe for a shorter time. If you love arts and crafts but can no longer do them, consider teaching them to others. If exercise is painful for your joints, try water exercise instead. Exercising is known to boost pain relief with natural endorphins and also helps strengthen muscles to prevent reinjury and further pain. </p> <p><strong>Reduce stress and anxiety</strong></p> <p>Stress intensifies the pain experience. Negative perceptions from depression, anxiety, stress and anger can increase sensitivity to pain. Explore techniques to promote stress reduction and relaxation. Remove yourself from conditions that are adding to your stress. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family. Look into support groups with people who can identify with you. Be encouraged that there are always manageable ways to redirect your situation. </p> <p><strong>Incorporate focused physical therapy</strong></p> <p>Physical therapy can be helpful if there are recurring problem areas such as back, neck and joint pain. Our skeleton is aligned in such a way to support the weight of the entire body. Injuries lead to a disruption of the support provided by bones, tendons, ligaments and nerves. Focused therapies directed by a trained physical therapist can provide great guidance in rehabilitation, strength and resilience training to rebuild those crucial support structures. Exercises from your physical therapist can be incorporated into your daily schedule. </p> <p><strong>Alternative and integrative medicine options</strong></p> <p>There are many integrative practices that have been shown to reduce pain. These are safe alternatives that don't add potentially harmful medications to your current regimen. Acupuncture, massage therapy, medication, biofeedback mechanisms and numerous mind-body techniques can be done daily to improve your pain experience and regain control of your body. </p> <p><em><a a geriatrician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM). </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/elderly/ech_chronicpain_01_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=A80323E6051C0EAC91F5B71EB5D05109\" alt=\"ECH_ChronicPain_01_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />A combination of approaches can lead to successful chronic pain management. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonChronic Pain TipsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson hit the stores for back-to-school shopping, a new backpack often tops the list. But there's more to look for in a backpack than fun graphics or trendy colors. </p> <p>Keep these tips in mind to minimize stress and strain on your child's body: </p> <p><strong>Consider backpack basics. </strong></p> and has:</p> <ul> <li>Wide, padded shoulder straps. Narrow straps can dig into shoulders, causing pain and restricting circulation. </li> <li>Two shoulder straps. Single, cross-body straps can't distribute the weight evenly. </li> <li>A padded back to protect against sharp edges of objects inside the pack and increase comfort. </li> <li>A waist strap to distribute the weight of a heavy load more evenly. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Bigger is not better. </strong></p> <p>The upside of a big backpack is that there's lots of room for stuff. The downside is there's lots of room for stuff. And that stuff can overload a child. </p> <p>Everyone has seen tiny kids bent forward under the weight of a backpack that's too large. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says that ideally a filled backpack should not exceed 15%-20% of a child's body weight. In addition to causing back and shoulder pain, a backpack that's too heavy can put a child off balance, such as when going up or down stairs. </p> <p><strong>Check the fit.</strong></p> <p>Adjust shoulder straps and tighten the waist strap so the backpack lies close to the body and holds the pack 2 inches above the waist. </p> <p><strong>Wear it correctly.</strong></p> <p>Always use both shoulder straps, since slinging it over one shoulder can cause muscle strain. </p> <p><strong>Organize.</strong></p> <p>Use all the compartments to distribute weight and make things easier to find. Put heavier items, such as books and water bottles, close to the center of the child's back. </p> <p><strong>Other good ideas. </strong></p> <p>Kids should stop at their school locker often, if possible, so they don't have to carry all the books needed for a day. When bending down, kids should use their knees and not bend at the waist. Consider a rolling backpack, if the school allows them, but be aware this could present a tripping hazard for your child or others. </p> <p><strong>Don't ignore symptoms.</strong></p> <p>Parents, don't ignore your child's complaints about back or shoulder pain, which may be caused by a backpack that's too heavy or improper form in carrying it.

That's because, in the life course of individuals, these two forces are often closely related. </p> <p>Spirituality has been described as <em>\"the quality of being concerned with the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things.\"</em> On the other hand, medical care falls in the realm of science, defined as <em>\"the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.\"</em></p> <p>While these two concepts appear to be on the opposite ends of a spectrum, they often reside side-by-side within the person, and can influence each other deeply. </p> <p>In many religious traditions, spirituality informs almost all aspects of people's lives. Faith and religious beliefs have a strong role in life and death, illness and healing. For instance, illness may be perceived as being present because it was allowed by God. The health care provider (or science), is being simply the \"vessel\" He uses for healing. In this way, spirituality and health care are two forces with the single goal of healing the patient. </p> <p>Some religious stipulations that patients observe, such as periods of fasting, may require that providers adjust medications, or postpone tests and appointments for a few weeks. Providers can be partners and advocates for their patients during this time, which helps strengthen the patient-provider relationship. </p> <p>It's important that your provider is aware of the role spirituality plays in your life, so please talk this over with them. This awareness can help guide your medical care and support your healing. </p> <p>Recognizing this link between spirituality, health and healing, allows providers to treat the whole person, with their multiple dimensions \u2014 physical, cognitive, psychological, emotional, social and spiritual. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jane-njeru-mbchb/\">Dr. Jane Njeru</a> is a general internist in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

By optimizing your health you can help prevent eye diseases, including: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Macular degeneration.</strong> Thinning of the macula, which is part of the retina responsible for clear vision in your direct line of sight, causes loss of this central vision. </li> <li><strong>Cataracts.</strong> The lens in the eye becomes cloudy, leading to blurry or double-vision, light sensitivity and loss of night vision. </li> <li><strong>Glaucoma.</strong> Abnormally high pressure in the eye damages the optic nerve. </li> <li><strong>Diabetic retinopathy.</strong> Uncontrolled high blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels in the retina and eventually lead to blindness. </li> </ul> <p>Foster good health throughout your life <ul> <li><strong>Not smoking.</strong> Smoking \u2014 and even second-hand smoke \u2014 can increase your risk for major eye disorders, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma and cataracts. </li> <li><strong>Eating a healthy diet.</strong> A diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, shellfish, fatty fish like salmon, and whole grains provides the nutrients that promote eye health. And that includes carrots (Vitamin A)!</li> <li><strong>Shielding them from the sun.</strong> The sun's UV rays can damage your eyes, leading to cataracts and macular degeneration.

It could become a new holiday tradition. </li> <li><strong>Be mindful of what you eat. </strong><br /> Go for quality, not quantity. Think about what you plan to eat before a meal or celebration. Make smart choices. If you take a bite and it's not what you like or expected, leave it on your plate. </li> <li><strong>Keep moving. </strong><br /> Don't become a couch potato.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHoliday Eating TipsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Jill SwansonKeeping farm can be so much fun for kids, whether they live there or are a visiting friend, grandchild or school group. Farms are a great place for adventure and learning. But farms are dangerous places, too, putting kids at risk for injuries and even death from encounters with animals, equipment and just being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p> <p>Here are just a few facts and figures to bring home the danger kids face on the farm:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>About 900,000 youth lived on farms and nearly 24 million visited farms in 2014.</li> <li>Every day, about 33 children are injured in agriculture-related incidents.</li> <li>Animals are the leading cause of injury.</li> <li>Every three days, a child dies in a farm-related incident.</li> <li>The leading causes of these deaths involve machinery (25%), motor vehicles, including ATVs (17%) and 16% were drownings.</li> <li>For youth who work on a farm, tractors were the main cause of death, followed by ATVs.</li> </ul> <p>Harvest is getting underway, shifting activity on the farm into high gear and increasing the risk of accidents and injuries. Many of the accidental injuries involving farm implements result in long-term disabilities like infections, amputation of extremities, loss of function, and tragically, death. Children are curious, and to them, the farm is a great big playground full of things to explore. But they don't recognize or understand the risks or remember the rules for situations that may arise.</p> <p>With these quick tips, the farm can be a safer place for kids to live, work and play:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Build a safe play area away from the action in the farmyard.</li> <li>Fence areas with water and where animals are held.</li> <li>Install fall protection in haylofts</li> <li>Keep your eyes open! Children move fast, they're small and hard to see when driving farm equipment and vehicles.</li> <li>Keep kids away from and out of tractors. This includes letting them ride in the cab! </li> <li>Fit the job to the child's age, understanding and abilities when assigning chores.</li> <li>Make wearing personal protective equipment a habit for kids doing farm work.</li> <li>Know when your child is capable of safely driving a tractor or ATV. There's NO evidence that children under 12 can safely operate an ATV, which, because of their design, can be more challenging than driving a car.</li> <li>Don't mix your worksite with child care. It's hard to keep a close eye on children when you're focusing on your farm work.</li> <li>Supervise children around farm animals, including horses. They're big, strong and unpredictable, and kids can get stepped on kicked, crushed, bitten, head butted or thrown. Even if the animals are seen as gentle, family pets, they're still unpredictable animals.</li> <li>Create a list of farm rules that school groups and other visitors must follow.</li> </ul> <p>With Fall comes the opportunity to go to pumpkin patches, apple orchards, corn mazes and other great fun and educational activities. If you visit a farm with your family or your children go with a group or as a guest, remember it's your responsibility to supervise them and stress that they follow any rules the farm family may have and to listen to instructions from any adults.</p> <p>Living and working on a farm or just visiting is a wonderful experience for kids.

Several systems in your body contribute to maintaining good balance. Your vision, inner ear and joint receptors provide a sense of where your body is in space. Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults. Fear of falling is also common, but building balance skills at any age can reduce fall risk. </p> <p><strong>Working balance training into your workout</strong></p> <p>Balance training is an essential aspect of any well-rounded fitness routine. It improves your body's ability to react quickly to everyday missteps. Incorporating balance training in your life can significantly reduce risk of falls, help maintain independence and may significantly improve performance. </p> <p>Unfortunately, depending on your exercise routine, it's often skipped or forgotten. The great news is that with a few simple exercises, balance training can easily be incorporated into your cardiovascular and resistance training sessions. </p> <p>Exercises such as step ups, lunge clocks, side walks and single-leg dead lifts all challenge your balance while building strength. Try a trail run, jumping rope or side-to-side jumps to work on balance during a cardio session. </p> <p><strong>Just getting started? Try these tips</strong></p> <p>Balance training outside your regular workouts can be easy and fun. Aim to incorporate balance exercises tailored to your skill level into your daily activities for at least a few minutes each day. Remember safety first, you should be challenged, but not to the point that it's difficult to perform the exercises safely. You may want to start your balance exercises with a partner or by having a counter or chair back nearby for extra security. </p> <p><strong>When getting started, give these tips a try:</strong></p> <p><strong>Change your base of support</strong></p> <p>Start by standing with your feet close together and walk by putting one foot directly in front of the other, working your way up to balancing on one leg. </p> <ul> <li>Pretend you're on a balance beam. This will require you to stand with your feet closer together and to walk by putting one foot directly in front of the other. </li> <li>Pretend you're a flamingo. This will help you practice balancing on one foot and can be done while making dinner, watching the news or waiting for your coffee to brew. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Change the surface</strong></p> <p>While many of us are used to standing on flat ground, part of balance training is learning to stand on uneven surfaces, try doing your exercises on different surfaces including: </p> stable) or up (less stable)</li> </ul> <p>Try standing with your feet close together or on one leg, if you're able. You also can look for variable terrain to walk on, such as a hiking trail or sandy beach. Standing on a floating dock or bridge can be a fun challenge. </p> <p><strong>Close your eyes</strong></p> <p>Closing your eyes while balancing can be tricky, but it's a good exercise to work up to. Try closing your eyes while standing with your feet together, pretending to walk on a balance beam, balancing on one leg or walking on a varying surface. You may need to rely on a partner for support. </p> <p><strong>Turn your head or look up and down</strong></p> <p>While engaging in the foot and leg positions previously described, turn your head or look up and down. You also can try this while balancing on an unstable surface. If you feel up to the challenge, try both at the same time while closing your eyes. </p> <p><strong>Add movement elsewhere</strong></p> <p>While standing on one leg, put your arms out in a \"T\" position. Make circular motions for 30 seconds, and then try it in the opposite direction. Work your way up to increase your time. Try simultaneously turning your head side to side once this becomes easy. </p> <p><strong>More tips for preventing falls</strong> </p> <p>Balance training is an excellent way to stay steady, upright and avoid falls. Some other tips for preventing falls include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Keep moving.</strong> Physical activity can go a long way toward fall prevention. Consider activities such as walking, water workouts or tai chi. </li> <li><strong>Wear sensible shoes.</strong> Consider changing your footwear as part of your fall-prevention plan. High heels, floppy slippers and shoes with slick soles can make you slip, stumble and fall. So can walking in your stocking feet. Instead, wear properly fitting, sturdy shoes with nonskid soles. </li> <li><strong>Take a look around your home.</strong> Remove throw rungs, electrical or phone cords from walkways, and move furniture that narrows walking paths to eliminate tripping hazards. Consider a nonslip mat in your bathtub or shower. </li> <li><strong>Keep your home brightly lit</strong> to avoid tripping on hard-to-see objects. Place a night light in your bedroom, bathroom and hallways.</li> <li><strong>Try a balance class.</strong> Classes designed to challenge and enhance your balance include tai chi, Pilates or yoga. Balance classes are offered at some facilities. </li> </ul> <em>Danielle Johnson, MPT, is a wellness physical therapist at the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program in Rochester, Minn.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonMask On Mask UpPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Allison Ducharme-Smith, M.D.Answers is full of ads and recommendations for you to buy and take fish oil supplements to cure a list of health worries. But, are fish oil supplements really what you need? </p> <p><strong>What is fish oil?</strong></p> <p>Fish oil is the fat, or oil, that comes from fish tissue. The reason you hear so much about it is because it is loaded with beneficial omega-3 fatty make these omega-3 fatty acids, so you must get them from food or supplements. </p> <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are important for your muscles, specifically your heart muscle. They can reduce the risk of heart attacks; high cholesterol, particularly triglycerides; and high blood pressure. But more than that, omega-3 fatty acids play a role in brain function and inflammation. Being deficient in omega-3 fatty acids has shown to be associated with issues including cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression and Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p><strong>Should you go and buy a bunch of fish oil supplements?</strong></p> <p>While it's known that omega-3 fatty acids are good for you and being deficient is bad, taking high doses of fish oil supplements does not necessarily correlate to better health. In large studies examining the effects of fish oil supplements on health, the evidence was mixed. </p> <p>These supplements did not appear to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, or heart-related deaths in men and women. Moreover, there were some side effects, including bad breath and heartburn, and at high doses, an increased risk of bleeding. However, looking deeper, several specific groups benefited from fish oil supplements, and the exact dose of the supplement seemed to matter, as well. </p> <p><strong>Who benefits from taking fish oil supplements?</strong></p> <p>As studies have shown, it is not a one-size-fits-all scenario. These studies showed that these specific groups may benefit from daily fish oil supplements:</p> <ul> <li>Patients who eat less than 1.5 servings of fish a week or don't eat any fish. </li> <li>African American patients. </li> <li>Patients with high triglyceride levels, that is those patients whose triglyceride level is greater than 200 milligrams per deciliter. </li> </ul> <p><strong>If you are a member of one of the groups that benefits from fish oil supplements, how much should you take and when should you take it?</strong></p> <p>The American Heart Association recommends that those who might benefit from fish oil supplements should take 1 gram per day of EPA plus DHA. Preferably this should come from consuming oily fish, but supplements can be considered. For patients with high triglycerides in particular, the American Heart Association concludes that a prescription fish oil supplement of 4 grams per day of EPA, or EPA + DHA, can be used to lower triglyceride levels. </p> <p>It is recommended to take the supplement prior to your largest meal of the day if you can, as doing so will help mitigate the rise in triglycerides that occurs with the largest meal. As always, consult with your health care provider before starting a fish oil supplement. </p> <p><strong>What else can you do to lower your risk of heart disease?</strong></p> <p>The best thing you can do to lower your risk of heart disease is lead a healthy lifestyle and consume a healthy diet. This means not smoking, eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and getting moderate exercise for at least 150 minutes a week. </p> <p>If you are a healthy person and at low or average risk for heart disease, you should eat at least two servings a week of fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna or herring. It is better to eat your omega-3 fatty acids in food rather than a supplement. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/allison-ducharme-smith-md/\">Allison Ducharme-Smith, M.D.</a>, is an internal medicine physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine, she practices at Mayo Family Clinic Northeast in Rochester.

If you're scheduled for orthopedic surgery, you can help reduce your own risk of infection. Your orthopedic health care team also makes every effort to prevent infection by following Mayo Clinic's and the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) best practice care guidelines before, during and after surgery. </p> <p><strong>What to do before surgery</strong></p> <p>Your surgeon may advise you to attend a pre-surgery class where you'll learn about measures to prevent infection, including: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Staying healthy!</strong> Work with your health care team to make sure your health is the best it can be before surgery. this is particularly relevant in cases of: <br> <ul> <li><strong>Obesity.</strong> Extra body weight increases the risk of infection.</li> <li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Infection risk is increased, particularly with poorly controlled diabetes, reflected in high hemoglobin A1C levels. </li> <li><strong>Malnutrition.</strong> Individuals at higher infection risk include those with metabolic conditions or after gastric bypass surgery. </li> <li><strong>Recurrent infections.</strong> Chronic urinary tract infections are the most </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>If you smoke, try to stop.</strong> Smoking inhibits healing and increases the risk of infection. Your health care team may recommend postponing your surgery until you haven't been smoking for several weeks. You shouldn't smoke during your recovery, either. Blood work may be used to confirm that you're off nicotine products. </li> <li><strong>Reduce bacteria in your body.</strong> The night before and the morning of surgery, you'll use a special soap to thoroughly wash off bacteria regularly found on your skin. Before shoulder surgery, you may also need to wash with benzoyl peroxidase, which is particularly effective at clearing <em>Cutibacterium acnes</em>, a bacteria present on the chest, back and armpit. You may carry staphylococcus in your nose; an antiseptic solution may be used to decontaminate it just before surgery. </li> <li><strong>Taking a medication break.</strong> You may be asked to take a break from certain medications before, during and after surgery. These can include blood thinners, anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressive medications. Talk to your health care team before taking a break from any of your medications. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Antibiotics during surgery</strong></p> <p>Your health care team will administer antibiotics through an intravenous line in the operating room right before surgery begins and again at the end, and two more times afterward. The most common antibiotic is cefazolin; vancomycin is added for those at risk for certain infections. If you're allergic to either of these antibiotics, your team will select alternatives. Many other precautions will be observed during surgery, including adequate sterile technique and limited traffic in the operating room. </p> <p><strong>Precautions after surgery</strong></p> <p>If you've had to follow these precautions:</p> <ul> <li>Delay elective high-risk dental procedures, elective gastrointestinal endoscopy and high-risk urologic procedures for at least six months after the procedure. </li> <li>If you develop active dental problems, they need to be evaluated and treated immediately. </li> <li>You should receive antibiotics one hour before dental work for the first year after surgery. </li> <li>If you're undergoing certain high-risk urologic procedures, you'll be given antibiotics one hour before the procedure for the first year after joint replacement. </li> </ul> <p>Preventing infection is of the utmost importance when considering orthopedic surgery. Improving your general health, avoiding nicotine products, and washing off bacteria from your skin and nose will help. Your surgical team will let you know when antibiotics are needed, as well. </p> <p><em>Lori McGowan, PA-C, has worked in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery since 2010.

One in eight women will develop breast cancer over the course of their lifetime (by about age 80), according to the Centers for Disease Control. </p> <p><strong>What are the screening options for breast cancer?</strong></p> <p>Mammograms are basically x-rays of the breast, with or without tomosynthesis (3D imaging), and remain the mainstay of breast cancer screening. The purpose of mammography is to detect whether there are abnormal collections of calcium that could indicate breast cancer before a lump can be felt. Mammograms also reveal breast density. Increased density, typically density C and D, is associated with increased risk of breast cancer. </p> <p>In general, recommendations say average-risk women should begin having mammograms at age 40. If you receive your primary care in Rochester or Kasson, you can schedule one kind of breast-screening examination, so it's important to talk with your provider about the options for screening and whether you're at average or increased risk. Together, you can make a choice that suits your situation best. Keep in mind that these options don't replace regular screening mammograms:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI),</strong> a supplemental breast cancer screening test, doesn't replace mammograms, but an injected dye \"sees\" through dense breasts. MBI can also be used when there is a breast problem that needs further evaluation or if the patient is at high risk of breast cancer and needs specialized screening. </li> <li><strong>Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</strong> is used in addition to a mammogram for women at a high risk of breast cancer, including greater than 20% lifetime risk, having a strong family history, certain genetic mutations or being treated with chest radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma before the age of 30. </li> <li><strong>Automated whole-breast ultrasound (ABUS)</strong> is another tool for screening women with dense breasts. It uses sound waves to see through the breast. This test has a high false-positive rate and isn't currently offered at Mayo Clinic. </li> <li><strong>Thermography</strong> uses infrared technology to record different temperatures on the surface of the skin. Thermography is <strong>NOT</strong> approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for breast cancer screening because it detects only about half of breast cancers. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Can I do anything to decrease my risk of breast cancer?</strong></p> <p>The good news is the answer to that question is \"yes\"! There are things that you can do to decrease the risk of breast cancer. </p> <ul> <li>We know that, especially for women who have gone through menopause, being at a healthy body weight decreases the risk of breast cancer. </li> <li>Regular aerobic exercise, 30 minutes at least five days per week, can lower the risk of breast cancer by 10-20%. </li> <li>Alcohol is also known to increase the risk of cancer, and women who have two to three beverages per day have a 20% higher risk than women who don't drink alcohol. </li> <li>Studies have NOT shown increased risk of breast cancer by wearing bras, drinking caffeine, or an Internal Medicine physician in the Division of General Internal Medicine. She spends a majority of her time in the Breast Clinic and has a special interest in breast cancer prevention and women at a high risk of breast cancer. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/randomimages/ech_breastcancer_01_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=7A36B4F005683077312A999370DA5D2B\" alt=\"ECH_BreastCancer_01_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month.

It's so frustrating! Whether you call them zits, pimples, blackheads, whiteheads \u2014 they are all a form of acne. </p> <p>Acne is a skin condition caused by hair follicles becoming plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It can appear on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders. Unfortunately, they heal slowly and just when one begins to go away, others crop up. </p> <p>Here are 10 tips for coping with acne and helping minimize the severity and duration of outbreaks:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Be kind to your skin.</strong> Whether you're experiencing an outbreak or not, use a gentle facial cleanser and avoid scrubs, astringents and masks, as well as excessive washing and scrubbing. </li> <li><strong>Keep your hair and body clean.</strong> Use shampoo every day, especially if your hair is oily, you wear a hat or helmet during sports or exercise, or you have problems with acne around your hairline. Shower after activities that make you sweat. </li> <li><strong>Treat acne early.</strong> It's easier to deal with a few pimples than a full breakout. </li> <li><strong>Use over-the-counter (OTC) acne cleansers.</strong> Look for ones that contain topical benzoyl peroxide as the main ingredient. Apply with your fingertips and rinse with warm water. </li> <li><strong>After washing, treat with a topical product.</strong> Ones containing adapalene help unclog pores and prevent new outbreaks. Be sure to use any OTC product according to the directions. More is not better and may cause side effects. </li> <li><strong>Parents, remind your teen to use their acne treatment, but don't nag.</strong></li> <li><strong>Don't pick at your zits.</strong> It can make the breakout worse and cause scarring. </li> <li><strong>Protect your skin from the sun.</strong> Sun exposure can make acne worse, and some medications make skin more susceptible to sunburn. Choose a sunscreen formulated for faces to avoid making acne worse. </li> <li><strong>Be aware of items that cause friction or pressure.</strong> These include phones, helmets, backpacks, tight collars and straps. </li> <li><strong>Manage your stress.</strong> </ol> <p>If self-care doesn't clear up your acne, see your primary care provider. They can prescribe stronger medications and determine if you may need to seek specialized care. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/marcie-billings-md\">Dr. Marcie Billings</a> is division chair of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM) within Employee and Community Health (ECH).

One in 70 women will develop ovarian cancer. The typical age of diagnosis is between 55 and 65. Ovarian cancer is most often diagnosed in the later stages, and it's associated with vague symptoms. </p> <p> Indigestion.</li> <li> Anorexia (loss of appetite). </li> <li> Feeling full after eating a small amount of food. </li> <li> Weight <li> Fatigue. swelling. </li> </ul> <p> The risk for developing ovarian cancer is associated with several factors. The most common factor is advancing age. Women with a history of infertility and infertility treatment (assisted reproductive technology), endometriosis and postmenopausal hormone therapy are at a slightly increased risk. Women at the greatest risk are those with known heritable genetic conditions, including the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 breast cancer genes and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, also known as Lynch syndrome. </p> <p> The risk for ovarian cancer increases three to six times for women with: </p> <ul> <li> A diagnosis of premenopausal breast cancer under 40. </li> <li> A diagnosis of breast cancer under 50. </li> <li> A close relative grandparent, parent, sibling or child with breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age. </li> <li> A first-degree relative mother, sister or daughter with ovarian cancer.</li> <li> A family history of breast cancer under 50 in two or more close relatives. </li> <li> A family history of ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age. </li> <li> Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. </li> </ul> <p> No guidelines for ovarian cancer screening are available for the general population. To reduce their risk, most women simply need to follow a healthy lifestyle and recommended wellness principles: </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Weight</strong> <br /> Achieve and maintain a normal body weight with a body mass index of 19-24. </li> <li> <strong>Exercise</strong> <br /> Take part in 30 minutes or more of a moderate intensity activity five to seven days per week, with 10,000 steps per day. </li> <li> <strong>Diet</strong> <br /> Consume a low-fat diet that with minimal processed food. </li> <li> <strong>Sleep</strong> <br /> Aim for seven to sleep per night. </li> <li> <strong>Stress</strong> <br /> Take time </li> <li> <strong>Substance exposure</strong> <br /> Stop all use of tobacco products, avoid or stop vaping, avoid or stop drug use, and consume little to no alcohol. </li> </ul> <p> For women with an increased risk, a heritable genetic conditions consult and testing are the first steps. For women with the aforementioned heritable genetic conditions, individualized screening may include laboratory testing for CA-125, which looks for certain proteins in your blood, and a pelvic ultrasound. Other recommendations for procedures that reduce risk include surgical removal of the uterus, one or both breasts, one or both ovaries, and/or one or both fallopian tubes. </p> <p> Body self-awareness is key to maintenance of good health.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonINR TestingPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson is head of the Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group. He has spent the past 40 years studying vaccines, their development and use to prevent disease. He has been the chair or member of every committee at the federal level involved with vaccine decision-making. </p> <p>He recently gave a virtual presentation to provide an update on COVID-19, what is known about the virus, how containment of the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing, and the role of vaccinations for adults and children. A lot of misinformation is circulating about COVID-19 vaccines. Dr. Poland cleared the air to ensure everyone had correct facts. He also addressed misunderstandings and misinterpretations. </p> <p>Here is a brief summary of his presentation:</p> <p><strong>Facts about the pandemic</strong></p> <ul> <li>No one thing will end the COVID-19 pandemic. People will continue to need to wash their hands, maintain distance from others, avoid being around those who are sick or exposing others when they are, wear a mask at times, and get vaccinated for COVID-19. </li> <li>Hospitals are full. Even though these facilities have protective gear for doctors, nurses and others who work there, hospital personnel are getting tired, and more staff are needed in hospitals. </li> <li>Children are getting sick. In September, 250,000 became ill with COVID-19, and some of them died. </li> <li>Those who choose not to get vaccinated for COVID-19 are much more likely to become serious ill, be hospitalized, and die of COVID-19 than those who get vaccinated. </li> <li>The new delta variant is much more contagious than the original alpha version of COVID-19. One sick person can spread the infection to up to six to eight other people. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Facts about the vaccine</strong></p> <ul> <li>No vaccine in history has ever been studied as much as the COVID-19 vaccines. </li> <li>Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has full Food and Drug Administration approval now, not just emergency use authorization. </li> <li>Vaccines do best in blocking COVID-19. They are less effective at blocking infection. While you can get infected with COVID-19, you generally do not get seriously ill, and it decreases your risk of dying from COVID-19. </li> <li>Every vaccine has side effects, but if you balance the benefits of getting vaccinated with COVID-19 against the side effects, the benefits outweigh the generally mild side effects. </li> </ul> <p>The bottom line is that everyone is in this together, and the only way to end this pandemic is for everyone to do his or her part. While people can exercise their freedom to choose whether to be vaccinated, they are choosing not only for themselves, but for others. Unvaccinated people continue to be sources of infections, allowing COVID-19 to continue developing new variants. </p> <p>You can listen internist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCOVID19 FactsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Ramona DeJesusWhat's the best Millions of Americans \u2014 adults and kids \u2014 are now overweight. The excess weight is also called \"obesity\" and results when there's an imbalance between the energy we take in (food) and the energy we spend (resting, digesting, physical activity \u2014 both exercise and non-exercise). Studies reveal that the surge we've seen in obesity is driven by our eating behaviors and food choices \u2014 not by decreased activity. </p> <p>You've seen the different weight-loss diets that focus on macronutrients like carbohydrates, fat and protein. They're all equally effective at helping you lose weight because they all have one thing in common: they restrict energy intake (fewer calories). Zeroing in on carbohydrates, fats or protein isn't necessary for weight loss, and it isn't usually sustainable because we get bored with all the restrictions. </p> <p>Which brings us to an old adage: the best diet is one we can live with or maintain for life. What does that diet look like? It's one that reduces the number of calories (energy) we take in and is built around: </p> <ul> <li>Fruits and vegetables, which are naturally low in calories</li> <li>Fiber, which helps make us feel full and satisfied</li> <li>Water and other low-calorie beverages to satisfy thirst</li> <li>Avoiding trans-fats and processed in a box)</li> <li>Controlling food portions</li> </ul> <p>Also, make it a habit to eat breakfast every day. In a national weight-control registry, people who lost 30 pounds or more and managed to keep them off for at least a year, report eating breakfast every day as a weight-loss maintenance strategy. </p> <p>Diet is only one piece of a healthy lifestyle. Exercise does play a key role. Try to be physically active \u2014 aim for about two-and-a-half hours or 150 minutes of vigorous activity per week for both physical and mental health. Managing your stress also helps you cope with emotional issues that can lead to unhealthy eating patterns. </p> <p>Find an approach you can live with, and you'll have found the perfect weight-loss plan for you. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/ramona-dejesus-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Ramona DeJesus</a> is a general internist in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM). she completed her MD at the University of Florida and residency in internal medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

But over the course of this past year, we have learned of the far-reaching effects of this virus on the entire body, particularly, the heart.</p> <p>A common question I hear is how does COVID-19 affect the heart?</p> <p>There are several ways that COVID-19 can affect the heart both directly by the damage from the virus itself and indirectly by the inflammation from our immune system trying to attack and kill the virus. COVID-19 also can worsen preexisting heart conditions by increasing strain on the heart during an infection. This can lead to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart; heart arrhythmias, or abnormal heart rhythms; and rarely heart failure, where the heart does not pump as well.</p> <p>We know that almost 25% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have heart damage, but we are starting to understand that even patients who are not hospitalized are at risk for these complications. And it is not just in patients with preexisting heart conditions. Even people without prior heart issues have shown signs of heart damage.</p> <p>While many patients with COVID-19 recover, we are still trying to understand what the lasting effects on the heart are. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for patients to experience prolonged fatigue and deconditioning as their body heals from COVID-19.</p> <p>Note these signs of COVID-19 that indicate when you further social distance.</li> <li>Avoid large gatherings.</li> <li>Continue to take your medications as prescribed if you have underlying heart disease, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. </li> <li>Maintain an Ducharme-Smith, M.D.,</em></a><em> is an internal medicine physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine, and she practices at Mayo Family Clinic Northeast in Rochester.

To help prevent them, parents strap helmets on their kids as they run outside to play and ponder whether their youngsters should participate in contact sports. But what about protecting adult brains from injury? </p> <p>There's no age limit on getting concussions, whether it's from a fall on the ice, vehicle accident, tumble from a bike or bumping into a kitchen cabinet door. And as we age, we become more susceptible to issues from head injuries. It may not take much of a jolt to cause an injury that takes longer to heal. </p> <p>With a concussion, there is a violent shaking or blow to the head causing our brains to move inside our skull. Even a single, mild concussion may have a longer-lasting impact, including memory problems and possible increased risk for dementia. As with children, increased numbers of concussions come with increased risk for complications long term. </p> <p>Typical symptoms in adults include: </p> <ul> <li>Headaches</li> <li>Trouble a fog</li> <li>Dizziness</li> <li>Nausea/vomiting</li> <li>Fatigue</li> <li>Withdrawal from social interaction, feeling depressed</li> </ul> <p>Loved ones also might notice that you're sleeping more or having trouble sleeping; experiencing mood swings, including being more irritable; or having memory issues, which can include taking more time to respond and repeating questions. </p> <p>Don't just write these symptoms off as part of the aging process or that it's \"not that bad\". If you're on a blood thinner, you should go to the Emergency Department immediately following a head injury. If you're having a headache that's increasing in severity, persistent vomiting, seizure activity or unusual behavior, then emergency evaluation would be needed, as well. Otherwise, if your symptoms affect day-to-day function or you're concerned, see your care team for an evaluation. </p> <p>While there's no treatment for the concussion itself, treatment can manage symptoms \u2014 such as medications to control headaches and physical or occupational therapy to relieve dizziness or improve balance. </p> <p>Steps to protect the adult brain from concussion are much like those for kids: </p> <ul> <li>Always wear a seat belt</li> <li>Use a helmet for activities from riding bike to downhill skiing</li> <li>Reduce fall risks around the home, such as slippery surfaces and trip hazards (electrical cords, clutter, throw rugs, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Stay active, have fun, but watch your head!</p> <p><em>Dr. Kyle McKenzie is a physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

Along with picking out colors and furniture, make sure you're creating a safe nursery, too. </p> <p>Here are some tips for designing a safe environment for your bundle of joy when you bring them home and as they grow. </p> <p><strong>Cribs and beds</strong></p> <p>Carefully choose a crib and mattress for your baby. Make sure all nursery furniture meets safety requirements. You can trust new furniture if it bears the <a href=\"https://www.jpma.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association</a> safety certification seal. Some things to consider: </p> <ul> <li>Bars should be spaced no more than 2-3/8 inches apart. Do not use a crib with drop rails. </li> <li>The mattress should be very firm and should not sag under your baby's weight. It should fit snugly, with no space between it and the crib walls. </li> <li>Keep crib bumpers or pads, large toys, stuffed animals, pillows, bulky comforters and heavy blankets out of the crib. </li> <li>Place your baby on their back for sleep until they're one year old. </li> </ul> <p>Once your child is about three feet tall, they should start sleeping in a bed. If you're worried about them falling out of bed, you may want to start with the mattress on the floor. </p> <p><strong>Changing tables</strong></p> <p>A changing table makes it easier to diaper and dress your baby, but a fall from it can be serious. </p> <ul> <li>Choose a sturdy, stable changing table with a two-inch guardrail around all four sides. </li> <li>For the pad, choose one where the middle is slightly lower than the sides. </li> <li>When using, buckle the safety strap, but always keep a hand on your baby too. Never leave them unattended, even if strapped in. </li> <li>Diapering supplies should be handy so you don't have to leave the baby, but out of the baby's reach \u2014 including the powder container. </li> <li>Make sure diaper pails nursery, bathroom and hallways. </li> <li>Install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors inside the nursery and hallway outside the room. </li> <li>Anchor heavy furniture, such as dressers and bookshelves, to the wall to prevent them from falling on children. </li> <li>Choose a toy chest or basket without a lid. If it does have one, make sure there are air holes in case the child crawls inside. </li> <li>If picking out a crib mobile, look for one with bright colors, varied shapes and maybe even music. View it from below, which will be your baby's point of view. Remove it once they can sit up or reach it. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Windows</strong></p> <p>Windows provide natural light and fresh air, but all windows throughout the house pose hazards, too. To make sure they're secure:</p> <ul> <li>Move furniture away from windows. </li> <li>Don't rely on screens to prevent falls. </li> <li>Install stops that prevent windows from opening more than four inches. Most children five and younger can fit through a six-inch opening. </li> <li>Install window guards that cover the lower part of the window. </li> <li>Open double-hung windows from the top only. </li> </ul> <p>For more tips about creating a safe environment for baby, check out stories a family physician with Women's Health fellowship training in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Department of Family Medicine.

Interest in it began in the 1960s as data started showing that coronary heart disease caused fewer deaths in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea than in the U.S. and northern Europe. More studies backed up these findings. </p> <p>Here are the basics of eating the Mediterranean way: </p> <ul> <li>Daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats</li> <li>Weekly intake of fish, poultry, beans and eggs</li> <li>Moderate portions of dairy products</li> <li>Limited intake of red meat</li> <li>Sharing meals and enjoying a glass of red wine with family and friends</li> <li>Being physically active</li> </ul> <p><strong>What are healthy fats?</strong></p> <p>Healthy fats are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet. They're eaten instead of less healthy fats, such as saturated and trans fats, which contribute to heart disease. Healthy fats include: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Olive oil.</strong> Primary source of added fat.

Omega-3 fatty acids also help decrease triglycerides, reduce blood clotting and decrease the risk of stroke and heart failure. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What about wine?</strong></p> <p>If you've ever been to countries like France, Italy or Spain, you know that wine is a feature of their daily meals. The Mediterranean diet allows red wine in moderation: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Women:</strong> One 5-ounce serving per day. </li> more than two 5-ounce servings per day. </li> <li>Remember these recommendations are limits per day \u2014 not an average per week. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Do I have to give up snacks?</strong></p> <p>Snacks \u2014 small amounts of food eaten between meals \u2014 can be part of the Mediterranean diet. Tasty and satisfying treats of fruit, whole grains, veggies, nuts and seeds follow the Mediterranean eating plan. Here are some easy ideas: air-popped popcorn, peanut butter and celery, veggies with toasted red pepper hummus, cottage cheese or Greek yogurt with berries, tomato slices/olives/whole wheat bread drizzled with olive oil or up to 14 almonds. </p> <p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p> <p>If you'd like to test the waters of the Mediterranean diet, here are some steps for taking the plunge: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Eat more fruits and vegetables.</strong> Aim for seven to 10 servings a day of fruit and vegetables. Fill up to half your place with fruit and veggies. Meet your servings my choosing fruits and veggies as snacks. </li> <li><strong>Opt for whole grains.</strong> Switch to whole-grain bread, cereal and pasta. Experiment with other whole grains, such as bulgur and faro. </li> <li><strong>Use those healthy fats.</strong> Olive oil is a good replacement for butter when cooking. Instead of putting butter or margarine on bread, try dipping it in flavored olive oil. </li> <li><strong>Eat more seafood.</strong> Eat fish twice a week: fresh or water-packed tuna, salmon, trout, mackerel and herring are healthy choices. Grilled fish is delicious and simple to prepare. Avoid deep-fried fish. </li> <li><strong>Reduce red meat.</strong> Substitute fish, poultry or beans for meat. If you eat meat, make sure it's lean and keep portions small. </li> <li><strong>Enjoy some dairy.</strong> Drink a glass of low-fat milk with one meal a day, eat low-fat Greek or plain yogurt and small amounts of a variety of cheeses. </li> <li><strong>Spice it up.</strong> Herbs and spices boost flavor and lessen the need for salt. </li> <li><strong>Do watch your portions.</strong> Too much of even a healthy food can add pounds. For example, nuts have good health benefits, but it's easy to eat more than 1,000 calories in one sitting. Stick to a small handful \u2014 1-1.5 ounces \u2014 of nuts per day. That means the 30-ounce tub of nuts form Costco should last a person an entire month!

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonMigraine MedicationsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson sinus-problem sufferers, a stuffy nose is one of the most annoying and uncomfortable symptoms. But a simple, low-risk, inexpensive technique helps wash away the pollen, dirt, mucus and other irritants that can cause nasal congestion. </p> <p>It's called a nasal saltwater wash, which rinses and moisturizes tissues, helping keep nasal passages open. Research shows that patients who do it routinely two or three times a week can relieve or even prevent congestion. </p> <p>Here's how it works: </p> <ul> <li>Start with a nasal saltwater solution that you buy or make. It's available over the counter premixed or in premeasured packets. To make your own solution, use distilled or sterilized water or boil tap water for three to five minutes. Measure out one cup and set aside to cool until lukewarm. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon non-iodized salt, such as sea salt, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda until they dissolve in the warm water. </li> <li>Pour the solution into a plastic nasal wash bottle or Neti Pot, which looks like a mini teapot. Lean over the sink, and tilt your head so your chin and nose are at the same level. Pour the solution in the upper nostril, letting it run out the lower one. Turn your head and do the other side. Repeat until all the solution is gone or until your nose feels clearer. </li> <li>Another option is to do the saline wash while you're taking a shower. </li> <li>Be sure to wash the bottle or Neti Pot after use and let it air dry. </li> <li>To see the technique, check the nasal saltwater wash every day for two to four weeks, since if you're really congested, it may take time to clear your nasal passages. Then reduce to a couple times a week as a preventive treatment or just when you feel you need it. At first, the sensation can feel strange, but it's not like jumping in a pool and getting a nose full or water!</p> <p>There are few side effects to a nasal saltwater wash, but plenty of benefits. It's low cost, easy to do, won't cause nasal irritation and may even make your nasal spray work better.

But it was not until her pregnancy that she would see the benefits firsthand. </p> <p>At just 12 weeks pregnant, Hannah began to have complications with a subchorionic hemorrhage, which is bleeding under one of the membranes that surrounds the baby inside the uterus. Due to her complications, Hannah was admitted to the hospital when she was 17 weeks pregnant. She needed seven blood transfusions to stay pregnant long enough to bring her son to viability. Her son, Louden Miller was born prematurely at 24 weeks, weighing just 1 pound, 7 ounces. </p> <p>During his six-month stay in the Neonatal ICU, Louden needed eight blood transfusions. After 135 days in the Neonatal ICU, Louden gave his dad the best birthday gift: He was discharged to head home for the first time.

Take this quiz to find out \u2014 and learn more about what causes UTIs and how to treat and prevent them. </p> <p><strong>True or false: We don't really know what causes a UTI.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> A UTI is a bacterial infection of the lining of your bladder that causes the lining to become irritated and inflamed. <em>E. coli</em> bacteria, which lives in your intestinal tract and comes from your own bowel, is the culprit in 90% of UTIs. Some women seem to be more susceptible to these infections. </p> <p><strong>True or false: A UTI can indicate the onset of sexual activity.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>True.</strong> Typically, the chance of developing a UTI increases after you start having intercourse. <em>E. coli</em> that colonizes in your urinary/genital area can be pushed into your urethra and bladder during sexual activity. </p> <p><strong>True or false: Itching is one of the main symptoms of a UTI. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> Itching is NOT a UTI symptom. If you experience an urgent, frequent need to urinate, don't produce much urine despite that urge and have an internal burning sensation when you go, you have the symptoms of a UTI and should contact your care team. </p> <p><strong>True or false: It's important to go to the clinic for a urine culture to diagnose if you have a UTI.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> We now recommend that you call your primary care team's appointment line. They can connect you with a nurse who will walk you through your symptoms. If your symptoms indicate an uncomplicated UTI (no sexually transmitted disease or kidney problem), they can prescribe an antibiotic over the phone. Antibiotics have been proven effective in more than 90% of cases. You may be prescribed one such as (Macrodantin, cranberry juice helps if you are having symptoms of a UTI. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> Years ago, a small study suggested that drinking large amounts of cranberry juice would increase the acidity level in your urine, killing harmful bacteria and preventing UTIs. Since then, a number of studies have debunked this. Cranberry products <strong>do not</strong> reduce the occurrence of symptoms, nor do they help once acute symptoms have started. </p> <p><strong>True or false: Being a \"goer\" rather protects you from UTIs.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>True.</strong> When you feel the urge to go you should head to the bathroom. Holding urine in your bladder for extended periods of time provides fertile ground for infection. Two other techniques that can prevent UTIs are: </p> <ul style=\"margin-left: 80px;\"> <li>Emptying your bladder glass of water after intercourse. </li> <li>For post-menopausal women, applying topical estrogen cream, prescribed by your provider, can significantly reduce the incidence of UTI. </li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">If you have three or more UTIs a year, in addition to the steps above, your care team may prescribe a very small dose of antibiotic to take after intercourse or three times a week. Having a complete urological evaluation is not necessary; it's better to be on a preventative program. </p> <p><strong>True or false: Only women get UTIs.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> Men also can get the infections, but they occur much less frequently and tend to be more complicated. </p> <p><strong>True or false: A UTI in the elderly can cause behavioral and cognitive changes.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>False.</strong> Multiple studies have shown there is no link between UTIs and changes in behavior, confusion, dementia or falls. So how did these two come to be connected? </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Many elderly carry bacteria in their urine, <strong>without symptoms of infection</strong>, especially those who have cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence or are living in long-term care facilities. If caregivers notice behavioral or cognitive changes, a urine culture might be performed. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">When the elderly have cognitive issues, they have good days and bad days. If they're given an antibiotic on a bad day, as they swing toward their good days, it's assumed the antibiotic eliminated the infection and improved their mental state. And that's how a misconception was born. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Unfortunately, it also gave birth to prescribing unneeded antibiotics, which can be a huge concern if the person develops a challenging infection, such as <em>C. difficile</em>. There's now a major push to educate health care professionals and caregivers about this issue. </p> <p><strong>The message:</strong> Unless a person has symptoms of a UTI \u2014 urgent, frequent need to urinate, little urine production when they go and a burning sensation \u2014 they should not undergo a urine culture or be treated with antibiotics. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/henry-schultz-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Henry Schultz</a> is a primary care physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Primary Care Internal Medicine (PCIM) in Rochester.

They represent a significant advancement in anticoagulant therapy. They have been available for several years. Over that time, these newer medications have been found to be safe and effective, and much easier to take. </p> <p>Previously, warfarin (Coumadin) was the only medication in pill form available to thin the blood. While effective, warfarin requires regular monitoring, as its action is affected by many medications, acute illness and foods containing vitamin K. As a result, the blood can become too thick or too thin, which makes clotting or bleeding more likely. </p> <p>Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are different in that their blood thinning actions are much more consistent. They require much less monitoring, and the dose does not need to be adjusted, making them much easier to take. On balance, they are somewhat safer and more effective than warfarin. Like any medicine that thins the blood, bleeding is a risk. However, when taken consistently, this risk is lessened. </p> <p>Direct-acting oral anticoagulants cannot be used in some situations. For example, mechanical heart valves still require warfarin to be used for anticoagulation. For many patients, the primary concern to using direct-acting oral anticoagulants is the out-of-pocket cost, as these are new, brand-name medications with no generic equivalents. The cost to the patient will be determined by insurance coverage. Coupons may be available for those not enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. </p> <p>For most patients requiring oral anticoagulant therapy, direct-acting oral anticoagulants are a safe, effective and much more convenient treatment option.

To avoid injuries and unwanted trips to your health care provider, take tips from ergonomics. </p> <p>Ergonomics is the study of the \"best fit\" between workers and their job. The goal is to reduce injuries, and increase comfort and safety related to work. Work-related musculoskeletal injuries are caused by repeated gripping, lifting, bending, twisting, kneeling and squatting. These activities are common in farm workers and gardeners. Even activities that are harmless alone, such as stretching out an arm to grasp an object, can put a worker at risk of injury if repeated over time. </p> <p>Some general principles can be use to reduce injuries related to farm work and gardening as it relates to hand work and lifting. </p> <p>Consider these guidelines for hand work:</p> <ol> <li>Avoid placing needed tools above shoulder height. </li> <li>Allow adequate recovery time between repeated activities and allow alternative activities to occur, such as alternating weeding with carrying heavy loads. </li> <li>Place items within 17 inches of yourself. </li> <li>Sit if possible. </li> <li>If you need to stand, use floor mats with workstations at the proper height. </li> <li>Have hand tools that are covered with a smooth, slip-resistant material, such as plastic or rubber, with a spring to keep an open position. </li> <li>When washing plants, include the use of mesh bags rather than hand-washing to avoid stooping, lifting and repeated gripping. </li> <li>Use standardized containers as much as possible to allow for easy stacking. </li> </ol> <p>Consider these best practices for lifting:</p> <ol> <li>Keep lifts between hand level and shoulder level and avoid lifting from the floor. </li> <li>Use handles on containers. </li> <li>Use dollies, palate trucks or utility carts. </li> <li>Keep bag or box weight below 50 pounds. </li> <li>Use lifting tools. </li> <li>Lift with your legs. </li> <li>Carry smaller loads. While this seems less efficient, it will allow you to avoid injury and needing to stop the work or activity. </li> </ol> <p>For more safety tips for farm workers, visit <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/\" target=\"_blank\">The National Institute for Occupational farming and gardening. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jon-ebbert-md/\">Jon Ebbert, M.D.</a>, is a physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonSMART GoalsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Craig Sawchuk, Ph.D., and Sydney are slowly transforming into cooler temperatures at night. The leaves are just starting to change colors. The sun is rising a little later in the morning and setting a bit earlier in the evening. And the end of daylight savings time, where \"falling back\" gains an extra hour of sleep, is not yet here. However, this is also a time of year when people who tend to struggle with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) start to get concerned about changes in their mood and function that arrive later in autumn and early winter. </p> <p>Those who live in northern states are no strangers to the \"winter blues,\" which is a mild version of seasonal affective disorder. About 15% of the population may struggle with winter blues. Studies have shown that nearly 10% of people in New Hampshire have been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder, but it affects only about 1% in Florida, the Sunshine State. </p> <p>Seasonal affective disorder tends to be more common in women, young adults and those who work night shifts. It also has been found to run in families. Symptoms typically come on during the fall and winter and reliably go away during the spring and summer. Many symptoms feel like the need to hibernate. </p> <p>Common seasonal affective disorder symptoms but not sleeping well. </li> <li>Feeling dragged out and unmotivated, with low energy. </li> <li>Craving junk or comfort food. </li> <li>Gaining weight. </li> <li>Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed. </li> <li>Not being able to focus. </li> <li>Avoiding social activities. </li> </ul> <p>While many experience these symptoms to some degree, when they become disabling or make it difficult for you to function, you should contact your care team. If you already suffer from depression, seasonal affective disorder can worsen your symptoms. </p> <p>While there's no exact cause of seasonal affective disorder, researchers have found it may be linked to: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Your biological clock (circadian rhythm) </strong><br> The reduced level of sunlight in the fall and winter may cause winter-onset seasonal affective disorder. This decrease in sunlight may disrupt your body's internal clock and lead to feelings of depression. </li> <li><strong>Serotonin levels</strong> <br> A drop in serotonin, a brain chemical that affects mood, might play a role in seasonal affective disorder. Reduced sunlight can reduce serotonin, and that reduction may trigger depression. </li> <li><strong>Melatonin levels </strong><br> The change in season can disrupt the balance of a body's level of melatonin, which plays a role in regulating sleep patterns and mood. </li> </ul> <p>Although it may be several more weeks until your seasonal affective disorder symptoms normally start to appear, taking action now will help you get a running start toward developing healthy habits. </p> <p>Whether it's the winter blues or seasonal affective disorder, here are some things you can try to lift your mood: </p> <ul> <li>Open your shades to let in the sunlight. </li> <li>Head outdoors on sunny days. </li> <li>Include physical activity in your daily routine. </li> <li>Adjust your diet to include foods that provide energy. </li> <li>Plan to stay connected regularly with friends, family and other social supports. </li> </ul> <p>You also can try light therapy. During light therapy, you sit or work near a box that emits bright light mimicking natural outdoor light. The boxes are relatively inexpensive, and they can be bought without a prescription. Some insurance companies cover the cost. They're small, thin and lightweight, and they can be carried when you travel. Many patients find light therapy to be as effective as antidepressants, without the side effects. </p> <p>Choose a light box that emits 10,000 lux and emits low ultraviolet light. Some light boxes emit off-white light or blue light, but there is no advantage to one color of light over the other. </p> <p>Here are some tips for using a light box correctly:</p> <ul> <li>Start using the light box within two weeks of the usual time each year your mood starts to decline. </li> <li>Set it at an angle to the left or right, at eye level or higher, and at about an arm's length away. Do not stare directly into the light. </li> <li>Keep your eyes open while using it, and feel free to perform other activities like reading or eating breakfast. </li> <li>Start light therapy for 20-30 minutes each day within the first hour of waking up in the morning. </li> </ul> <p>Keep using it until the days lengthen and you begin to feel better, which is usually in the early spring to summer. Remember that consistent use is key. </p> <p>Studies also have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy, a skills-based treatment, can effectively treat seasonal affective disorder. As part of this therapy, participants learn ways that can offset the likelihood of experiencing seasonal affective disorder in the future. </p> <p>Some people also may benefit from antidepressants. Research has shown that starting a medication several weeks before the usual onset of seasonal affective disorder symptoms tends to be more helpful than starting a medication once it has already started. </p> <p>Talk to your health care team regarding the best options for managing your seasonal affective disorder.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonSeasonal Affective Disorder 2021Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - you see that little heartbeat on the screen, your life changes. Your new goal is to keep this little human safe and happy. There is no shortage of advice available \u2014 from online blogs to well-meaning family and friends. But all that advice can be confusing at best and dangerous at worst. </p> <p>Here are five simple tips you can use to keep your baby safe: </p> <p><strong>Provide safe sleep.</strong></p> <p>Providing safe sleep is key to taking care of your little bundle of joy. </p> <p>Key things to remember are:</p> <ul> <li>Put your baby to sleep on his or her back. </li> <li>Your baby should sleep in his or her own flat sleep space. </li> <li>It is best to keep your baby in your room until 6 months of age, or even better, 1 year. </li> <li>Keep your baby's space clear. That means no cute fluffy blankets, stuffed animals or crib bumper. </li> <li>Once your little one starts rolling, stop swaddling his or her arms. Then he or she can freely use his or her arms to reposition if needed. </li> <li>Give your little one a pacifier, which can decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Check your home environment.</strong></p> <p>Your little one is growing and developing quickly. As he or she becomes mobile, be sure your house is safe. </p> <p>This means:</p> <ul> <li>Installing safety gates. </li> <li>Moving chemicals, sharp knives and dangerous products up and out of reach. </li> <li>Installing drawer and cabinet locks, and electrical outlet covers. </li> <li>Removing any small pieces a little explorer could choke on. </li> <li>Draining any water \u2014 even if just a few inches \u2014 from buckets or bathtubs to prevent drowning. </li> </ul> <p>It can help to crawl around at baby level to see any hazards that are around. </p> <p><strong>Ride safely.</strong></p> <p>Install a rear-facing car seat for your little one to ride in. Ensure it is installed correctly and tightly in the vehicle. The instruction manual that comes with the car seat is a valuable resource. </p> <p>Always buckle up, even if only going a short distance. When you buckle your little one, the clip should be at the nipple line, and the belt should be tight \u2014 so tight you can't pinch the fabric with your fingers. During the winter, it is important to not put your child in a bulky coat or snowsuit while in the car. The bulky clothing can compress in a crash leaving the straps too loose to restrain your child. This can lead to increased risk of injury. </p> <p><strong>Take care of yourself.</strong></p> <p>It is important to make time for your own health, both mental and physical. Babies cry \u2014 sometimes a lot. </p> <p>It can be difficult to cope if you are overwhelmed. This can lead to decreased bonding or even harming your baby. </p> <p>It is especially important to watch for any signs of postpartum depression, such as feeling worthless, not enjoying hobbies, or in serious cases, wanting to harm yourself or your baby. Know that postpartum depression is not your fault, and your health care team can help you. </p> <p><strong>Keep an open line of communication with your care team.</strong></p> <p>Keep your well-child appointments on schedule. These appointments make sure your baby is growing and developing appropriately, and that's when immunizations are provided to keep your family safe. </p> <p>Always ask your health care team any questions you have. Millions of things can come up when raising your child, and your health care team is here to help and support you, and your little one. </p> <p>Enjoy every moment you have with your little one and take simple steps to keep your little one safe. A great resource for more information on safety, growth and parenting is <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://healthychildren.org\" target=\"_blank\">healthychildren.org</a>, a parent-friendly resource from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Remember, you are doing a great job and the best parent for your little one is you. </p> <p><em>Erika Short, APRN, C.N.P., D.N.P., is a nurse practitioner in Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine in Rochester, and practices in the Baldwin building. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/kids/childsafety.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=34FD0DD0A5BFF44231957D57C7C009C0\" alt=\"ChildSafety\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />These five tips can help keep your baby safe and healthy.

Dagoberto Heredia for it is so ingrained in us that it's even written into the Declaration of Independence: \"...certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" But how do we achieve it?</p> <p><strong>Happy in the moment</strong></p> <p>We all know when we feel happy \u2014 we're filled with a sense of joy or pleasure about someone we're with or what we're doing. But we also know the feeling of happiness doesn't last, no matter how much time we spend chasing after it.</p> <p><strong>Seeking what gives us meaning</strong></p> <p>What does last are the behaviors that give us a more complete, rich and meaningful life. They're the foundation that fosters hope, optimism and a desire to engage with others. No one can tell you what gives your life meaning \u2014 it's unique and specific to you. And finding that meaning starts by building from the inside out, by asking yourself, \"What are my values, what means the most to me, what gives me a sense of purpose?\"</p> <p>Often things that give us happiness are right in front of us, and we let ourselves get distracted from them due to guilt, shame or worry. Take some quiet time to really think about this and jot down your thoughts about what makes you happy. Then you can start building some goals and taking the first steps to live flexibly, but consistently, with the aspects of life that make you happy. Once we're aware of what we value, we can take action to build opportunities for happiness and meaning, rather than wait for happiness to come by.</p> <p>Building inner meaning is a gradual process. For instance, if you value family, start by spending 15 minutes of uninterrupted time with your family. If the outdoors and nature fulfills you, go to the park and relish your surroundings for 10 minutes a week. These simple, and gradually increasing steps, are what build opportunities for happiness.</p> <p>Every feeling is fleeting, but if you can build consistent activities into your life, that's what will bring deep-seated, lasting happiness. Often people who are unhappy can benefit from being consistent and matching what they value with actions.</p> <p><strong>Benefits of happiness and meaning</strong></p> <p>Research shows us that happy people are healthier, live longer and have lower rates of heart disease, stroke and infection. Being positive makes us more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, such as eating well and getting regular exercise, which circle back and contribute to happiness.</p> <p>People who are deeply happy and have meaning in their life tend to:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Have a network of social relationships. They want to be out and about in their neighborhoods, workplaces and even casual settings, such as coffee shops. They're more comfortable and confident when with a group.</li> <li>Be more productive, cooperative and creative at work. They are better able to collaborate and contribute to reaching a common goal, as well as more apt to find the middle ground.</li> <li>Be good friends, neighbors and citizens. People with a positive mood see others more sympathetically and are more inclusive; they find ways to get along, despite differences.</li> <li>Do good to feel good. Doing good can be volunteering, reaching across party lines, respecting cultural diversity, helping neighbors they don't know.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHappinessPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.When kitty coat of your Kitty lies a tiger waiting to pounce. House cats are biologically designed to be efficient hunters and complete with the tools they need \u2014 sharp claws and teeth for grabbing and killing prey. Unfortunately, sometimes that \"prey\" is their human's hands, face or feet. </p> <p>It doesn't take much for Kitty to turn tiger. A game that gets out of hand or being overexcited, frightened by another animal or startled by a noise can trigger their predator response, and the claws come out. (Even declawed cats usually still have a full set of back claws in working order.) If you're a victim of a cat bite or scratch, take is seriously to avoid becoming infected with cat-scratch disease (CSD). </p> <p><strong>What is CSD?</strong></p> <p>It's an infection caused by being bitten, scratched or having an open wound licked by a cat carrying a bacterium called <em>Bartonella henselae</em>. About 40% of cats carry this bacterium at some time in their lives, although most never show signs of illness. Kittens younger than one year are more likely to be infected and spread the germ, since they often bite and scratch as they play and learn how to attack prey. </p> <p><strong>How do cats get infected?</strong></p> <p>Cats can pick up the bacterium from flea bites and getting flea droppings into their wounds. They also can become infected by fighting with other cats that are infected. </p> <p><strong>How do you know if you have CSD?</strong></p> <p>About 3 to 14 days after the bite or scratch, a mild infection can set in. The affected area may look swollen and red with round, raised lesions and possibly, pus. It also may feel warm or painful. The infected person may have a fever, headache, poor appetite and be excessively tired. As the infection progresses, lymph nodes closest to the original scratch or bite can become swollen, tender or painful. </p> <p>Although rare, CSD can cause serious complications, affecting the brain, eyes, heart or other internal organs. These rare complications, which may require intensive treatment, are more likely to occur in children younger than 5 years old and people with weakened immune systems. </p> <p><strong>How is CSD treated?</strong></p> <p>Wash bites and scratches well with soap and running water. Keep an eye on the wounds and contact your care team if you develop any symptoms of infection. You may need to be treated with antibiotics. </p> <p><strong>How can it be prevented?</strong></p> <p>Protect your cat by keeping it indoors and make sure it has regular veterinary care. But as every cat owner knows, scratches and nips happen. That's why it's important for everyone to learn how to play safely with them, such as using toys for \"prey\" rather than your hands, holding them correctly and realizing that your Kitty has the heart of a tiger. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internist in Community Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Palliative Care at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

These medications are generally safe and well-tolerated when used as directed or under the direction of your health care provider. Proton pump inhibitors are more powerful medications that are used daily, and they can be used for more frequent symptoms or if other medications do not provide relief. </p> <p><strong>Should you tell your health care provider about these over-the-counter medications?</strong></p> <p>You should notify your care team if you take any of these medications. Although many of these heartburn medications are available over the counter, they may interact with other medications you take. Some side effects are associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, and your health care provider may need to perform additional monitoring. </p> <p>Talk to your health care provider before taking both a proton pump inhibitor and histamine blocker together. If symptoms are severe enough to take multiple medications, you should see your health care provider to make sure it is simple heartburn and not a more severe issue.

When someone has been taking a proton pump inhibitor for longer than three months, it is advised to slowly decrease the dose of the medication instead of quitting cold turkey. </p> <p>The proton pump inhibitors have been shutting off your acid production, and quitting cold turkey would turn them all on at once, potentially causing an overproduction of acid. Slowly decreasing your daily amount by 50% every 1-2 weeks has been shown to be the best way to successfully taper off these medications. </p> <p><em>Regina Haeflinger is a pharmacy student completing clinical rotations at Mayo Clinic.

Being obese or overweight increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other chronic medical conditions that can begin as early as the teenage years and continue into adulthood. Not only does carrying extra weight affect health and quality of life, it also can affect mental well-being. Being overweight can lead to poor body image, low self-esteem, unhealthy weight control, bullying and depression. That's why your primary care provider may have addressed your child's weight during a well-child visit. </p> <p>If you've had this discussion with your child's provider, you know there is a wealth of resources to help you \u2014 from nutrition information to healthy living programs just for kids. The trick is to apply that information at home. Here are some techniques and tips for creating an environment at home that benefits not just your child, but the entire family. </p> <p><strong>Staying on track during the pandemic.</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic presents new challenges to maintaining a healthy weight for children. Attending school online from home limits opportunities to play with friends, increases screen time and makes it harder to follow a schedule in the day. Having more access to snacks around the house can lead to mindless eating and weight gain. Everyone's busy schedules also can make it harder to enjoy mealtimes together. Here are some tips to stay on track: </p> <ul> <li>Designate certain times of the day to have family meals or snack time. </li> <li>Keep meals and snack time at the kitchen or dining room table, and not in front of screens. </li> <li>Stock up on healthier snacks and keep them in sight for children and adolescents to grab. </li> <li>Limit how many sweets and treats are in the household, whether you buy them or make them at home. </li> <li>Encourage kids and adolescents to take breaks from screens when possible and participate together in some form of physical activity or movement. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Make it a family affair.</strong> Any changes in eating and lifestyle will be good for everyone. Younger children rely on family members to provide their meals and snacks, so providing nutritious foods early can influence their decisions later in life as they transition to adolescence and adulthood. Having family meals at the dinner table is also a great opportunity to connect and enjoy time together. </p> <p><strong>Change the focus.</strong> Make the changes about healthy eating and activity rather than weight. Don't reward or punish kids with food. Shaming is not effective and may have the opposite effect on making positive behavior changes. Compliment your children on lifestyle changes, such as choosing to play outside over video games inside, rather than losing a few pounds. </p> <p><strong>Take action.</strong> Children learn fast, and they learn best by example. Decide on healthy habits you would like to create and get started step-by-step. Discuss the concrete benefits of these actions, such as fun with movement or good energy from eating a healthy meal or snack. Children are more likely to adopt these habits if they participate with family members. </p> <p><strong>Adopt new ways of eating.</strong> Some behaviors are known to promote weight gain, including skipping breakfast; eating meals in a restaurant or ordering takeout (which often have larger portions); eating too fast; eating in front of screens (like phones, computers, TV, etc.); eating less nutritious foods; and eating when you're not hungry. Positive eating habits include eating meals together; choosing more fruits and vegetables; eating at regular times; and preparing meals from scratch. </p> <p>In short, every family is different in making healthy changes with food choices and activity. Just remember to take it one step at a time, notice immediate benefits to healthy habits, and have fun. Your primary care provider can be a good partner on the road to great health habits and can answer any questions you have along the way. </p> <p><em>Kristine Penza, R.D.N., L.D., are members of the Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson Childhood Obesity Task Force.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonGenetic Test Results 030821Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Anne Roche, Ph.D.; Sydney Kelpin, Ph.D.; Craig Sawchuk, Ph.D.Are you increased experiences of frustration, agitation or anger throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic? If so, you're not alone. </p> <p>Research has shown that many people are experiencing anger. The pandemic anger, or \"panger,\" is real. </p> <p>If this experience is familiar to you, you know that anger can become exhausting over time. And you might be interested in learning about different ways to cope. </p> <p><strong>What is anger?</strong></p> <p>Anger is a universal human emotion. In its most basic form, anger's primary purpose is to motivate action. That's really important. But many of the things done in response to anger, such as yelling, ruminating or shutting down, can be less than helpful. And these actions can negatively affect physical and mental health, and relationships. </p> <p>So what can you do? </p> <p>Below, you'll find some ideas that may help you respond intentionally and effectively to \"panger\" rather than simply reacting: </p> <p><strong>Step back and observe. </strong></p> <p>Take a deep breath and pay attention to what's happening in the moment without judging or evaluating your experience. </p> <p>Oftentimes, anger feels too overwhelming. If you can step back, you can notice that experiencing anger has many parts. People experience anger in their own way. </p> <p>Take a moment to reflect on what your anger typically looks like: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Thoughts</strong> <br /> Thoughts and emotions are closely related. What thoughts indicate you're becoming angry? You may notice thoughts such as \"This isn't fair\" or \"How dare they,\" or \"I'm so tired of this.\" Try to observe your thoughts coming and going like clouds in the sky rather than thinking of thoughts as absolute truths that must be immediately acted on. </li> <li><strong>Emotions </strong><br /> A variety of other emotions can come with anger. For example, you may be feeling hurt, fear, embarrassment or frustration before you notice anger itself. Be specific in labeling you notice anger in your body, such as as tightening of the chest or clenching of the jaw or fists, or feeling hot? </li> <li><strong>Urge to act </strong><br /> Before taking action, you may notice an action urge, or impulse. For example, you may notice the urge to scream or run away. </li> </ul> <p>Try imagining what your \"panger\" might look like in physical form. Would it be big or small? What color would it be? What shape? Where would it be located in your body? Would it make noise? Would it be loud or soft? Imagining a physical \"anger monster\" might help you notice and observe your anger rather than being caught up in it. </p> <p>Simply slowing down and observing anger in these ways can make it seem less overwhelming and can help create space between your anger and what you do next. </p> <p><strong>Allow 'panger' to be present.</strong></p> <p>As humans, we often try to avoid or get rid of unpleasant internal experiences, including thoughts, emotions and memories. This is natural and even makes a lot of sense in the short term, but it doesn't always work well in the long term. With anger, the tendency to avoid can result in various automatic reactions that aren't always helpful and may even lead to an increase in anger over time. </p> <p>For example, though lashing out at someone may make you feel better in the moment, it doesn't often help in the long term and may even make you feel worse, such as feeling guilty for yelling at your children or co-worker. Similarly, shutting down and suppressing anger or frustration often leads to an increase in its intensity over time \u2014 what you might think of as \"the beach ball effect.\" That is the more you push the beach ball down under the water, the bigger and stronger it becomes when it explodes up. </p> <p><strong>Listen to anger's message about what you value.</strong></p> <p>Choosing to allow anger, and associated thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and urges, to be present without automatically trying to avoid or get rid of them creates freedom and flexibility to choose effective and meaningful actions. It's important to note that accepting anger is an active choice, not a passive resignation. It does not mean you're accepting the situation that may have led to anger or that you're giving up on what you care about. It means you're choosing to put energy toward effective action rather than focusing solely on trying to control the uncontrollable. </p> <p>If you listen closely, painful emotions, like anger, often connect with a message about something or someone you really care about or value. If you didn't care, it wouldn't hurt. And of course, most humans are hurting in the context of the global pandemic. \"Panger\" makes sense. </p> <p><strong>Choose your effective action.</strong> </p> <p>Once you've slowed down to listen to the message anger may have for you, choose your next effective action. You may not be able to control what others say and do, or even what you think and feel, but you can control how you respond. </p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>Anger about pandemic-related travel and social distancing restrictions might carry the message that you really care about your family and friends. You miss spending time with them. You may choose to explore new, creative and safer ways to connect with loved ones, such as walking together outside or scheduling a Zoom game night. </li> <li>Anger about racial health disparities related to COVID-19 may point to how much you value equitable health care policies and practices. Anger can help motivate you to take part in values-based actions, which could range from getting involved in advocacy efforts to giving yourself time to rest and recharge. </li> <li>Frustration with stress or exhaustion, or burnout at work, may be associated with the importance of self-care. This message may cue you to make time, no matter how small, to take part in restful, grounding or enjoyable activities. </li> <li>Agitation toward those who may not agree with your views and the importance of public health measures, such as COVID-19 vaccinations, may indicate that you value the health and wellness of the global community. This may lead you to focus on public health education efforts and modeling the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations. </li> </ul> <p>It is important to note that everyone has unique and individually chosen values, and the actions that align with these values likely look different across people and situations. It's all about exploring the message that anger may have for you and choosing actions based on what you care about most. </p> <p>If you feel like anger or other strong emotions are significantly and negatively affecting you, consider seeking out psychotherapy services from a professional who uses evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance and commitment therapy. </p> <p>Here are helpful resources if you need Health Services Administration: Anger Management for Substance Use Disorder Mental Health Clients Workbook</a>. </li> <li><a Ph.D., are clinical psychology fellows in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral Health clinical psychologist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral Health.

You may have had a regular dining routine, planned ahead for meals, exercised regularly and drove your car to your job every day. You enjoyed weekly meetings with colleagues, lunches out with friends, and several days a week you worked out at the group classes at the gym. You had friends to dine with, have a glass of wine with, go on vacations with, and occasionally attend religious services. You may have had a daily meditation practice and didn't worry much about what was coming tomorrow. </p> <p>But that was before the COVID-19 pandemic. </p> <p>Everyone experienced different repercussions with the COVID-19 pandemic, with shutdowns, social distancing, masking, quarantining and isolation. People were \u2014 and still are \u2014 worried about their health, the health of others who may have been exposed, the deaths of loved ones, loss of income, unending news reports, and lack of social support. </p> <p>2021 seemed to be the year to reenergize coping mechanisms for the current environment. Pandemic chaos led many to overeat, binge-watch TV and movies, obsess on never-ending news, and drink more to cope with the pandemic. </p> <p>People were drinking more because they were bored, lonely, angry, sad, isolated or frozen. Many tried to cope with feelings by numbing out. Alcohol relaxes many of those underlying fight-or-flight symptoms, which are so prevalent during times such as these, and they are extremely uncomfortable to feel. The drinking was not necessarily problematic in itself, but it may create future problems. </p> <p>Having a cocktail at the end of a stressful day is relaxing, and alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which calms heightened emotions and anxiety. Withdrawal happens when alcohol leaves the body, and that increases muscle tension, decreases blood flow and increases the heart rate \u2014 much like anxiety. What appeared to be a good coping skill to deal with daily stress the next day tends to create more anxiety and difficulty coping. Over time, this may evolve into problematic ongoing alcohol consumption. </p> <p>Brain science indicates that when a person drinks alcohol, \"happy chemicals,\" such as dopamine and serotonin, flood the brain with positive and comfortable feelings. Alcohol use becomes problematic over time, when repeated use brings those chemicals so frequently to the brain that the brain decreases production of its own natural \"happy chemicals.\" Repeated regular alcohol use causes the brain to deplete itself of serotonin and dopamine, thus requiring increased alcohol for a person to feel normal. </p> <p>Some of the most common misconceptions about drinking include the ideas of \"drinking is only a problem if I drink every day,\" \"I am not drinking at home alone, so it is not a problem,\" or \"I do not drink to intoxication.\" Alcohol consumption becomes problematic when it starts to negatively affect social interactions, work responsibility and interpersonal relationships. </p> <p>The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as \"a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among the brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences. People with addiction use substances or engage in behaviors that become compulsive and often continue despite harmful consequences.\"</p> <p>The good news is that you can make a conscious decision to stop drinking, and then change your attitude and your actions to support that decision. Using cognitive behavioral therapy skills, you can understand that thoughts influence emotions, which then influences your behavior. This teaches that you can decide to take a break from alcohol and implement other behavioral goals or coping skills to cope with ongoing stress. </p> <p>Some important facts to understand about alcohol use disorder are: </p> <ul> <li>If a person wants to stop drinking so that it doesn't become more of a problem, are held every day in Rochester. This would be a first step in trying to stop on your own. </li> <li>Treatment also can consist of inpatient care, residential care and intensive outpatient programs. </li> <li>Several types of therapy are used to treat addiction, including behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic behavioral therapy, experiential therapies, medication-assisted treatment, 12-step facilitation-assisted therapy, and motivational enhancement therapy. </li> <li>If alcohol use has become an immediate problem, a number of chemical dependence treatment programs are admitting in the community, and you can find them through <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" rel=\"noopener Administration</a>. </li> <li>If you want to know if your drinking is a problem, you can schedule an evaluation at Mayo Clinic or another program in your area. </li> <li>Recovery from alcohol, as some say, is a \"one-day-at-a-time adventure.\" Being sober is not the same thing as living in recovery. </li> <li>Social connection is one of the key components of recovery, due to the importance of ongoing support in making a decision and remaining abstinent. </li> </ul> <p>Why wait until drinking alcohol every day has a physiological addictive effect on your brain and you have to work harder to remain abstinent? Why not identify healthy coping skills now and decide to schedule activities in your day instead of taking a drink? Why not take a walk outside with your family, go for a bike ride or practice yoga.

Lydia is enjoying her life in full remission since her acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis in September 2012. </p> <p>While on a family trip to Sweden, Lydia began to feel extremely exhausted and eventually found she couldn't walk, so her dad carried her. Her parents thought she was suffering from anemia and fed her iron supplements. Once home, her doctor found her hemoglobin was at 4.6 \u2014 an extremely low and dangerous level. A bone marrow biopsy revealed cancer cells. She then underwent intense chemotherapy treatments at Mayo Clinic through January 2015. </p> <p>\"While being treated, I experienced a lot of issues due to the chemotherapy, including steroid-onset diabetes, kidney stones, a suppressed immune system and pancreatitis,\" says Lydia. \"I missed a lot of school and really missed hanging out with my friends.\"</p> <p>Detail-oriented, Lydia always wanted to know the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of how everything worked. Lydia says she was so impressed that her health care team addressed her in such an adult manner, although she was only 11. </p> <p>\"They all took their time with me and my parents, answering all of our questions,\" she says. \"They were all so wonderful to me in the hospital for my 12th birthday. The doctors and nurses made it extra special by decorating my room and writing 'Happy Birthday, Lydia' on my windows.\"</p> <p>Lydia enjoys swimming and has received wonderful support from her coach; this year, she's captain of her swim team. </p> <p>She responded to the chemo treatments very well, and shortly after beginning the treatment regimen, she was found to be in remission. On January 4, 2020, after five years of remission, she'll be completely healed and cancer-free. </p> <p>Having received many units of blood product during the course of her treatment, Lydia and her family are extremely grateful for the generosity shown by so many people who donated their blood in order to save Lydia's life. Symptom-free, Lydia currently advocates for our program by encouraging her friends to donate blood whenever Mayo Clinic's blood drive comes to their school.

These cold-weather activities can be dangerous, but you can reduce your risk of injury if you and your family take the proper safety precautions. </p> <p>Here are some tips: </p> <p><strong>Wear protection</strong></p> <p>Wear well-fitted protective gear that's lip balm, and wear sunglasses or goggles, to keep your skin, lips and eyes safe from the sun and wind. Even in the winter, your skin and eyes can be damaged by the sun, especially with the sun reflecting off the snow. </p> <p>Appropriately sized helmets are strongly encouraged during winter sports, especially in sledding, skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and snowmobiling. </p> <p><strong>Know your terrain</strong></p> <p>When participating in outdoor activities, be on the lookout for trees, people and other obstacles. Do not sled on hills near roads, parking lots, ponds or other obstacles on the sledding route. Find a sledding hill with a clear finish area without trees or other obstacles in the way. </p> <p>If you like to ice skate, you should do so in rinks, if possible, rather than ponds or other bodies of water. If you ice skate over a body of water, make sure the ice is thick enough to skate on. </p> <p>If you like to ski, pick a skiing hill that is appropriate for your skill level. Stay on designated skiing trails and courses. </p> <p><strong>Buddy up</strong></p> <p>Your child should never do any winter activities alone. Young children should always be supervised by an adult while doing outdoor winter activities. Older kids and teens should always have someone with them in case of injury, especially in the harsh, cold elements. It is best if they have access to a phone nearby to call for help if needed. </p> <p><strong>Learn from the pros</strong></p> <p>Lessons are strongly encouraged for beginner skiers and snowboarders. Be sure your child follows the instructions of his or her guide, instructor or coach to safely participate in outdoor winter activities. </p> <p>If you live in Minnesota, snowmobilers are required by law to take a snowmobile safety training course before operating a snowmobile. If you life elsewhere, you should familiarize yourself with your state's <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://files.dnr.state.mn.us/rlp/regulations/snowmobile/snowmobileregs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">snowmobile regulations</a> a snowmobile. </p> <p><strong>Stay moisture-wicking base. </li> <li><strong>Insulating layer:</strong> You should have at least one insulating layer between your base and top layers. </li> <li><strong>Top layer:</strong> Your top layer should be waterproof and windproof. </li> </ul> <p>Try to cover up as much of your child's exposed skin as possible to prevent cold injury, such as frostbite. Make sure clothing is replaced if it gets too wet and cold for the child. Wet gear causes a rapid loss of body heat and can lead to frostbite and hypothermia. Also, take frequent breaks to go inside to warm up, if needed. </p> <p>Don't forget to drink water before, during and after outdoor winter activities. It is easy to forget to drink fluids during winter sports, but it is just as important to stay hydrated during the winter as it is during hot weather. Staying well-hydrated will help maintain good circulation, and help your child stay warm and active. </p> <p><strong>Recognize hypothermia and frostbite</strong></p> <p>Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition that happens when someone's core body temperature gets too low. Due to a variety of reasons, children are more prone than adults to hypothermia. </p> <p>Suspect emergency care immediately if you suspect hypothermia. </p> <p>Frostbite is a cold injury to the skin, most commonly on extremities and exposed areas of skin, such as ears, nose, chin, hands and feet. Monitor your children for signs of frostbite. </p> <p>Skin numbness or stinging, or a tingling sensation, can be early signs of frostbite. If frostbite is suspected, warm skin up slowly in warm \u2014 not hot \u2014 water. If skin numbness doesn't go away \u2014 or if skin appears hard, waxy, white or grayish-yellow in appearance, with a lack of sensation \u2014 seek emergency care for frostbite. </p> <p>Watch closely for signs of hypothermia and frostbite in children who cannot communicate easily, such as young children or children with communication disabilities. </p> <p><strong>COVID-19 considerations</strong></p> <p>To reduce the spread of COVID-19, it's recommended that you wear a mask, even while exercising outdoors. As a side benefit, your face stays nice and warm under the mask. </p> <p>It is ideal to take part in these outdoor winter activities with only members of your own household, rather than people from multiple other households. If you participate in winter activities with other families, try to limit such participating to no more than two other families, and be sure to mask and stay appropriately distanced. Avoid sharing equipment with others. </p> <p>If you see another person on the trails or hill, mind your distance from them and try to safely move out of the way. Also, wash your hands frequently. </p> <p><strong>Seek care when concerned</strong></p> <p>It is particularly important for your child to stay healthy and active this winter season. Exposure to outdoor winter activities is a fun way for the whole family to stay active. </p> <p>Despite your best efforts to keep your kids safe this winter, they still may end up with an injury or ailment. If so, contact your health care provider promptly to ensure your child gets an appropriate evaluation and any treatment that he or she may need. </p> <p>Stay warm, stay safe, and have fun this winter. </p> <p><em><a href=\"/providers/luke-radel-md\">Dr. Luke Radel</a> practices in Mayo Clinic Primary Care's Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.

Go for a walk, climb the stairs, dance, swim, cross-country ski, work in the yard, or take a fitness class. It's not important what you do, but rather that you do it and do it regularly. </p> <p>The rule of thumb is at least 30 minutes five times a week. But you also can move in smaller doses more often, which can make it easier to work movement into your everyday life. </p> <p>Exercising lowers your blood pressure and reduces cholesterol, both of which can affect the blood vessels feeding your brain. Some research also has found that exercise can slow shrinking of the brain, which to some degree happens naturally with age. When more advanced, this shrinkage can be associated with conditions like Alzheimer's dementia. </p> <p><strong>Make your brain work</strong></p> <p>As with physical exercise there's no best activity to keep your mind sharp. Use the computer; do crossword, number or jigsaw puzzles; play cards and other games; knit; build something in your woodshop; read; brush up on your high school French; or discuss current events with a friend. </p> <p>A recent Mayo Clinic study found that people 70 or older with no cognitive issues who used a computer, completed craft projects, took part in social activities and played games had a lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment. Researchers followed nearly 2,000 cognitively normal participants for an average of four years. They discovered that taking part in these \"brain games\" one to two times a week reduced the risk of mild cognitive easy to become isolated as friends or family members move or pass away.

It's also the season of bee and other insect stings. About 5% of the population is allergic to insect stings, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. But most people aren't aware of their allergy until they're stung. </p> <p>Reactions to insect stings, including wasps, bees and hornets, range in severity from minor to potentially fatal. In most cases, bee and other stings are only annoying, causing a brief sharp pain, along with slight swelling and redness. Home treatment is all that's necessary to ease the pain. </p> <p>But if you're allergic or get stung numerous times, a more severe reaction \u2014 anaphylaxis \u2014 can require emergency attention. </p> <p><strong>What happens when you're stung? </strong></p> <p>When you're stung, your immune system produces immunoglobulin E antibodies, which react to the venom injected by the insect. This reaction triggers your body's release of histamine and other chemicals that can cause severe responses, such as: </p> <ul> <li>Itching and hives throughout the body. </li> the throat and tongue. </li> <li>Difficulty breathing. and nausea. </li> <li>Stomach cramps and diarrhea. </li> <li>Rapid fall in blood pressure, resulting in shock and possibly loss of consciousness. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Treating stings</strong></p> <p>After any sting, remove the stinger using your fingernails or tweezers as soon as you can. It takes only seconds for the venom to enter your body. Then wash the sting area with soap and water. </p> <p>If you notice a minor to moderate reaction, such as redness, warmth or swelling around the sting, apply a cold compress and take an over-the-counter oral antihistamine. You may want to apply hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion to ease any symptoms. </p> <p>If you have a more serious reaction to single or multiple bee stings, even if it's just one or two of the serious symptoms listed above, call 911. </p> <p><strong>Preventing stings</strong></p> <p>These tips can reduce your risk of getting stung by bees, hornets and wasps:</p> <ul> <li>Take care when drinking sweet beverages outside. Wide, open cups may be your best option because you can see if a bee is in them. Inspect cans and straws before drinking from them. </li> <li>Tightly cover food containers and trash cans. </li> <li>Clear away garbage, fallen fruit, and dog or other animal feces, as flies can attract wasps. </li> <li>Wear close-toed shoes when walking outside. </li> <li>Don't wear bright colors or floral prints, which can attract bees. </li> <li>Don't wear loose clothing, which can trap stinging insects between the cloth and your skin. </li> <li>When driving, keep your windows rolled up. </li> <li>Be careful when mowing the lawn or trimming vegetation, activities that might disturb a beehive or wasp nest. </li> <li>Have hives and nests near your home removed by a professional. </li> <li>If a few bees are flying around you, stay calm and slowly walk away. Swatting an insect may cause it to sting. </li> <li>If you are stung, or many insects start to fly around, cover your mouth and nose, and quickly leave the area. If you can, get into a building or closed vehicle. When a bee stings, it releases a chemical that attracts other bees. </li> </ul> <p>If you've experienced an allergic reaction to a bee, wasp or hornet sting, you should talk with your health care provider or an allergy specialist about prevention and treatment options. This could include being prescribed an emergency medication, such as an epinephrine autoinjector, to use if stung. In more severe cases, allergy shots may be a long-term solution for you. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internist in the Division of Community Internal Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota.

Constipation is when someone has difficulty either because bowel movements are infrequent or become hard to pass. </p> <p><strong>What is normal?</strong></p> <p>It is normal for people to have occasional constipation. Generally, we expect the average person to have at least three bowel movements per week. Normal bowel movements should be easy to pass without pain, straining or difficulty. Stools should be soft and not hard or lumpy. </p> <p><strong>What causes constipation?</strong></p> <p>Common factors leading to constipation include dehydration, reduced activity and low-fiber diets. However, there is a long list of other causes, including medications and conditions such as hypothyroidism, and even certain cancers. </p> <p><strong>How is constipation treated?</strong></p> <p>Treatment always depends on the cause. Generally, for occasional constipation, the first and most important treatment includes diet and activity. These changes can alleviate constipation and prevent it from returning. </p> <p>Maintain regular activity throughout the day, from taking walks to more vigorous exercise. Keeping your body moving keeps your bowels moving, too. </p> <p>Your diet should include a daily intake of high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. Some people choose to take over-the-counter fiber supplements. </p> <p>Hydration is key, as it helps keep stool soft and moving easily through the digestive system. Make sure to sip on fluids throughout the day and with every meal. </p> <p>Occasionally, people find benefit from over-the-counter laxatives, which come in many forms and can be effective. If changes in diet and activity are not enough, talk with your health care provider about whether this option is right for you. </p> <p><strong>When to be evaluated</strong></p> <p>A sudden change in bowel habits that persists and does not improve with diet and activity should be evaluated. Bleeding and pain should not be ignored and need to be discussed with your health care provider. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/michelle-duvall-md/\">Michelle Duvall, M.D.</a>, is a family medicine physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonConstipationPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. disease. Bones become brittle (\"thin\") and more likely to break (fracture). Everyone is at risk for developing this disease, although older, post-menopausal women are at highest risk. Some diseases, medications, smoking, and personal and family history of fractures also increase your risk. You can read more about these risk factors and how to prevent osteoporosis in half of all women will suffer a fracture of the spine, hip or wrist due to osteoporosis, while up to one-quarter of men over age 50 will fracture their hip or spine. Given these statistics, it's important to maintain bone health and detect and treat bone loss early. Here are answers to questions patients frequently ask about screening and treatment of osteoporosis.</p> <p><strong>Q: When should I be screened?<br /> </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In our practice, we recommend that women who are post-menopausal and age 65 or older should be tested. We also screen men age 70 and older. Younger women and men also may need to be screened if they have risk factors for osteoporosis or fractures.</p> <p><strong>Q: What does testing for osteoporosis entail?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> A bone-density test is the most common way to diagnose bone loss. The test is an x-ray of the spine and hip, taken at a certified radiology center. If you have an artificial hip or arthritis in your hip or spine, another option is to use the wrist. It is possible to measure bone density at other sites, like the heel or finger, but these tests, along with ultrasounds, are a lot less useful and reliable.</p> <p><strong>Q: What results will I get from the test?</strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>A bone-density test will provide your actual bone density at each measured location, and calculate a T-score and a Z-score.</p> <p><strong>T-score</strong> tells how your bone density compares to an average healthy young adult of your sex. A normal T-score falls between -1 and +1. Anything outside of that range is abnormal, and fracture risk increases as the T-score decreases:</p> <ul> <li>-1 to -2.5 indicates osteopenia and more negative indicates osteoporosis</li> </ul> <p><strong>Z-score</strong> compares your bone density with what is normal for someone of your age, sex, weight and race/ethnicity.</p> <p><strong>Q: How is osteoporosis treated?</strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Treating osteoporosis, as well as osteopenia, involves lifestyle, diet and medications. I recommend lifestyle and dietary modifications to everyone with, or at risk for, osteoporosis. These include: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Get enough Vitamin D.</strong> Have your Vitamin D level tested. It should be between 30-50 ng/mL. If low, you can eat more D-fortified foods such as dairy products and usually also take over-the-counter supplements of 800-1000 international units/day of Vitamin D2 or D3.</li> <li><strong>Get enough calcium. </strong>Calcium is the building block for bone. If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, you should be getting about 1,200 mg/day through diet or a supplement.</li> <li><strong>Get at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise/day. </strong>This can be as simple as walking and does not need to be vigorous. Activities that do not work against gravity, such as biking or swimming, are not weight-bearing.</li> <li><strong>Stop <p>The decision to start a medication is more difficult because, even though medications for treating osteoporosis generally are very safe, effective and affordable, they still have some risks. They may be started if their benefits (much lower risk of fractures) outweigh these risks. You should discuss all options with your health care provider.</p> <p><strong>Q: What drugs are used for treating osteoporosis?</strong></p> <p><strong>A: </strong>There are several prescription medications that treat osteoporosis and reduce risk of fractures. There are advantages and disadvantages to each one. You'll need to discuss these options with your provider to determine what will work best for you.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bisphosphonate medications</strong> have the best scientific evidence for effectively reducing vertebral, nonvertebral (wrist, etc.), and hip fractures in both men and women. These include <strong>alendronate (Fosamax)</strong>, a tablet taken one time/week; <strong>risedronate (Actonel)</strong>, a tablet usually taken weekly or monthly; and <strong>zoledronic acid (Reclast)</strong>, a quick intravenous infusion that is given once a year.</li> <li><strong>Denosumab (Prolia)</strong> is an injection given once every six months and can be used safely by patients with more advanced chronic kidney disease.</li> <li><strong>Teriparatide (Forteo)</strong> is the only medication that builds new bone. It is a self-administered injection given two times/day. It must be followed by either a bisphosphonate or denosumab to solidify the newly built bone.</li> <li><strong>Raloxifene (Evista)</strong> is a non-hormonal, estrogen-like medication that can reduce risk of vertebral fractures in women. However, it does not lower risk of non-vertebral or hip fractures.</li> <li><strong>Estrogen therapy</strong> for post-menopausal women, and testosterone therapy for men, is controversial and not recommended for treatment of osteoporosis because of the potential harm for older women and men. This is different for young women who experienced early menopause, and men who experienced hypogonadism; in these cases, hormone therapy may be beneficial for reasons other than bone health.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q: Do I need to take osteoporosis medications for the rest of my life?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Just like the decision to start an osteoporosis medication, the decision of when to stop it - take a \"drug holiday\" - is a personal one and should be discussed in depth with your provider. I generally advise that lifestyle and dietary approaches continue indefinitely.</p> <p>To learn more about risk factors, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia, visit the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/home/ovc-20207808\">Mayo Clinic website</a>.</p> <p><em>Dr. Rozalina McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician in the Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM) in Rochester.

These illnesses are the result of six outbreaks in 10 states. Two outbreaks have been going on since 2018. </p> <p>Outbreaks like these affect all of us. Not only can measles be miserable for those suffering from them, they also can be fatal and lead to complications lasting months to a lifetime. These outbreaks are expensive because: </p> <ul> <li>Up to one third of patients with measles require hospitalization and others may need ongoing health care. </li> <li>Measles is the most contagious disease known. How contagious? If you aren't immune to measles and are in the same room as a person with measles, you have a 90% chance of developing the illness. After a person with measles leaves the room, the air remains infected and contagious for two hours. So we spend a lot of money limiting outbreaks. This calls for tracking down every individual exposed to that infected person, as well as finding the person who gave <em>that</em> person measles. The cost averages $20,000 for each individual with measles, not counting the cost of caring for the ill individual. </li> </ul> <p>What can you do about these outbreaks? Make sure you and the members of your family are immune to measles. What counts as immune varies depending on the person's age and occupation. </p> <ul> <li>Written documentation of adequate vaccination: one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not at high risk</li> <li>Written documentation of two doses of measles-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk, including college students, health care personnel and international travelers</li> <li>Laboratory evidence of </ul> <p>If you can't find the vaccine records, repeat the vaccines.

If you're not familiar with what your teen is using, check these out:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\" target=\"_parent\">TikTok</a>. All the rage, this platform features 30-second videos created by users. They run the gamut from showing off dance moves to making art to adorable pets to how-tos for just about anything. School teachers and pediatricians are jumping onto TikTok to get out the message about a lesson, vaccinations target=\"_blank\">Snapchat</a>. It's all about photos, adding artwork and playing games. Originally, the posts only lasted for a set amount of time, now they can be saved and shared. Users can create \"streaks,\" almost like the old-fashioned chain letter, but no one wants to break the streak, which makes it especially hard for parents trying for a social media holiday. on any topic under the sun, from silly jokes to poems, users connect with others who share their interests. If teens aren't able to find a community in real life, Tumblr is one place they can find app has been around a while, it's still popular. But what you see on your teen's public Instagram posts might not be all they're sharing. They may have created a \"finsta\", or \"fake Insta\", a private Instagram account that's only open to a select group of friends outside the view of parents. </li> </ul> <p>Social media is a tool that's neither good nor bad. But it's very powerful. It can encourage social behavior, activism, finding a cause that means something to your child, or connecting with a community that shares their interests, which can be a huge plus for kids who feel marginalized in any way. Social media also can lead to cyberbullying, sexting, revenge porn, and more, that can ruin their reputation now and into their professional adult life. </p> <p>It's recommended that pediatricians talk about internet and social media use at every well-child visit, starting when kids reach middle school. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Message for parents:</strong> If you allow your child to have social media, even if it's just text or email, you should have your child's user names and passwords for devices, sites and apps. This can be negotiated as kids near 18. </li> <li><strong>Message for teens:</strong> Everything you put online, even if you think it's private, becomes public. If you wouldn't put it on a bulletin board at school, don't put it on social media. One of the reasons your parents should be involved, is so that if anything you've received bothers you or is inappropriate, you can take it to them. They can take a screenshot and alert the authorities, if necessary. </li> <li><strong>Message for both:</strong> Cell phones and screens shouldn't be in your room. Putting it in another room, especially when you're ready for bed, creates separation and reduces the pressure to respond. And it lets you get the sleep you that focuses on teens' use of social media. Currently, it's only available for community showings, in order to stimulate discussion. Here's where you can find information your kids about social media use and stay engaged with them about it. It's your role as a parent to encourage what's good about these platforms and protect your teen from what's bad.

There also are easy-to-use independent online sites and apps.</li> <li><strong>Watch the portions.</strong> Some menus have \"senior\" or \"lighter side\" offerings that tend to be smaller. Consider splitting an entr\u00e9e. Or ask for a to-go box as soon as your meal arrives; split everything in half and set aside to take home. </li> <li><strong>Watch your kids' portions.</strong> Just because kids can eat adult food, doesn't mean they should eat adult portions. Share meals, take some home or ask for kid-sized portions. </li> <li><strong>Control your order.</strong> Ask for dressing and mayo on the side, dry toast (then you control the amount of spread put on it), order egg-white omelets, choose grilled over fried or breaded. </li> <li><strong>Beware of before-meal extras</strong> like baskets of chips or popcorn, breadsticks and endless refills of beverages. Noshing on these meal starters can add 300-500 calories on top of those for your entr\u00e9e. </li> <li><strong>Build your own meal around a carryout entr\u00e9e.</strong> Try ordering a smaller pizza (remember those portions) and rustle up your own sides at home such as baby carrots and fruit cups or grapes and assorted olives. </li> <li><strong>Share desserts.</strong> Everyone gets a taste without putting a bite in their calories for the day. </li> </ul> <p>Save eating our or picking up carryout for special occasions or as a treat. When you cook at home, it's easier to make healthy choices \u2014 and it's easier on your budget. </p> <p><em>Michaeleen Burroughs, RDN, LD, has worked at Employee and Community Health (ECH) in Family Medicine for 20 years.

These FAQs can help you determine if, who and when screening for lung cancer might be needed. </p> <p><strong>Who should be screened?</strong></p> <p>Smoking is a recognized risk factor for lung cancer. The number of pack years of smoking and current smoking status help determine your risk for lung cancer. For example, one pack year is equal to smoking one pack per day for one year, or two packs per day for half a year. If you're currently a smoker, or have smoked more than 30 pack years, talk to your provider to see if you need to be screened for lung cancer. </p> <p><strong>When should you be screened?</strong></p> <p>Calculators have been developed to help your doctor determine if you should have a low-dose CT scan. While there are many guidelines and not all experts agree, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual screening with low-dose CT for smokers or individuals who: </p> <ul> <li>Have quit less than 15 years ago</li> <li>Have a 30 pack year smoking history</li> <li>Are between the ages of 55 and 80\\</li> </ul> <p>Other groups recommend stopping screening at ages 74 to 77. An important consideration when deciding whether or not to get a CT scan is your general health and life expectancy. </p> <p><strong>What type of screening is used? </strong></p> <p>Currently, only low-dose CT scanning is recommended for lung-cancer screening. Chest x-rays aren't sensitive and specific enough to detect lung cancer early enough to make a difference and prevent death from lung cancer. </p> <p>But the best thing for you to do if you smoke is to stop, which reduces your risk for developing lung cancer. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md\">Dr. Denise Dupras</a> is a general internist in Employee and Community Health's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

Yet, statistics tell a different story. </p> <ul> <li>Human trafficking is an emerging global public health problem, most often affecting women and children. </li> <li>Supply and demand influence human trafficking. It's considered a \"low risk\" crime by perpetrators because it's so under-recognized. </li> <li>The profits are high, estimated at $150 billion worldwide. </li> <li>The United States is the second-largest sex trafficking market in the world, with thousands of cases reported every year. </li> <li>According to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, the state recorded the nation's third-highest rate of human trafficking in 2015. </li> </ul> <p>However, many more cases go unreported or unrecognized. Most of these victims aren't being plucked off the street and tied up in a basement somewhere, as is often portrayed in television shows and images. When popular media portrays the minority of cases, it's easy to see how we have a problem identifying victims of sex trafficking. </p> <p><strong>What is sex trafficking?</strong></p> <p>While there is overlap with prostitution, sex trafficking involves a third party who benefits from the sale of sex. These crimes can be hard to prosecute, but state and federal laws are evolving \u2014 for the better. The Trafficking Victims' Protection Act of 2000, which has been reauthorized several times, is the primary tool in the U.S. for combating human trafficking. Minnesota's Safe Harbor Law, passed in 2011, removed the criminal status for victims under age 24 engaged in the sale of illegal sex, and instead strengthened penalties for adult buyers exploiting minors. </p> <p><strong>What are the risk factors?</strong></p> <p>Risks for people being sex trafficked include living in poverty, young age, racial or ethnic marginalization, history of abuse or exploitation, intellectual or physical disability, isolation, chemical dependency, lack of a support system, immigration status, fleeing a crisis situation, identifying as LGBTQ, being homeless or a runaway, and/or having criminal record/juvenile delinquency. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimated in 2016 that one in six endangered runaways reported to them were likely sex trafficking victims. </p> <p><strong>What are the signs or symptoms?</strong></p> <p>Victims of trafficking are at risk for a number of physical and behavioral health problems. The trafficked person's \"employer\" wants them to be healthy, so they do seek care at clinics. However, health care providers, as well as others, often fail to recognize the signs and symptoms of at-risk individuals and miss the opportunity to rescue victims. </p> <p>Whether you're a concerned family member, health care provider, friend or neighbor, symptoms that trafficked people have may be vague and non-specific. In a 2008 study, 63% of trafficked individuals complained of 10 or more symptoms including headaches, fatigue, dizzy spells, back pain, memory difficulty, abdominal or pelvic pain, and gynecologic infections. Signs include: </p> <ul> make eye contact. </li> <li>Dressing inappropriately for their age, setting, or the weather. </li> <li>Offering stories and explanations that may not add up or seem scripted; a companion may do much of the talking. </li> <li>Having a pattern of mysterious injuries, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy terminations. </li> <li>Displaying tattoos, also called simply \"just leave.\" They've experienced severe trauma. The perpetrator may control their housing and money, as well as many other tactics to maintain control. Victims may be unaware of their rights and fear prosecution. </p> <p><strong>What are the resources for victims?</strong></p> <p>Resources for victims of sex trafficking include social services. Victims' services advocates may help meet their physical needs, such as clothing, safety and housing, as well as provide emotional and psychological support. Child protective services, if appropriate, also may help. </p> <p><strong>What can you do?</strong></p> <p>If you're concerned about an individual, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline at <a href=\"tel:18883737888\">1-888-373-7888</a> or text \"BeFree\" to 233733.

We all want our children to be as well prepared for the future as possible, but with adolescents, it's often tricky finding a balance between giving them enough support and letting them make their own decisions (and mistakes!). </p> <p>Here are some suggestions for helping your young adult on their journey to independence \u2014 and taking charge of their own health. </p> <p><strong>Be prepared</strong></p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends all young adults see their primary provider before heading to college or moving away. This will help them make a successful transition to taking over their own care. At this visit your young adult will be able to: </p> <ul> <li>Receive recommended vaccines. </li> <li>Get help with planning for future evaluations of chronic health conditions, such as ADHD. </li> <li>Renew medications they may need to take with them. </li> <li>Discuss contraception and important sexual health issues and practices. </li> <li>Talk about the increased accessibility and risks with alcohol, drugs and sexual activity. </li> <li>Address healthy relationships and ways to avoid or prevent situations that increase the risk of sexual assault. </li> <li>Review the importance of continuing daily healthy eating and exercise. </li> <li>Get help setting up online access. This will be important if they need to reach their regular provider for questions and advice. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Be knowledgeable</strong></p> <p>If they haven't already, make sure your young adult is starting to take charge of their health and has researched their new home-away-from-home. Make sure they know:</p> <ul> <li>What health services are offered, on and off campus, in their community and where they are located. </li> <li>Where the nearest outpatient care area and Emergency Department are located if they need immediate care. </li> <li>Their health insurance coverage and information. They should know how it works and have documentation or a card with them. </li> <li>The names, dosages and side effects of the medications they take. Also, where the nearest pharmacy is in case they need a refill. </li> <li>All the facts about their medical conditions or health issues, if they have them. They should be able to provide this information if they are seen in another facility. </li> <li>Where to get help with concerns with mood, homesickness, feeling sad, or other social situations. Help them locate the college health center or counseling services on campus or in their new community. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Be safe</strong></p> <p>Don't shy away from talking about drugs, alcohol, relationships and sex. New pressures will arise, and you want your child to have a plan for when they're on their own and can't use their parents as an excuse to get out of tricky situations. Make it a conversation, not a lecture, and do your best to withhold judgment about what peers are doing. </p> <p>Expect lots of requests for friend time. It's normal for your teen to want to spend all their time with friends. When they're on their own, almost all interactions will be with peers, and they need to practice skills for navigating these relationships. Don't take it personally when they don't want to hang with their parents. However, set aside family time, such as meals, to stay connected and build your relationship. </p> <p>If your young adult is away and can only come home periodically, make sure to check in, especially within the first month to find out how they're doing academically and emotionally. It's normal for them to miss home or feel a little lost. However, if these feelings are getting in the way of their studies or ability to function, make sure they seek help. </p> <p><strong>Be successful</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Encourage problem solving.</strong> Don't automatically jump in with a suggestion or solution when your child comes to you with a problem. Prompt them to think through their options and weigh pros and cons. Let them know you will support them whatever choice they make, but understand that mistakes are the best teachers. However, don't pay for those mistakes and don't bail them out from the consequences. </li> <li><strong>Decrease your financial support.</strong> If you haven't already, have your teen take some financial responsibility for themselves. Start with gas and entertainment, then move on to other expenses. This will help them understand the cost of living when they are no longer at home. It also sends the message that you view them as able to take on increasing responsibility. </li> <li><strong>Help your child define success.</strong> What leads them to feel their life has value? Help your young adult weigh the importance of the different aspects of their life \u2014 income and money, relationships, career, health, family, spirituality and leisure. Avoid instilling fear and competition in them. Instead, do your best to convey excitement and a sense of adventure for what lies ahead, as well as your confidence in their ability to manage their lives successfully. </li> </ul> <p><em>Hannah Mulholland, LICSW, is a clinical social worker serving children and adolescents in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH). </em></p> <p><em>Cassandra Narr, APRN, CNP, is a nurse practitioner caring for children and adolescents in ECH's Division of Community Pediatric and alt=\"ECH_college_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />These tips can help you support your young adult in taking charge of their own health and well-being. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCollege TipsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Craig the most common mental health condition in the United States, affecting nearly 30% of the population at some point in their lifetime. The most common anxiety disorders are specific phobias, which affect 19 million people and social anxiety disorder, affecting 15 million. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is the least common, affecting 2 million people each year, yet it can be one of the most impairing. The answers to these frequently asked questions can help you gain a better understanding of these disorders and their treatment. </p> <p><strong>Q: Where do anxiety disorders come from?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Anxiety disorders typically come from a combination of biological, environmental and learned factors. Certain anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder, tend to run in families. Sometimes, certain health conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and asthma, may mimic symptoms of anxiety or make existing anxiety problems worse. Environmental stress can also lead to the onset of anxiety disorders. Other anxiety disorders may be due to negative learning experiences. </p> <p><strong>Q: What are the different types of anxiety disorders?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> These are the types of phobias providers see most often:</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Specific phobias:</strong> This of:</p> <ul> <li style=\"margin-left: as dogs or storms or the dark</li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Medical situations, such as of blood</li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Individuals with a specific phobia will often experience significant anxiety, even at the thought of managing the triggers for their fears. Avoiding triggers for their phobia is also very common. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Separation anxiety disorder:</strong> This type of anxiety involves intense dread and worry about being away from caregivers and loved ones. Uncertainty about their absence can feel intolerable and multiple attempts at seeking reassurance \u2014 think phone calls or texts \u2014 may be common. Although this tends to be more likely in children, adults can also experience significant anxiety over separation from others. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder:</strong> This type of anxiety involves difficulties controlling worry. Individuals worry about a wide variety of situations, such as health, finances, relationships, work or school. Their worry tends to jump to the worst-case scenarios, they assume these situations are likely to happen, and they doubt their ability to copy with them if they occur. Muscle tension and sleep disruption are also commonly associated with excessive worry. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Panic disorder:</strong> This type of anxiety involves the experience of intense surges of physical anxiety, such as rapid heart rate, difficulties breathing, chest tightness, lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating and tingling in the hands and feet. It's also common to experience significant worry over what these symptoms mean, such as fear of losing control or having a heart attack/stroke. Panic attacks can be triggered by specific situations, but they may also seemingly come out of the blue, even waking people up in the middle of the night. The anxiety tends to be about the fear of fear-related symptoms. Avoiding situations because of fear of having these attacks and seeking emergency medical care can be common. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Social anxiety disorder:</strong> This type of anxiety involves fears of being negatively evaluated or criticized by others. Worries over making mistakes and embarrassing oneself tend to be common. Individuals often experience significant anticipatory dread even before getting into social situations. They may replay their performance in a negative way after these situations are over, even if nothing objectively negative happened. Avoiding social situations can be common. Social anxiety is often associated with an increased risk for depression. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder:</strong> This type of anxiety involves the experience of recurring, intrusive and unwanted thoughts or images (obsessions) and engaging in behaviors to try to reduce or eliminate anxiety (compulsions). Common obsessions include fears of getting contaminated; doubting whether they did something correctly; worry about losing control and causing harm to others; and intrusions related to sexual, moral or religious themes. Most of the time, compulsions are related to the obsessions, such as washing excessively to eliminate fear of contamination, repeatedly checking door locks when feeling doubtful, and praying when experiencing religious intrusions. However, other compulsions can involve more rule-governed, superstition-like behaviors, such as having to get dressed in a particular way, counting in groups of threes, or having to repeat phrases over and over until they sound \"just right\". </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder:</strong> With this form of anxiety, individuals experience extreme distress in reaction to an event that involved the threat of death, violence or serious injury. A variety of symptoms can be common, including re-experiencing the event(s) in the form of flashbacks and nightmares; being easily startled and hypervigilant to one's surroundings; having mood changes; and avoiding situations or reminders of the traumatic event(s). </p> <p><strong>Q: What happens if anxiety disorders aren't treated?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The annual estimated cost of untreated anxiety disorders is approximately $60 billion due to lost wages, unemployment and health care. In comparison to those without anxiety disorders, individuals who experience them are at greater risk for depression and substance abuse. </p> <p><strong>Q: How are these disorders treated?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Anxiety disorders are very treatable mental health conditions. Unfortunately, only about one-third of individuals are receiving evidence-based care for their condition. The most effective treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication management. CBT is a skills-based approach in which individuals learn to gain control over their anxiety by facing their fears (exposure therapy) and directly challenging negative beliefs (cognitive reframing). The most common medications used to treat anxiety disorders are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). </p> <p><strong>Q: How do I get help?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Talk with your health care provider about effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Many primary care teams are skilled in treating these disorders with medication strategies. When looking for psychotherapy, be a good consumer of your care and ask to work with a clinician skilled in CBT. CBT providers will often assign homework between sessions, which is extremely important in your recovery.

While products containing ibuprofen, including Advil and Motrin, and naproxen, such as Aleve, are effective pain relievers, they also have several safety concerns. </p> <ul> <li>Bleeding is a common and potentially serious side effect. </li> <li>NSAIDs increase your risk for ulcers in the stomach and intestine, which also may be related to serious bleeding. </li> <li>They may affect blood flow to the kidneys and cause damage, particularly in people with underlying kidney disease and/or taking other medications with this risk factor. </li> <li>NSAIDs may increase fluid retention and can lead to increased blood pressure, which may be particularly unsafe for people with heart failure. </li> <li>\"Rebound headaches,\" also known as medication overuse headaches are daily headaches that may be due to frequent NSAID use. </li> <li>NSAIDs may increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. The risk increases with higher doses or extended use. </li> </ul> <p>Talk to your care team about NSAIDs if you take blood thinners or have been diagnosed with heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, heart failure, kidney disease, asthma or have had gastric bypass surgery. If you take an NSAID more than 15 days a month for headaches, discuss alternative strategies for managing them. </p> <p><strong>Aspirin</strong></p> <p>While some people have been prescribed or recommended to take aspirin daily, the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/aspirin-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease-preventive-medication\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force</a> provides guidance on who may benefit most from daily aspirin for disease <em>prevention</em>. </p> <p>Consider discussing aspirin use with your care team if you do not have a personal history of heart disease and are younger than 50 or over 70 years old. For those between 50 and 70, the decision to take aspirin depends on your risk factors. Taking aspirin daily, even low-dose or \"baby\" aspirin, may increase your risk for serious bleeding. This risk increases if you also take blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medication or even other OTC medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Be sure to review your personal need for aspirin with your care team if you also take blood thinners. </p> <p><strong>Acetaminophen</strong></p> <p>Acetaminophen is found in more than 600 OTC products. A common brand name is Tylenol\u00ae. Often, acetaminophen is the primary ingredient in multi-ingredient OTC products. It can also be found in some prescription medications abbreviated as APAP, Mapap or Q-Pap. </p> <p>While risk is low for acetaminophen interacting with prescription medications, people may unintentionally exceed safe doses when combining various OTC and/or prescription sources of acetaminophen. This may lead to serious liver damage. </p> <p>Talk with your care team about safe use of acetaminophen if you have been diagnosed with a headache disorder, liver disease or consume three or more alcoholic beverages per day. </p> <p><strong>Pediatric dosing</strong></p> <p>Pediatric formulations of pain medications may be more prone to accidental dosing errors. Be sure to read the package instructions every time. Formulations may change or look similar but be different concentrations of similar products. Be sure the active ingredient is the one you intended to give. Use the correct dosing device and measure carefully. </p> <p>If you are uncertain of the package instructions, ask for clarification at the pharmacy counter. Heed the \"Keep out of reach of children\" warning; many flavored OTC medications may be enticing to little ones. </p> <p><strong>Read the labels</strong></p> <p>Read all OTC product labels carefully, especially for the active ingredient. Use this <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/UnderstandingOver-the-CounterMedicines/ucm277845.htm#checklist\" target=\"_blank\">checklist</a> when shopping for OTC medications to be sure you're familiar with the package label and important information. When starting a new prescription medication, be sure to discuss with your care team if it is compatible with the OTC medications you're currently using. </p> <p><em>Laurie Danielson, PharmD, RPh, is a clinical pharmacist working in Family Medicine in the Baldwin Building.

This reaction can be both physical and emotional. What stresses us is very individualized; what triggers stress in you may not bother someone else. Everyone experiences stress as we learn to navigate life. As we go along, we learn what we can add to our plate, when we have too much to manage and how to set boundaries with ourselves and others. Balance is an important part of stress management. </p> <p><strong>Good vs. bad stress</strong></p> <p>Stress is a natural part of life, and not all stress is bad. Stress can motivate us to achieve our goals, help us stay focused and give us the energy to get stuff done. For example, if we didn't feel stress, we wouldn't worry about being late to work or school or finishing a school project on time. </p> <p>Positive stress includes changes in our life that fill us with excitement, such as the first day of school, learning a new hobby, going on vacation, having a child and moving. </p> <p>Bad stress, also known as \"distress', is what weighs on us, brings our mood down, drains our energy and seeps into many areas of our life. This stress may feel burdensome, ongoing and relentless. Examples of negative stress include abrupt or unforeseen life changes such as losing a job, failing a class, breaking up/divorcing or the death of a loved one. </p> <p>Stress comes from what happens around us or to us, as well as our thoughts and feelings. Brain research has revealed that negative thoughts will trigger stress, and our brains are drawn to negativity. That's why fears/phobias, overthinking, perfectionism and unrealistic or irrational expectations can stress us out. </p> <p><strong>Signs of stress</strong></p> <p>Physical signs of stress range from headaches or stomachaches to chest pain or fatigue or difficulty sleeping. Sleep issues can include trouble falling and staying asleep, oversleeping, waking up and being unable to fall back to sleep. </p> <p>Stress in children may show itself in different ways than adults. Sleep issues may relate to anxiety, while being irritable may be a sign of depression or stress. </p> <p>Emotionally, stress exhibits itself enjoyment or motivation</li> <li>Crying and more often than usual or when angry</li> <li>Trouble concentrating and and stress</strong></p> <p>Kids experience stress, too. But t may be harder for them to handle it because they don't have the life lessons and skills learned by adults. Educating kids on how to manage stress is vital for developing positive mental health. </p> <p>Helping your child cope with stress can be difficult, and it's tempting to take on their challenges and help them feel better faster. However, learning to manage stress in a healthy way is an important lesson, and one they'll need throughout their lives. </p> <p>A few tips to help your kids manage stress include: </p> <ul> <li>Modeling healthy ways to manage stress; they learn from watching you. </li> <li>Voicing your feelings about work, family, etc. (\"I felt frustrated today when my boss sprung a new assignment on me\") and demonstrating a healthy way to manage it. (\"I think I'll go for a run to get it out of my system.\")</li> <li>Asking your kids for specifics about their day to avoid the \"How was your day?\" \"Fine.\" cycle. Use open-ended prompts like, \"Tell me about something difficult that happened today.\"</li> <li>Being careful about accidentally invalidating your child's distress. It can be tempting to respond to your child's concern by problem-solving or pointing out why it's \"not so bad.\" Instead, listen empathically and allow them to have negative emotions. </li> </ul> <p>Raising kids can be the most rewarding and challenging thing we do. Being a parent is a second job on top of our daily routines and commitments and can be overwhelming. As a parent or caregiver, you need to take care of yourself, to be the \"best you\" for your loved ones, so don't forget about your own stress management. </p> <ul> <li>Make time for yourself. Take a break by exercising, going for a walk, reading, socializing with friends or practicing mindfulness. </li> <li>Use your support system. </li> <li>Reach out for professional help.

Your child's provider and care team rely on your observations of your child, as well as those from family and anyone who cares for your child. While every child develops at their own rate \u2014 some leap ahead, some make slow-but-sure progress \u2014 there are general milestones your child should reach around certain ages. </p> <p>The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) offers <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/\" target=\"_blank\">checklists</a> for following your child's developmental milestones from ages two months to five years, including tips for how you can help them learn and grow and when to talk with your pediatrician if they seem to be falling behind. </p> <p>Some developmental issues to watch for include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Speech delay.</strong> Children usually say their first word between 12 and 15 months. By 18 months they should be saying a few words. For the next six months, your child will undergo rapid progress in their speech. </li> <li><strong>Gross- or fine-motor delays.</strong> Walking usually gets underway by 15 to 16 months of age. Your child also should be starting to put on their clothes, fasten buttons and pick up small items. </li> <li><strong>Non-typical behaviors.</strong> These can range from throwing long tantrums a number of times a day and not calming down afterward to being more aggressive or over active to making unusual body movements like hand flapping or head banging. Typically these behaviors are daily struggles for parents, not just once in a while. </li> <li><strong>Sensory sensitivities.</strong> The issues include being sensitive to sounds (covering their ears when the toilet flushes or the blender runs), clothes/shoes (don't like tags or the feel of certain fabrics) and foods (texture, temperature, etc.). </li> </ul> <p>One of the best things you can do for your child's health and development is to keep your eyes open, be sure to go to all the recommended well-child visits and speak up if you sense something isn't quite right with your child. </p> <p>If there is a problem, the earlier your child's care team is notified, the better the outcomes. They may decide to watch it for a while and document it to see if it persists. Ideally, a diagnosis is made by the time your child is two or three. </p> <p>Employee and Community Health (ECH) has an Integrated Community Specialties (ICS) clinic especially devoted to helping parents and kids (ages nine months to four years 11 months) address developmental delays. The ICS connects them with the appropriate resources and therapies, whether it's speech, physical or occupational therapy or behavioral training for parents.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonChild DevelopmentPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. 10 Americans - 30 million people - has diabetes, and one in four don't know they have it. If you're over 65, your chance of having diabetes is 25%. Most people with diabetes - 95% - have type 2, which is a chronic disease caused by progressive resistance to insulin. Type 1 diabetes, caused by your body's inability to make insulin, accounts for most of the remaining cases. </p> <p>Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease caused by a variety of personal, lifestyle, environmental and genetic causes. Because it's possible to change many of the risk factors for diabetes, the disease can be delayed, prevented and sometimes even reversed. This is why it's so important to understand what contributes to the development of diabetes and know whether or not you have, or are at risk for, it. </p> <p>With prediabetes, blood glucose is elevated above normal - fasting blood sugar less than 100 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c less than 5.7%. But it's still lower than it would be for diabetes - fasting blood sugar above 125 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c above 6.4%. One in three American adults has prediabetes, but fewer than 12% know it. Prediabetes will progress to diabetes over time if the risk factors aren't identified and addressed. </p> <p>If you have prediabetes, losing a small amount of weight - as little as 5-7% of your body weight (10-14 pounds for a 200-pound person) - and getting regular physical activity (30 minutes a day, five days a week) can lower your risk for developing type 2 diabetes. </p> <p>In addition, these positive lifestyle changes to lower your risk of type 2 diabetes also would improve the overall physical and emotional well-being of you and your family. </p> <p><strong>Take a quick quiz</strong></p> <p>The American Diabetes Association has developed a quick quiz to help you determine if you're at risk for diabetes. You can take it <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.diabetes.org/risk-test\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and calculate your score. The higher your score, the higher your risk of having or developing type 2 diabetes. If you scored five or higher, talk with your health care provider to learn whether being screened with a fasting blood sugar test is right for you. </p> <p>Remember, you can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes with simple, proven lifestyle changes. There are many ways to lead a healthier life, but they all involve being physically active, maintaining a healthy weight and eating a nutritious, balanced diet. Your health care provider and team are there to help, along with a number of community-based health promotion programs like the Diabetes Prevention Program. </p> <p><em>Dr. Rozalina McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Primary Care Internal Medicine (PCIM).

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCore ExercisesPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Christina component of traditional Chinese medicine that originated more than 2,500 years ago. It involves inserting hair-thin needles into specific points along your body's energy meridians, called acupoints. </p> <p>The philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine focuses on maneuvers to balance life energy or Qi (pronounced \"Chee\"), which is considered vital to health and function, and often is described as blocked, depleted or in excess when disease-specific conditions and symptoms surface. This mechanism often is difficult to study, and exactly how it works is not fully understood. </p> <p>The practice of acupuncture varies, depending on whether stimulation of the needles is manual or electrical, if ear acupuncture also is used, how long the needles are inserted, and the frequency of treatments. </p> <p><strong>How does acupuncture work to relieve pain? </strong></p> <p>According to the principles of the gate control theory of pain, inserting these needles stimulates pain fibers that close the pain gates in the central nervous system so the pain stimulus is not transmitted to the thalamus, which is located in the brain, and acts as the center for pain perception. </p> <p>Biochemical evidence shows that acupuncture also increases the activity of the opioidergic system, releasing natural endorphins like serotonin, dopamine, neutrophins and nitric oxide, which may be effective in treating chronic pain and headache disorders. </p> <p><strong>What is acupuncture used to treat? </strong></p> <p>Acupuncture has been used for both acute and chronic health conditions. The goal is to promote and restore the balance of energy and improve overall health and well-being. The benefits of acupuncture can extend to a wide variety of conditions, including emotional disorders (anxiety, depression); neurological conditions, such as migraines or Parkinson's disease; or as a rehabilitation strategy for individuals who suffered a stroke. </p> <p>It also can be beneficial for digestive issues, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and pain conditions due to injury or related to chronic inflammatory/degenerative disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. </p> <p>Acupuncture has been used for many women's health issues, such as hot flashes, gynecologic disorders and infertility. In addition, it has been beneficial for reducing fatigue and addictive behaviors, such as smoking. In terms of insurance coverage, Medicare now covers acupuncture for the indication of back pain. Otherwise, call your insurance provider to find out if your plan covers acupuncture for your condition. </p> <p><strong>Are there risks involved?</strong></p> <p>Overall, the risks of acupuncture are very low if you are treated by a certified and experienced acupuncture practitioner. The needles are sterile and disposable to reduce infection risks. Possible side effects include minor issues, such as soreness or bruising at the needle sites. Injury may occur if the needles are pushed in too deeply (particularly in the lung), however this is extremely rare. </p> <p>Before undergoing a treatment, let your practitioner know if you are pregnant, have a pacemaker or suffer from any bleeding disorders so your treatment may be designed to your specific needs in a safe manner. </p> <p><strong>Will it hurt?</strong></p> <p>Acupuncture treatments should not be a painful experience. Initially, you may feel a small prick when the needle is inserted, but then you should feel a sensation of pressure, soreness, a deep ache or warmth when the needle is stimulated. This means it has made contact with the QI, the energy source. Typical treatments last from 20-30 minutes. </p> <p><strong>What should I experience/expect after the first treatment?</strong></p> <p>Patients often report a general sense of relaxation and rejuvenation after an acupuncture treatment. The frequency of treatments and how long they last depends on the condition and individualized treatment plan that your practitioner will outline for you. Typically, chronic conditions may require more frequent and/or longer courses of treatment. </p> <p><strong>How do I find an acupuncture practitioner? </strong></p> <p>If you think acupuncture is an option for you, discuss it with your primary care provider and ask for a referral to one of Mayo Clinic's acupuncture specialists. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/christina-chen-md/\">Christina Chen, M.D.</a>, is an internal medicine physician, trained in geriatric medicine and acupuncture, and practices in the Division of Community Internal Medicine at Mayo Family Clinic Northwest in Rochester, Minnesota.

People who have agreed to organ donation are given more tests at no charge to their families to determine that they're truly dead than are those who haven't agreed to organ donation. </p> <p><strong>Myth: Organ donation is against my religion.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Organ donation is consistent with the beliefs of most major religions, including Roman Catholicism, Islam, most branches of Judaism and most Protestant faiths. If you're unsure of or uncomfortable with your faith's position on organ donation, ask a member of your clergy. </p> <p><strong>Myth: I'm under age 18. I'm too young to make this decision.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Many states allow people who are younger than 18 to register as organ donors, but the final decision will remain the responsibility of your parents or legal guardian. Discuss your wish to become an organ donor with your family and ask for their consent. Keep in mind that children, too, are in need or organ transplants, and they usually need organs smaller than those an adult can provide. </p> <p><strong>Myth: An open-casket funeral isn't an option for people who have donated organs or tissues.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Organ and tissue donation doesn't interfere with having an open-casket funeral. The donor's body is clothed for burial and treated with care and respect, so there are no visible signs of organ or tissue donation. </p> <p><strong>Myth: I'm too old to donate. Nobody would want my organs.</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> There's no defined cutoff age for donating organs. The decision to use your organs is based on strict medical criteria \u2014 not age. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Let the doctor decide at the time of your death whether your organs and tissues are suitable for transplantation. </p> <p><strong>Myth: I'm not in the best of health. Nobody would want my organs or tissues. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Few medical conditions automatically disqualify you from donating organs. The decision to use an organ is based on strict medical criteria. It may turn out that certain organs are not suitable for transplantation, but other organs and tissues may be fine. Don't prematurely disqualify yourself. Only medical professionals at the time of your death can determine whether your organs are suitable for transplantation. </p> <p><strong>Myth: I'd like to donate one of my kidneys now, but I wouldn't be allowed to do that unless one of my family members is in need. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> While that used to be the case, it isn't any longer. Whether it's a distant family member, friend or a complete stranger you want to help, you can donate a kidney through certain transplant centers. If you decide to become a living donor, you will undergo extensive questioning to ensure that you are aware of the risks and that your decision to donate isn't based on financial gain. You also will undergo testing to determine if your kidneys are in good shape and whether you can live a healthy life with just one kidney. </p> <p><strong>Myth: Rich and famous people go to the top of the list when they need a donor organ. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> The rich and famous aren't given priority when it comes to allocating organs. It may seem that way because of the amount of publicity generated when celebrities receive a transplant, but they are treated no differently from anyone else. The reality is that celebrity and financial status are not considered in organ allocation. </p> <p><strong>Myth: My family will be charged if I donate my organs. </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> The organ donor's family is never charged for donation. The family is charged for the costs of all final efforts to save your life, and those costs are sometimes misinterpreted as costs related to organ donation. Costs for organ removal go to the transplant recipient. </p> <p><strong>Why you should consider organ donation</strong></p> <p>Now that you have the facts, you can see that being an organ donor can make a big difference, and not just to one person. By donating your organs and tissue after you die, you can save or improve as many as 75 lives. Many families say that knowing their loved one helped save or improve other lives helped them cope with their loss. </p> <p>It's especially important to consider becoming an organ donor if you belong to an ethnic minority. Minorities, including African Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and Hispanics, are more likely than whites to have certain chronic conditions that affect the kidney's heart, lung, pancreas and liver. </p> <p>Certain blood types are more prevalent in ethnic minority populations. Because matching blood type is usually necessary for transplants, the need for minority donor organs is especially high. </p> <p><strong>How to donate</strong></p> <p>Becoming an organ donor is easy. You can indicate that you want to be a donor in these ways: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Register with your state's donor registry. driver's license. </strong>Do this when you obtain or renew your license. </li> <li><strong>Tell your family.</strong> Make sure your family knows your wishes regarding donation. </li> </ul> <p>The best way to ensure that your wishes are carried out is to register with your state's organ donation registry, and include donor designation on your driver's license or state ID. Taking these steps legally authorizes your organ donation upon death. </p> <p>If you have designated someone to make health care decisions for you if you become unable to do so, make sure that person knows that you want to be an organ donor. You also may include your wishes in your living will if you have one, but that might not be immediately available at the time of your death. </p> <p>It's also important to tell your family that you want to be a donor. Hospitals seek consent from the next of kin before removing organs, although this is not required if you're registered with your state's donor registry or have donor designation on your driver's license or state ID card. </p> <p><em>Used with permission of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, all rights reserved.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonOrgan DonationPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Robert in the fall, Minnesota school rules call for all senior high school students to receive two doses of the meningococcal ACWY (Menactra\u00ae, Menveo\u00ae) vaccine. This vaccine prevents sudden death and loss of limb from a rapid-onset bacterial infection caused by meningococcus. Teens ages 11 through 20 are at increased risk. One dose of the vaccine is due when students are 11 to 12 years old; the second dose is due when they're 16. The vaccine dose lasts about five years. </p> <p>If you've heard or been told that your teen should wait to get the second dose until they're closer to age 18, this is not correct and has never been a recommendation. The increased risk begins at 11 or 12 years of age and decreases after the first year out of high school. </p> <p>Mayo Clinic recommends all its patients get these doses when they are due. Nurses and providers work hard to catch teens up at non-preventive care visits. Mayo Clinic also provides nurse-only visits to get any shots that are due. Mayo Clinic Express Care offers this vaccine, as well. </p> <p>Parents can ask for their teens' vaccination records by calling their care team or through their teen's Patient Online Services portal. This is an exception to the privacy rules that restrict other access. The vaccines will appear in the portal as MCV4 (Menactra), MCV4 (Menveo) or MCV4 (Unspecified). If your teen got the vaccine elsewhere, the vaccine might show up as MenACWY. </p> <p>Until this fall, Minnesota State Law didn't require schools to enforce the need for the 16-year-old dose. Schools won't admit seniors who haven't received the vaccine. Seniors will need to get the vaccine, or, if the parents refuse, turn in a conscientious-objection form. </p> <p>This vaccine is different from the optional MenB vaccine that Mayo doesn't recommend <span style=\"color: #333333;\">routinely</span>. We do make the MenB vaccine available for those 16 to 23 years of age who request it. </p> <p>Both vaccines are well covered by commercial insurance, so there's no out-of-pocket expense, and provided free of charge through Minnesota Vaccines for Children. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/robert-jacobson-md/\">Dr. Robert M.

Afterward, she wasn't able to donate for quite a while, but that didn't stop this Mayo Clinic employee from finding other ways to help our patients. </p> <p>As a Wellness Champion, Marilyn decided to spearhead a blood donor challenge in her department. Blood donor challenges at Mayo Clinic in Rochester typically are friendly competitions between departments to see which team can contribute the most blood for our patients or a single department aiming to reach its team goal. </p> <p>Marilyn's team, Lenaye's Lifesavers, successfully achieved its goal. \"This is our way of helping our patients. We don't do the surgeries, and we don't have direct contact with them,\" she says. \"It's fun to get new people to donate blood and give back after all that Mayo has given to us.\"</p> <p>During last year's competition, the meaning of a blood donation became even more personal for her team. Marilyn's colleague, Sara, needed an emergency C-section during delivery in order to save her baby's life. Where a typical C-section might only take an hour to perform, she was on the table for nearly three. After Gwen was born, she struggled at first, but then stabilized. Sara, however, had extremely low hemoglobin, so was offered a transfusion, which she accepted. </p> <p>Also a blood donor prior to giving birth, Sara says, \"Never in all my donations, and while participating in this challenge, did I ever think that I'd receive a blood transfusion. It was very emotional. While apprehensive about receiving blood, I was surprisingly very comfortable.\"</p> <p>Marilyn adds, \"I remember, too, the thoughts I was having while receiving the transfusion. What if it doesn't adhere to me? But I really didn't have a choice. Once I had received it, I felt to much better. </p> <p>Having come full circle in the experience of blood donation, Sara and Marilyn continue to use their passion to inspire their staff to participate in the challenges. </p> <p><strong>How to donate</strong></p> <p>For more information about donating blood or how to set up a blood drive in Olmsted County, call <a href=\"tel:5072844475\">507-284-4475</a>, email <a href=\"mailto:donateblood@mayo.edu\">donateblood@mayo.edu</a>, or visit height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />Marilyn and Sara now channel their passion into encouraging others to donate. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonBlood Donors Being RecipientsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson ages and becomes more ill and frail, more Americans \u2014 actually one in five \u2014 find themselves in the role of caregiver. Of the people who need care, two-thirds rely on care from family members, friends and neighbors. </p> <p>The assistance these caregivers provide ranges from: </p> <ul> <li>Activities of daily living (hygiene, dressing, eating, toileting, shopping, housekeeping, managing finances, setting up appointments, preparing food, transportation, etc.)</li> <li>More involved care (giving medications, tube feedings, physical therapy, monitoring behavior of a loved one with cognitive impairment, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Caregiving can be a 24/7 job. The risk to caregivers is that they aren't able to get enough rest, exercise, recuperate from illness, keep up their own social interactions and family involvement, and neglect their own care. They may begin to see their loved one only as an obligation or a burden and lose the positive feelings of their relationship. </p> <p>Not only is burnout an issue for caregivers, it also can be a safety concern for patients. If their caregiver is worn out, there may be no backup plan or person.</p> <p><strong>Are you cut out to be a caregiver?</strong></p> <p>If you're faced with becoming a caregiver, before you agree to the role, be honest with yourself \u2014 and your loved one's health care provider \u2014 about your own resources and abilities. Do you have the skill, time, energy, financial resources and possibly home arrangements to do this? </p> <p>If not, there are resources available to help you explore your options. Here are just a few for families and caregivers seeking information worship.

Be sure you go to them with your loved one! You're not intruding and being there can help both of you. The appointment can be as much about your caregiving role as the medical needs of the patient. </p> <ul> <li>Tell the care team member that you're the caregiver. The patient's care plan should include instruction, guidance and support for you. Don't be afraid to ask for that. </li> <li>Let them know what type of tasks you're doing for the patient.

For example, smoking, cancer and cholera can cause you to lose weight. But all are not good for you, and they will not solve society's weight problem. Likewise, there are many diet plans and diet fads on the internet, such as low-carb and low-fat diets, and intermittent fasting. It can be overwhelming. </p> <p>It is not unusual to yo-yo from one diet plan to another. So, what should you do to promote health, wellness and longevity? </p> <p>Most medical professionals agree that the healthiest way to maintain a healthy weight, feel good and prevent chronic disease is to eat a diet that is rich in: </ul> <p>In addition, this diet should be low in animal products, saturated fats and refined sugars. </p> <p>Although this is how people were designed to eat, you are surrounded by a toxic food environment that makes it too easy to choose convenience or processed foods that are not nutritious versus nutritious whole foods. No wonder that society is fatigued and rapidly gaining weight. </p> <p><strong>What is the good news?</strong></p> <p>If you decide to go all in and adopt a whole-foods, plant-based, minimally processed diet, you will likely find yourself losing weight and feeling better, without the need for calorie-counting. If you have food and lifestyle-related diseases, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, erectile dysfunction, fatty liver disease or diabetes, you will likely be able to work with your provider to reduce, if not get rid of some of your medications, and possibly reverse the disease process. </p> <p>People tend to underestimate the power of lifestyle change. Lifestyle, including nutrition and exercise, is the most important way to treat disease. Unlike medications, the side effects are good. </p> <p>In the words of Dean Ornish, M.D., a famous cardiologist and lifestyle medicine guru, \"What is meaningful is sustainable.\" If you can commit to even four weeks of a plant-based, whole-foods diet, you will experience meaningful benefits in how you feel and relate to food. </p> <p><strong>If you eat this way, will you be hungry?</strong></p> <p>Most Americans do not get enough fiber in their diet. The good thing about fiber is that it fills you up, and helps you eat smaller portions than you normally would if you were eating simple carbohydrates and refined sugars. Fiber is good for your gut and helps keep you regular. More and more studies show the health benefits of a high-fiber diet. </p> <p>If you are interested in reading more on this, check out \"Fiber Fueled\" by Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.</p> <p><strong>How do you get started?</strong></p> <p>There are plenty of plant-based recipes on the internet with tips for ingredient substitutions, and practical tips for cooking, shopping and eating out. Simply type in \"plant-based recipes\" in your favorite search engine, and the options are endless. </p> <p><strong>How can you help your children make healthy food choices?</strong></p> <p>It is important to be an example by eating and preparing healthy foods. Emphasize the importance of good nutrition rather than weight. Get your children involved in the kitchen with meal preparation when they are young. Eat and exercise together as a family. </p> <p><strong>What are some resources on nutrition and much exercise should you get? </strong></p> <p>There is a close connection between movement and better health. Ideally, you should work toward a minimum goal of 150 minutes, or about 2-1/2 hours, of moderate activity per week. However, the more the better. People of all ages benefit from exercise, and it is never to late to start. It is OK to start slowly and progress over time. </p> <p>In conclusion, healthy change begets healthy change. It is a virtuous cycle. If you start with focusing on what's at the end of the fork and a little movement, you will likely begin to make healthy changes in all aspects of your life. </p> <p><em><a href=\"/providers/meghan-theofiles-md\">Meghan Theofiles, M.D.</a>, is a family medicine physician in Mayo Clinic Primary Care's Department of Family Medicine and practices at Mayo Family Clinic Northeast.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonMaintain Healthy WeightPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Natalie time to make the move for yourself or loved ones away from independent living? This point comes at different times for everyone, but it's never easy. These questions typically arise in families, and the answers may help you better understand the process and how to make the move go smoother. </p> <p><strong>When is it time to move?</strong></p> <p>For many, moving from independent living, such as their home, happens when:</p> <ul> <li>They're no longer able to care for themselves. </li> <li>Their loved one (spouse, child, etc.) can no longer safely care for them at home.</li> <li>Their caregiver becomes ill or unable to handle their role. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What housing options are there?</strong></p> <p>Many! Based on the level of care needed, these are some options:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Assisted living.</strong> Rochester has 13 assisted-living facilities (ALF). All offer similar resources, such as nurses on site, medication management, and help with bathing, dressing and meals. </li> <li><strong>Adult foster home.</strong> These are homes that typically house four to five residents. They provide meals, medications and take care of daily needs, much like in assisted-living residences. </li> <li><strong>Nursing homes/long-term care.</strong> These facilities have more resources than assisted living and are for people who need increased help taking care of themselves. If your loved one is no longer able to walk, or needs a lift to move from the bed to chair, they have the staff and equipment. </li> <li><strong>Memory care.</strong> These are special units designed for dementia patients, including those with Alzheimer's, Lewy Body dementia, etc. They're locked units in case your loved one is prone to wandering and has left the house unexpectedly. They typically have more staff and closer oversight than assisted living. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Where do I start, and how do I choose?</strong></p> <p>Deciding what type of housing is needed can be a difficult decision and is based on the care needs of your loved one. Many times both parents can live together in an assisted-living apartment if their needs can be safely met. </p> <p>A good place to start is by talking to your primary care provider. They may be able to offer insights and discuss prognosis so you can prevent numerous moves in a short period of time, such as moving your loved one to a townhouse, but then finding they need memory care a year later. </p> <p>At Mayo Clinic, social workers at the hospital and Employee and Community Health (ECH) are a great resource. We have a booklet that lists all assisted living and long-term care facilities. I recommend touring these early before you or your loved one may need to move. There are often waiting lists, and it's best to get your name on the list. </p> <p>Elder Network is available statewide to meet with you and discuss all senior living options as well. We also use the Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association (IMAA) Community Health Workers who can meet with you at your home and review options. SeniorLinkage Line is another statewide resource, with information available by phone or online. </p> <p><strong>How can I help my loved one adjust to the move?</strong></p> <p>Making the move from independent living is a big adjustment and takes time.</p> <ul> <li>For loved ones who need more help with daily cares, such as bathing and dressing, it can be difficult to let someone help you. Speak with staff about allowing your loved one as much independence and control as possible. </li> <li>For patients with dementia, we typically recommend giving them about a month to adjust to their new living situation. Dementia patients do best with routines and consistency. If loved ones visit the same time every day, it can help ease this transition. </li> <li>For caregivers, you may feel guilty about having to move your parent or partner into a different level of care. This does get easier with time. It's good to recognize your limitations and put your own physical and mental health care needs first. Caregiving is extremely difficult, whether you're the one providing care or overseeing the care of your loved one. Continue to advocate with staff about your loved one's needs. You know them best!</li> </ul> <p><strong>What happens when spouses/partners can't live together? </strong></p> <p>This is a common situation. Often, spouses will move into an assisted-living apartment together. In time, the care needs of one may increase, and assisted living is no longer appropriate. When this happens, families need to decide where to move the other spouse. If one has dementia, they can sometimes moved into an attached memory-care unit. That way, the more independent spouse can visit daily and still be near their partner. </p> <p>Sometimes one spouse needs a higher level of care, such as a nursing home. Some facilities in Rochester do have nursing homes attached to the assisted-living facility. Close proximity helps ease this transition. But when this isn't available, I encourage the independent spouse to use whatever transportation (such as the ALF bus/transportation in Rochester) to visit their loved one in the nursing home whenever possible. These visits may be difficult at first, since you can no longer live together, but the goal is to ensure that your loved one is safe and that their needs \u2014 and yours \u2014 are best met. </p> a nurse practitioner in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM) and practices in the Care Transitions & Palliative Care Homebound Programs.

As a parent, you can prevent dental caries, also known as tooth decay, in your infants or children by brushing their teeth, starting at the first tooth and following the recommendations below. </p> <p>Dental caries are the most common chronic infection disease in children. And they are 100% preventable. Early childhood caries are an aggressive form of dental caries in children 0 to 5. Dental caries affect 1 out of 5 children by age 5, and twice as many children from low-income families or minorities. In Minnesota 50% of third graders have at least one dental caries. </p> <p><strong>Why is oral health prevention important?</strong></p> <p>Infants and children with dental caries can experience problems with pain and difficulty eating that leads to poor growth and severe, complicated infections. Children also can suffer from difficulty sleeping and poor self-esteem. More frequent school absences, or work absences for parents, and poor learning are consequences of untreated dental caries. Also, extensive and expensive preventable dental treatment if often needed to be performed under general anesthesia. </p> <p><strong>What can parents do to promote good oral health in their children? </strong></p> <p>To promote good oral health in their children, parents can: </p> <ul> <li>Brush their teeth twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. Use a smear, like a grain of rice, in infants and children until their third birthday. Then after 3, use a pea-size amount. </li> <li>Keep a healthy diet with lots of fruits and veggies, and lots of water and milk. </li> <li>For infants, do not provide sippy cups with juice and do not feed in the middle of the night after 6 months. </li> <li>See a dentist by their first birthday or appearance of their first tooth. </li> <li>Have your health care provider or dentist apply fluoride varnish every three to six months to prevent caries. </li> </ul> <p>Regular tooth brushing, especially before bedtime, is important to remove plaque and food debris, and for distributing fluoridated toothpaste. You should brush your children's teeth until they are at least 8 and supervise them for a while when they gain independence to brush on their own. It is best if you stand or sit behind your children when brushing their teeth. Your children should spit but not rinse after brushing to increase topical fluoride exposure. </p> <p>It is important to find a dentist by the time your children's first tooth arrives or your children's first birthday. Your children's health care provider can help you find a dental home if needed and apply topical fluoride varnish after the first tooth and every three to six months until a dental home is established. Topical fluoride is the most efficient way to protect your children's teeth by making them healthier and stronger to prevent caries. </p> <p>Remember, you can prevent caries and promote your children's overall health with healthy teeth.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonRestorative ExercisesPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Drs. Chris Derauf and Arne GraffWhat's the \"Spare the rod, spoil the child.\" \"Spanking isn't hitting, and it's not abuse.\" \"It works!\" \"It's part of our culture.\" These are just some of the common responses from parents and caregivers in the U.S. \u2014 and worldwide \u2014 in support of spanking or hitting children as a form of discipline. </p> <p>But a growing volume of research is showing that spanking or hitting children actually can have the opposite effect parents were trying to achieve. Research reveals that:</p> <ul> <li>Spanking doesn't reduce aggression or make children more compliant. </li> <li>It's linked to worse, not better behavior. </li> <li>Kids learn that hitting and violence are acceptable when interacting with others. </li> <li>It can foster depression, anxiety and aggression in children and even affect their performance in school. </li> <li>Spanking damages the whole parent/child relationship because someone they love hurts them. </li> </ul> <p>Even with these findings, there are many reasons why spanking is still an accepted form of discipline around the world. These range from cultural and religious, to frustration, stress and loss of self-control, to not understanding child development or knowing other options that do work. </p> <p>So what works better than spanking, hitting or even harsh verbal abuse? The goal of discipline is to teach children ways that will help them develop self-control, character and appropriate social behavior. </p> <p>All kids need someone who's crazy about them \u2014 that's number one. Children also need appropriate limits, stability and consistent routines. Just having these will encourage good behavior. That's not to say discipline isn't still needed, but it needs a different approach. </p> <p><strong>Catch kids being good</strong></p> <p>Kids strive to meet our expectations for them. If we expect kids to be troublemakers, they'll keep doing something wrong for the attention. Paying attention to kids is a powerful tool for parents. If you try to catch kids being good, they'll respond by wanting to repeat the good behavior. Give positive praise and do it promptly. Sometimes all that's needed is a smile to let them know you've noticed. </p> <p>It's about downplaying the bad behavior and rewarding the good. For a rule of thumb, use a ratio of five to one of positive feedback to negative feedback. </p> <p><strong>Time out \u2014 for both parents and kids</strong></p> <p>One goal of discipline is to encourage children to reflect on their behavior and what they've learned. A time out can be a useful strategy, particularly for children ages two to seven. Put your child in an uninteresting place, usually for one minute for every year of age. If they leave, return them to that place. </p> <p>But time outs work for parents, too. Sometimes parents just need to step away from the situation with their child. While their child is in a time out, they can put themselves in one, too. That can be going to another room or sitting outside. Or, if the parent prefers, they can sit next to their child and say something like, \"I need to calm down, too. Let's both take a break.\" Once everyone is calm, the parent and child can discuss what happened and what would have been a better behavior. </p> <p>That approach makes time outs effective on two levels: the situation is handled more calmly and parents model self-control to their kids. </p> <p>If you have questions about or would like to learn more effective parenting skills, talk with your child's care provider. There are lots of resources for parents ranging from classes to support groups. </p> <p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/derauf-donald-chris-c-m-d/bio-20055380\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Chris Derauf</a> is a consultant in the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine at Mayo Clinic.

While they get all the hype, almost all other fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish, eggs, dried beans and peas, whole grains and dairy products are just as beneficial. In fact, research doesn't show any evidence that eating more of a certain food will make you healthier and may keep you from getting the other nutrients you need. </p> <p>Food, not supplements or vitamins, is the best way to get the nutrients you need as you age.

Here's a handy guide for what should be on your plate: </p> <ul> <li><strong>One-half:</strong> Fruits and vegetables. Whether they made the superfood list or not, all fruits and vegetables help lower your risk of death, heart attack, stroke and some cancers. They also provide natural fiber, which is good for digestion. Put them on your plate at every meal. </li> <li><strong>One-quarter:</strong> Grains. This includes whole-wheat pasta, 100% whole-grain bread, brown rice and steel-cut oats. Grains not only help prevent diabetes, but if you have it, they can help control your blood sugar. </li> <li><strong>One-quarter:</strong> Lean meat, fish, eggs. These are easy sources of high-quality protein that you still need for building muscle and a variety of body-maintenance functions. </li> <li><strong>On the side:</strong> Water. As we age, we lose our sense of thirst. And water is a simple way to provide fluid our bodies need for everything from blood pressure to keeping mentally sharp.

These tips can help you make it happen: </p> <ul> <li>Shop along the perimeter of your grocery store \u2014 not down the aisles \u2014 for most whole foods. </li> <li>Choose fresh fruits and veggies. If this isn't an option, go for frozen. They're flash-frozen, preserving the flavor and texture without added sodium or other preserving agents. </li> <li>Visit a farmers' market with family or friends. Not only will you have an excellent selection to choose from, it's a fun outing. </li> <li>Keep a bowl of fresh fruit for snacking on the table as a reminder. Fruit in the fridge might not get eaten. </li> <li>Use herbs, spices and other seasonings (not just salt!) to boost the flavor and aroma of foods to make them more appealing as our sense of taste dulls. </li> <li>Cook fruits and veggies a bit to make them softer and easier to chew and swallow. Bananas, grapes, berries, pears, tomatoes and dark leafy greens are just a few choices that can be eaten raw without the chewing challenge. </li> <li>Try smoothies. With a blender, veggies or fruits, milk and ice, you've got an easy breakfast or snack. </li> <li>White breads and rice will never be super. Go for the whole grain. </li> </ul> <p>Is there room for treats and sweets? If you're generally in good health, you can say \"yes\" to occasional treats without feeling guilty.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonSuperfoods SeniorsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. affects an estimated 37 million people in the U.S., about one in seven adults. Most people with CKD don't even know they have it, including 90% of people with moderate CKD and 37% of people with advanced CKD. </p> <p>For a wide variety of reasons, but most often to support their overall health and wellness, many Americans turn to dietary or herbal/botanical supplements. Garlic, fish oil, turmeric, multivitamins, flaxseed, vitamin D all find their way into Americans' medicine cabinets to fill the gaps in nutrition, boost energy or relieve aches and pains. While dietary and herbal supplements are generally considered safe, they may not be for individuals with CKD. </p> <p>Some of these supplements contain potassium or phosphorous \u2014 minerals that can be harmful to people with impaired kidney function. Other supplement ingredients also can be harmful to people with CKD. These individuals have a harder time filtering medications, wastes, and excess fluids from their body, so it's especially important for them to know about the safety or risks of any supplements they're taking. </p> <p>Despite potential safety concerns, more than one-third of the 15.7 million Americans with moderate or advanced CKD use dietary or herbal supplements, according to new research conducted by a group of Mayo Clinic colleagues. Many Americans decide to take supplements on their own and not because of a doctor's recommendation. </p> <p>Supplements, in many ways, are an unknown. They aren't regulated by the FDA the same way as prescription medications, may not be completely labeled, or can interact with each other or other prescription medications. For example: </p> <ul> <li>16% of study participants took flaxseed oil, the most commonly used high-risk supplement that contains phosphorus, but it's not listed on the nutrition label. </li> <li>One tablespoon of whole flaxseeds has about 62 mg of phosphorus \u2014 7% of the daily recommended value for those without CKD, but the safe limit is likely much lower for people with CKD. </li> <li>Flaxseed and flaxseed oil also may interact with blood-thinning and blood pressure drugs and may decrease absorption of any oral drug. </li> </ul> <p>More study is needed to dig deeper into the use of supplements and risk for those with CKD. In the meantime, if you've been diagnosed with CKD, you should have a periodic review of your medications and various supplements with your health care provider or pharmacist.

For millions of Americans, the quality of the day often hinges on that morning cup of coffee, evening spot of tea or soda at lunch. While these beverages may give us a lift or soothe our souls during these troubled times, is the caffeine they contain good for us? There's a lot of information out there; these FAQs may help you sort it out. </p> <p><strong>Is caffeine good for anything?</strong></p> <p>It's not just in your head. In healthy adults, caffeine can temporarily improve your ability to think and even help with headaches. Beyond this, we're not sure it does much else that's good. For instance, you may have read about caffeine making you live longer and protecting you against disease, like Parkinson's, but the jury is still out on this. </p> <p><strong>How much is too much?</strong></p> <p>It appears that 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe, if you're a healthy adult. This is about the same as three to four cups of coffee, four to six cups of tea, eight cans of soda or two energy drinks. Most products should let you know how much caffeine is in them. </p> <p><strong>How do I know if I'm having problems from caffeine?</strong></p> <p>Sometimes it can be hard to know, but there are a lot of symptoms that show evidence your body may not be liking caffeine \u2014 irritability, insomnia, feeling nervous, urinary urgency and headache are bothersome symptoms of caffeine. However, caffeine can cause more serious issues, such as elevated blood pressure and dangerous heart rhythm problems. </p> <p><strong>Who shouldn't drink caffeine?</strong></p> <p>Children have plenty of energy, which is a clue they don't need any more! People with insomnia should avoid caffeine. If you have certain heart problems, caffeine poses risks, so ask your doctor about consuming caffeine. For women who are pregnant, modest caffeine use seems to be okay, but limiting it to about 200 milligrams per day is recommended. </p> <p><strong>How should I cut down?</strong></p> <p>Stopping cold-turkey won't hurt you, but it may not feel good. You'll likely have a headache, feel run down and be a bit crabby for a few days! Another is the go-slower route:</p> <ul> <li>So you know your starting point, write down how much caffeine you consume every day. </li> <li>Then slowly decrease the amount. For example, drink one less cup of coffee for a week. </li> <li>Switch to decaf! Almost all the great-tasting beverages you have a caffeine-free or caffeine-reduced version. </li> </ul> <p>The current pandemic has limited us in a lot of ways, and the small joys in life really are important right now. For healthy adults, caffeine in moderation can be an ally to help us get through the day. However, be vigilant for problems and have a plan ready to cut down. </p> <p>And, don't forget to wash your hands!</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/luke-hafdahl-md/\">Dr. Luke Hafdahl</a> is a consultant and assistant professor in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

These microorganisms can be generally classified as healthy or unhealthy. </p> <p>Gut health can be defined by a normal composition of the microbiome, adequate digestion and absorption of food, the absence of gut illnesses, and an effective immune status. Emerging research is helping the medical world understand more about the gut microbiome, suggesting that the microbiome can be altered by what is eaten. </p> <p>This is important because when the gut microbiome is not balanced, disease risk is higher. A gut rich in healthy bacteria can reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as obesity and colon cancer. </p> <p><strong>How to build a healthy gut microbiome</strong></p> <p>Foods that help create a healthy gut microbiome are prebiotics and fiber, and probiotics and fermented foods. High-fiber diets containing prebiotics and probiotics promote a healthy gut microbiome. In contrast, diets high in fast food, sugar, processed foods and excessive alcohol can decrease gut health. </p> <p>Try to include these foods in your <li><strong>Fiber and prebiotics</strong> <br> These are nondigestible substances that feed healthy gut bacteria.

But history doesn't need to repeat itself. Here are some tips to make 2018 the year your weight-loss resolutions stick!</p> <p><strong>Think small!</strong> Aim to lose about three to five pounds per month. Rapid weight loss is usually a sign that you're doing something that's going to be hard to keep up. Focus on small changes that you can sustain for the rest of your life. Remember: <em>Small changes over a long period of time yield big results.</em></p> <p><strong>Rethink your drink.</strong> Calories are experts at sneaking into your diet without you even noticing, especially in beverages. Consider these simple substitutions. Diet instead of regular soda, skim milk instead of whole for your coffee, flavored-water instead of fruit juice, etc. </p> <p><strong>Avoid portion pitfalls.</strong> Oversized portions derail the best weight-loss plans. Give these quick fixes a try: </p> <ul> <li>At restaurants, put half of your meal in a to-go box as soon as it comes to the table. </li> <li>At home, keep serving dishes away from the dining table to discourage seconds and thirds. </li> <li>With snacking, put your snack in a bowl or container, rather than sit and munch with the whole package at hand. </li> <li>Spoil your dinner! A healthy snack before dinner that leads to eating less at your meal is A-OK!</li> </ul> <p><strong>Ease into exercise.</strong> Exercise is key to weight loss, but if you're not doing much exercise to start, going from zero to 60 is a recipe to crash and burn. Start low and go slow. Start with 10 minutes of exercise <em>per week</em>. Add in 10 minutes every week and <em>slowly build up</em> to 30 minutes, five days a week. How do you know if you're exercising right? If you're breathing hard enough that it would be difficult to have a conversation with someone, then you're doing it right!</p> <p><strong>Put a dietician in your pocket.</strong> Have a smart phone or tablet device? Put it to work for you! Knowing which foods are good and bad is only part of the struggle. MyFitnessPal is a fantastic, free application that helps you set weight-loss goals and tracks your calories. </p> <p>Remember that your provider is there for you, so don't hesitate to ask them for guidance and encouragement.

It becomes even more complicated and difficult if you are a parent. </p> <p>There is so much to sort through, details to decide and changes to make. Your children may seem like they are coping well with the situation or you may notice significant struggles. </p> <p>Learn more in this Q&A about parenting through a divorce:</p> <p><strong>When should I tell my kids?</strong></p> <p>It's likely that your children have picked up that something is not right. If they come to you with questions, be as honest and age-appropriate as possible. However, it's best not to share about a separation or divorce until the decision is final. </p> <p>It's developmentally appropriate for children to be concrete in their thinking, so understanding ambiguity or gray areas in a relationship is often difficult for younger children.</p> <p><strong>How should I tell my kids?</strong></p> <p>Ideally, parents should have this conversation together and plan in advance to make sure they are on the same page. Presenting a united front can be reassuring for kids. It sends the message that, although their family is changing, both parents are still working together to take care of them.</p> <p>Keep the conversation simple and straightforward. Reassure your child that you love him or her, that you will always be his or her parents, and that the divorce is not his or her fault. </p> <p>Do not comment on anything related to extramarital affairs, finances or any other age-inappropriate details. Also, be careful to avoid the temptation to criticize, insult, or blame the other parent. </p> <p>It's important to tell your children that this is hard, and it's OK to be sad, angry or upset.</p> <p><strong>How do children of divorced parents feel?</strong></p> <p>In a major life change such as divorce, children experience a variety of emotions. There's no right way to feel or go through it. </p> <p>Some children experience grief and sadness. Some express anger and resentment. Others are relieved. </p> <p>You might be surprised at how quickly your child adapts to the new normal. Remember, your child's emotional response may be different toward each parent. What's key is using validation and empathy to let your child know that all feelings are OK.</p> <p><strong>How do we decide custody time?</strong></p> <p>The most important part of deciding on parenting and custody time is taking your child's development into account. Ask yourself how you can make the schedule most conducive to school and extracurricular activities. </p> <p>Keep in mind that it will be hard to give up your child to the other parent for any amount of time, but that in most situations assuming there are no concerns about safety it's vital to his or her growth and development to have a relationship with both of you. </p> <p>The more consistent you make the schedule, the better. That way, your child always knows when he or she will be where. It is helpful to create a calendar that your child can refer to.</p> <p><strong>How do we co-parent from two houses?</strong></p> <p>Communication is essential. Find the communication method that works best for you, perhaps through text messages or email if verbal conversations are hard. Make sure the communication is direct between the two of you, and not sent back and forth through your child.</p> <p>When your child is struggling with something, make sure to share that information with the other parent. Both of you should try to attend all medical appointments and school conferences, so that everyone has the same information.</p> <p>When talking with your child, don't act jealous or upset about the time your child spends with the other parent or ask what he or she does together with the other parent. This isn't a competition. Don't discuss finances or negative attributes of the other parent with your child. </p> <p>As you co-parent during a divorce, remember to take care of yourself and get support if you need it. The better you deal with your feelings, the better your child will be able to deal with his or hers.</p> <p><strong>How do I start dating again?</strong></p> <p>This is an important conversation to have with your child. Discuss why you would date and what you are looking for in a partner. </p> <p>Try to introduce significant others only when the relationship is more than casual, so you're not bringing many new people in and out of your child's life.Remember that children typically are fairly concrete, so the gray areas that characterize many adult dating relationships can be hard for children to understand. </p> <p>Once you've met someone who likely will be a steady presence in you and your child's life, help your child become part of the relationship through family dates and quality time together. However, make sure your child knows that he or she is still important to you and deserves one-on-one time with you.Validate your child's feelings about your dating, recognizing all children will handle this change differently.</p> <p><strong>How will I know if my child isn't coping well with the divorce?</strong></p> <p>If you see changes in schoolwork, friendships, behavior or mood, your child may be struggling to manage the change. If your child shows a consistent increase in irritability, sleeping difficulties, toileting or eating problems, then try talking with him or her about how he or she feels about the divorce. Your care team can be an excellent resource when you have concerns about how your child is coping with a divorce.</p> <p><em>Hannah Mulholland, L.I.C.S.W., M.S.W., is a clinical social worker serving children and adolescents in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral Health.</em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/people/divorce_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=9267CAAC7D96F4885B34A94D2CAFA0B8\" alt=\"Divorce_widget\" />Parenting responsibilities don't change, a couple's struggles.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonFalls ImpactPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Natalie physician who focuses on the role of healthy lifestyle and the epidemic of obesity, particularly in kids, I have a vested interest in recess. </p> <p>It frustrates me to hear that some schools withhold recess as a form of punishment when students misbehave, or use it as a time for students to make up missed work. Without recess, a child's day looks a lot like that of the average adult: sitting, reading, hunching over, dozing off. It's not a coincidence that the obesity epidemic coincides with a culture that's becoming more sedentary. Children mirror what adults do, and adults are, across the board, moving less and sitting more. </p> <p>School recess is more than just fun and games (although those are important, too). Here are some of the health, wellness and developmental benefits of recess: </p> <p><strong>Gets kids moving:</strong> Current guidelines for childhood activity, based on the 5-2-1-0* recommendations, advise at least one hour of physical activity a day. But meeting that requirement is getting more difficult when recess is taken away or simply cut out; physical education class isn't offered every day; and after-school or evening activity gets shortened by homework loads. </p> <p><strong>Improves ability to focus and pay attention:</strong> In a time when we are constantly concerned that our kids are becoming more inattentive and unable to concentrate, why would we take away a break time when they can burn off energy and increase blood flow, both of which allow for improved attention and concentration? </p> <p><strong>Gets kids outside: </strong>Going outside during nice weather is easy, whether at school or home. But during cold winter months, recess at school might be the only time some students have the opportunity to go outdoors, so withholding it during the school day is detrimental. Some schools offer no alternate indoor activity if bad weather keeps kids inside. </p> <p><strong>Allows children to make choices:</strong> During a typical school day, kids have little unstructured time. Their classes are scheduled and activities in the classroom are chosen by the teacher. Recess, which encourages free play, allows for problem solving, brain development, learning to regulate emotions and getting along with others. </p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics firmly supports building recess into the daily school schedule. If for no other reason than to prevent childhood obesity, we need more opportunities for physical activity during each school day. </p> <p>I encourage schools, teachers and parents to address the importance of daily, active recess time and to ban the practice of withholding recess as punishment. Let's work together to find ways during the school day to nurture and support our children's emotional and physical well-being. </p> <p>*5-2-1-0 refers to the wellness model that outlines how families can take action to prevent childhood obesity: </p> <ul> <li><strong>5 - </strong>Eat five (or daily. Limit 100% fruit juice.</li> <li><strong>2 - </strong>Reduce screen time to two hours or less a day. This includes TV, phones, computers, etc.</li> <li><strong>1 -</strong> Participate in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity every day. </li> <li><strong>0 - </strong>Restrict soda and sugar-sweetened drinks.

In most cases, you should see your health care provider if you develop dizziness, a sense of motion or spinning (i.e., vertigo), lightheadedness or wooziness, or unsteadiness. </p> <p>Problems in various parts of your body could lead to dizziness or feeling out of balance. It is helpful to understand the timing and triggers for the dizziness and know about other accompanying symptoms. Common cases include low blood pressure, dehydration, and medication side effects. An inner ear problem or migraine also can cause dizziness, as can psychiatric conditions like anxiety. Rarely, dizziness can indicate a heart or brain problem such as stroke or tumor. </p> <p>Sometimes a referral to a specialist is needed to address the cause of the issue. Common inner ear problems, such as BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) or vestibular neuritis may be treated with medication and vestibular therapy to improve the symptoms.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonDizzinessPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Natalie Gentile Kristine Penza, APRN, messages about the \"best\" way to eat, navigating the grocery aisles can be confusing. We all have the same goal: to provide our families with healthy meals and snacks. So it's important to be equipped with the evidence supporting a well-balanced diet when you head to the supermarket. </p> <p>Starting healthy habits in childhood leads to healthy habits in adulthood. When it comes to healthy eating, the focus is \"the more whole foods, the better\". This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes like dried peas, beans and soybeans. </p> <p> In this series, we're addressing several nutrition myths to help make healthy food choices less confusing. </p> <p><strong>Myth #2: Sugar is OK in moderation</strong> </p> <p>For decades, the low-fat craze has led food manufacturers to make their products more enticing with another ingredient: sugar. Sugar in some form \u2014 think high fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup \u2014 is now in almost every processed food. </p> <p>The latest research is showing that sugar is highly addictive and a promoter of chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease, to name a few. That's why it's so important to cut back on them. The American Heart Association and World Health Organization recommend kids ages two to 18 should have less than 25 grams (six teaspoons) of added sugar per day. For adult women, that amount is 25 grams and for adult men, 36 grams. One 12-ounce soda contains almost twice as much! </p> <p>Unfortunately, diet beverages may not be the solution, either. Be cautious with artificial sweeteners. In April 2018, researchers from the Medical College of Wisconsin linked artificial sweeteners to obesity and diabetes in rodents. The journal, Nature, reported that artificial sweeteners can promote insulin resistance, leading to diabetes, and may have a negative impact on the gut microbiome, which is the three pounds of helpful bacteria that lives in our gut. </p> <p> Much like cigarettes, sugar is addictive, and it's difficult to stop consuming it cold turkey. Fortunately, as you and your kids decrease your sugar intake, it will take less sugar for foods to taste sweet. Also, those intense cravings will diminish the longer you avoid sugar. But start eating it again, and they'll come right back! </p> <p>If you can't stop cold turkey, here's one simple place to start: try diluting your child's juice with sparkling water. Start small, just add an ounce or two to their glass, then slowly add more as everyone gets used to it. </p> <p>Satisfy sugar cravings with sweet fruits, such as watermelon and cherries. And be on the lookout for the sneaky places that sugar hides, such as in bread, yogurt, salad dressings and other condiments, like ketchup. Nutrition labels on packaged foods say how many grams of sugar are in a serving. And deli counters at your supermarket can provide nutrition information, including sugar, for sliced meats, salads, etc., if you ask. Treat your sugar search as a scavenger hunt!

Banish boredom with a modern-day treasure hunt. It's called geocaching (jee-oh-cash-ing). Instead of hunting for a buried chest, you're looking for a cache of goodies hidden in above-ground sites. \"X\" still marks the spot, but instead of a map, you use a GPS system. The one in your smartphone works great, just search for free GPS/exergaming apps. At some locations, such as state parks, you can borrow geocaching kits. </p> <p>So what's geocaching all about? It's one of the fastest-growing outdoor activities. Caches are hidden all over the world by geocachers who put together a hodgepodge of trinkets, a logbook and a pen or pencil, and, sometimes, a disposable camera. These items are then stuffed into a weatherproof box and hidden under a rock, behind a tree, under a bench or by an outdoor landmark or statue. </p> <p>There are no dues to play or clubs to join. Simply log onto <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/\" target=\"_blank\">geocaching.com</a> to access the more than 3 million cache coordinates. Geocache sites range from easy to challenging, and their level of difficulty is indicated alongside the cache's coordinates for easy access. </p> <p>Geocaching is fun, but it's also educational (don't tell the kids that). As they sleuth for and identify clues, they're polishing problem-and puzzle-solving skills and learning navigation and orienteering. </p> <p>It's also a great way to explore a Minnesota State park.

Your nurse or provider may take a minute or two to paint a fluoride varnish on their teeth. What's up with that?</p> <p>This simple treatment for children six months to five years old has been found to be an easy way to prevent cavities and slow the progress of very early cavity formation. Fluoride varnish is applied to teeth every three to six months. It's backed by the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.</p> <p>Here's what to disc;\"> <li>Your child's provider that fluoride varnish is due.</li> <li>If you have an infant or toddler, you and the provider will sit knee-to-knee with your child on your lap between you. You'll gently hold your child's arms.</li> <li>The nurse or provider will dry the child's teeth with a piece of gauze, then using a little brush, they'll paint the varnish on all tooth surfaces. That's it!</li> </ul> <p>Children can eat or drink anything immediately, but should hold off on sticky foods for four hours and wait to brush their teeth until the next day.</p> <p>While providers have been applying fluoride varnish in Employee and Community Health (ECH) for a while, nurses began doing the treatment in December 2018, giving them another way to help care for kids.</p> <p>So how's it being received? Kids love it. The varnish has a yummy bubblegum flavor. And parents have been very accepting.</p> <p>Fluoride varnish is just one step in creating a lifetime of healthy smiles for your child:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li><strong>Brushing. </strong>Brush teeth twice a day after the first tooth. For children three and younger, use a toothbrush with a smear of fluoride toothpaste about the size of a grain of rice. After age three, increase the amount of toothpaste to pea-size. Up until about age six, parents will need to help their children with brushing. </li> <li><strong>Healthy-eating habits.</strong> Encourage eating lots of fruits and veggies, little or no sugary foods or drinks and less-processed food. These same habits will also help prevent obesity. </li> <li><strong>Plenty of water.</strong> Water is good for every part of our body and our teeth are no exception. Fluoridated water is the best, because the fluoridation helps strengthen teeth. Well water needs to be tested for fluoride to know if it is good for your teeth. Keep in mind that bottled water is only fluoridated if it's spelled out on the label. </li> <li><strong>Regular dental checkups and care.</strong> Take your child to the dentist after the first tooth emerges or by their first birthday.</li> </ul> <p><em>Dr. Valeria Cristiani is a pediatrician with Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM).

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonFluoride VarnishPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Katherine Zeratsky, vegetarian diet is a healthy way of eating, you need to consider how to get the appropriate nutrients. It's also important to remember that a vegetarian diet is not necessarily a weight-loss diet. Rather, it's a healthy lifestyle choice. </p> <p>With a little planning, a vegetarian diet can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. It's important to include a variety of foods while not relying too heavily on processed foods. Processed foods can be higher in calories, sugar, fat and sodium.</p> <p>The types of vegetarian diets, and what foods are included and excluded, differ:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lacto-vegetarian</strong><br /> This diet excludes meat, fish, poultry and eggs, as well as foods that contain them. Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, yogurt and butter, are included.</li> <li><strong>Ovo-vegetarian</strong><br /> This diet excludes meat, poultry, seafood and dairy, but it allows eggs.</li> <li><strong>Lacto-ovo vegetarian</strong><br /> This diet excludes meat, fish and poultry, but it allows dairy products and eggs.</li> <li><strong>Pescatarian<br /> </strong>This diet excludes meat, poultry, dairy and eggs, but it allows fish.</li> <li><strong>Vegan</strong><br /> This diet excludes meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy, and all foods that contain these products.</li> <li><span style=\"color: #333333;\"><strong>Semivegetarian (or flexitarian)</strong><br /> T</span>his primarily plant-based diet includes dairy, eggs and poultry, and fish on occasion or in small quantities.</li> </ul> <p>When moving to a vegetarian diet, remember these key nutrients in your meals:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Calcium</strong><br /> This nutrient keeps your bones strong and prevents fractures. Milk and dairy products are highest in calcium. Dark green vegetables when eaten in sufficient quantities provide calcium, as well. Consider calcium-enriched and fortified products, as well.</li> <li><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br /> This nutrient is important for bone health, immune function and reduction of inflammation. Vitamin D is added to milk, some soy and rice milk, and some cereals. It's naturally found in mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light.</li> <li><strong>Vitamin B-12</strong><br /> This vitamin is necessary to produce blood cells and prevent anemia. Dairy and eggs are good sources. Vegans and older adults who may have more difficulty absorbing vitamin B-12 may require fortified foods or vitamin supplements.</li> <li><strong>Protein</strong><br /> This nutrient helps maintain healthy skin, bones, muscles and organs. Eggs and dairy products are good sources, but you don't need to eat large quantities of these foods to meet your needs. Soy products, legumes, lentils, seeds, nuts and whole grains are also good sources of protein.</li> <li><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong><br /> They are especially important for heart health and during pregnancy. Excluding fish and eggs can decrease the amount of omega-3 your body requires. While canola oil, soy oil, walnuts, ground flaxseed and soybeans are good sources of plant-based omega-3, the body uses them less efficiently.</li> <li><strong>Iron and zinc</strong><br /> Iron is a crucial component of red blood cells. Because iron isn't as easily absorbed from plant sources, the recommended intake of iron is almost double if you receive your iron from plant sources, such as dried beans and peas, lentils, enriched cereals, whole-grain products, dark leafy green vegetables and dried fruit. Zinc also is not easily absorbed from plant sources, such as whole grains, soy products, legumes, nuts and wheat germ. Legumes and cheese are good options to fulfill your zinc requirements.</li> <li><strong>Iodine</strong><br /> This is a component in thyroid hormones, which helps regulate your metabolism, growth and function of key organs. Plant-based diets are typically low in iodine. Adding just one-fourth of a teaspoon of iodized salt a day provides a significant amount of iodine.</li> </ul> <p>Whichever diet you decide on, it's important to choose a variety of healthy plant-based foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes and nuts, and whole grains. At the same time, be sure to cut back on less healthy choices, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit juices, overly processed foods and refined grains.</p> <p>Be sure that whatever diet you choose includes the nutrients you need to stay healthy. For more information, talk to your health care team or request a referral to a dietician to learn more.</p> <p><em>Katherine Zeratsky, R.D.N., L.D., is a dietitian who has worked for Mayo Clinic in Rochester for more than 20 years.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonVegetarian DietPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Elliot Bruhl4 things to know about rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the joints, causing swelling and pain. However, it also affects multiple organ systems. Before new medications were introduced in the 1980s and '90s, RA often progressed rapidly and resulted in early deaths for many who had the disease. Modern drugs have greatly improved both quality of life and survival for people with RA, but it continues to be a major threat to their health. </p> <p>Research has found one of the most important areas of added risk is cardiovascular disease. Here are four things those with RA should know about this complex link between it and heart disease: </p> <ol> <li><strong>Inflammation.</strong> RA increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which can cause heart attacks. This probably is due to the overall higher level of inflammation caused by RA. Inflammation increases the chance of developing plaques in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. </li> <li><strong>Less exercise.</strong> Most with RA exercise less, due to joint pain. Regular exercise is important for preventing coronary artery disease and heart attacks. Less exercise can contribute to higher risk for these health issues. </li> <li><strong>Steroid use.</strong> To control their disease, many with RA require frequent or long-term use of glucocorticoids (steroids). While steroids usually are not associated with more risk for heart disease, chronic use by those with RA does seem to increase the risk. The reason is not understood and still is being researched. </li> <li><strong>Other pain relievers.</strong> Many with RA also tend to use NSAIDS and (cox)-2 inhibitors, such as Motrin and Celebrex, to control their pain. These medications have been shown to increase the risk of heart attack for all patients when used frequently or in high doses. The risk is somewhat higher for individuals with RA because they are more likely to use these drugs. </li> </ol> <p>People with RA should work with their provider to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease as much as possible. These strategies have been shown to help:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stop smoking!</strong> There are many ways available to help people stop smoking, including nicotine replacement, counseling and inpatient treatment. </li> <li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong> Those with RA should eat a healthy diet low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables. If their cholesterol is above normal, they should discuss medications for controlling it with their provider. </li> <li><strong>Set treatment goals.</strong> While is may be possible for many to eliminate the use of NSAIDS and steroids, they should work with their provider to set goals for minimizing their use, yet still control pain and improve mobility. </li> <li><strong>Exercise more.</strong> Many studies show that regular activity, whether walking, swimming or just working around the house, reduces the overall fatigue and pain caused by RA. It also has the added benefit of reducing the risk of heart disease. </li> </ul> <p><em>Dr. Elliot Bruhl is a family physician practicing primary care medicine in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Department of Family Medicine at Mayo Family Clinic Northwest, where he also serves as the clinic's medical director. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/arthritis/ech_rhuematoid_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=5110565E62688D39EDDAB0313528E394\" alt=\"ECH_Rhuematoid_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />The link between RA and cardiovascular disease is complex, but you can help reduce the risk.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonPoison PreventionPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Jane NjeruInterpreters at Mayo Clinic - interactions between patients and their health care teams, clear and complete communication is vital. It is important that providers get an accurate and complete picture of each patient's concerns, and patients also need to be fully 'heard' and understood, as well as to comprehend fully the recommendations they receive from providers. </p> <p>In a country where many health care providers speak only English, patients who have limited English proficiency, defined as those who speak English less than very well, may require an interpreter for adequate communication with their health care teams. Interpreters serve a critical role in facilitating communication between two parties, not only in terms of language, but also in cultural terms. Their role is to convey the message accurately without adding, modifying, or deleting information. </p> <p>At Mayo Clinic, interpreters are available at no cost to assist with communication between health care providers and patients whose primary language is not English. Experienced medical interpreters attend appointments with patients (in-person or virtually), translate patient education materials, and offer other assistance as needed, including helping communicate appointment details and deliver test results to patients. Patients are usually asked to indicate if they need an interpreter at the time appointments are scheduled, which helps ensure that appropriate planning is done prior to the visit to facilitate the availability of an interpreter. </p> <p>Mayo Clinic offers appointments for patients in person, via video or phone. Interpreters are available to assist with each of these types of visits. While family members may be willing to assist with interpretation for the patient, best practices indicate that having a trained medical interpreter who is familiar with medical terminology is the ideal standard. Adequate communication is irreplaceable in the healing relationship between providers and health care teams. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jane-njeru-mbchb/\">Dr. Jane Njeru</a> is a general internist in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

In the Midwest, hunting is often a tradition of spending time with family and friends. Unfortunately, hunting can be dangerous if you don't take proper safety measures. While hunting accidents are uncommon, they can be catastrophic. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources: </p> <ul> <li>Approximately 800,000 hunting licenses are sold each </li> <li>From 2005-2015, there were 219 hunting accidents.</li> <li>During that time, there were 22 fatalities, as well as spinal injuries with paralysis. </li> </ul> <p>Some general measures for a safe <ul> <li>Follow gun safety rules. </li> drugs, alcohol or sedatives while hunting. </li> <li>Carry a cell phone or other device to call for help if you need it. Keep it easily accessible. </li> </ul> <p>Two of the more common types of hunting accidents are tree-stand injuries and hearing loss. Following these simple steps will ensure that you'll have a safe hunting experience. </p> <p><strong>Tree-stand safety</strong></p> <p>Tree-stand safety is as important as gun safety. Follow the same approach with a tree stand as you do with your gun. </p> <ul> <li>Always wear a safety harness or belt while checking or using a stand. </li> <li>Use a short tether between you and the tree when attaching your fall-restraint device. This is to keep you in the stand if you slip or fall, not to catch you after you have fallen. </li> <li>Know what you should do if you slip while using a safety device. Make a plan.</li> <li>Check permanent tree stands each time before use. Replace any worn or weak lumber. </li> <li>Inspect portable stands for loose nuts and bolts before every use. </li> <li>Read, understand and follow the manufacturer's instructions when installing a ready-made tree stand. </li> <li>Choose a tree large enough to support your weight. </li> <li>Never hurry to set up your stand. Take your time to check it over. </li> <li>Make sure someone knows the location of your tree stand and when you will be there, every time. </li> <li>Use a haul line to raise or lower equipment. </li> <li>Keep firearms unloaded and arrows in a covered quiver when going up or down. Stay awake and alert. Always be aware of your position on the tree-stand platform. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Protect your hearing</strong></p> <p>People who use guns are more likely to develop permanent hearing loss. Shooting without hearing protection practically guarantees you will suffer at least some degree of hearing loss during your lifetime. </p> <p>The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) recommends that on-the-job exposure to noise of 115 decibels (dBA) not exceed 15 minutes per day. A .22 caliber rifle produces a noise level of 140 dBA; a typical deer rifle can produce noise greater than 175 dBA. You should always wear hearing protection such as ear plugs or muffs when shooting. </p> <p>On this year's hunt, aim for safety, as well as the game. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/matthew-bernard-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Matthew Bernard</a> is chair of the Department of Family Medicine and practices Family Medicine throughout Mayo Clinic sites in the Midwest.

While they tend to think about these products as being safe, side effects can occur. When combined with a prescription, these products can worsen or cause new side effects, or lessen the response of that prescription.</p> <p>Prescriptions for hypertension, or high blood pressure, are one example of medications that can be affected by over-the-counter and herbal products. Considering that nearly half of adults in the U.S. have hypertension or are taking a prescription for hypertension, it's important to be mindful of these potential interactions.</p> <p>Several over-the-counter products have been shown to increase blood pressure, even when used as labeled. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat pain, such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen sodium (Aleve) can increase blood pressure, as can decongestants to treat colds, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Sudafed-PE and Neo-Synephrine). Look for these ingredients in many other combination products for colds.</p> <p>Herbal products also can increase blood pressure, including ginkgo, ephedra, licorice, caffeine, saw palmetto and St. John's wort. Other herbal products that can contribute to increased blood pressure include arnica, bitter orange, blue cohosh, dong quai, guarana and yohimbine.</p> <p>If you've been told you have high blood pressure or are using a prescription to treat high blood pressure, talk to a member of your health care team before starting herbal or over-the-counter products to ensure they're safe for you. It's important to check the ingredient list on herbal and other over-the-counter products you take.</p> <p>Since many herbal products have not been well-studied, it may be difficult to predict the exact effects on blood pressure. Further, some products can lower blood pressure, increasing the risks of side effects.

While the COVID-19 pandemic is top of mind, other bugs and germs, such as cold viruses, stomach bugs and the flu, are still looking to spread illness. These germs thrive when people huddle together indoors, shake hands, or share towels and door handles. </p> <p>The past few months have been a reminder that the simplest things \u2014 masking and social distancing, for example \u2014 are the best weapons against infection. Also, another simple thing breaks the chain of infection, and it isn't a doctor's prescription. Rather, it's wisdom from your mother. Wash your hands. </p> <p>In addition to getting vaccinated for COVID-19 and influenza, you should wash your hands at these times:</p> <ul> <li>Before, during and after preparing food. </li> <li>Before eating. </li> <li>Before and after caring for someone sick. </li> <li>After changing a diaper, blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the toilet or touching garbage. </li> <li>After touching an animal, animal food or animal waste. </li> </ul> <p>Here are the steps to follow to ensure you're washing your hands correctly:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Wet.</strong> <br /> Use clean, running water at any temperature. Do not wash hands in standing water. </li> <li><strong>Lather. </strong><br /> Any soap will work. There's no evidence that soaps with special antibacterial ingredients are better at preventing disease. </li> <li><strong>Scrub. </strong><br /> Studies show that about 20 seconds is right for most situations. Sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song to get the timing right. Don't forget the back of your hands and under your nails. </li> <li><strong>Rinse.</strong> <br /> Use clean, running water. Do not rinse hands in standing water, as doing so could recontaminate your hands. </li> <li><strong>Dry.</strong> <br /> Wet hands transfer germs easier. Dry them using a clean towel or let them air dry. </li> </ol> <p>If you don't have access to soap and water, hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol will do. </p> <p>COVID-19 is still here and influenza is coming back, so be safe and thoughtful this holiday season.

You also may experience buzzing, hissing, clicking or even a roaring sensation when there are sounds no one else can hear. </p> <p><strong>What causes tinnitus?</strong></p> <p>Tinnitus is not a disease, but rather it is a symptom caused by another condition. The most common cause is inner ear damage to delicate hairs that transmit sound waves to your brain. Other common causes include age-related hearing loss, exposure to loud noise, earwax in your outer ear canal, and changes in the bones in your middle ear that transmit sounds. </p> <p>Less-common causes include problems related to blood vessels; head and neck injuries; jawbone (temporomandibular joint) disorders; (benign tumors on the cranial nerve); and Meniere's disease, which is often associated with severe dizziness. Even medications can cause tinnitus or worsen your symptoms.</p> <p><strong>Should you worry about tinnitus?</strong></p> <p>Whether you should worry about tinnitus depends. If it occurs suddenly, or you have dizziness or hearing loss associated with the noise, you should see your health care provider. Evaluation and treatment depend on the cause of tinnitus. </p> <p>While tinnitus can't be cured, it can be managed. This may involve removing excess earwax, treating an underlying vascular condition, changing medications, using white or masking noise, or being properly fitted with hearing aids. Sometimes tinnitus can be reduced if you hear sound better. Exercise and relaxation techniques also may help since tinnitus can worsen with stress. </p> <p>Several promising therapies include music therapy, training your brain to ignore the sound, and cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on replacing negative thoughts with positive ones to change your reaction to tinnitus. </p> <p><strong>How to prevent tinnitus</strong></p> <p>Most importantly, actions to prevent tinnitus: </p> <ul> <li>Wear ear protection when around loud machines, including firearms and chainsaws. </li> <li>Turn down the volume when listening to music. </li> <li>Take care of your heart and blood vessels. That means exercising and maintaining a normal blood pressure. </li> </ul> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Palliative Care.

Even if bacterial in origin, sinus infections can still clear on their own. </p> <p><strong>Does a green nasal discharge mean you have a bacterial infection?</strong></p> <p>In most cases, a green nasal discharge does not mean you have a bacterial infection. In most cases, this is a normal response to a virus. </p> <p>As the body's immune system is responding to the infection, there are more white blood cells present, which in turn causes the thickened and discolored nasal mucus. <p>Antibiotics are often overprescribed, and overuse can cause risks of antibiotic resistance (meaning these antibiotics won't work as well in the future).

Urine incontinence can adversely affect your physical, social and psychological well-being, and even your quality of life at home and at work. Answers to these frequently asked questions about this condition will help dispel some myths, and if you experience urine leakage, I encourage you to talk it over with your provider. </p> <p><strong>Q: How many women experience urine incontinence?</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> More than you may think! One in four women experience it, and incontinence gets more common with age \u2014 up to 75% of women over 65 report involuntary leakage. </p> <p><strong>Q: Isn't it just a normal result of childbirth and aging?</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> Childbirth and aging can play a role, but urine leaking isn't a given for women. Incontinence can be caused by several factors, and sometimes more than one. Each additional cause makes your symptoms more severe and the treatment more complex. There are two main types: stress and urge incontinence. If you have both, it's called mixed incontinence. </p> <p><strong>Q: What is stress incontinence and what causes it?</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> This is the leaking brought on by physical activities such as coughing, laughing, sneezing, jumping or even walking. Increased abdominal muscles from these actions exerts stress or pressure on your bladder and bladder neck. If your incontinence mechanisms are weakened, this increased stress causes leakage, typically spurts or drops of urine. Unfortunately, women affected by stress incontinence tend to stop doing their favorite sports or recreational activities and adapt a less-active lifestyle. </p> <p><strong>Q: How is this type of <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> If you have stress for treating it: </p> <ul> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Pelvic floor muscle training.</strong> A member of your care team or physical therapist trained in women's health will coach you on how to do Kegel exercises. These exercises strengthen the muscles of the your pelvic floor so they work more effectively and efficiently. You should see results within six months. </li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Treatment for conditions that may contribute to incontinence.</strong> Obesity, chronic cough, constipation, diabetes, limited mobility and genitourinary symptoms of menopause all can contribute if not addressed or treated. </li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Intravaginal pessary.</strong> A pessary is a device made out of silicone; it's fitted to your vagina and inserted by a provider in the clinic. Different types, shapes and sizes of pessaries are used for different pelvic floor problems, depending on your condition and what is most comfortable. A ring pessary has a knob that exerts external pressure on your urethra to overcome the pressure caused by daily activities. The effect of a pessary is immediate \u2014 and reversible once the device is removed. </li> <li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Surgery.</strong> When other options fail, surgery can be a solution. The most common procedure is the midurethral sling. A synthetic mesh is used to replace the damaged fibromuscular sling that supports the midsegment of the urethra and reestablishes the continence mechanism. This procedure has a success rate of 85-95%; complications related to the mesh are reported at 3%. A midurethral sling is considered minor surgery, and you'll probably be sent home the same day, with some limitations on your activity.</li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">These options are safe, but there are risks. There's a lot of confusing information about mesh and slings, so it's important to talk with your health care provider. If you're interested, consult an experienced surgeon who does a lot of these procedures.</p> <p style=\"margin-left: 80px;\">A less invasive option for some cases is an injection of bulking agents into the internal sphincter of the bladder, but this is less effective. </p> <p><strong>Q: What is urge incontinence and what causes it? <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> Have you ever had to \"go\" so bad, even when your bladder isn't full, that you just can't hold it, it starts and you can't stop it? That's urge incontinence, and women who have it say it's more distressing than stress incontinence because it's unpredictable and restricts their lifestyle more. You may find yourself mapping out where toilets are located and limiting outings and social activities because you don't want to be embarrassed. Urge incontinence is usually caused by involuntary bladder contractions or \"spasms\", creating the strong urge to go to the bathroom and producing a larger volume urine leakage. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This can be a common condition as you get older and most of the time there's no underlying condition causing it. Risk factors for this condition can include neuropathy, such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis, menopausal symptoms or some types of brain injury that alter the bladder's inhibitory As with stress incontinence, the first lines of therapy are pelvic floor muscle training and treatment of conditions that contribute to the problem. In addition, your health care team can teach and reinforce modifications as caffeine (coffee, tea, chocolate, certain medications, artificial sweeteners like aspartame and saccharin), alcoholic beverages, carbonated beverages (including sparkling water), chili pepper, citrus fruits and juices (grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, tangerines, kiwi, medications can be very effective in treating urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence. First-line options are medications that relax the muscles of your bladder. The most common side effects include dry mouth, constipation and low blood pressure. Recently, Botox (yes, the wrinkle-fixing drug) injections have been used in patients who don't respond to, or tolerate, the medicines. Injections provide reasonable improvement for about six months. Possible side effects include temporary urine retention. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Surgery is used for this type of incontinence only in very rare cases. </p> <p><strong>Q: If I'm experiencing leakage, should I talk it over with my provider?</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! Only 45% of women who experience weekly episodes of urine leakage talk with their providers about it. Some find it too embarrassing to discuss, while others may think it's just normal. You can find relief from this condition and resume your active, engaged lifestyle!</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jennifer-horn-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jennifer Horn</a> is a family physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Department of Family Medicine.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonUrinary IncontinencePrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Rose Prissel, MSN, RDN, LDWhen off winter doldrums with a burst of spring cleaning, don't forget the kitchen. Spring's a great time to target harmful bacteria that can lurk on kitchen surfaces and in your refrigerator. A clean kitchen helps protect you and your family from foodborne illness, but keeping food safe isn't just for spring \u2014 it should be a year-round practice. Remember, everything that touches food should be clean. </p> <p>Here are some cleaning tips for making your kitchen and meals safer: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Counters.</strong> They may look clean, but bacteria can hide anywhere. So clean surfaces thoroughly with hot water and soap. Then disinfect/sanitize with a strong chlorine bleach solution, if appropriate for the surface, or a disinfectant kitchen strong bleach solution of four teaspoons of bleach per quart of water or five tablespoons (1/3 cup) per gallon. </li> <li>Remember, never mix bleach with ammonia or other cleaners. Also, more bleach is not better. Let the solution stand on the surface for several minutes, then rinse with cold water and air dry or pat dry with fresh paper towels. Bleach solutions can lose their effectiveness over time, so discard any unused solution after one week. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Kitchen towels and sponges.</strong> These provide a moist environment for bacteria to grow. Consider using paper towels instead, and toss them when you're done. If you use cloth towels, wash them often in the hot cycle of your washing machine, If you use kitchen sponges, replace them frequently. </li> <li><strong>Kitchen sink and drain.</strong> Food particles get trapped in the drain and disposal, creating a perfect place for bacteria to thrive. Clean your kitchen sink, drain and disposal once a week with warm water and soap. Disinfect your drain and disposal by pouring in that bleach solution you made for the counters. </li> <li><strong>Microwaves.</strong> These workhorses of the kitchen often get overlooked in day-to-day cleaning. But you can give it a good cleaning with just a few steps: <ul> <li>Heat a microwave-safe bowl filled with water on high for approximately four minutes. </li> <li>Carefully remove the bowl; use hot water and dish soap to wipe down the inside. Dry with a fresh paper towel. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Cutting boards.</strong> Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use; then rinse and air or pat dry with clean paper towels. <ul> <li>To sanitize your cutting boards, use a solution of one tablespoon unscented, liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Flood the surface with the bleach solution and allow it to stand for several minutes; then rinse and air or pat dry with clean paper towels. </li> <li>Non-porous acrylic, plastic, glass and solid wood boards can be washed in a dishwasher, although laminated boards may crack or split. Even plastic boards wear out over time. Once cutting boards become very worn or develop hard-to-clean grooves, replace them. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Refrigerator.</strong> For general food safety, check that the temperature in your fridge is set below 40\u00b0F. Clean it weekly to get rid of spills, bacteria, mold and mildew that could contaminate foods. <ul> <li>Manufacturers recommend against using chlorine bleach, solvent cleaning solutions or abrasives because they can damage seals, gaskets and linings. </li> <li>Clean inside surfaces with hot water and soap. Rinse with a damp cloth; dry with a clean cloth. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>A clean kitchen is just one part of food safety and reducing food waste. How you handle and monitor food also plays a big role. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Wash your hands.</strong> It's your first line of protection. <ul> <li>To do the job properly, wet hands with warm, running water. Apply soap and rub your hands together vigorously to make lather and scrub all surfaces. Continue for 20 seconds (sing \"Happy Birthday\" two times), then dry thoroughly with a clean towel. </li> <li>In the kitchen, wash your hands before and after handling food, such as uncooked eggs or raw meat, poultry or fish and their juices. If something takes you away from the kitchen, wash your hands again before returning to food prep. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Wash fruits and veggies \u2014 but not meat, poultry or eggs!</strong> <ul> <li>As you cut or peel fruits and veggies, any bacteria on the outside can spread to the inside. This includes onions, bananas, oranges, pineapple and more. </li> <li>Washing raw meat and poultry can actually spread any bacteria, because juices may splash onto and contaminate your sink and countertops. Commercial eggs are washed before they're sold, so no need to wash them at home. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Toss or keep? To minimize food waste:</strong> <ul> <li>Check your fridge regularly to be sure you use foods before they spoil. </li> <li>Once a week, make it a habit to throw out or compost foods that shouldn't be eaten. </li> <li>There's an app for that!

Babies are usually born with 46 chromosomes, or \"groups\" of material, they inherit from their parents.

People with Down syndrome usually have multiple medical and learning challenges. </p> <p><strong>What is the test for Down syndrome?</strong></p> <p>Your health care provider can test for Down syndrome during pregnancy using a blood test or other procedures, depending on when you are tested in pregnancy. You can choose whether you would like this testing during pregnancy. </p> <p>After birth, babies can be tested for Down syndrome using a blood test if a health care provider sees signs of Down syndrome. </p> <p><strong>What medical problems accompany Down syndrome?</strong></p> <p>People with Down syndrome can have multiple possible medical complications, including vision and hearing problems, heart defects, sleep difficulties, or stomach issues. Your child's health care provider will check for these potential problems. Not all people with Down syndrome have all these medical issues. </p> <p><strong>What learning issues accompany Down syndrome?</strong></p> <p>Children with Down syndrome learn motor and language skills slower than children without Down syndrome. This is known as \"developmental delay.\" Almost all people with Down syndrome have intellectual disability or low IQ, which includes difficulty learning and trouble with activities of daily life. These difficulties can be mild to severe. </p> <p><strong>Can people with Down syndrome lead a meaningful life?</strong></p> <p><strong></strong> Yes, people with Down syndrome can still have meaningful friendships, and they can date and marry. Many job opportunities are available, as well, including in banks, hotels, hospitals and offices, as well as in the entertainment industry and child care. </p> <p><strong>How can I learn more about Down syndrome?</strong></p> <p><strong></strong> You can find more information on the <a target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> websites.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonDown SyndromePrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Luke a student athlete is busy. School, practice, games, homework and social demands all make for a full schedule. Sleep often gets overlooked when scheduling the day, but this can come at a price. A lack of quality sleep can greatly hinder a student athlete's academic and athletic performance. Your student athlete is experiencing an important period of physical, mental and emotional maturation. Sleep is vital to optimize healthy growth and development during this time. Here's how I respond to some of the common questions I get about sleep from parents of their student athletes. </p> <p><strong>What are the benefits of sleep?</strong></p> <p>There's been extensive research describing the benefits of sleep. Getting adequate, quality sleep has been demonstrated to improve mood, energy levels, physical and cognitive performance, speed up recovery, decrease illness and reduce likelihood of injury. </p> <p>Adequate sleep has been shown to improve academic performance, which is the number-one priority for student athletes. Getting enough quality sleep, in addition to practice, training and good nutrition and hydration, is a vital part of achieving a student athlete's peak athletic performance. From an injury prevention standpoint, some studies have shown that even getting a single additional hour of sleep at night can drastically reduce injury risk. </p> <p>Sleep is also important in regulating several physiologic functions, including energy storage. Sleep deprivation has been shown to decrease glycogen storage, which is one way the body stores energy for intense, prolonged physical activity. </p> <p><strong>How much sleep should I get?</strong></p> <p>The amount of sleep each individual athlete needs is a bit variable, since some need more than others in order to perform at their peak. However, for the majority of high school athletes, they should be getting a minimum of eight to 10 hours of sleep a night; younger athletes need even more. In addition to getting an adequate length of sleep, it's also important that sleep is high quality. </p> <p><strong>I heard napping was bad for teenagers, is this true? </strong></p> <p>Not all napping is bad. In fact, it's been shown to be beneficial if done appropriately, since it can provide a physical and mental boost. A daytime nap can help reduce sleep debt and improve your energy, alertness, memory and even reaction time and performance. Naps should be limited to about 30 minutes and shouldn't be done too late in the day, since prolonged naps or napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleeping. </p> <p>If the athlete is excessively sleepy during the day, they're probably not getting adequate restorative nighttime sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness can also be a symptom of depression in children, so alert your child's primary care provider if you're noticing a pattern of increased daytime sleepiness or other signs or symptoms of depression. </p> <p><strong>Is it okay if my athlete snores?</strong></p> <p>Snoring should not be brushed aside or ignored. Snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If your athlete consistently snores, then you should discuss this with your primary care provider to see if an evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist would be helpful. </p> <p><strong>What should I do if I'm having trouble sleeping?</strong></p> <p>Sleep difficulties can be due to a variety of reasons. Some student athletes have a difficult time falling asleep, while others may have trouble staying asleep or wake up frequently at night. Certain medical conditions can cause sleep issues, but most of these can be addressed by optimizing your sleep hygiene. </p> <p>Improving sleep includes practices such as:</p> <ul> <li>Having a consistent bedtime routine, including going to bed and waking up at consistent times. </li> <li>Creating a relaxing and soothing environment, such as a bath, soothing music or meditation. </li> <li>Making the room cool, dark and quiet. White noise or fans help some people sleep. </li> <li>Avoiding cell phones and other screen time at least one to two hours before bed; artificial light can be stimulating and make it more difficult to fall asleep. </li> <li>Avoiding heavy meals or exercise within two hours of bedtime, which can make it more difficult to fall asleep. Hunger also affects sleep, so try having a light snack before bedtime. </li> <li>Avoiding caffeine late in the day, including coffee, soda, tea, energy drinks and chocolate. </li> </ul> <p>If sleep problems persist despite these recommendations, consider discussing your student athlete's sleep with your primary care provider. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/luke-radel-md/\">Dr. Luke Radel</a> practices in Mayo Clinic Primary Care's Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM).

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonAthletes and SleepPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Gentile messages about the \"best\" way to eat, navigating the grocery aisles can be confusing. We all have the same goal: to provide our families with healthy meals and snacks. So it's important to be equipped with the evidence supporting a well-balanced diet when you head to the supermarket.</p> <p>Starting healthy habits in childhood leads to healthy habits in adulthood. When it comes to healthy eating, the focus is \"the more whole foods, the better\". This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes like dried peas, beans and soybeans.</p> <p>In this series, we're addressing several nutrition myths to help make healthy food choices less confusing.</p> <p><strong>Myth #3: Soy is bad for you</strong></p> <p>One type of food we hear a lot about in the news and on social media is soy. So what is it, and why should we work it into our family's diet? Soy is a legume, like chickpeas and kidney beans. It's found in products such as tofu, soymilk and tempeh; edamame is the fresh soybean pod. Soy is low in fat, contains no cholesterol and is high in folate, potassium, iron and magnesium. And it's a great source of plant protein and fiber, both of which promote cardiovascular health, gut health and weight control. However, these benefits apply only to whole soy products, not partially hydrogenated soybean oil or other refined soybean oils used in processed foods. Reading food labels can help you steer clear of these oils.</p> <p>Soybeans contain isoflavones, which are a type of phytoestrogen. Many people see the word \"estrogen\" in phytoestrogen and think that eating soy products causes development of feminine characteristics or even leads to breast cancer. That's not the case. Soy phytoestrogens have a special property that acts like estrogen in some parts of the body (like helping reduce menopausal symptoms and protect bones) and anti-estrogen in others (like protecting breast and uterine tissues).</p> <p>As dietary guidelines point more and more toward the beneficial effects of plant-based diets on our health, soy is a great plant protein option to mix into your weekly meal plan, and because it's available in so many forms, it's versatile for a wide variety of recipes. For an easy, tasty meal starter or snack, steam edamame and dip in soy sauce or hummus. When choosing soy products, look for organic or non-GMO, as well as products made from whole beans, not supplements. Legumes, including soybeans, add variety, texture and flavor to dishes from snacks to desserts. </p> <p>Here are some ideas for incorporating them into your meals:</p> <ul> <li>Adzuki beans (field peas or red beans): Soups, sweet bean paste, Japanese and Chinese dishes</li> <li>Anasazi beans: Soups and Southwestern dishes; can be used in recipes that call for pinto beans</li> <li>Black-eyed peas (cowpeas): salads, side dishes and garnish for salads</li> </ul> <p><em>Dr. Gentile</em><em> is a provider in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) department of Family Medicine.

This change is notable due to a long history of stigma attached to talking about mental health. However, this does not mean everyone is comfortable starting a conversation or openly discussing depression and mental health. Older generations may still feel uncomfortable with this. But everyone is still at risk for depression during such uncertain times. </p> <p><strong>What are common signs or symptoms of depression?</strong></p> <p>Depression, while more common as people age, is not a normal part of aging. Reasons for increased depression in the elderly include effects of chronic health conditions, physical limitations and the loss of loved ones. While everyone will feel down at times, if these feelings last weeks to months, it may suggest depression. </p> <p>Common symptoms of depression include: </p> <ul> <li>Feeling sad, hopeless, helpless or guilty. </li> interest in once death or suicide. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What can be done if someone is experiencing depression symptoms?</strong></p> <p>First, if a person is having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, or expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, reach out for help immediately. Seeking emergency care and making sure the person is not alone must be the first step. </p> <p>Over the last year and a half, isolation has been a big factor affecting mental health. The elderly have borne the brunt of this. </p> <p>It is important to remain respectful of others when talking about mental health. Just reaching out, and providing socialization and talking, can be a good start. Making regular contact and extending a hand to involve them in activities can build on this. </p> <p>Evidence suggests that psychotherapy, or talk therapy, as well as antidepressant medications can help. Primary care providers are sensitive to the effects of antidepressants and side effects in the elderly. They pay careful attention to medication selection and dosing to ensure they are well-tolerated. They also will watch for interactions with other medications. These should not be barriers to considering and discussing medications with one's health care provider. Therapy and medications are often used together. </p> <p><strong>Is there anything that can reduce the risk for depression?</strong></p> <p>Taking regular care of one's self and maintaining social contact can be beneficial in maintaining good mental health. </p> <p>These are some reasonable steps to focus on: </p> <ul> <li>Get regular exercise. </li> <li>Maintain </li> <li>Eat a healthy diet. </li> <li>Keep socially active, even if just with a phone call or video chat during the pandemic. </li> <li>Stay active with hobbies. </li> </ul> <p>Many elder care programs have options that provide low-cost or free phone calls with volunteers to provide another source of contact during this time. This often provides a nice resource to those who might not feel comfortable talking to family. Technology has made counseling services by video chat available to many in their own home, as well. </p> <p>Continue to watch out for others. Know that many around you might be struggling.

A frequent complaint following overuse or repetitive action is elbow pain. </p> <p>The best way to understand this elbow pain is that there are two main muscle groups in the forearm that control the actions of the wrist and fingers. </p> <ul> <li> <span>Bending the wrist and fingers uses the muscles that attach on the epicondyle on the inside (medial) of your elbow. </span> </li> <li>Bringing the wrist up and straightening the fingers uses muscles that attach on the bony prominence (epicondyle) on the outside or thumb side (lateral) of the elbow.</li> </ul> <p>Repeatedly moving your wrist and/or fingers in the same motion or activity can cause inflammation and irritation over the epicondyle, resulting in pain. Common causes of epicondylitis include: golfing, tennis, painting, cooking, gripping tools, or riding a bike. Most often the pain starts slowly over weeks to months. The pain is generally worse with activity, may radiate towards your hand, and result in the feeling of some weakness with use of the hand. </p> <p>Most people improve with home treatments. Initial treatments include: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Rest.</strong> Avoid any activity that worsens your symptoms. </li> <li><strong>NSAIDs.</strong> If you tolerate and are approved to take anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, they can help decrease the pain and inflammation. Tylenol can help with the pain but does not have the NSAIDs added benefit of being anti-inflammatory. </li> <li><strong>Bracing.</strong> Using an elbow counter brace during activity can take pressure off the irritated area. </li> <li><strong>Ice.</strong> Ice massage to the painful area can decrease pain and inflammation. </li> </ul> <p>If after a few weeks your symptoms are still not improving, contact your provider for further evaluation and consideration of additional treatment options. </p> <p>Some things to remember as you return to activities: </p> <ul> <li>Start slowly. </li> </li> </ul> <p><em>Chelsea Harstad, PA-C, is a physician assistant in Mayo Clinic in Rochester's Department of Orthopedics.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonBlood Donation COVIDPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Thomas deep vein thrombosis (DVT) makes the news when someone develops it on an airplane, often with serious effects on their health. But what is it and how can you avoid developing it? </p> <p><strong>What is deep vein thrombosis?</strong></p> <p>DVT is a condition where a clot forms in the veins of our legs, deep inside the muscles. It can develop if you have certain medical conditions that affect how your blood clots. DVT can also happen if you don't move for a long time, such as after surgery or an accident, when you're confined to bed or sit too long when flying or driving. </p> <p>This condition can be very serious because blood clots in your veins can break loose, travel through your bloodstream, lodge in your lungs and block blood flow, causing a pulmonary embolism. It's not all that common, though, affecting only about 3% of individuals. </p> <p>DVT can be confused with other conditions, including superficial thrombophlebitis and even a strain of your calf muscle. With superficial thrombophlebitis, the area has tenderness, often redness and warmth just under the surface of the skin. While the superficial clots are more obvious, they're much less serious than clots with DVT. </p> <p><strong>What are the symptoms?</strong></p> <p>The symptoms of DVT can be subtle. One leg, but not both, may swell over the course of a few days. This swelling is more prominent than what we all experience to some extent as the day progresses. There may be some discomfort, but it's harder to pinpoint. </p> <p><strong>How is DVT diagnosed? </strong></p> <p>If someone has new, unexplained pain or swelling of a single leg, DVT is a possibility. An evaluation should be scheduled promptly, within a day, if possible. Determining the cause of leg symptoms, whether pain or swelling, requires direct examination. This exam usually includes diagnostic testing, typically an ultrasound. In some instances, a clot is discovered as a result of testing done for other reasons. </p> <p><strong>What is the treatment?</strong></p> <p>In almost all cases, treatment of DVT requires blood-thinning medication, which falls into two categories: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Newer blood thinners.</strong> These are convenient, don't require injections and are somewhat safer, but they can be expensive. </li> <li><strong>Warfarin, pill form.</strong> Warfarin is still used routinely but it requires five or more days of heparin injections, as well as regular testing to monitor effectiveness. Even patients consistently taking the same dose of warfarin might have thinner and thicker clotting depending on diet, acute illness or other medications, so warfarin requires regular monitoring. Monitoring is done through the Primary Care in Rochester Anticoagulation Clinic pharmacy and nursing staff. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What happens after treatment?</strong></p> <p>Once you'll need to: </p> <ul> <li>Check with your doctor regularly to see if your treatment needs to be modified. If you're taking warfarin (Coumadin\u00ae, Jantoven\u00ae), you'll need a blood test to see how well your blood is clotting. </li> <li>Take your blood thinners as directed. If you've had DVT, you'll be on blood thinners for at least three to six months. </li> <li>Watch for excessive bleeding, which can be a side effect of taking blood thinners. Talk to your doctor about activities that could cause you to bruise or get cut, since even a minor injury could become serious if you're taking blood thinners. </li> <li>Move. If you've been on bed rest because of surgery or other factors, the sooner you get moving, the less likely blood clots will develop. </li> </ul> <p><strong>How can DVT be prevented?</strong></p> <p>The best treatment for DVT is preventing it from occurring. Here are some things you can do: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Avoid sitting still. </strong> <ul> <li>If you've had surgery or been on bed rest for other reasons, try to get moving as soon as possible. </li> <li>If you're sitting for a while, don't cross your legs, which can hamper blood flow. </li> <li>If you're traveling a long distance by car, stop every hour or so and walk around. </li> <li>If you're on a plane, stand or walk occasionally. If you can't do that, exercise your lower legs. Try raising and lowering your heels while keeping your toes on the floor, then raising your toes with your heels on the floor. </li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Make lifestyle changes.</strong> Lose weight and quit smoking. </li> <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Regular exercise lowers your risk of blood clots, which is especially important for people who sit a lot or travel frequently. </li> </ul> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/thomas-jaeger-md/\">Dr. Thomas Jaeger</a> is a consultant in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine, and is the Medical Director of the Primary Care Anticoagulation What it is, what causes it and how it can be treated and prevented.

Patients often ask why they can't get antibiotics even though they may have in the past. One good reason is antibiotic resistance. </p> <p><strong>What is antibiotic resistance, and why should you care?</strong></p> <p>Resistance means the antibiotic can no longer effectively treat a bacterial infection. This resistance often can be transferred to other bacteria. </p> <p>Sometimes this resistance can affect an entire group or class of antibiotics, which can limit the medications available to treat current and future infections. That can make it difficult to treat even common infections in large groups of patients. Limiting the number of options for treatment increases the chances of side effects and the costs of treating patients. </p> <p>Antibiotic resistance is a serious health problem. Over 2.8 million patients are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year, and 35,000 people die, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p><strong>You can help prevent antibiotic resistance by:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Taking only antibiotics that are prescribed for you. </li> <li>Finishing all antibiotic prescriptions.

Do I want the natural version or lower sodium? Organic or non-GMO? What kind of eggs come from the most humane farms?</p> <p>Labels on food packaging can be unclear and misleading. By understanding what some of their claims mean, you can make more informed choices and have confidence the next time you revisit those shelves. </p> <p><strong>Organic</strong>: The organic label addresses the type of farming practice used to grow food or ingredients. Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, genetically-engineered crops, and antibiotics or growth hormones in livestock. Although synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are prohibited in organic practices, natural chemicals commonly found in nature are allowed in production. Unless the label explicitly states \"100% Organic,\" the organic label only requires that 95 percent of the ingredients in the product be certified organic. While most assume organic is the healthier option, research is inconclusive if these practices produce more nutritious food. If trying to eat healthy, don't feel compelled to pay the higher prices for organic foods, as conventional versions can be just as nutritious!</p> <p><strong>Non-GMO</strong>: Many people confuse \"non-GMO\" to mean the same thing as \"organic.\" While all organic food is non-GMO, not all non-GMO foods are organic. Non-GMO is a term used to identify foods that do not have genetically-modified organisms. GMOs are typically used to better harvests by selecting traits in crops that are desirable, such as being resistant to certain pests. While some believe GMO foods are unsafe to consume, research does not support this claim; however, long-term safety of these foods is unknown. </p> <p><strong>Natural: </strong>The use of the term \"natural\" on food products does not have a formal definition yet, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has noted the meaning to include foods that contain no artificial or synthetic ingredients, which include color additives. Although natural foods are free from artificial ingredients, it does not address whether a food contains pesticides or has been subject to irradiation or pasteurization. </p> <p><strong>Grass-fed beef: </strong>When purchasing beef, this grass-fed claim often evokes a feeling of a higher quality and healthier product. However, the term \"grass-fed\" may not mean that the cattle were fed on grass for their entire lives. All beef are fed grass up until the final months before harvest, at which time they may be switched to a grain-based diet to reach goal weight at a faster pace.<strong> </strong>Products that state the beef is \"grass-finished\" mean the cattle grazed on grass prior to harvest, but can still be misleading in the sense that these cattle may still have consumed grain at some point.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonFood Label ClaimsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Jaclyn the often-chubby older gent with his foot resting on a footstool and his puffed-up big toe wrapped in a white bandage. His ailment? Gout. But for anyone who's experienced the symptoms of a warm, painful, swollen big toe, it's no joke. It's also not uncommon. Gout affects about 9.2 million people in the U.S. each year. </p> <p><strong>What is gout?</strong></p> <p>Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that typically causes a warm, painful, swollen joint. It can affect any joint, but the most common joint is the one at the base of the great or big toe. Those with chronic gout can even have multiple joints flare up at one time. </p> <p>Gout occurs when monosodium urate crystals deposit and accumulate in the joints. It can be diagnosed based on symptoms, but your provider will likely order some lab work, such as a uric acid level. Uric acid levels in the blood are typically high in those with gout. Testing the joint fluid for urate crystals under under a microscope can confirm the diagnosis. This confirmation is important because there are many illnesses that cause joint pain and inflammation. </p> <p><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></p> <p>A variety of factors can predispose an individual to developing gout, including: being male, medications, diet, obesity, family history and medical conditions, such as cardiovascular and renal disease. Circumstances that promote a gout flare include a recent trauma to a joint, changes in diet, dehydration and starting certain medications. Diets high in red and fatty meats, alcohol, seafood and sugary foods can potentially trigger a gout flare because the body breaks down these foods into uric acid. </p> <p><strong>What is the treatment such as ibuprofen, naproxen and indomethacin work well to treat an acute gout flare and are usually given when it starts. Taking medications in this class may not be an option for those with kidney disease, older than 65, on blood thinner medications or with a history of stomach ulcers. Colchicine is another anti-inflammatory medication used in gout flares. Corticosteroids also reduce inflammation and can be given either orally or injected. </p> <p><strong>How can it be prevented?</strong></p> <p>Gout flares can be prevented by a combination of dietary changes and medications. It's important to focus on eating a healthy diet, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products. Losing weight and increasing water intake can help reduce the chances of repeat flares, along with following a low-fat, low-sugar diet. For those with frequent gout flares, daily medication, such as allopurinol, may be necessary to lower uric acid in the blood. </p> <p>If you're looking to avoid getting gout or preventing flares, some foods to minimize and/or avoid include: </p> <ul> <li>Alcohol, specifically beer and liquor</li> including shellfish, anchovies, sardines and tuna</li> <li>Organ meats, red meat and processed high fructose corn syrup</li> <li>Sugary foods</li> </ul> <p>Mayo href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/gout-diet/art-20048524\" target=\"_blank\">modifying your diet</a> to control gout. </p> <p>If you have concerns about gout, please discuss any questions with your provider. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jaclyn-houghton-pac/\">Jaclyn (Jackie) Houghton, PA-C</a>, is a physician assistant in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonGoutPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Chad Ellis, LICSWMaking the choice: What home all of us will have to make health care decisions for ourselves or loved ones. One option is receiving care at home, which can increase the quality of live for the patient and their family since the patient is cared for in the comfort of their own home. One size doesn't fit all, so home health care agencies tailor care to meet the individual consumer's needs. Services can be provided on a short-term, long-term or intermittent basis and range from complex skilled nursing to brief custodial care. These services can cost less than care provided at a facility. </p> <p><strong>Arranging for home care</strong></p> <p>Finding an experienced and compassionate caregiver can be challenging, but doesn't have to be. Consumers can arrange home care services through an agency or by hiring an individual directly. Home care providers must be registered or licensed by the Minnesota Department of Health. Some agencies are also Medicare-certified, which requires both a state license and federal certification for certain standards of operation. Home health care agencies work to ensure the consumer is matched with a caregiver that has the skills, qualities and expertise to meet their needs. </p> <p>It's important to be an informed consumer when deciding on home health care. Agencies provide information about their services directly over the phone. Generally, it's best to compare the availability of service, insurance coverage, policies and credentials of the agency before deciding to hire them. A face-to-face meeting with the patient's health care provider must take place 90 days before or 30 days after the start of service. This visit needs to be related to the reason for seeking in-home services. </p> <p>Once you've chosen an agency, the patient will have an appointment with a registered nurse care coordinator who will oversee their care. The nurse care coordinator will collaborate with the care provider and patient to detail a plan identifying the type and frequency of service and its projected outcome. The agency will then begin making regular scheduled visits, providing the agreed-upon care to meet the patient's needs. </p> <p>People are often eager to resume their activities and lifestyle after being in the hospital. Their provider may refer them to a home health care agency for occupational, physical and/or speech therapy. </p> <ul> <li>An occupational or physical therapist can assess the patient's ability to function safely and independently at home. They check out the home environment, identify fall risks and make recommendations, if needed, for adaptive equipment, such as ramps and grab bars. They also provide in-home training to maximize the patient's ability to perform daily tasks.</li> <li>An occupational therapist helps the patient regain independence in taking care of themselves, such as dressing, bathing and preparing meals. </li> <li>A physical therapist helps the patient restore strength, balance, mobility and stamina. </li> <li>A speech therapist helps improve the patient's ability to communicate and swallow. </li> </ul> <p>Home health care agencies also can provide skilled nursing care, which often reduces the length of a hospital stay and prevents recurrent hospitalizations. In-home skilled nursing helps the patient recover from an illness and increase their independence as they learn to take care of their own health needs. Some typical needs for skilled nursing would include IV therapy, wound care, medication management and palliative care. </p> <p>Home health care agencies use home health aides to provide hands-on assistance with activities of daily living to patients who aren't able to safely perform them independently due to physical or cognitive limitations. They commonly perform tasks that don't require the expertise of skilled nursing, including managing personal cares, bathing, grooming, hygiene, walking, transfers, light housekeeping and meal preparation. The services provided by home health aides are only covered through Medicare insurance when there is also a \"skilled\" need. </p> <p>Medicare, Medicaid, VA benefits, county-waivered funds, and some private health insurance policies may cover the fees for the services. Home health care services are most commonly covered by Medicare, as long as it's medically necessary and prescribed by a provider, there's a \"skilled\" need, and the individual is homebound. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Skilled need.</strong> This refers to occupational, physical or speech therapy, or a skilled nursing service for IV therapy, wound care, medication management and palliative care. </li> <li><strong>Homebound.</strong> Medicare considers an individual homebound if leaving the home involves considerable and taxing effort and absences from home are infrequent and brief. Even if the individual is considered homebound, they can still go to medical appointments, religious services, and for short periods of time, special non-medical events without affecting their homebound status. </li> </ul> <p>For more information and assistance, call the Senior LinkAge Line at <a href=\"tel:18003332433\">1-800-333-2433</a>.

It can be even harder to let your child fail and not sweep in to save the day like the super hero you are. It's okay to not draw on your \"Super Parent\" powers that make everything better. By not paving the way for your child (think helicopter parenting), you might actually be helping them build important life skills. </p> <p>Allowing your child opportunities to experience frustration and failure is <em>crucial</em> to building their resilience. Resilience is when your child learns to work through everyday struggles or difficult circumstances and adapt and persevere in the face of challenges. </p> <p>Resilience is like a muscle, the more you use it, the stronger it gets. If children aren't given opportunities to exercise resilience in a supportive and loving environment, they're missing out on developing the key skills that will help them succeed at whatever life throws at them. </p> <p>To foster resilience, start by observing your child when they're faced with everyday challenges. How do they respond? Are they quick to cry, give up or ask for help? Or do they keep at it when things get tough? Some of your child's responses in these situations are related to their disposition and personality. </p> <p>Even babies can begin building their resiliency. When your infant is trying a new skill and getting frustrated, don't step in and do it for them. Instead, sit with them and encourage them to keep trying. </p> <p>Everyday life offers many opportunities to practice resiliency skills. As a parent, sometimes you need to slow down and let your toddler, child or teen try things on their own. For example: </p> <ul> <li>When your six year old is learning to buckle their seat belt, let them work through it, then praise them for their effort. </li> <li>When your preteen is experiencing drama with friends, don't rush in and call the other parent to get to the bottom of the situation. Encourage your child to work through it with their friend and give them the skills and support to do so. </li> </ul> <p>These key steps will help your child develop their resilience: </p> <ul> <li>Teach your child that decisions have consequences and whenever possible, involve your child in decision-making and let the natural consequences play out. </li> <li>Teach your child that failure is part of life. If your child learns to expect to fail at things sometimes, they'll be more willing to try new things. They'll start seeing failure as an opportunity to learn. </li> <li>Foster your child's character strengths. Everyone has strengths! Identify your child's and find ways to nurture them. </li> </ul> <p>If you're interested in learning more about resilience, read about it in chapter 17, \"Raising a Resilient Child\", of a new book from Mayo Clinic, <em>Mayo Clinic's Guide to Raising a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://marketplace.mayoclinic.com/shop/healthy-lifestyle/book/mayo-clinic-guide-to-raising-a-healthy-child_296300\" target=\"_blank\">buy it</a> from Mayo, your local retailer. general pediatrician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

The answers can give you peace of mind and let your kids splish and splash safely all summer long. </p> <p><strong>Can babies or toddlers wear diapers in the water?</strong></p> <p>Swim diapers and swim pants are water-repellent and fit snugly around a child's thighs and waist, but they're not waterproof. If your child has a bowel movement in the water, fecal material might escape the diaper.</p> <p>A dirty diaper may contain diarrhea-causing germs, including the parasite cryptosporidium, which can contaminate pool water or other swimming areas. In healthy people, a cryptosporidium infection is less concerning and may cause diarrhea. The consequences can be more severe for the elderly and people with a chronic condition or weak immune system.</p> <p>Urine in the water is less risky than feces, but it's difficult to separate the two when children wear diapers. If you allow your child to swim in a diaper, take bathroom breaks to use the toilet or change the diaper. If your child has diarrhea, keep them out of the water.</p> <p><strong>Is it risky for children to swallow pool water?</strong></p> <p>Your child is bound to gulp pool water, especially when first learning to swim. A little swallowed pool water typically isn't a cause for concern, but too much can lead to illness. Encourage your child to spit out any water that gets in their mouth.</p> <p><strong>If my child has a splint, brace or made of fiberglass. Some are made of plaster. The majority of casts should not be<strong> </strong>used in the water unless your medical provider specifically tells you that your cast is waterproof.<strong> </strong></li> <li>Certain braces or splints are waterproof, but this should also be cleared by your medical provider.</li> </ul> <p>If you have your doctor's go-ahead to get your cast, brace or splint wet, after swimming, thoroughly rinse the inside of the cast with clean water and allow it to air dry.</p> <p><strong>Can children be in the water if they have ear tubes?</strong></p> <p>If your child has ear tubes \u2014 tiny cylinders placed through the eardrum to drain fluid and allow air into the middle ear \u2014 ask their doctor about ear protection and if it's okay for your little fish to go in the water. Many times kids can swim in pools without ear plugs or other ear protection, but regular use might be needed when they dive or swim in untreated water, such as lakes and rivers.</p> <p><strong>What's the best way to prevent swimmer's ear?</strong></p> <p>Swimmer's ear is an infection that's often treated with prescription eardrops. To prevent this <li><strong>Keep ears dry.</strong> Encourage your child to wear ear plugs while swimming. After being in the water, dry their ears by gently wiping the outer ears with a soft towel or use a hair dryer. Put the hair dryer on the lowest setting and hold it at least a foot away from the ear.</li> <li><strong>Avoid using cotton swabs.</strong> Don't use cotton swabs in your child's ears, which can pack material deeper into the ear canal and irritate or break the thin skin inside the ear.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What about red eyes after swimming?</strong></p> <p>Exposure to chlorine used to treat pool water might leave your child with red eyes. To ease discomfort and reduce redness, rinse your child's eyes with a sterile eyewash or an artificial tears solution. To prevent red or puffy eyes, encourage your child to wear goggles while in the water.</p> <p><strong>What's the best age to begin swimming lessons?</strong></p> <p>Swimming lessons can be beneficial for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports swimming lessons for most children ages four and older.</p> <p>Lessons can be considered for children ages one to four, but should be based on how frequently your child is exposed to water and the program. New evidence shows that children in this age group may be less likely to drown if they have formal swimming instruction.</p> <p><strong>Can children swim when they're sick or have cuts and scrapes?</strong></p> <p>It's fine for children who have colds or other minor illnesses to swim if they feel well enough. It's also okay for them to swim with cuts and scrapes, as long as the wounds aren't bleeding.</p> <p><strong>Is it okay to swim right after eating?</strong></p> <p>Waiting an hour to go in the water after eating to prevent stomach cramps and drowning is an old summertime myth. It's okay for kids to swim right after a light meal or snack. But if they feel really full or sleepy, encourage them to take a break before swimming.</p> <p><strong>Are hot tubs safe for kids?</strong></p> <p>Young children can quickly become overheated in a hot tub or spa.

Special considerations that affect eating as you age include living situations, routines, appetites and food preferences. As you approach life's next stage, it's important to make sure your body gets the essential vitamins and minerals recommended to promote optimal health and aging. </p> <p>Different foods provide different vitamins and minerals, so picking a variety of foods at mealtimes will help ensure a proper balance of important nutrients. To meet nutritional needs, aim to pick foods from at least three food groups at each meal. </p> <p>Here are some the nutrients especially important in healthy aging: </p> <p><strong>Vitamin D</strong></p> <p>Vitamin D helps maintain bone health as you age. Your body needs more than it did when you were younger. Sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, like salmon, as well as eggs and fortified foods and beverages, like milk and yogurt. </p> <p>Try to include a fatty fish once or twice per week in place of red meat. Make your soup or oatmeal with low-fat milk instead of water. </p> <p><strong>Calcium</strong></p> <p>Calcium helps the body maintain healthy bones and teeth. Try to aim for three servings of calcium-rich foods per day. Sources include low-fat or fat-free dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, soybeans, and calcium-fortified foods. </p> <p>Add a cup of low-fat or fat-free milk as a beverage at lunch or dinner. Consider yogurt or a low-fat cheese as an afternoon snack. </p> <p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong></p> <p>Vitamin B12 is important for healthy nerves and helps prevent a type of anemia that can lead to weakness and fatigue. Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, poultry, milk and fortified breakfast cereals. </p> <p>Shop for a cereal that has been fortified with vitamin B12. Include a serving of meat at least once per day. </p> <p><strong>Potassium</strong></p> <p>Potassium helps support proper kidney and heart function, muscle contraction and nerve function. Getting enough potassium helps support a healthy blood pressure. </p> <p>Potassium is found in many foods, and it is especially high in plant foods. Good sources include fruits, vegetables, lentils, kidney beans, nuts, milk, yogurt and meat. </p> <p>Aim to include a side of fruit or vegetables at every meal. Include a plant-based protein like lentils or kidney beans once or twice per week in place of meat. </p> <p><strong>Fiber</strong></p> <p>Fiber helps support regular bowel movements and lowers the risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Good sources of fiber include whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, lentils, and whole varieties of fruits and vegetables. </p> <p>Make it a goal to chew your fruits and veggies whole instead of drinking them in the form of juice. Look for the whole-grain labeling on the front of the packaging and choices that offer at least 2-3 grams of fiber per serving. </p> <p><strong>Additional guidance</strong></p> <p>A nutritionist can offer additional guidance specific to your needs and preferences. It may seem challenging, but it can be fun and inviting to consider changing up your food choices in the next stage of life. </p> <p><em>Carly Herr is a dietetic intern at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

While more than one-third of adults in the U.S. are obese, it's now commonly seen even in low- and middle-income countries. Plus, there's been a 10-times increase in global childhood and adolescent obesity since 1975. At least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. </p> <p><strong>Myth:</strong> It's okay for children to be overweight. It shows they're healthy, more likely to be obese as adults. They're also more likely than healthy-weight children to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease at a younger age. </p> <p><strong>Myth:</strong> If you're obese, you need to get your weight to normal to achieve health benefits. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Research shows that a weight loss of 5-10% results in improved health outcomes, including lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure and reduced cholesterol levels. Focus on slow, progressive weight loss with a goal of taking off 10% of your starting weight after six months. </p> <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Only a few diseases are associated with obesity. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> More than 60 diseases have been linked to obesity; among them are diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, stroke and cancer. </p> <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Not that many people die of obesity. </p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><strong>Fact:</strong> Worldwide, obesity is one of the top-five leading causes of death. The other four leading causes are high blood pressure, tobacco use, high blood glucose and physical inactivity. </p> <p>People who are overweight or obese also miss more work days and spend more on medical bills than people of normal weight. The realities of carrying around excess weight can start to creep up on you and take its toll. The good news is that obesity is largely preventable, and a healthy diet and regular exercise can go a long way to help you reach and maintain a healthy weight. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/ramona-dejesus-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Ramona DeJesus</a> is a general internist in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

Let's set the record straight on some of these myths. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonObesity Facts FictionPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Denise Dupras, M.D.I've got to move - Do 5%-10% of people suffer from restless legs. But what is this condition and how do you know if you have it? </p> <p>There are four main symptoms of restless legs: </p> <ul> <li>An uncomfortable feeling or urge to move your legs. </li> <li>Symptoms are usually worse at night. </li> <li>Symptoms come on with rest. </li> <li>Symptoms go away with moving your legs. </li> </ul> <p>The condition is more common as you get older and in women. It can run in families, and can be associated with other conditions, including peripheral neuropathy, iron deficiency, kidney failure and spinal cord problems. </p> <p>The symptoms can range from mild and not bothersome to severe to the point that it interferes with day-to-day functioning and sleep. </p> <p>There isn't a test that makes the diagnosis of restless legs, but seeing a doctor is important to make sure there isn't another cause for your symptoms. Your doctor likely will perform a physical examination and order some basic tests. </p> <p>Simple lifestyle changes may alleviate some of the symptoms, including: </p> <ul> <li>Soak in a warm bath and massage your legs</li> <li>Alternate the use of heat or cold packs</li> <li>Maintain a good sleep regimen</li> exercise</li> <li>Avoid caffeine</li> </ul> <p>Restless legs syndrome is not a curable disease. Once the diagnosis is made, there are many options for treatment. Replacement of iron is appropriate if there is iron deficiency, even if you aren't anemic. Treatment often focuses on increasing dopamine levels in the brain with medications that are often used for patients with Parkinson's disease. The primary disadvantage is that, over time, the dose will need to be increased to be effective. Another class of medications that affect calcium channels, which includes gabapentin, are effective for some patients. Other medications, such as opioids, muscle relaxants and sleep aids, are rarely used in the treatment of restless legs. </p> <p>The bottom line is that if you feel like you just have to move your legs at the end of the day or when you are at rest and you get relief if you get up and walk around, it might be time to see your doctor and find out if you have restless legs syndrome. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internal medicine physician in the Division of Community Internal Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

So when her mother, Kerry, dropped Shea off at her grandmother's for the weekend, she had no reason to worry. But by Sunday, her grandmother was concerned that Shea had been sleeping a lot and looked a little yellow. So she called Kerry. </p> <p>Kerry and her husband, Joe, wasted no time taking Shea to the doctor. Under the light, her skin did look jaundiced. The pediatrician initially thought these signs pointed to leukemia, so Shea was sent to Saint Marys Hospital in Rochester. Later that evening, test results revealed that she had autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a rare disease in which white blood cells attack red blood cells. </p> <p>For two months, Shea and her family lived at the hospital. She received a total of 63 blood transfusions, often two or three a day, as well as a few rounds of chemotherapy. When her hemoglobin returned to a regular level, Shea was finally able to go home. </p> <p>Now, once every two months she's checked at the hospital, and doctors are hopeful the disease won't return. </p> <p><strong>'Shea's Day': a birthday present for others needing blood</strong></p> <p>After a routine check in October 2018, Kerry was delighted to learn all of Shea's levels were within normal range and had been staying consistent.

It's often referred to as the \"change of life\" and marks the transition between a woman's childbearing and non-childbearing years. Menopause is a natural part of aging and happens because of the gradual loss of estrogen, a hormone primarily produced in the ovaries. </p> <p><strong>What are the signs and symptoms of menopause?</strong></p> <p>As estrogen production declines, women often develop irregular periods, hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and fatigue. These symptoms usually develop three to five years before a woman's last period \u2014 a time referred to as perimenopause. </p> <p>Menopause usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, with an average age of 51. If a woman is 45 or older and stops menstruating completely for one year, it's assumed she's in menopause. Lab testing isn't needed to confirm menopause. If a woman is under 45 and stops having periods or thinks she may be having menopause symptoms, then she should talk with her doctor to determine if any testing is needed. She may need testing to see if it's menopause or another problem causing her symptoms. A woman should also contact her care team if:</p> <ul> <li>She's having really bothersome menopausal symptoms that are interfering with her activities</li> <li>She's experiencing heavy bleeding during her period or between periods</li> <li>She starts bleeding again after entering menopause</li> </ul> <p>Menopause affects all women regardless of race or socioeconomic background, but it's an experience unique to every woman. Some women have more estrogen-deficiency related symptoms and find menopause extremely bothersome, while others may have few or no symptoms. </p> <p><strong>What are the health concerns for women in menopause?</strong></p> <p>Reduced levels of estrogen after menopause can lead to health problems. The most common is osteoporosis \u2014 thinning of the bones \u2014 which increases risk of fractures. Postmenopausal women are at risk for other health problems, including heart disease, stroke and cancer, but the relationship to changes in estrogen levels is not clear. </p> <p><strong>What are the treatment options for menopausal symptoms?</strong></p> <p>Medical treatments available by prescription include hormone replacement therapy, antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Estrogen replacement.</strong> It's safe for most healthy women, and it's the most effective treatment. Typically, hormone replacement therapy is recommended for up to five years. It's not recommended for women with a history of breast cancer, heart disease or stroke. Progesterone treatment will also be needed if a woman still has a uterus. </li> <li><strong>Antidepressants.</strong> Some types can help ease hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms \u2014 even in women who are not depressed. </li> <li><strong>Anti-seizure medications.</strong> These have effectively treated hot flashes in some women. </li> <li><strong>Natural remedies.</strong> Some may not be safe, so a woman should talk with her care team before taking them, especially if she has a history of breast cancer. </li> <li><strong>Smoking.</strong> Women who smoke should quit, since smoking intensifies hot flashes. </li> </ul> <p>Menopause is a normal part of a woman's life and doesn't always need to be treated, unless symptoms are particularly bothersome.

Mosquitoes are pesky parasites that leave bites that can be unbearably itchy. So what's the best way to cope with this summertime nuisance?</p> <p>The best way to keep mosquito bites to a minimum is to: </p> <ul> <li>Use repellent sprays or wipes containing DEET, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, a plant-based option</li> <li>Avoid outdoor activities between dusk and dawn when skeeters are most active</li> <li>Repair any tears in window and door screens and camping gear</li> <li>Use mosquito netting over strollers and cribs or when sleeping outdoors</li> </ul> <p>If you do get a bite, why does it itch? Mosquitoes deposit saliva in our skin when they bite us. Our bodies react to the saliva, causing a bump, which usually clears up on its own in a few days, but can cause unbearable itching in the meantime. </p> <p>Some of the tried-and-true home remedies for treating mosquito bites work well to calm down bites, including calamine lotion, over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream and even a cold compress. </p> <p>These remedies sooth and quiet the intense burning and inflammation we feel in our skin. But while it's not always easy, it's also important to not scratch them. Why? If we scratch bites hard enough, it can break the skin. Then there's a chance of developing a bacterial infection. </p> <p>Although using insect repellent and other prevention tips can reduce your chances of being bit, getting at least one skeeter bite this summer is almost inevitable.

Food poisoning \u2014 also called foodborne illness \u2014 is caused by harmful germs, such as bacteria, in contaminated food. Because bacteria typically doesn't change the taste, smell or look of food, you can't tell whether it's dangerous to eat. So if in doubt, throw it out. </p> <p>Fortunately, proper cooking and food handling can prevent most cases of food poisoning. </p> <p>To practice food safety: </p> <ul> <li>Quickly refrigerate perishable as meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs. </li> <li>Don't let food sit more than two hours at typical room temperature or more than one hour at temperatures above 90 F. </li> <li>Uncooked foods, such as cold salads or sandwiches, also should be eaten or refrigerated promptly. </li> </ul> <p>Your goal is to reduce the time a food is in the \"danger zone\" \u2014 between 40 F and 140 F \u2014 when bacteria can quickly grow. </p> <p>If you're going on a picnic or hosting a cookout, you should: </p> <ul> <li>Keep cold foods in a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs until ready to serve. </li> <li>To preserve quality and safety, consider resting a container or plate of cold items on a bed or bowl of ice. </li> <li>Have a separate cooler for drinks since this cooler will be opened more frequently and affect the temperature. </li> </ul> <p>For Food and Drug you shouldn't use slow cookers to reheat food, you can use them to maintain the temperature of foods that are already hot. Keep your food at or above 140 F, usually on the low temperature setting. Tip: This is an option when you're feeding a large group and need to keep hamburgers or meat from the grill hot. </p> <p>Leftovers can be kept for three to four days in the refrigerator. After that, the risk of food poisoning increases. If you don't think you'll be able to eat leftovers within four days, freeze them immediately. When ready to eat leftovers, reheat them on the stove or in a conventional oven or microwave until the internal temperature reaches 165 F. </p> <p><em>Katherine Zeratsky, R.D.N., L.D., has worked for Mayo Clinic in Rochester for more than 20 years.

It's called a whole-foods diet, and the best thing about this diet is that it's not a diet at all, but rather a food philosophy. </p> <p><strong>What is a whole-foods diet?</strong></p> <p>A whole-foods diet simply means choosing foods that are minimally processed. Think fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils, and whole grains. While a whole-foods diet does focus on eating lots of plant-based foods, it does not necessarily mean you have to become a vegetarian or vegan to eat a whole-foods diet. Meat and dairy are perfectly acceptable, but the idea is to choose those foods in moderation (a few times a week as opposed to every meal) and focus instead on fueling up with unprocessed plant foods for most of your meals. </p> <p><strong>What are the benefits?</strong></p> <p>Unprocessed foods tend to be rich in essential vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytochemicals and fiber, and are naturally low in saturated fat and sodium. Evidence from large population studies as well as randomized clinical trials has linked a diet higher in plant-based whole foods to lower occurrences of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, obesity and certain types of cancer. If that isn't reason enough, as an added bonus, whole-plant food can be grown and harvested while having a smaller effect on the environment and can be surprisingly affordable. </p> <p><strong>Is a whole-foods diet nutritionally adequate?</strong></p> <p>A common myth that often is used as an argument against a plant-based diet is that it does not supply us with all of the nutrients we need and doesn't supply enough protein. While it is true that it takes a little extra planning to meet protein goals, it is absolutely possible to get more than enough protein with a whole-food, plant-based diet. Remember that meat and dairy are perfectly acceptable, but if you are planning to eat a purely vegetarian or vegan diet, the main nutrients of concern are protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, calcium, zinc and iodine. In some cases, supplements may be necessary. It is recommended to talk to your primary care provider to set up an appointment with a registered dietitian who can help you plan a diet that ensures you are getting enough of these important nutrients. </p> <p><strong>Tips for getting started</strong></p> <p>Are you interested in trying the whole-food approach to eating? Try these tips to get started down the path to health and longevity:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Aim for at least one fully vegetarian meal a week, and go from there. </strong><br> If you are new to this concept, it may be a little intimidating to completely overhaul how you are eating immediately. To get started, try to plan one meal a week that fits the whole-food mold. From there, you can work toward incorporating one whole-food meal a day. Once you have a good idea of foods you enjoy and have some recipes you like, it will be much easier to eat this way for multiple meals every day. </li> <li><strong>Open up that spice drawer.</strong> <br> It's a common misconception that plant-based meals are bland and lack flavor. Try experimenting with different spices and herbs other than salt to spice up your dishes. A few of my favorites are lemon juice, garlic and onion powder, turmeric, tarragon, cumin, coriander, paprika, ground mustard seed, marjoram, mint, rosemary, thyme, basil, and ginger. The possibilities are endless. </li> <li><strong>Build a healthy plate.</strong> <br> When preparing a plate, try to fill half the plate with vegetables (the more colorful the better), one quarter with whole grains, and the other quarter with a protein, such as beans or lentils. This will ensure you are getting a wide array of vitamins and minerals, and the fiber will fill you up and keep you satisfied. </li> </ul> <p><em>Eric DeAngelis is a dietetics intern at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Picky eating typically begins in young children and can last a lifetime. The good news is that it's never too early or too later to broaden one's palate and take a bite into a new food experience. </p> <p><strong>Should I force picky eaters to eat veggies?</strong></p> <p>You should not force picky eaters to eat their veggies. Force-feeding tends to interfere with the pleasure of eating. However, there is a difference between forcing, and encouraging, guiding and modeling healthy eating habits.</p> <p><strong>Will picky eaters grow out of it?</strong></p> <p>Up to 20% of children between the ages of 2 and 3 could be described as picky eaters. It is normal for young children to have strong likes and dislikes to foods. While most children grow out of it, some still have specific likes and dislikes. Acknowledge this, but continue to expose your children to plenty of healthy options. Also, be patient and try not to make food likes or dislikes a constant battle or topic of discussion.</p> <p><strong>Tips for incorporating new foods</strong></p> <p>Try these tips to picky eaters incorporate new foods:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Let your children help prepare the food. Give them hands-on experience touching and smelling the food. </li> <li>Allow your children to fill their plate. Let them decide what and how much they will try. </li> <li>Encourage them to take a bite of new foods, but don't get frustrated if they don't like it. It can take up to eight attempts of trying a food before they start to like it. </li> <li>Try growing a few vegetables and have your child help with the process. This gives them an understanding of where food comes from. </li> <li>Offer the same foods to the whole family, and let your child see you eating and enjoying the meal. </li> </ul> <p><strong>What you say matters</strong></p> <p>Telling your children that they have to eat the new food placed in from of them can make them feel as though they don't have a choice. Instead use phrases that help your children understand the sensory or beneficial qualities of a food.</p> <p>For example, instead of saying, \"You have to take a bite,\" instead try saying: \"These are carrots, and they are crunchy. They help your eyes so you can see better.\" By doing this, your children know a little of what to expect when they bite into the food.</p> <p><strong>Adult picky eaters</strong></p> <p>Expanding food preferences in adulthood can take a little more work, as adults have already distinguished the foods they like and dislike. Breaking out of the picky eating habits can be more stressful for adults, but it can still be done. Just as with children, don't force adult picky eaters to try new foods. Instead, encourage and support them.</p> <p>Here are some tips for adult picky eaters:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Take your time experimenting with new foods. </li> <li>Start out slow. For your first experience, just put the food in your mouth to understand its texture and how it tastes. It is OK to spit it out. For your second or third experience, just take one bite and swallow it. Next time, take a couple bites and keep growing from there. </li> <li>Most importantly, trust your own feelings as you try new foods, and go at your own pace. </li> </ul> <p><em>Madison Hemer is a former dietetic intern at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonPicky Eater TipsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Drs. Yasaman Fatemi and Robert M. JacobsonLead exposure: Why it's lead was used in paint, as an additive in gasoline, in water pipes and many other products, so it was found in homes, the air, water and soil. Children were often poisoned by eating chips of lead-based paint peeled from windowsills and walls or by chewing on painted toys. In Flint, it was caused by lead leaching from corroded water pipes. </p> <p>Recognizing the health impact of lead, public health agencies took measures to have it removed from gasoline and paint. However, many older homes still may have lead-based paint inside and out, creating an exposure risk from chips and dust. </p> <p>The U.S. banned lead-based paint in 1978. Homes built before 1978 likely contain lead-based paint. Lead from the paint can contaminate house dust and the grounds around the home as the paint chips, cracks, and wears. Home renovations may inadvertently increase lead exposure from demolition and sanding. Painted wooden windows might release lead when opening and closing causes the painted surfaces to rub and wear. </p> <p>While lead exposure is less of a concern today, it's still a concern, especially for older infants and toddlers. Why? Because at these ages, they tend to put things in their mouth. Lead poisoning is caused when lead builds up in the body. Even small amounts can cause serious health problems, including: </p> <ul> <li> Non-reversible cognitive issues, such as, lower IQ and poorer school performance, which will affect them throughout their lifetime. </li> <li> Slower growth and physical development </li> <li> Damage to the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults </li> <li> Seizures and unconsciousness from particularly high levels </li> </ul> <p>The main way you can help protect you and your family is to: </p> <ul> <li> Reduce exposure to lead-based paint chips.</li> <li>Wash hands and toys to reduce hand-to-mouth transfer of contaminated dust or soil from chips that may have fallen onto the ground around your home. </li> <li> Keep up on repairs around your home. </li> <li> Undertake lead-abatement measures, if necessary. </li> <li> Eat a healthy diet. Good nutrition and regular meals can help lower lead absorption. </li> </ul> <p>Also, see your health care provider regularly, especially if your child is under age two. If you're concerned about lead exposure, please tell your care team, so that your child can be screened. Your home also can be checked for lead, and if risk levels are high, we can refer you to the public health department for lead abatement and other programs. </p> <p><em>Dr. Yasaman Fatemi completed her medical schooling and pediatric residency here at Mayo Clinic, served as that residency's chief resident, and now is a fellow at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pediatric Infectious Diseases. </em></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/robert-jacobson-md/\">Dr. Robert M.

It can be a scary time for kids, and you may be wondering how to support and help them understand what's happening. These tips can help you help your kids cope through this experience. </p> <p><strong>Define terms about COVID-19.</strong> Kids are hearing about it all the time. Take time to sit down with your child to define what COVID-19 is, using language appropriate for their development. Start by asking your child, \"What do you think coronavirus or COVID-19 is?\" This gives you an understanding of what they know, think they know or how they interpret the illness. As you talk, here's how you can help explain the situation:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Coronavirus or COVID-19</strong> is a virus. A virus is so tiny, you can't see it, and it can cause a person's body to feel sick. The reason you are hearing so much about this virus, is because it's one our world hasn't seen before. Every day we're learning about it and ways to stop it from spreading through research. Experts around the world are working hard every day to learn about this virus and how to keep people safe. </li> <li>Most people who have COVID-19 say they have a cough, fever, chills (feeling cold) and body aches. The most common way the virus can enter a person's body is from their hands \u2014 and then touching their mouth or their eyes. That's why it's important to wash your hands often, especially before touching your mouth or your eyes. </li> <li>When people have coronavirus, or possibly have come in contact with others who have the illness, they're being asked to remain in <strong>quarantine.</strong> Quarantine means to stay in your house and not be in places or spaces with people other than your family.</li> <li>To help prevent coronavirus from spreading, we're being asked to <strong>social distance</strong> ourselves from one another. This means when we're outside our home, we shouldn't come into close contact with others. Pretend there is a bike separating you and the person you are standing by. Keep that distance away from people other than your family. Right now, instead of giving high fives, fist bumps or hugs to people outside your family, we can smile and wave to say hello. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Control your child's access to news and social media about coronavirus.</strong> Explain to your child there are many conflicting resources about the virus, so you're going to monitor and limit their access to external media for now. Reassure them you'll share any new information you learn that they should know. As a caregiver, use reliable sources such as the state health department, communication from your school district, etc., to gather your facts. Be aware of your child's presence when watching or listening to the news. Even though they may not appear to be paying attention, they may be listening and internalizing the information they hear. </p> <p><strong>Explain the importance of good hand washing.</strong> Bring your child to a sink and practice washing your hands together. Show them how to \"create tiny bubbles\" by rubbing their hands back and forth and how to get the soap between all spaces, even to the ends of their fingers. Encourage your child to sing an entire song such as \"Happy Birthday\" twice while they wash their hands, so they can be sure they're spending enough time getting their hands clean. </p> <ul> <li>Hang a sign, such as \"Welcome home. Please remember to wash your hands\", on your front door. This reminds them to wash their hands when they get home. </li> <li>Remind them to wash before meals, after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing. </li> </ul> <p><strong>When events are being canceled, explain how this will help prevent the spread of coronavirus. </strong>Young children may see canceling an event, a family vacation, school, going to the movies, etc., as a result of something they've done wrong. Explain that the reason you're not able to attend the event is to help prevent the spread of coronavirus, especially with large groups of people. If it's an option, share with your child future plans to attend the event after you know it's safe for everyone. </p> <p><strong>Remind your child when they're under someone else's care, to listen to them.</strong> It's important to tell them to follow directions and instructions from those who are responsible for them when you're not there, such as a grandparent, a daycare provider or teacher. Directions they give, such as practicing good handwashing, social distancing, covering your mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze, are practices to protect them and keep them safe.</p> <p><strong>Create new home routines as a family.</strong> Setting up and keeping routines help kids predict what's planned, allowing them to feel in control. Use a white board or paper to display a daily schedule at home. Explain that if social distancing continues to be encouraged, the new norm is going to be staying at home. Identifying clear expectations for the day will support and encourage kids to feel accomplished and like they're helping. When making a schedule, consider activities, such as wake-up/bedtime, meals, school/learning, exercise/outdoor, play and household responsibilities. </p> <p><strong>PLAY, PLAY, PLAY.</strong> Kids learn and process through play. Take advantage of being asked to stay home/social distance, to engage together as a family. Play games, play with toys, put together puzzles, read books, listen to/play music, dance, take family hikes and work on an art project together. For evening times, establish family fun nights, such as movie nights, cooking nights, game nights and ice cream nights. Even though being stuck at home may seem out of the norm, consider this an opportunity for your family to make good memories. </p> <p><strong>Connect with loved ones and friends with electronic devices.</strong></p> <ul> <li>During social isolation, call or FaceTime grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends you normally would engage with. This will help children not feel as isolated as they maintain and build relationships with their loved ones. </li> <li>Set up a virtual playdate with your child's friend. Kids can be fulfilled from watching others play. Children can also engage in the same activity by virtually playing with each other, also known as parallel play. </li> <li>Virtual connections are also a way to support their social development through interacting with others. </li> </ul> <p><strong>If your child becomes sick, reassure them.</strong> Remind them you, or someone who is caring for them, will keep a close watch on their body at all times. Reassure them you'll be in close contact with your medical provider if you feel medical advice is needed, and that the doctor or nurse will give instructions to help you care for them. </p> <p><strong>If your child hears of a friend or a loved one who becomes infected with coronavirus, reassure them.</strong> Let them know the friend or loved one has received medical advice, and they are being told how to help their body during their illness. As a family, send the person who is recovering a note through the mail. You could have your child draw a picture or write a story to add to your note. This lets them know you're thinking about them and a way for your child to feel they're helping their loved one or friend by bringing joy into their day. </p> <p><strong>Be honest with your kids.</strong> As a parent, it may go against your instinct to tell the truth because at times you may feel what you are sharing may cause fear, worry, anxiety or sadness. Being honest with your child and telling them you're going to be honest, builds trust between you. Remind them you'll keep them posted and update them when information changes or new information arises about coronavirus. This way, as new information comes up, they're hearing it from you. </p> <p>Have these conversations daily:</p> <ul> <li>This will give them the chance to ask you questions or help them process their concerns. </li> <li>Let your child know how you feel about COVID-19 to validate how they're feeling. You may feel challenged because of your own questions, concerns or worries. </li> <li>It's important to let your child know that you're following the guidance of our leaders. </li> <li>Remind them we're all doing things to help prevent the spread of the virus and to help keep our bodies safe. </li> </ul> <p>As a caregiver, you are your child's biggest support and advocate. You have the ability to make a significant difference on how your child copes through this ever-changing experience. </p> <p><em>Jennifer Rodemeyer, MA, CCLS, is a certified child life specialist and child life manager at Mayo help calm and inform them - and you.

More studies are exploring its effectiveness in relieving pain, but the data is still limited. </p> <p><strong>Complicated to study</strong></p> <p>One key factor complicates research into CBD: At the federal level, CBD-containing products are illegal, even if they're legal in some states. </p> <p><strong>No standard regulation</strong></p> <p>Neither the FDA nor federal regulatory agencies oversee the production or distribution of CBD sold from dispensaries or on the internet.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCBD OilPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Drs. Cesar a woman's pregnancy, Dr. Natalie Erbs, Family Medicine, is often asked, \"Am I having a boy or a girl?\" This question has been passed down through generations to guide expectations of \"what boys do\" and \"what girls do\". It affects how individuals view themselves, others and their futures \u2014 as well as which colors or clothing they'll use, recreational activities they'll pursue, what occupations they'll be encouraged to follow, and even how much emotion is acceptable to express. But what happens when your sex assigned at birth is not aligned with who you are as an individual? </p> <p>Between the ages of two and four, most children will have already learned stereotypes of what boys do and what girls do and will have told their parents what gender they are. For most children, gender expectations based on sex characteristics informs their gender identity, defined as the internal sense of being a boy or girl. </p> <ul> <li>The term cisgender is used to describe individuals whose gender identity is in line with their sex assigned at birth. Most people are cisgender women or cisgender men. </li> <li>The term transgender is used to describe individuals who report that their gender identity is not aligned with their sex assigned at birth. </li> </ul> <p>Among transgender individuals, many report distress due to the difference between their sex characteristics and gender identity. This distress is called dysphoria; transgender people may or may not experience it. </p> <p>In a random selection of 100,000 adults living in the U.S., it's estimated that approximately 580 adults would identify as transgender. For adolescents (ages 13 to 17), the estimate is that for every 100,000 there are 730 adolescents that identify as transgender. </p> <p>Multiple studies have suggested that among transgender people, 40 to 50% have attempted suicide at least once in their lifetime. This is significantly higher than the estimated 3 to 5% of the general U.S. population. </p> <p><strong>Minority stress linked to suicide attempts</strong></p> <p>Think about all of the stressors we have to deal with day in and day out. Now add the worry and focus of wondering if everyone you encounter is going to hurt or insult you just by being present. </p> <p>The constant worry and fear of being harassed and rejected, on top of daily stressors, is an example of minority stress. There's also the stress of being called the wrong name, wrong pronoun or being judged for using the bathroom.

While regular and symptomless vaginal discharge can be normal, if the discharge changes, is associated with symptoms or occurs after a new sexual partner, you should be evaluated. </p> <p><strong>When to monitor vaginal discharge</strong></p> <p>A regular amount of vaginal discharge is normal for most women. The average women has 2-3 tablespoons of discharge per day. This discharge is generally transparent to white in color, thick and odorless. Hormonal changes can increase or decrease the amount of vaginal discharge. </p> <p>Vaginal discharge increases in women at menarche \u2014 the development of the menstrual cycle \u2014 and near the middle of one's menstrual cycle when ovulation occurs. This discharge typically increases in volume; is thicker; and is often described as stringy, stretchy or whitened, compared to baseline discharge. </p> <p>Women can experience an increase or decrease in vaginal discharge during the perimenopause transition or with menopause. Use of hormonal contraceptives, including intrauterine contraception, also can change the amount of regular vaginal discharge. </p> <p><strong>When to be seen</strong></p> <p>Any change from the normal discharge pattern described above should be considered abnormal and discussed with your health care provider. Abnormal discharge is characterized by a change in color, odor or the amount of vaginal discharge experienced. </p> <p>If discharge is associated with vulvar \u2014 the external part of the female genitalia \u2014 or vaginal redness, swelling, masses or lesions, skin or mucosa changes, pain, itching, or other irritation, it should be evaluated.

My child has an algebra test they shouldn't miss. I don't feel THAT bad. </p> <p>Who hasn't had these mental debates when they're sick? But how do you decide if you're too sick to go to work or if you should keep your child home from school? These four tips should help:</p> <p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> Listen to your body. The same chemicals that tell the immune system to rush in and fend off invading viruses also tell us to slow down and rest. but we often tune out the messages our stuffy nose and aching body are sending us until we're so sick we can't get out of bed. </p> <p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> If you have flu-like (influenza) symptoms (high fever, cough, chills, body aches), stay home for at least 24 hours after your temperature returns to normal \u2014 that's without taking anything to reduce your fever. However, if you're a health care worker who has contact with stem cell transplant patients in a protective environment, you should stay home for one week once your temperature is normal. </p> <p>Think you have the flu? Rather than head to the clinic, just stay home.

Ten years later, and now a donor services technician with the Mayo Clinic Blood Donor program, Garrett was dealt another blow. </p> <p>After abdominal surgery on May 25, 2019, Garrett and his fiancee, Erin, were informed that he had Burkitt lymphoma. Facing the diagnosis head-on, together they supported one another and considered it \"just another hurdle\" to jump over before beginning their lives together. </p> <p>Burkitt lymphoma, which has a cure rate of approximately 90%, often grows quickly, and that was the case for Garrett. He spent a lot of time in the hospital, including the ICU, to get the disease under control.

During his treatment, his hemoglobin dropped to such dangerous levels that he needed nine units of red blood cells to help him feel better. </p> <p>After all the difficulties Garrett went through, he is officially in remission as of Nov. 2019.

He was 83 and had multiple medical problems, so it was easy enough to attribute his symptoms to medications, known lumbar spine disease, and his age. Extensive testing did not reveal the cause of his symptoms. </p> <p>Over the next six months, he developed more difficulty with swallowing, hoarseness and generalized weakness, which impaired his walking. When muscle twitches developed in his arms, trunk and tongue at six months, further evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Lou Gehrig's disease, which is also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. </p> <p><strong>ALS symptoms?</strong></p> <p>Signs and symptoms of ALS vary from person to person but can include: </p> <ul> <li>Difficulty walking or performing normal daily activities. </li> <li>Tripping and falling. </li> <li>Weakness in your legs, </li> <li>Muscle cramps twitching in your arms, shoulders or tongue. </li> <li>Inappropriate crying, laughing or yawning. </li> <li>Cognitive and behavioral changes. </li> </ul> <p>ALS often starts in the hands, feet or limbs, and then spreads. As the disease progresses, nerve cells are destroyed, and people with ALS become weaker. Pain is not usually a symptom of ALS, whether early or in later stages. </p> <p><strong>What causes ALS?</strong></p> <li><strong>Heredity<br> </strong>Of people with ALS, 5%-10% inherited it. The children of people with inherited, or familial, ALS have a 50-50 chance of developing the disease. </li> <li><strong>Age </strong><br> Risk increases with age, but ALS occurs most common between the ages of 40 and the mid-60s. </li> <li><strong>Gender </strong><br> Slightly more men than women are diagnosed with ALS before age 65. The sex difference disappears after age 70. </li> <li><strong>Genetics </strong><br> Genetic variations might make people more susceptible to ALS, even in patients without the familial ALS. </li> </ul> <p>Environmental factors that might trigger ALS include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smoking </strong><br> Smoking is the only likely environmental risk factor.

These safety plugs stop young children from being able to stick their fingers or other items into the outlet, which could cause an electric shock. </li> <li><strong>Do not plug too many appliances into one outlet. </strong><br /> An outlet can become overloaded if too many items are trying to use power from it. You should only plug one large appliance, such as a refrigerator or dryer, into an outlet at a time. If you are worried that the outlet is becoming hot, schedule an appointment with a licensed electrician to review your home's electrical circuit. </li> <li><strong>Check electrical cords for damage. </strong><br /> Damaged cords can cause electrical shock and fires. Check your cords regularly for signs of damage. If you notice that an electrical cord is fraying or cracking, replace it right away. </li> <li><strong>Keep electrical appliances away from water. </strong><br /> Water and electricity do not mix. If an electrical appliance gets wet, it can cause an electrical shock. Make sure your appliances are dry and kept away from water sources. This is especially important in places like the kitchen or bathroom, where water is frequently used. </li> </ul> <p>Following these tips will lower the risk of injury from electrical accidents. </p> <p>If you are concerned about any outlets or appliances in your home, talk to a licensed electrician.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonElectrical Safety 020821Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Stephanie ZiebarthBalancing the fun with balancing fun and safety for their children. Trampolines are a perfect example of this dilemma. When it comes to trampoline use, are we overreacting or is there significant risk of injury? </p> <p>Since 1977, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has been making safety recommendations for trampolines. We know from current evidence that trampolines are associated with a variety of injuries in children. Unfortunately, the risk is great enough that the AAP routinely discourages playing on trampolines. </p> <p>Trampoline injuries can range from minor, such as sprains or bruises, to more severe, including broken bones, concussions, and even permanent injuries from head, neck or spinal trauma. In 2009, there were almost 98,000 trampoline-related injuries, resulting in 3,100 kids in the hospital. </p> <p><strong>The dangers</strong></p> <p>So what are the dangers and types of injuries that come from playing on trampolines? </p> <ul> <li>Multiple people jumping at the same time accounts for approximately 75% of injuries. </li> <li>Children age five or younger have up to 14 times the chance of getting hurt, and tend to have more broken bones and dislocations. </li> <li>Falls account for about one-third of injuries. Arms are most commonly injured after a fall, and about 60% of these are fractures. </li> <li>Head and neck injuries account for up to 17% of injuries. The most severe are caused by doing a somersault or the child falling from the trampoline and landing on their head or neck. </li> </ul> <p>Manufacturers have been making greater efforts to improve trampoline construction and safety, including adding netting and padding around trampolines. Surprisingly, current evidence doesn't show that having more trampolines with enclosures has led to a significant decrease in injuries, either. The trampoline mat itself is still unfortunately the culprit for a variety of injuries. </p> <p><strong>The balance</strong></p> <p>Jumping on a trampoline is still a lot of fun, and so it's up to every parent to decide what amount of risk they're able to tolerate when balancing between fun and safety. The good news is that risk of injury can be reduced by following a few trampoline safety rules: </p> <ul> <li>Only one somersaults allowed</li> <li>Adult supervision at all times</li> <li>Children six aren't allowed to jump on the trampoline</li> <li>Adequate protective padding and a netted enclosure</li> <li>Set up on level ground away from trees, patios, yard furniture, play equipment, etc. </li> </ul> <p>Also, be sure to check your homeowner's policy to see if it requires additional coverage for trampoline-related injuries if you have one on your property. </p> <p>For more information, see the American is a general pediatrician with Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM) and practices in the Baldwin Clinic.

The fact is that most of us get more calcium than we need.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHealthy Eating Kids Myth 1Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Craig Sawchuk, a good night's sleep, you're not alone. Difficulty falling asleep, fragmented sleep, early awakening and nonrestorative sleep are common problems. As many as 30%-40% of adults experience sleep issues. </p> <p>Sometimes your sleep cycle may get off track, whether it's due to stress or a change in sleep habits, or you're going through a medical issue. Thankfully, it usually rebounds on its own or after you make some minor adjustments in your habits, or the stress or medical issues are resolved. </p> <p>However, for some, sleep problems can persist, leading to problems associated with insomnia. Approximately 10%-30% of people meet the criteria for insomnia, which usually is defined as disruptions in falling asleep, staying asleep or waking early for at least three nights a week over a three-month period. Unaddressed sleep problems can lead to difficulties functioning in almost every aspect of life and can have detrimental effects on your health. Sleep problems also tend to occur along with depression and anxiety disorders. These conditions can cause sleep problems or make them more difficult to manage. </p> <p>When your sleep isn't restorative, you tend to change your habits to make up for this lack of restful sleep, such as: </p> <ul> <li>Increasing caffeine use during the day. </li> <li>Taking more frequent or longer naps. </li> <li>Going to bed earlier or trying to sleep in longer. </li> <li>Using electronics, such as TV, tablets or smartphones, during the night as distractions. </li> </ul> <p>While these habit changes make sense, they quickly become part of the insomnia problem. Tossing and turning result in more time in bed without sleeping. Worry and frustration start to build about not being able to sleep. Unfortunately, the brain begins to associate the bed and nighttime with sleeplessness. </p> <p>Cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, also known as CBT-I, is a highly effective treatment that can lead to long-lasting beneficial improvements. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and American College of Physicians recently recommended this therapy as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. It's a straightforward approach that can be delivered in various ways: self-help, internet, apps, individual or group therapy. </p> <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia doesn't necessarily focus on how insomnia started. Rather, it focuses on how sleep problems are maintained. It helps you learn skills and change habits to reassociate the bed with nighttime and sleep, with the goal of reducing the amount of wakeful time during the night. </p> <p>Among the elements of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia are: </p> <p><strong>Sleep hygiene</strong></p> <p>Sleep hygiene involves changing your sleep habits and sleep environment to maximize the likelihood that your body is ready for sleep, such as: </p> <ul> <li>Making the bedroom dark, quiet and cool. </li> <li>Reducing daily caffeine use. </li> <li>Removing all electronics from the bedroom. </li> <li>Reducing or eliminating daytime naps and limiting sleep to nighttime. </li> <li>Establishing a routine time for going to bed and waking up. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Stimulus control</strong></p> <p>When sleep hygiene isn't enough, stimulus control can effectively help people reassociate the bed with nighttime and sleep using strategies such as: </p> <ul> <li>Using the bedroom only for sleeping and sexual activity \u2014 no reading, watching TV, using electronics or even spending time in your bedroom during the day. </li> <li>Going to bed only when sleepy rather than just feeling tired. When you're sleepy, your head tends to bob and your eyes are heavy. These signs tell you your body is ready to call it a night. </li> <li>Getting out of bed if you're lying awake for longer than 15-20 minutes. Go to another room, such as the living room, keep the lights low and only take part in quiet activities, such as listening to light music, practicing relaxation or reading something boring. Return to bed only when you're sleepy. </li> </ul> <p>Keep a regular wake-up routine and get up at the same time each morning, even on weekends, holidays and days off. </p> <p><strong>Sleep restriction</strong></p> <p>Sleep restriction reduces the amount of wakeful time in bed and promotes a stronger association between the bed, nighttime and sleep by: </p> <ul> <li>Tracking the amount of time you spend in bed and the amount of time you spend asleep. For example, you may go to bed at 10 p.m., toss and turn from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. and get up at 6 a.m. for a total of eight hours in bed. But you only had six hours of sleep. </li> <li>Moving your bedtime later and limiting the time in bed to the actual time spent sleeping. For example, you go to bed at midnight and wake up at 6 a.m., giving you six hours of sleep. </li> </ul> <p>Wake up at the same time each day, while maintaining good sleep hygiene and continuing to practice getting out of bed when you're not sleeping. </p> <p><strong>Challenging negative thoughts</strong></p> <p>Lying awake in bed with a \"busy brain\" can be frustrating. Schedule thinking time so that it is less likely to come up while you are in bed. </p> <p>This can be achieved by: </p> <ul> <li>Taking 10 minutes each night to write down your thoughts, worries or ideas that often come up while you are lying in bed. </li> <li>Give yourself at least two hours before your scheduled bedtime to give your brain time to settle down after this activity. </li> <li>The next morning, review the list within one hour of waking up. The act of reviewing the list each morning serves to build trust with your brain that you are not forgetting about what is on the list. </li> <li>This exercise allows your brain to unhook from your thoughts while you are in bed and pick them up again in the morning. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Relaxation training or stress management</strong></p> <p>A you start to sleep more solidly through the night, you can gradually start going to bed earlier. It may take some practice until you find the optimal sleep schedule. </p> <p>Other cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia skills include: </p> <ul> <li>Learning ways to challenge nighttime negative thoughts and worries, such as \"I must get eight hours of sleep in order to function.\"</li> <li>Practicing relaxation skills, such as deep breathing, guided imagery, and passive or progressive muscle relaxation. </li> <li>Learning stress management techniques, including time management and problem-solving, to reduce stress during the day. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Resources to help improve your sleep</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia</strong> <br> Individual and group therapy is available through Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson. Ask your care team about your options. </li> <li><strong>\"Overcoming <br> This self-help workbook by Jack Edinger and Collen Carney is a helpful resource for implementing cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia independently. developed by the Veterans Administration to help users learn and apply cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia skills. </li> and resources to improve sleep. </li> </ul> <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia takes time and patience to be effective. The good thing is that nighttime always comes, so there is always an opportunity to practice, implement and refine these skills. </p> <p><em>Olivia Bogucki, Ph.D., is a clinical health psychology fellow in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral Health. </em></p> <p><em>John Mack, L.I.C.S.W., M.S.W., is a licensed clinical social worker in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral target=\"_blank\">Craig Sawchuk, Ph.D., L.P.</a>, is clinical psychologist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Integrated Behavioral Health.

The cause and is one of the most common anxiety disorders. An estimated 12 percent of the population experiences it at some point in their lifetime. A person who has social anxiety feels significant fear or anxiety in everyday social situations like:</p> <ul> <li>Meeting strangers</li> <li>Using a public restroom</li> <li>Doing something in front of other people like speaking, writing or eating</li> </ul> <p>Overall, people with social anxiety feel fearful about being judged critically and negatively evaluated by others. They often think that they will humiliate or embarrass themselves or that others will laugh at, make fun of, be offended by, or not like them. </p> <p>The fear of being negatively evaluated by others often leads people with social anxiety to avoid social situations or experience significant anxiety in them. Passive avoidance, such as avoiding eye contact or trying to look busy while in social situations, can also be common ways to try to cope with their anxiety. As you may expect, social anxiety makes it harder to engage in social situations and can cause problems at home, school, and work. </p> <p>Rates of depression and substance use tend to be higher in people with social anxiety relative to those with other anxiety-related disorders. Unfortunately, it often takes a long time for socially-anxious people to seek treatment. The <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://adaa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a> found that less than five percent of people seek treatment within a year of first experiencing social anxiety and 36 percent wait 10 years or longer. </p> <p><strong>What causes social anxiety disorder?</strong></p> <p>There are many factors that contribute to the development of social anxiety disorder. Negative social experiences, like being bullied or doing something embarrassing, can lead to social anxiety. You are also much more likely to develop social anxiety if you have a naturally shy personality style or have an immediate family member with similar struggles. </p> <p>Social anxiety tends to develop earlier in life. The majority of people who are diagnosed with social anxiety disorder begin to experience symptoms in childhood or adolescence, and many continue to experience significant difficulties from their anxiety well into adulthood.</p> <p><strong>What types of treatments are available for social anxiety disorder?</strong></p> <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has the strongest evidence for treating social anxiety disorder. CBT is a skill-building intervention that helps people learn how to identify and manage thoughts and behaviors that contribute to maintaining social anxiety. Common features of CBT for social anxiety include: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Challenging thoughts:</strong> It's good to keep in mind that the anticipation of bad things happening in social situations tends to be worse than the actual outcomes. Most people are quite forgiving and tend not to notice our mistakes and struggles. Socially-anxious individuals tend to be their own worst critic; they often perform better in social situations than they think. </li> <li><strong>Avoiding the avoidance:</strong> While avoidance makes sense when we feel uncomfortable, learning how to approach and tolerate social situations is extremely important. Gradual and repetitive exposures to progressively more challenging social situations often helps individuals feel more comfortable over time. </li> <li><strong>Practicing social skills:</strong> Learning how to do small talk, ask for help, and maintain eye contact takes practice. Setting small social goals every day, such as saying hello to three people you are less familiar with, can help build confidence in these situations. </li> </ul> <p>Joining social groups or participating in Toastmasters may help individuals gain comfort in social situations. Self-help books, such as <em>The Shyness and Social Anxiety Workbook</em>, can help introduce CBT skills and practical strategies that can be worked on over time. Some individuals may benefit from working with a CBT therapist to learn and strengthen skills to conquer their fears. </p> <p>For more information on social <li><a rel=\"noopener clinical health psychology fellow in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson. </em></p> <p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sawchuk-craig-n-ph-d-l-p/bio-20085911\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Craig Sawchuk</a> is clinical psychologist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson and co-chairs the Division of alt=\"AloneGroup_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />These tips can help you deal with stressors from social anxiety.

But almost from the time we're born, we put that protective shell through its paces. We fall while learning to walk, tumble from trees and off bicycles, collide with each other during games and sports, bonk our heads on low doorways, get in vehicle accidents, slip in the tub, trip on rugs. </p> <p>Brain injuries range in severity from a mild concussion to death, and fall under the umbrella of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's data showed that in 2013, TBI resulted in 2.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. The main causes for TBI were: </p> <ul> <li>Falls, primarily among children (age 0-14) and adults (age 65 and older)</li> <li>Being struck by against an object</li> <li>Motor vehicle accidents</li> <li>Self-harm</li> </ul> <p>While the skull protects the brain, it also floats in fluid, which helps absorb shocks. But any form of blow can rattle the brain inside the skull, causing bruising and even tears that lead to bleeding and swelling. Sometimes the TBI is so severe the individual loses consciousness and may die. </p> <p>Any part of the brain can be injured, and where that injury occurs can affect cognition, personality, motor control, coordination, ability to plan movements, sensation, critical thinking, decision making and inhibitions. Injuries toward the front of the brain can affect critical thinking, toward the back, vision may be impaired. </p> <p>TBIs of all kinds should be taken seriously, especially if symptoms progress from mild to moderate to severe. If you or a loved one is having trouble with memory or orientation with dates and locations, seek urgent care. There also can be delayed complications, so be sure that you're not alone after suffering an injury or that someone checks on you regularly. </p> <p>Brain injury can happen throughout our lives, but so does prevention: </p> <ul> <li>Use car seats for infants should fasten seat belts</li> <li>Install \"baby gates\" at the top of stairs and guards on windows</li> <li>Wear well-fitting helmets for sports \u2014 from skateboarding to horseback riding</li> <li>Drink alcohol responsibly and abstain when driving motorized vehicles, including boats, ATVs and snowmobiles</li> <li>Remove clutter and loose rugs, install handrails on both sides of staircases, improve lighting</li> <li>Remain physically active</li> <li>Improve lower body strength, balance</li> </ul> <p>No matter our age, all it takes is one TBI to affect our thinking and functioning.

Knowing our intrinsic worth, we're able to be present with ourselves and our partners \u2014 whatever the circumstances. Here's how Jennifer Welwood, poet and therapist, describes this: </p> <p><em>Willing to experience aloneness, I discover connection everywhere<br> Turning to face my fear, I meet the warrior who lives within<br> Surrendering to my emptiness, I find fullness<br> Each condition I flee from pursues me, each condition I welcome, transforms me.</em></p> <p>Moving from our conditioned ways of relating to more authentic ways of connecting can be refreshing, scary and life-giving all at the same time. Communication is often given as a problem in relationships; it also happens to be the solution. Relearning to communicate is at the heart of intimacy. Learning to be emotionally present to ourselves and to another can be amazing. Why not give it a try?</p> <p>Our Integrated Behavioral Health colleague, Denise Morcomb, LICSW, says \"We should expect to have to learn how to communicate better as we grow in our relationships, otherwise we're destined to continue communicating like we're 18 years old.\"</p> <p><strong>Moving beyond 18</strong></p> <p>Skills like problem-solving, negotiation and conflict resolution can be more challenging when we're with someone we think we \"know\". Often over time, we don't practice being vulnerable to those closest to us because things become comfortable, routine and easy. Sometimes it's essential to pause and discover what and who we don't know, which may prompt us to notice how <em>we've</em> changed. We can always be in the midst of discovery. </p> <p>Learning to speak one's truth without blame or judgment is at the heart of vulnerability. Vulnerability in a relationship can draw you closer, but it takes practice and time. </p> <p>Exploring new ways to connect may help you move inward, outward and forward to cultivate vitality in your relationship. Consider trying some of these ideas. </p> <p><strong>Cultivate</strong></p> <p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">C</span></strong>ommunicate.

Try to really know what makes that person feel loved. First you need to understand how they experience love so you can meet their needs and not your own.

Love languages may be expressed through: </p> <ul> <li><em>Words of affirmation.</em> Tell them what you appreciate about them. </li> <li><em>Acts of service (actions speak louder than words).</em> \"I called the vet today\", \"I cleaned out the dishwasher.\"</li> <li><em>Gifts.</em> Better yet, don't just \"do\" for the other \u2014 put a note in his lunch tote or a thoughtful trinket by her plate. </li> <li><em>Quality time.</em> Actually listen, respond and pay attention. </li> <li><em>Physical touch.</em> Sit close <p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">L</span></strong>isten attentively.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonFirst Pap Test 2020Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Brandon Verdoorn, MD, are a natural part of aging; everyone will likely experience some form of change in cognition as they get older. Peak cognitive performance may occur from late teens for processing speed to 40s and 50s for measures of emotional intelligence. Once past these peaks, it is common to notice some cognitive changes, which typically fit into one of three categories: changes seen with normal aging may be a nuisance, but they are generally minor, do not disrupt one's daily activities, and cannot be detected on formal cognitive tests. Common examples include forgetting names, telling stories repeatedly, relying more on written lists rather than memory, or forgetting tasks. </p> <p>On the other end of the spectrum, dementia is a progressive decline in cognition that is more severe and leads to impairment in daily activities such as the ability to drive, manage finances, or cook a meal, and in more advanced cases even dressing, bathing, or toileting. </p> <p>MCI lies between normal age-related cognitive changes and dementia. MCI is a decline in cognition more significant than that expected with normal aging but not yet severe enough to affect one's daily activities. It is significant enough to be detected on formal cognitive tests. MCI is common and affects 10 to 20 percent of adults age 65 and older. Risk increases with age, and men appear to be at higher risk than women. Anywhere from 5 to 20 percent of people with MCI progress to dementia annually, though not everyone with MCI eventually develops dementia. </p> <p>When you notice cognitive changes in yourself or a loved one, it is important to notify your health care team. If you are diagnosed with MCI, your provider will help determine the underlying cause. </p> <p>While MCI commonly represents a precursor to dementia \u2014 most commonly Alzheimer's dementia \u2014 it may have other causes like depression or medication side effects. There are no drugs to treat MCI directly, but, depending on the cause, treatment of an underlying condition may help (for instance, if depression is causing MCI, treatment with an anti-depressant may help). Aerobic exercise, mental activity, social engagement, and management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) all may help reduce risk of further cognitive decline. </p> <p>With early detection, your health care team can help you manage MCI and optimize your function and quality of life. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/brandon-verdoorn-md/\">Dr. Brandon Verdoorn</a> is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and a consultant in the Division of Community Internal Medicine, where he practices mainly in nursing homes and other similar venues.

Here are five tips to make that happen:</p> <p><strong>Make them fun.</strong></p> cucumbers and apples, pears and melons with an inexpensive \"waffle\" cutter to give them a fun, wavy edge. </li> <li>Cut yellow, orange or red sweet peppers into rings instead of slices. </li> <li>Scoop melons into balls and mix and match honeydew, watermelon and cantaloupe. </li> <li>Spend a few bucks on a spiralizer, which shaves apples, pears, cucumbers, zucchini, squash and more into long \"noodles\" that can be steamed and topped with pasta sauce. For fruit spirals, drizzle them with nonfat yogurt thinned with a little skim milk and a pinch of cinnamon. </li> <li>Keep dips like nonfat yogurt and salad dressings on hand for dipping and scooping with sliced fruit or veggies. </li> <ul> <li>Roast or boil cauliflower, mash with salt and pepper and serve instead of mashed potatoes. </li> <li>Cook a spaghetti squash, and when tender, lift out the long noodle-like strands and top just as you would pasta or rice. </li> <li>Switch it up and instead of white potatoes, opt for sweet potatoes: bake, roast, mash or serve them in.</strong></p> <li>Making lasagna? Between each pasta layer, spread a veggie layer of shredded carrots or zucchini, chopped yellow or green sweet peppers or torn spinach. </li> <li>Add chopped fresh or frozen green beans to a soup or stew. Stir canned, fresh or frozen corn kernels into chili. </li> <li>Saute chopped green peppers and onions and sliced mushrooms to boost pasta sauce. </li> <li>Dress up tacos is a fruit smoothie: Combine frozen fruit (berries, peaches, pineapple) and a cup of nonfat milk in a blender and puree until smooth.

The rule of thumb is that you have to try something 10 times before you develop a taste for it. So don't give up. Keep exposing your kids to a variety of fruits and vegetables; tastes and reasons for disliking foods may change over time. Plus, kids tend to eat a food if their friends are eating and enjoying it. </p> <p>But when they turn up their nose, don't let them get away with just saying, \"Eww, gross!\" Have them explain what it is they don't like: Is it the taste, smell, texture? If they say it's too tart or too squishy or too stinky, then you can work at improving those \"problems\" for next time. Add a spice like cinnamon to sweeten something tart, keep sauces chunkier, to improve the texture, roast broccoli instead of boiling or steaming it. </p> <p>Two great references for recipes, buying tips and nutrition are Fruits and Veggies \u2014 More Matters dietician at Mayo Clinic working in pediatric and adult nutrition, with a focus on preventive care, sports nutrition and weight management. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/food/ech_5veg_01_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=535B6A9524D2E28FF3DE5AFB743B8B2F\" alt=\"ECH_5Veg_01_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />You know your kids should eat more fruits and veggies.

Here are five tips to help make that happen. - Michaeleen Burroughs, RDN, LDNutrition Facts box, bottle, jar or bag of packaged food there's a super tool for helping you make healthy food choices. It's the Nutrition Facts label, and it's just <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/food-labeling-nutrition/changes-nutrition-facts-label\" target=\"_blank\">undergone a makeover</a>. new design and information reflects the most up-to-date scientific nutrition information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases. </p> <p>Food manufacturers have some time to transition to the new label, but the new one already is showing up on foods nationwide. So let's do a walk-through of the label to see what's new. </p> <h3><strong>Servings</strong></h3> <p><strong>Serving size</strong> is based on the amount of food that typically is eaten at one time and is not a recommendation of how much to eat. The nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts label is usually based on one serving of the food; however, some containers may also have per-package information. When comparing calories and nutrients in different foods, check the serving size in order to make an accurate comparison.</p> <p><strong>Servings per container</strong> shows the total number of servings in the entire food package or container. </p> <p><strong>What's new:</strong> Servings per container and serving size are now in larger and/or bolder type. Serving sizes have been updated to reflect what people eat and drink today. There also are new requirements for certain sized packages, such as those that are between one and two servings or are larger than a single serving but could be consumed in one or more sittings. </p> <h3>Calories</h3> <p><strong>Calories</strong> refers to the total number of calories or \"energy\" supplied from all sources (fat, carbohydrate, protein and alcohol) in one serving of the food. As a general guide, 100 calories per serving of an individual food is considered a moderate amount, and 400 calories or more per serving is considered high in calories. For help in determining what your daily calorie needs are, check out the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" rel=\"noopener it's easier to find. </p> <h3>% Daily Values</h3> <p>% Daily Value (%DV) shows how much a nutrient in a serving of the food contributes to a total daily diet. Use the %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in an individual nutrient to compare food products. As always, when making comparisons, check to make sure the serving size is the same. </p> <p>As a general guide, 5% DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high. </p> <p><strong>What's new:</strong> The Daily Values for nutrients have been updated based on new scientific evidence. They are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day (for adults and children age four and older) and are used to calculate the % Daily Value.</p> <h3>Nutrients</h3> <p>The list of nutrients required on the label has been updated to reflect how they impact your diet. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Added sugars</strong> is now required. Added sugars includes sugars that are either added during the processing of foods or are packaged as such (think a bag of table sugar). They also include sugars from syrups and honey and concentrated fruit or vegetable juices. Aim for less than 10% of your total daily calories from added sugars.</li> <li><strong>Vitamin D and potassium</strong> are required because many Americans don't get the recommended amounts. Vitamins A and C are no longer required, since deficiencies of these vitamins are rare today. Manufacturers may voluntarily include them. </li> </ul> <p>Use the label to choose products that are lower in nutrients you want to get less of and higher in those you want more of. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Nutrients to get less of: Saturated fat, sodium, added sugars and trans fat.</strong> Most Americans exceed the recommended limits for these nutrients, and diets higher in them are associated with an increased risk of developing some health conditions, such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Compare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV of these nutrients each day. Trans fat has no %DV. Use the number of grams to make comparisons and strive to keep your intake of trans fat as low as possible. </li> <li><strong>Nutrients to get more of: Dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, iron and potassium.</strong> Many Americans don't get the recommended amount, and diets higher in these nutrients can reduce the risk of developing some health conditions, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and anemia. Compare and choose foods to get 100% DV of these nutrients on most days. </li> </ul> <h3>Check out the Ingredient List</h3> <p>Although the ingredient list is not part of the Nutrition Facts label, it's also a helpful tool, showing each ingredient by its common or usual name. Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, so the ingredient that weighs the most is listed first; the one that weighs the least is listed last. </p> <p>The Nutrition Facts label provides a wealth of information in one handy location By using that information, it's not hard to make better choices about the foods you eat. </p> <p><em>Michaeleen Burroughs has worked at Employee and Community Health (ECH) in Family Medicine for 20 years.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonNutrition Facts LabelPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - tough to roust out of bed in the a.m.? Does that same teen stay up long past their \"bedtime\"? While it can be aggravating for parents, your teen isn't lazy or focusing on their devices late into the evening. Staying up later and sleeping in longer are baked in to your teen's development. In other words, when they hit the teenage years, their internal clocks reset, too. This change can last into early adulthood. </p> <p>It's not an easy transition to make. Kids have school activities and homework that run into the evenings, but then have to catch the bus or be at school hours before their bodies say, \"Wake up!\" Plus, our work and school worlds revolve around an eight-to-five schedule, making it harder for schools and parents to make adjustments to meet this new sleep reality. </p> <p>So what's going on? Our bodies produce a hormone called melatonin, which is responsible for helping us go to sleep. It helps set our internal circadian clock for sleep and wake periods. In teens, melatonin production starts later in the evening. So kids naturally stay up later and wake up later. Genetic factors can also play a role in this delayed sleep phase. </p> <p>Research shows that teens need a <em>minimum</em> of nine to 10 hours of sleep a night, but only about one-third of them are meeting that goal. Which builds up a sleep debt that's impossible to \"pay back\" by sleeping in on weekends. The result of this sleep debt can: </p> <ul> <li>Increase risk for obesity and cardiovascular issues</li> <li>Influence mental health, including anxiety and mood problems</li> <li>Affect academic performance and behavior</li> </ul> <p>For some children, it may worsen into a disorder, which can persist into late life if not treated. If your teen is having problems functioning during the day or using medications, alcohol or other drugs to help fall asleep or stay awake, schedule an appointment with their primary care provider. Treatment can include taking melatonin at night to go to sleep, using a light box in the morning to stimulate waking up and following a fixed sleep schedule every day of the week. </p> <p>Several school districts nationwide, at the urging of parents and health care professionals, have adopted new school start times at 8:30 or later for teens that reflect their changing sleep-wake phases. Accumulating research indicates this is working. Later school times allow teens to sleep in during the week, creating less of a difference between their weekday and weekend schedules, reducing sleepiness during the day and even decreasing the number of motor vehicle accidents involving teens.</p> <p>You can help your teen get the sleep they need and adjust to their new inner clock by encouraging them to: </p> <ul> <li>Prioritize sleep</li> <li>Maintain a regular they start their bedtime routine</li> <li>Develop a nice, wind-down routine for the day</li> <li>Be physically active, but not too close to bedtime</li> <li>Avoid exposure to bright light in the late evening</li> <li>Expose themselves to bright light first thing in the morning</li> </ul> <p>Creating good sleep habits will help them now and for the rest of their lives. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mansukhani-meghna-p-m-d/bio-20199994\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Meghna Mansukhani</a> is a consultant at Mayo Clinic's Center for Sleep Medicine and associate professor in the Mayo College of Medicine.

It's important to know what symptoms can be normal and what symptoms warrant further evaluation with your health care team. </p> <p>It's normal to have some vaginal discharge, called physiologic discharge. The average woman has 2 to 3 tablespoons of discharge per day. This discharge is often transparent to white, thick, odorless and without irritating symptoms. Hormonal changes, such as during ovulation, contraceptive use, or menopause, can alter this discharge and may increase or decrease the amount or consistency of the discharge. </p> <p>Abnormal discharge that may indicate an underlying medical condition can present with a change in color, odor or amount of discharge. Vulvar or vaginal skin changes including redness, itching, burning, pain, urinary symptoms, incontinence, ulcers, masses, or a bulge warrant further evaluation. Evaluation is also recommended if there is any abnormal menstrual bleeding, such as bleeding between periods, after intercourse or after menopause. </p> <p>In order to maintain vulvar and vaginal health it is recommended to wash the vulva with warm water only. You should wear underwear with a wide fit that are white and made with a cotton material. Underwear should be washed in very hot water and with half the amount of laundry soap compared to other loads. Avoid hand washing underwear and wearing thong-fitting underwear. It is recommended that you sleep without underwear or wear loose clothing to bed. </p> <p>Avoid common vulvar and vaginal irritants such as soaps, scented pads and tampons, spermicides, lubricants, sprays, dyes, fragrances, softeners, bleach, bubble bath, shampoo, hot tubs, chlorine, over-the-counter prescriptions, shaving, douching, oral sex, and over cleansing. </p> <p>Be sexually responsible \u2014 utilize condoms and be screened for sexually transmitted infections.

On one hand, you're seeing your child start to become an independent adult. On the other, you want to continue to set some limits around their behavior, choices and beliefs. And your teen wants you to control none of these. </p> <p>Teens are in a unique stage of development. They know they need you, but they don't want to need you. They crave independence. They crave peer interactions and approval. This can lead to frequent arguments as they assert their independence, and you assert your authority, since they do need help navigating peer relationships. </p> <p>Communication and mutual respect is the key. Although it feels contrary to how you may have been raised, it's important to earn your teenager's respect. We can respect our teens by explaining the rationale behind our decisions, giving opportunities for independence, staying calm, being present at their activities and asking their opinions. In turn, you can expect them to show respect in their interactions with you. </p> <p><strong>10 tips for parenting your teen:</strong> </p> <ol> <li> <strong>Take time to connect.</strong> This is unique to each teen, so connect with your teen over something they are interested in or you can do together. Some ideas are: sporting events, shopping, cooking, exercising or just talking. </li> <li> <strong>Provide clear expectations.</strong> Have rules about curfew, friends, social gatherings and cell phones. Then stick to them. </li> <li> <strong>Listen to their opinions.</strong> Sometimes even let them influence yours. </li> <li> <strong>Expect responsibility.</strong> Your teen should be responsible for their own chores; after all, you won't always be there to clean up after them. Begin early teaching them how to manage their money and save for their own wants and needs. </li> <li> <strong>Don't lecture.</strong> Brevity is a parenting skill. Get to the point. </li> <li> <strong>Take the blame.</strong> Allow your teen to use you as their \"out\" when peer pressure is weighing on them. Let them refer to you as the lame parents who won't allow them to go to that party. </li> <li> <strong>Expect them to believe \u2014 and act like \u2014 the world revolves around them.</strong> </li> <li> <strong>Discuss drugs, alcohol and sex.</strong> Don't wait until something has already happened; plan ahead. Don't make fun of them. Their self-esteem is fragile. Find ways to laugh together. </li> <li> <strong>Show your love for them.</strong> Tell them how much you love them or do something special for them \"just because\". Some day (no guarantees when) they will let you know how much they appreciated it. </li> </ol> <p>Want to learn more on raising teenagers?

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCOVID SchoolPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson the second most common cancer of women in the United States, and mammograms are the screening tools used to detect it. Here are six things you should know about mammograms: </p> <p> <strong>Should I have a screening mammogram?</strong></p> <p> Mammograms have been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer by about 30%. In general, Mayo Clinic recommends annual mammograms for women at average risk of breast cancer beginning at age 40. However, the benefit of a screening mammogram is smaller for women in their 40s than for women 50 and older, primarily because breast cancer is less common at this age. The risk of false-positive findings is also higher, which may lead to further imaging and possible biopsy. </p> <p> For this reason, you and your health care team may decide that an every-other-year mammogram may be more appropriate for you during the ages of 40-45 or 40-50. If you have a family history of breast cancer, the age to begin mammograms and intervals also may vary, which you should discuss with your health care provider. </p> <p> <strong>Why can't I wear deodorant on the day of my mammogram?</strong></p> <p> Avoid using deodorants, antiperspirants, powders, lotions, creams or perfumes under your arms or on your breasts. Metallic particles in powders and deodorants could be visible on your mammogram and lead to confusion when your images are interpreted. </p> <p> <strong>When and how will I find out the results from my recent screening mammogram?</strong></p> <p> Most of the time, women getting a routine mammogram will receive a letter mailed to their home within seven to 10 days reporting normal results. At Mayo Clinic, Patient Online Service results are available within three to five days of the mammogram. </p> <p> If something suspicious is found, your care team or the radiology team will contact you within the week, and you may be asked to return for additional images or tests. This discussion can be scary, but a suspicious finding does not mean you have cancer. </p> <p> More than likely, you will have a diagnostic mammogram, which will take more-detailed pictures of the area of concern. You also may have an ultrasound of your breasts. Based on the results of the diagnostic imaging, the radiologist usually is able to resolve questions or decide if a biopsy or short-term follow-up is needed, which may be a repeat mammogram in six months. If a biopsy is recommended, this can be scary but does not mean you have cancer. </p> <p> <strong>Recently, I found a lump when examining my breasts. My mammogram is due in the next few months. Should I wait for the scheduled mammogram to have the lump evaluated?</strong></p> <p>Not necessarily. Your annual screening mammogram is recommended for an overall view of the breast. If a specific area of concern is identified, a diagnostic mammogram may be better suited to further evaluate it. Discuss breast changes with your health care provider, especially if they persist throughout your menstrual cycle if you are premenopausal. </p> <p> <strong>At my last mammogram, the report suggested my breasts were dense. What does this mean and should I be concerned?</strong></p> <p> Dense breast tissue is common, and refers to how the breast looks on the mammogram, not how it feels. Women with dense breasts have less fatty tissue and more non-fatty tissue. Areas of dense breast tissue can mask cancer on a mammogram, making it more difficult to detect. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to women with less-dense breasts. </p> <p> Routine mammograms remain very important and should be continued for women with dense breasts according to their screening schedule. Even with dense breast tissue, tumors have been seen on mammograms. </p> <p> Supplemental screening tests could be added to your next screening mammogram, if desired. These tests, such as Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), may find cancers not seen on mammograms. MBI also may detect cancers at an earlier stage when treatment options tend to be less invasive. </p> <p> There is no current consensus on whether more testing is necessary for women with dense breasts. Supplemental screening may lead to additional testing, breast biopsy or false positives. Also, it is important to check with your insurance company about coverage if you are interested in these tests. </p> <p> For more information in MBI and breast density, please review these videos from the Mayo Clinic Breast Clinic. If you have questions, discuss them with your health care painful. Are there things I can do to reduce the discomfort?</strong></p> <p>Compression is important for clear mammogram images, but may be uncomfortable. If you have not gone through menopause, it may help to schedule your mammogram seven to 14 days after the start of your period, when your breasts are less likely to be tender. Eliminating caffeine-containing products (chocolate, coffee, soda, tea) or excess salt around your mammogram may help, too. Taking a mild over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) or ibuprofen (Advil\u00ae, Motrin\u00ae) an hour before your mammogram is another option. </p> <p>It also is important to speak up and talk with your mammogram technician because they will be able to help position you and suggest breathing and distraction techniques to make your experience more tolerable. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jennifer-frank-cnp\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer M.

But what is the proactive health movement and how does eating well fit into this trend? </p> <p>Proactive health movement is the public's increased interest in making changes in lifestyle habits and choices to live well and prevent disease. Being proactive about your health can include changes in diet, exercise, sleep hygiene, dental health and muscle strength and flexibility. </p> <p>Choosing a healthy diet is one piece of proactive health. The public is being exposed to more channels via the internet and social media to learn about healthy foods and what that food can do for them. It is important to not get pulled into trendy or restrictive food habits, but rather consider food choices and habit changes that are backed by science. </p> <p>Here are some tips for focusing on a proactive diet:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eating a balanced diet.</strong><br> The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming food from multiple food groups, including whole grains, lean protein, fiber-rich whole fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy. Using the plate method, which divides up the plate to ensure appropriate portion sizes of different foods, can be a strategy to eat a balanced diet. </li> <li><strong>Taking dietary supplements. </strong><br> Individual nutrient needs vary depending on age and health conditions. Sometimes supplements are needed to fill a gap when someone cannot meet the need through diet. Discuss supplements with your health care team. </li> <li><strong>Eating food with added functional benefits.</strong> <br> While the government has no legal definition for functional food, referring to the Nutrition Facts label and ingredients list can help determine if a food is a healthy choice. Functional foods include minimally processed, whole foods. A few examples include antioxidant-rich berries; fatty fish like salmon that are rich in omega-3; or unsalted, heart-healthy nuts. </li> <li><strong>Supplementing diet with healthier foods. </strong><br> A good first step is as easy as increasing your fruit and vegetable intake. You can start small. Adding just one serving \u2014 about one cup per day \u2014 is a great start. </li> <li><strong>Eating superfoods. </strong><br> A superfood is nutrient-dense, meaning they contain high volumes of protein, vitamins, minerals, or fiber in a portion. Examples include broccoli, which is rich in fiber and antioxidants, and low in calorie; oranges, which are high in fiber, vitamin C and potassium; and blueberries, which provide antioxidants and phytochemicals. </li> </ul> <p>There are many pieces of the puzzle of proactive health to pursue. Healthy food choices for proactive health don't need to be flashy, restrictive or difficult to follow. When it comes to diet, choose a piece to work on \u2014 like more fruits and veggies \u2014 and see how it fits into your life. </p> <p><em>Rachel Braun is a dietetic intern at Mayo Minnesota. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/food/superfoods.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=33CA53C9318AFEA27DF2BF1FBFE9FD8C\" alt=\"Superfoods\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />These tips can help you focus on a proactive diet. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonProactive HealthPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Denise Dupras, been numerous claims on social media that vitamin supplements are effective for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. But what is the actual evidence that they can help you if you become sick? And what are the risks of using vitamins as a treatment?</p> <p><strong>Vitamin C</strong></p> <p><strong><em>What's being reported:</em></strong><em> A very high dosage of vitamin C given intravenously has been reported, by researchers in Italy and China, to be helpful in patients hospitalized with COVID-related pneumonia.</em></p> <p>The results of these studies have not been formally published for the medical industry's reference, and without published medical trials, we don't know if the results are truly effective or what side effects may be involved. The high doses of vitamin C reported in these stories cannot be met by taking over-the-counter vitamin pills, and if you were to try, you could give yourself kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and interfere with other medications. </p> <p>More formal studies of whether vitamin C is helpful in patients with COVID-19 are currently being conducted, and the safest course of action is to check with your primary care provider before adding a vitamin supplement to your diet. </p> <p><strong>Vitamin D</strong></p> <p><strong><em>What's being reported:</em></strong><em> There are studies looking at whether low vitamin D levels are related to outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infections. There are no studies looking at actual treatment of COVID-19 with vitamin D.</em></p> <p>High-dose vitamin D has potential serious side effects, and, again, you should check with your primary care provider before adding a supplement to your diet. If he or she is concerned about your vitamin D status, a blood test can be used to check for a deficiency. They can also advise you on how much vitamin D you should be getting every day and whether you should consider taking supplements to boost your daily intake. </p> <p><strong>Zinc</strong></p> <p><em><strong>What's being reported:</strong> One study looked at the addition of zinc to azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of hospitalized patients. </em></p> <p>The results of these studies have not been published for the medical community's review, and the doses used in the study were very high and exceeded those considered generally safe. Zinc should only be used under a doctor's supervision to ensure proper dosages. </p> <p><strong>Other substances</strong></p> <p>Other substances have been suggested \u2014 including elderberry, thiamine and melatonin \u2014 and remain untested, have potential harms, or have shown no benefit and should not be used. </p> <p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p> <p>The bottom line is that there is no scientific data supporting the use of vitamins C, D, zinc or other vitamin supplements to prevent or treat COVID. Talk to your primary care provider for advice on vitamins and whether you should consider taking supplements to boost your daily intake. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Dr. Denise Dupras</a> is a general internist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM).

It also requires a balance between the likely benefits and potential harms of treatment and lowering blood glucose (blood sugar). </p> <p>Diabetes is recognized by elevated blood glucose levels caused either by your body's lack of insulin production (type 1) or it's progressive resistance to insulin (type 2). Uncontrolled diabetes and high blood glucose levels affect almost every part of your body. Diabetes: </p> <ul> <li>Is the most common cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputations</li> <li>Significantly increases the risk of heart disease and strokes</li> <li>Is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.</li> <li>Affects the nerves causing symptoms such as painful neuropathy, unstable blood pressure and pulse, gastroparesis, diarrhea and constipation</li> <li>Affects your teeth and gums, mood immune system</li> </ul> <p><strong>Testing for blood sugar levels</strong></p> <p>Controlling blood sugar levels is key to reducing the risk of these complications. There are two ways to measure for diabetes control: </p> <ul> <li>Fasting blood glucose levels, measured either using a finger stick and glucose monitor or a laboratory blood test. Both tests tell us the current blood sugar level. <ul> <li>Normal, measures the percentage of hemoglobin (red blood cells) with glucose attached to them. Because these levels have a lifespan of about 120 days, HbA1c reflects the average glucose level during the past 120 days. Normal HbA1c levels may vary for different ethnic populations, children and people with certain health conditions, but general results are: <ul> <li>No pre-diabetes sugar levels \u2014 above 180 mg/dL \u2014 can cause immediate symptoms such as confusion, frequent urination and thirst, blurry vision and weakness. HbA1c of 8% corresponds approximately to a fasting blood sugar of 183 mg/dL. </p> <p><strong>Lowering HbA1c</strong></p> <p>Multiple studies have looked at the link between lowering HbA1c and reducing risk of microvascular (eye, kidney and nerve) and cardiovascular (heart disease and stroke) complications. Lowering HbA1c has the greatest effect on microvascular complications and plays a bigger role in type 1 than type 2 diabetes. This is likely because people with type 2 often have other chronic diseases with overlapping health complications, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and excess weight. </p> <p>HbA1c doesn't need to be reduced all the way down to normal. The most benefit comes from lowering HbA1c to less than 8%, with very little added benefit from decreasing HbA1c to 7% or lower. Also, it takes a long time to see the benefits of lower HbA1c. Most studies required at least 10 years to see any benefit for microvascular complications and even longer for reducing cardiovascular problems. </p> <p><strong>Lower blood sugar</strong></p> <p>Trying to lower blood sugar too much, particularly when using several medications or medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride), can lead to levels that are too low. </p> <p>This condition is called hypoglycemia, which can cause confusion, irritability, shakiness and heart rhythm problems. If not recognized and treated, it can progress to loss of consciousness, seizure, coma or even death. Long term, it increases the risk of heart disease, dementia and death. </p> <p>Blood sugar levels under 70 mg/dL can be harmful and should be treated promptly, including assessing why it happened and identifying steps to prevent it from happening again. </p> <p>People at risk for hypoglycemia should be cautious and strive for slightly higher blood glucose and HbA1c targets. This includes those who have a history of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness (few or no symptoms until it is severe) or multiple chronic conditions, kidney or heart disease, dementia or cognitive impairment. </p> <p>Because it takes many years to see the benefits of lower HbA1c, people with limited life expectancy (less than five to 10 years) don't need to lower their blood glucose to very low levels. </p> <p>For most people with diabetes, an HbA1c less than 7% is preferred, but only if this can be achieved safely, without significant hypoglycemia, medication side effects or making treatment too difficult for patients. </p> <ul> <li>Those who are young, healthy and have no major health concerns may consider a target of less than 6.5% for HbA1c. </li> <li>Those who are at risk for hypoglycemia, have limited life expectancy or can't tolerate intensive treatment, may benefit from higher targets, such as 8%-9%. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Finding the right balance</strong></p> <p>Balance changes over time, so something that was right for you before may not be right for you now. That's why it's very important to talk with your health care team about your goals, preferences and concerns, and work together to identify the diabetes treatment plan and regimen that are right for you. </p> <p><em>Dr. Rozalina McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Primary Care Internal Medicine (PCIM) in Rochester.

These eight techniques can help you bring it under control:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Prioritize.</strong> Make a \"to-do\" list of all your assignments and tasks, then order them by importance or deadline. Break down bigger things into smaller and more manageable pieces. Make sure you're setting yourself up for success so that you feel the positive, \"I did it!\", which can serve as a springboard for starting the next task. </li> <li><strong>Manage your time.</strong> Find a planner or search online for a schedule template to lay out your projects and commitments. It can help to see all that's on your plate before jumping in. </li> <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> Exercise releases the \"feel-good\" endorphin brain chemicals that help our mood, giving us a natural \"high\". Exercise can take the form of workouts or classes or activities such as gardening, cleaning and walking to the bus or school. Mayo Clinic recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity every day. </li> <li><strong>Follow a sleep schedule.</strong> Most teens need eight to 10 hours of uninterrupted sleep; adults typically need seven to nine hours. Create and stick with a sleep schedule to ensure your body is consistently getting the time it needs to recharge, heal and process emotional experiences. On weekends, try not to stray too far from this schedule. Also, have a bedtime routine you regularly follow to cue your brain to prepare for sleep. </li> <li><strong>Eat well.</strong> Make sure you eat three balanced meals that cover three of the five food groups, have healthy snacks, and hydrate with water throughout the day. </li> <li><strong>Be mindful.</strong> Make mindfulness a part of your lifestyle to bring nonjudgmental awareness into your daily routines. It means being present in the moment with your environment, those around you, and with yourself (thoughts, feelings, intentions, values, etc.). Notice things with curiosity and openness, rather than with expectations, comparisons and criticism. Research shows there is a direct link between mind-wandering and unhappiness; check out this <a more information. </li> <li><strong>Enjoy and relax.</strong> Regularly do things that bring you joy. Schedule them in so it's sure to happen. Practice breathing from your diaphragm and learn to regulate your body on your own. The more we practice what seems to be a basic task like breathing, the more control we have over it. Having practiced it, we'll be able to draw on it to calm down during a stressful time. </li> <li><strong>Seek professional support.</strong> Sometimes these coping strategies aren't enough, and it may be helpful to seek professional support from a mental health provider who can teach and coach you on a variety of coping strategies. Helpful therapies for stress include cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment a clinical pediatric social worker in Employee and Community Health (ECH) at the Baldwin Building and Mayo Family Clinic Northwest.

My child you respond to your child's ear pain depends a lot on their age and ability to tell you what hurts. Your nine-year-old can say, \"My left ear hurts\", while your two-month-old may just be fussy or not able to sleep.</p> <p>For infants younger than two months old, it's uncommon for them to develop ear infections. After three or four months of age, infections become more common. Why? There are two key factors:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li>Infections usually affect the middle ear space, which is smaller at this age. The Eustachian tube, which helps drain the area, is flatter and not as effective draining away fluids.</li> <li>Children three and younger tend to get a lot of colds. Fluid builds up, becomes infected and causes pressure and pain.</li> </ul> <p>Infants and toddlers may show symptoms of ear pain that include fussiness, pulling on their ear, running a fever, or not sleeping or eating well. The only way to tell if they're suffering from an infection is to have their ears examined at a clinic.</p> <p>If your child is less than a year old, you should bring them in to be checked. If your child is diagnosed with an ear infection, there are several things your health care provider considers to determine if an antibiotic is necessary. If your child is six months or younger, an infection likely will be treated with an antibiotic, typically amoxicillin. After six months, getting an antibiotic will depend on how the ear looks, if both ears are infected or how high or how long your child's fever is.</p> <p>If your child is two or older and only one ear is infected, there's a 75-80% chance the infection will go away on its own. Just watch them and treat the pain. If two or three days go by and they are getting worse or not showing signs of improving, then an antibiotic may be helpful.</p> <p>Home remedies on the box.</li> <li>Propping your child up for better sleeping, since lying down can increase the pressure and pain in the ear.</li> <li>Applying a warm, moist compress, such as a washcloth, to the ear hasn't been proven to help but likely won't cause harm.</li> </ul> <p>Until they turn three, your child may have as many as three ear infections. But after age three, they become less common. However, if your child has recurring ear infections \u2014 up to three a season or four in a year \u2014 talk with your provider about whether ear tubes, which drain fluid from the middle ear, would be an option for your child.</p> <p>One way to reduce the chance of your child getting an ear infection is to:</p> <ul immunizations are up to date</li> </ul> <p>An infection in the middle ear isn't the only cause of ear aches. The pain may be the result of a jaw or tooth issue, teething, infected lymph node, sore throat, wax build up or swimmer's ear. Swimmer's ear is an infection of the outer ear canal often caused by water remaining in the ear after swimming or bathing. The ear canal becomes inflamed and red; gently pulling on the earlobe is painful. Swimmer's ear usually is treated with prescription ear drops.</p> <p>No matter the age of your child, ear pain is rarely an emergency. So rather than bundling them up and heading to the ER in the middle of the night, make them comfortable with home remedies and wait until morning.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jason-homme-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jason (Jay) Homme</a> is a physician in Employee and Community Health's Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.

That's why it's important to have a good discussion with your provider to go over the pros and cons of hormone therapy (HT) to your individual circumstance.</p> <p><strong>Why take hormones?</strong></p> <p>Women might be prescribed hormones to alleviate or improve uncomfortable symptoms, such as hot flashes, flushing, sweating and sleep disturbances, as well as vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse. Women often experience these when they reach the age of perimenopause (around the time of menopause) or early in menopause (stopped having periods).</p> <p>Hormone therapy \u2014 estrogen, progesterone or both \u2014 may be an option because your uncomfortable symptoms develop from low levels of these hormones. HT may be considered during perimenopause or menopause. It also may be prescribed if you have had a hysterectomy at a young age or experience ovarian insufficiency (your ovaries quit working) at a young age (under 45).</p> <p><strong>Talking with your provider, making informed decisions</strong></p> <p>When you talk over HT with your provider, go over with and family health history </li> <li>Personal cancer risks or history, as well as family history of cancer, specifically breast or ovarian cancer </li> <li>Personal and family history of cardiovascular (CV) disease, clotting disorders, and liver disease</li> <li>Risk factors for CV disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol problems and weight</li> </ul> <p>They also may want you to be current on preventive screening for breast, cervical and colon cancer and screenings for factors that increase CV risk. Your provider likely will recommend addressing any concerns, including stopping smoking and treating high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol problems to lower your overall CV risk.</p> <p>After gathering the information about your health, health history and risks, your provider will give recommendations about whether HT is appropriate for you \u2014 or information about other non-hormone options for treating bothersome symptoms.</p> <p>Part of your discussion will include the risks of HT, which include potentially stimulating an undetected hormone-sensitive cancer, and increasing your risk for blood clots or CV events, such as stroke or heart attack.</p> <p>And finally, your provider will go over the side effects of HT, including nausea, headaches, breast tenderness, vaginal spotting, bleeding or bloating.</p> <p><strong>Treating your symptoms</strong></p> <p>There's a timeframe when HT is safer \u2014 usually at the onset of menopause (average age is 51) and for the next 10 years after your periods have stopped. Your provider will prescribe the lowest dose possible for the shortest amount of time needed to treat or reduce your symptoms. Your treatment is customized for you, since symptoms vary for each woman. HT usually is delivered through a pill or a patch; your provider will help you choose the best option for treating your symptoms.</p> <p>You've probably heard or read about over-the-counter (OTC) herbal supplements that can relieve symptoms. Some of these are black cohosh, ginseng and ginkgo. These herbal remedies may or may not be helpful.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHormone Replacement TherapyPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Sara Sedivy, MA, LPHow can you help others - and yourself a simple word for that painful and complicated process when there is significant change or loss in our lives. </p> <p>One might surmise that since grief and loss are part of the human condition, we should naturally know how to help others who are grieving. The reality is that many people have difficulty knowing how to help a friend, family member or colleague who is suffering a loss. </p> <p>First, it's important to remember that grieving is natural and an individual experience; there's no right or wrong way to grieve. Here are some responses and attitudes that demonstrate what someone who is actively grieving may be feeling:</p> <ul> <li>I know it's difficult to see me hurting, but someone I love is gone and I am going to hurt for a while. </li> <li>Crying is a healthy reaction to grief, I need to feel my feelings as they come. </li> <li>Keep me connected to others \u2014 even if I don't respond, please send emails, call/text, invite me to lunch, send cards. It helps to know you care. </li> <li>Please don't try to compare my loss to yours. </li> <li>I am not going to \"find closure\" or \"get over it\" \u2014 but, in time, I will heal. </li> <li>Sadness and joy can coexist; when I laugh one day it doesn't mean that I won't cry the next. </li> <li>Grief can be a roller coaster ... some days I can conquer mountains and other days I can't get myself to shower. </li> <li>Please don't tell me to stay strong. To me that means, don't show emotion. </li> <li>Memories and stories are important to my healing. Please talk about my child, partner, sibling, grandchild or parents ... I will let you know if it's too much. </li> <li>Avoid platitudes such as \"he/she is in a better place now\". </li> <li>I may need more rest, be more needy, have less to give. Grief is draining and exhausting. </li> <li>Grief knows no timeline. It takes as long as it takes. </li> </ul> <p>When someone you care about is grieving, you may be afraid of saying the wrong thing or feel you are intruding on their privacy. Don't let your discomfort prevent you from reaching out. Here are some tips to help:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Understand the grieving process:</strong> There is no right or wrong way to grief; grief may involve extreme emotions and behavior; there is no timetable. </li> <li><strong>Know what to say:</strong> While you may worry about what to \"say\" \u2014 it's actually more important to \"listen\". </li> <li><strong>Offer practical assistance:</strong> Offer to shop for groceries or run errands; drop off a family meal; offer to assist with funeral arrangements, housework, child/pet care; or just be there to show your support. </li> <li><strong>Provide ongoing support:</strong> Grieving doesn't stop when the funeral is over. Continue your support over the long haul. </li> <li><strong>Watch for signs of depression:</strong> It's common to feel depressed, confused, and disconnected during grief, but if the symptoms don't fade over time (or they get worse), it may be a sign that this has evolved into a more serious problem. </li> </ul> <p>Remember, grief can occur following any change \u2014 such as the loss of a job or position change, life-transition periods (kids leaving for college, getting married), relationship ending, or social distancing.

Genes, which are the controllers of cell growth, can be damaged after birth or inherited with problems that prevent them from working correctly. These genes, which can be inherited from either parent, are called inherited cancers. But they cause only about 5%-20% of cancers. </p> <p>As a patient, you may wonder whether you should worry if a family member has cancer. An important clue to an inherited cancer is family history. </p> <p>Answering these questions and discussing them with your health care provider is important:</p> <ul> <li>Who has cancer? For example, consider siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. </li> <li>What kind of cancer did they have? </li> <li>How were they when they had cancer? </li> </ul> <p>Some groups of cancers seem to be inherited together and are understood, including the gene that is involved. Two of the most recognized genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2, which increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer in women. This genetic information led to Angelina Jolie to have surgery to remove both of her breasts. Less well-known is that this gene abnormality increases the risk of cancer in men, too. </p> <p>It is important to review your family history and talk to your primary care provider if you think you may be at risk for an inherited cancer. Your provider can help you decide if getting genetic testing is a good idea. </p> <p><strong>What if genetic testing is positive?</strong></p> <p>Not everyone with an abnormal gene gets cancer, but genetic testing may change how often your health care provider recommends that you get checked for cancer or if you need treatment to decrease your risk of getting cancer in the future. </p> <p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p> <p>Less than 1 in 5 cancers results from an inherited cancer condition, and the best way for you to determine if you might have increased risk related to your genes is to look at your family history. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internist in the Division of Community Internal Medicine.

This includes becoming more active and making healthier food choices. And you can do it! Family teamwork is the best path to success in developing healthy habits. </p> <p>A healthy lifestyle is important for people of all shapes and sizes. And it starts with parents. Children form their ideas about a healthy lifestyle by watching their parents' behavior rather than listening to \"advice\" from them or others. </p> <p>So how can your family work as a team to tackle obesity? Here are some tips to make this happen: </p> <p><strong>The same rules apply to everyone.</strong> That means adopting the same eating and exercise habits across your family. Allowing one child to eat whatever they want while putting restrictions on another might cause that child to feel bad or singled out. Healthy living is not about losing weight when it is needed, but also about adopting a routine with lifelong benefits. </p> <p><strong>If it's not healthy for everyone in the house, don't buy it.</strong> It's easier to say \"no\" once to juice, soda, unhealthy snacks and sugary cereals when you're at the grocery store than to say \"no\" all the time at home. Not buying - and removing - unhealthy foods from your home puts the responsibility on you to make good choices for your kids. Packing lunch for school or work can help everyone learn what makes up a healthy midday meal. Turn it into a family ritual after dinner. It's a natural time to talk about healthy food choices so kids adopt them when they're on their own. </p> <p><strong>Eat as a family.</strong> Eating together can be so beneficial, allowing families to bond and taking kids (and parents) away from the distractions of cell phones and tablets. Family meals don't always need to be dinner. Your together time could be breakfast before everyone rushes off for their day. Set aside at least one weekend meal to eat - and maybe even prepare - together. </p> <p><strong>Exercise together.</strong> Many families think they need to go to the gym to lose weight, but this doesn't have to be the case. Think about playing an active game such as kickball, tag or touch football; shooting baskets; going roller skating; entering a 5K walk and training together. Kids should have one hour of vigorous exercise (something that makes you sweat) a day. </p> <p>Sometimes this isn't feasible, and if you haven't been active, it may mean working your way up to that one-hour goal. Even small steps toward a more-active lifestyle, such as walking to school instead of taking transportation or riding your bike for a few minutes a day, gets you and your team on track to tackle obesity. </p> <p>Go Team Family!</p> <p><em>Rose Prissel, MS, RDN, LD, is a dietician at Mayo Clinic working in pediatric and adult nutrition, with a focus on preventive care, sports nutrition and weight management. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/people/ech_summerfun_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=0971895A3BE6917707B3244B1E8AA5F3\" alt=\"ECH_SummerFun_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />Family teamwork is the best path to success.

COVID-19 has disrupted all of that. Not only are the schools and centers where they receive services closed, but their home routines are topsy-turvy. While some children are going to adapt fairly easily, here are some ideas for helping kids with autism manage their new normal: </p> <ul> <li>Write out a schedule and go over it with your child. </li> <li>Keep wake-up and bedtime at the same time. Follow the routines for getting up and going to bed that you've already established. </li> <li>Serve meals at regular times. </li> <li>Set aside blocks for school. </li> <li>Be sure to include plenty of outdoor, active time. </li> <li>Create a social story about what their day is going to look like. Use pictures and simple language to help your child \"see\" their new routine. </li> <li>If your child receives services or therapy at a center, check if they'll be offering more useful tips, including: </p> <ul> <li>School with disrupted routines</li> <li>Continuing clinical school/program closures</li> <li>Flu teaching story</li> </ul> <p>These resources can apply to adults with autism, too, since their routines are being disrupted as well. </p> <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, at Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson we're continuing to see our current patients with autism via phone and videoconferencing.

The devilish duo to be aware of and avoid are wild parsnip and poison ivy (and its cousins, poison oak with its flat, umbrella-like blossom sprinkled with tiny yellow flowers has run rampant this season. All it takes is skin contact with its poisonous sap, a little sunlight and yeow! The chemical reaction, called phytophotodermatitis, is so corrosive that it can cause a rash and blistering as bad as second-degree burns. The blisters can take weeks to clear up and may leave scars and skin discoloration. </p> <p>A non-native plant, it's found along roadsides and fence rows, the edges of prairie areas, woodlands and trails, and in abandoned is to wear long sleeves, pants and gloves. If you do come in contact with wild parsnip: </p> <ul> <li>Cover the affected area with a cool, wet cloth</li> <li>If blisters appear, try not to rupture them for as long as possible</li> <li>To avoid infection, keep the area clean and apply antiseptic cream</li> <li>Contact your care team or provider if the blisters get worse or there are signs \"Leaves of three, let it be.\" That's the old trick for identifying and steering clear or poison ivy. Good advice! Poison ivy and its cousins can produce an itchy, long-lasting rash caused by an allergic reaction to the oily resin, called urushiol, which is found in the leaves, stems and roots. </p> <p>You can get the oil on your skin not only from the plant, but also from clothing, tools, equipment or animal fur or hair. If you're burning with poison ivy, there's also danger of inhaling the oil, which may cause difficulty breathing. </p> <p>If you've come in contact with the oil, wash your skin with soap and water, and even your clothing, as soon as possible to reduce your chance of getting the rash. <span>Poison Ivy doesn't spread after contact with the plant, but it can seem that way. Symptoms typically occur 4-96 hours after exposure and peak by day 14 but new areas of rash can occur for up to 21 days after exposure. </span>Treat mild cases of poison ivy rash at home with soothing lotions and cool baths. If the rash is severe or widespread, or on your face or genitals, you may need a prescription medication. </p> <p>See your care team or provider if: </p> <ul> <li>Your skin continues to swell</li> <li>The rash eyes, mouth or genitals</li> <li>Blisters are oozing pus</li> <li>You develop a fever greater than 100 F.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonPoisonous Wild Plants 2020Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - child, I remember always wondering what was going on in the kitchen. It seemed to be the place to be, with all the commotion, sounds and smells. </p> <p>One day, my dad propped me up on the counter beside him while cooking dinner, and I got to see firsthand what the fuss was all about. And I loved it. </p> <p>From that day on, I was always in the kitchen \u2014 supervised, of course. I was the \"official stirrer,\" mixing up everything from cookie batter to sauces on the stove. As I grew older, my responsibilities changed. I learned how to cut foods like a chef and make my grandmother's recipes. </p> <p>If your kids are interested in cooking \u2014 even from an early age \u2014 involve them in the kitchen. </p> <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, you and your children may be spending more time at home. Instead of playing video games, get them in the kitchen. It's a place to bond, learn and create. </p> <p>Start by involving your little sous-chef. It's also a great way to help your kids expand their food choices. The more children are involved in the process, the more likely they will want to try different foods other than pizza or chicken nuggets. </p> <p>Here are a few guidelines for various ages and education levels: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Toddlers with supervision </strong><br /> Younger children can help out in the kitchen. Being involved makes them feel as though they are part of something special. Give them the opportunity to do simple and safe tasks, such as pouring measured ingredients into a bowl. Allow them to watch and learn at the same time. </li> <li><strong>Kindergarten and first graders with direct supervision <br /> </strong>Ask them to measure items using a measuring cup, simultaneously developing great hands-on math skills; wash fruits and vegetables; and hand-mix items that are not sticky in a large bowl. </li> <li><strong>Second and third graders with supervision </strong><br /> If you feel comfortable as a parent, this age group can try peeling vegetables, grating cheese and mixing sticky items in bowls. </li> <li><strong>Fourth and fifth graders with supervision </strong><br /> Start using a can opener, stirring stovetop items, pounding chicken and scraping bowls. </li> <li><strong>Sixth and seventh graders with limited supervision </strong><br /> If you feel comfortable as a parent, this age group can start using a knife and being more independent with cooking after instruction, and proving they are capable and safe. </li> </ul> <p>Remember, children's skills will differ, so you will need to decide what you feel comfortable letting them try in the kitchen. Starting children at a young age can help them develop culinary skills that can last a lifetime. You might be surprised at what your children can do. </p> <p><em>Amanda Halls, R.D.N., L.D., is a dietician at Mayo Clinic Health System City, Minnesota. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/kids/kidscooking_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=A3A4F6F4ADD31FBC39F085D6271FD6EE\" alt=\"KidsCooking_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />Early involvement yields oodles fun. Primary Care in Rochester and KassonKids In KitchenPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson a common mental health condition that affects about one in 10 women during the year after giving birth. On Monday, Feb. 26, Employee and Community Health (ECH) started screening moms for postpartum depression at their baby's well-child visits, which take place during the first year of life. </p> <p>This screening will involve asking new moms to complete a paper survey; the baby's provider will review it during the visit. This new screening process will take place at all ECH pediatric and family medicine practice sites in Rochester and Kasson. Here are answers to a few of the questions new moms frequently ask:</p> <p><strong>Q: How do I know if I have postpartum blues or postpartum depression?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Postpartum blues is extremely common in the first days to weeks after delivering a baby. Having a new baby at home can be quite stressful and cause symptoms such as crying for no apparent reason, mood swings, difficulty concentrating, sadness and anxiety. These emotions are a normal response to the stress, hormonal changes and poor sleep that come with a new baby. These \"baby blues\" should come and go, fade within a couple weeks after delivery and not prevent you from caring for yourself or your baby.</p> <p>Postpartum depression can happen anytime during the year following the birth of your child, although it most commonly appears sometime in the first two months. The symptoms can be similar to postpartum blues, but are more severe and also include loss of interest or pleasure in doing things, loss of motivation, feelings of hopelessness or guilt, loss of interest in caring for your baby or feeling like you would be better off dead.</p> <p>These symptoms don't come and go like those of postpartum blues; they last longer than a week or two; and they can get in the way of your ability to take care of yourself and your baby. If you, your partner or your family are worried you may have postpartum depression, it is important to tell your health care provider or your baby's so they can make a diagnosis and provide you and your baby the help you need.</p> <p><strong>Q: What causes postpartum depression? What can I do to prevent it?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> No one knows why or how postpartum depression develops. However, some women seem to be at higher risk. Risk factors for postpartum depression include:</p> <ul> <li>Having had it with a previous birth</li> <li>Depression to or during pregnancy</li> <li>Family <li>History of <li>Poor social or financial support</li> <li>Other stressful life events during pregnancy or after delivery</li> </ul> <p>While these risk factors cannot always be avoided, staying as healthy as possible during your pregnancy may help. Be sure to exercise, eat a healthy diet and practice stress-reducing techniques. Be sure to follow up with your health care provider before and after the birth of your child to make sure signs of depression are identified and managed early.</p> <p><strong>Q: What will happen if I am diagnosed with postpartum depression?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> This is a clinical disease, just like high blood pressure or diabetes. Being diagnosed with postpartum depression does not mean you are a bad mom or that your baby will be taken away from you. But just like high blood pressure or diabetes, it is important to manage this disease to prevent any consequences to your or your baby's health.</p> <p>Some women with postpartum depression improve their symptoms with a combination of talk therapy with a counselor or therapist and self-management interventions such as exercise, meditation, healthy eating and socializing with friends. Many women also need antidepressant medications in order to resolve their symptoms. These medications are effective, and many of them are safe to take while breastfeeding. Your health care provider can find one that will work well for you.</p> <p><strong>Q: Am I going crazy?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> No! Postpartum depression is common, but it is also very serious. Sometimes women feel like they want to harm themselves or their baby. This doesn't mean you are crazy or a bad person; however, these feelings shouldn't be brushed off, and you need to contact your doctor or call 911 immediately if you experience them.</p> <p>Some women also develop postpartum psychosis. This condition can cause you to see or hear things other people don't, feel paranoid or like you don't know where you are. These are very serious symptoms that require immediate medical attention.</p> <p>Most women with postpartum depression do not experience these severe symptoms, but still feel like they are \"losing it\" because they think that they should be happy to have a new baby in their life. Do not to let embarrassment or shame prevent you from seeking help. These feelings are common and can be treated with the help of your health care provider.</p> <p><em><a href=\"/providers/matthew-meunier-md\">Dr. Matthew Meunier</a> is a family physician with Women's Health fellowship training in the Mayo Clinic Department of Family Medicine.

So when is it time to be concerned and contact your provider? </p> <p>Sleep apnea is a condition where breathing repeatedly starts and stops. While it can be caused by a failure of the brain to tell the muscles to work (central sleep apnea), the more common cause is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). </p> <p><strong>Symptoms of OSA include:</strong></p> <ul> to bother a bed partner</li> <li>Excessive sleepiness during the day, including falling asleep while driving, watching TV or working</li> <li>Stopping breathing during sleep, which is usually noticed by a bed partner</li> <li>Waking suddenly during the night with a gasping or choking sensation</li> <li>Morning headaches</li> <li>Problems with sleeping, including frequent awakening and difficulty falling or staying asleep</li> <li>Waking with a dry mouth or sore throat</li> </ul> <p><strong>Factors that increase increase a person's risk of car accidents, heart problems (including hear attacks and heart failure), high blood pressure, stroke, and complications after general anesthesia. It also may affect performance at work or in school. </p> <p>Initial evaluation will include getting a history about sleep patterns and information from a bed partner. A physical examination will focus on your blood pressure, weight, heart, lungs, mouth and neck. Questionnaires are very helpful to assess your risk and need for additional testing. One of the most common questionnaires is the STOP-Bang, which can be used to screen patients and determine if additional testing is needed. </p> <p>Treatment for OSA depends on the severity of the condition, but generally will include avoiding sedating medications, alcohol and weight loss if you're overweight. If it occurs when sleeping in certain positions, avoiding those positions at night may be enough. It also may include the use of devices, such as a CPAP, that can improve the quality and quantity of your sleep. </p> <p>If you or your bed partner are bothered by your snoring, contact your primary care provider for a discussion and evaluation. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/denise-dupras-md/\">Denise Dupras, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is a general internal medicine physician in the Division of Community Internal Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

When these signals become disrupted or overactive, a seizure can occur. Seizures occur in roughly 1 in 10 people. </p> <p>Epilepsy is a neurological condition that causes recurrent seizures or increases the risk of recurrent seizures. Approximately 65 million people around the world have epilepsy. In the U.S., 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy at some point. </p> <p><strong>What causes epilepsy?</strong></p> <p>A single seizure can occur due to severe illness, high fever, infection, stroke, drug use, medication overdose, significant head injury, or alcohol withdrawal. </p> <p>Epilepsy can be caused by an inherited tendency, a genetic cause; abnormality in brain development from birth; brain injury; stroke; dementia; or due to residual brain damage from previous brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. However, the cause of epilepsy is not known in 6 of 10 people. </p> <p><strong>Can epilepsy be prevented?</strong></p> <p>Other than minimizing risk for head injury be wearing a helmet when appropriate and taking care of your health to minimize the risk of stroke, you cannot prevent epilepsy. </p> <p>In someone who is diagnosed with epilepsy, it is important to avoid missing doses of anti-seizure medication and avoid sleep deprivation. It is also important to not consume excessive amounts of alcohol or use illicit drugs. </p> <p><strong>How is epilepsy treated?</strong></p> <p>People with epilepsy need to take an anti-seizure medication regularly to reduce the chance of a seizure. Two-thirds of people with epilepsy can control their seizures with medication. </p> <p>Some people will develop epilepsy that is difficult to treat, and more than one anti-seizure medication may be required to control seizures. Epilepsy surgery or the need for an implanted device to control seizures is also needed sometimes. </p> <p><strong>Can someone with epilepsy lead a healthy life?</strong></p> <p>Most people with epilepsy will lead normal lives, and you will not know by looking at them that they have epilepsy. People with epilepsy can perform a variety of jobs. However, people with epilepsy generally cannot be an airline pilot or a truck driver. </p> <p>If you're struggling with epilepsy, be sure to talk to your care team about treatment Mayo Clinic neurologist.

When symptoms are severe enough and cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your child's life, it could be a sign of a neurobehavioral disorder, such </p> <p>ADHD is a chronic condition that affects millions of children and often continues into adulthood. ADHD includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty sustaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. </p> <p>Children with ADHD also may struggle with low self-esteem, troubled relationships, school anxiety and poor performance in school. Symptoms sometimes lessen with age. However, some people never completely outgrow ADHD, but they can learn strategies to be successful. </p> <p>While treatment won't cure ADHD, it can help a great deal with symptoms. Treatment typically involves medications and behavioral interventions. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a big difference in the outcome for your child. </p> <p>These five behavioral strategies can help you manage your child's ADHD. </p> <p><strong>Praise and reward your child when rules are followed.</strong> Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism more than other children. This can really affect their self-esteem. Some days, you might have to look hard for the good behavior, but you should praise good behavior at least five times more often than you criticize bad behavior. </p> <p><strong>Give clear, effective directions or commands.</strong> Make eye contact or gently touch your child on the arm or shoulder to get their attention. Give brief, simple steps and short commands that get to the point rather than multiple directions or wordy statements/questions. </p> <p><strong>Establish healthy habits.</strong> If your child is on a medication, it should be taken as prescribed. Contact your child's health care provider if problems arise. Make sure your child is getting enough sleep, eating a well-balanced diet consisting of three meals, a snack and adequate fluid every day, and can take part in some form of daily exercise. These healthy habits will help your child feel their best and minimize ADHD symptoms. </p> <p><strong>Develop routines around homework and chores.</strong></p> <ul> <li>Work together to make a checklist of what needs to be done for daily chores, getting ready for bed and school, so your child has something to refer to when they get off task. </li> <li>Encourage your child to use a daily planner so they're aware of all homework assignments. </li> <li>Have an established time and location for homework, and use a timer to remind your child two to four times an hour to show you their progress on the work. </li> <li>Factor in brain breaks, if your child needs them. Add movement between tasks or let them use an appropriate fidget toy. </li> <li>Help your child build relationships, strong social skills and maintain friendships. </li> <li>Be a good role model for behavior you want your child to practice. </li> </ul> <p>To help maintain a strong parent-child relationship, set aside some special time with your child three to five days a week. Make sure this time doesn't involve a screen and that it's conflict free. Help your child develop at least one close friendship. With younger children, parents may need to take the lead to arrange and host play dates or get kids involved in activities where there are other children the same age. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/renee-breland-aprncnpms/\">Renee Breland, APRN, CNP, MS</a>, is a certified pediatric nurse practitioner in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Integrated Community Specialty Pediatric ADHD Clinic and a general pediatric practitioner at Mayo Family Clinic Northeast in Rochester, Minn. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/medicalimages/ech_adhdtips_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=1875820D5C7A38D457B5D731D7EB3519\" alt=\"ECH_ADHDtips_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />These five behavioral Primary Care in Rochester and KassonManage ADHD 2020Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Luke student athlete is busy. Full school days, practices, games, homework and social life make for a full schedule. Sleep often gets overlooked when scheduling the day, but this can come at a price. </p> <p>A lack of quality sleep can negatively affect your student's academic and athletic performance. Your child is experiencing an important period of physical, mental and emotional maturation. Sleep is vital to optimize healthy growth and development during this time. </p> <p>Here's how I respond to some of the common questions that student athletes and their parents ask me about sleep: </p> <p><strong>What the benefits of sleep?</strong></p> <p>Research has extensively described the benefits of sleep. In athletes, getting enough quality sleep has been demonstrated to improve mood, energy levels, and physical and cognitive performance; speed up recovery; improve immune function; and reduce likelihood of injury. </p> <p>Adequate sleep has been shown to improve academic performance, which should be the top priority for student athletes. Getting enough quality sleep \u2014 in addition to practice, training and proper nutrition and hydration \u2014 is a vital part of achieving a student athlete's peak athletic performance. From an injury prevention standpoint, some studies have shown that even getting a single additional hour of sleep can greatly reduce injury risk. </p> <p>Sleep is also important in regulating several physiologic functions, including immune function and energy storage. Sleep deprivation has been shown to decrease glycogen storage, which is one way the body stores energy for intense, prolonged physical activity. </p> <p><strong>How much sleep should an athlete get?</strong></p> <p>The amount of sleep each athlete needs varies, since some need more than others to perform at their peak. However, most high school athletes should get a minimum of eight to 10 hours of sleep per night, with younger athletes needing even more. In addition to getting adequate sleep, it's also important that sleep is high-quality. </p> <p><strong>I heard napping was bad for teenagers. Is this true?</strong></p> <p>Not all napping is bad. Rather, naps have been shown to be beneficial if done appropriately, since they can provide a physical and mental boost. A daytime nap can reduce sleep debt, and improve your energy, alertness and memory \u2014 and even reaction time and performance. Limit naps to about 30 minutes, and they shouldn't be done too late in the day, since prolonged naps or napping too late in the day can interfere with nighttime sleeping. </p> <p>If athletes are excessively sleeping during the day, they're probably not getting adequate restorative nighttime sleep. Excessive daytime sleepiness also can be a symptom of depression in children, so alert your child's primary care provider if you're noticing a pattern of increased daytime sleepiness or other signs or symptoms of depression. </p> <p><strong>Is it OK if my athlete snores?</strong></p> <p>Snoring should not be brushed aside or ignored. Snoring can be a sign of a sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea. If your athlete consistently snores, you should discuss this with your primary care provider to see if an evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist would help. </p> <p><strong>What should I do if my athlete has trouble sleeping? </strong></p> <p>Sleep difficulties can occur for various reasons. Some student athletes have a difficult time falling asleep, while others may have trouble staying asleep or wake up frequently at night. Certain medical conditions can cause sleep issues, but most of these issues can be addressed by optimizing your sleep hygiene. </p> <p>Improving sleep includes practices such as: </p> <ul> <li>Having a consistent bedtime routine, including going to bed and waking up at consistent times every day. </li> <li>Creating a relaxing and soothing environment, such as bathing before bed, playing soothing music or meditating. </li> <li>Making the room cool, dark and quiet. White noise or fans help some people sleep. </li> <li>Avoiding cellphones and other screen time at least one to two hours before bed. This artificial light can be stimulating and suppress your brain's melatonin production, which is an important hormone involved in your body's sleep-wake cycle. </li> <li>Avoiding heavy meals or exercise within two hours of bedtime, which can make it more difficult to fall asleep. Hunger also affects sleep, so try having a light snack before bedtime, if you're hungry. </li> <li>Avoiding caffeine late in the day, including coffee, soda, tea, energy drinks and chocolate. </li> </ul> <p>If sleep problems persist despite these recommendations, consider discussing your student athlete's sleep with their primary care provider. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/luke-radel-md/\">Luke Radel, M.D.</a>, is a physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.

More common ages of diagnosis are sibling has Type 1 diabetes, or if you are born with certain genes, your risk increases. Research suggests that there also may be triggers, such as viral infections or exposure to other environmental factors that aren't yet clearly understood. The number of cases of Type 1 diabetes increases the farther away from the equator occurs when the body accidentally attacks its own cells. Specifically, in Type 1 diabetes, the body attacks cells in the pancreas. The pancreas makes insulin, which is a substance that helps move sugar from the blood stream into the cells to be used for energy. However, in Type 1 diabetes the pancreatic cells are damaged to the point that the organ is unable to produce enough insulin and eventually cannot produce any insulin. Without insulin to move it from the blood into the body's cells, circulating sugar builds up, leading to signs and symptoms of high blood suddenly, and may include being extremely tired, increased thirst and urination, unintentional weight loss, blurred vision, yeast infections, itchy skin, nausea or vomiting, extreme hunger, fruity smelling breath, bed-wetting in a child who was previously potty-trained, and irritability. If you or your child exhibit any of those symptoms, you should contact your health care essential in diagnosing Type 1 diabetes.

Sometimes people experience a \"honeymoon phase,\" where the pancreas still can produce a small amount of insulin for the body to use, and little or no insulin may be needed to stabilize blood sugar levels. However, this typically only lasts a few months to a year until regular use of insulin is the mainstay of treatment, can be delivered into the body in various ways, including pens, syringes, pumps or even the newer artificial pancreas systems. It is important that those living with Type 1 diabetes work closely with their medical team to find what insulin regimen and system is best. Other methods of treatment may include oral medications to help with blood sugar control and other conditions often seen along with diabetes, such as high blood pressure or high levels of that is low in fat and high in fiber, and includes vegetables and whole grain, is important to regulate blood sugar. Meeting with a dietitian is recommended. Physical activity is important for all people, and those with Type 1 diabetes are encouraged to exercise regularly, as well. Exercise can lower blood sugar, so it is important to ask your health care provider to be cleared to do so and to discuss how to safely take part in the levels of blood sugar from Type 1 diabetes can lead to episodes of dangerously high or low sugar, diabetic ketoacidosis, coma or even death. If diabetes is not treated and the body continues to have high levels of sugar moving around in the bloodstream, it can damage many organs, including the kidneys, eyes, heart and even the nerves. Nerve damage from diabetes can lead to permanent damage and the need to remove the affected body part, often the feet or toes of those living to recognize that with a Type 1 diabetes diagnosis comes a big lifestyle change for those living with it.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonJuvenile DiabetesPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. John WilkinsonDrinking enough water: One to feel slightly guilty about not drinking enough water or about never feeling thirsty. Some even believe they may be chronically dehydrated with unknown, but ominous, consequences. But for virtually all healthy individuals, we don't need to worry. </p> <p>We have finely tuned systems, mainly thirst, to ensure that our fluid intake is completely adequate. Our bodies signal us to drink long before we are actually dehydrated; there's no reason to worry if you rarely feel thirsty. </p> <p>While plain water has its advantages, it's certainly not our only source of hydration. We get much of our daily needs from juices, tea, coffee and soft drinks, as well as food, since water is a main component of fruits and vegetables. </p> <p><strong>Medical myths that are all wet</strong></p> <p>The idea that we must drink at least eight glasses of water a day has been around for decades. In my practice, it's not unusual for one spouse to ask me to intervene and urge the other spouse to \"drink more water.\" This idea may have sprung from a 1945 recommendation that stated, \"A suitable allowance of water for adults is 2.5 liters (84 ounces) daily ... Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.\" Somehow, the last sentence is often ignored, leading to the eight-glasses-a-day myth. </p> <p><strong>Dehydration concerns don't hold water</strong></p> <p>Still, every summer well-meaning individuals and many news organizations feel compelled to remind us to drink more water. We read warnings about dehydration, implying that healthy adults and children are walking around inadequately hydrated or that an epidemic of dehydration is responsible for a variety of health concerns. </p> <p>For instance, in 2013 CBS reported that, \"75% of Americans may be functioning in a chronic state of dehydration, many mistaking the symptoms for other illnesses ... and a slew of health issues including fatigue, joint pain and weight gain.\" They advised, \"Drink plenty of water!\" It turns out the 75% number has been floating around the internet for years. </p> <p><strong>Turning the tide</strong></p> <p>An independent, evidence-based group HealthNewsReview.org has concluded this flood of claims is not supported by good science, and there is \"no evidence that most Americans exist in a stat of unwitting desiccation.\" They highlight an authoritative 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine that, \"Women who are adequately hydrated consume an average of about 2.7 liters of water daily, while men average 3.7 liters daily; about 80% of that water comes from beverages of all kinds, with 20% from food.\"</p> <p>The same report also stated, \"We don't offer any rule of thumb based on how many glasses of water people should drink each day because our hydration needs can be met through a variety of sources, in addition to drinking water. On a daily basis, people get adequate amounts of water from normal drinking behavior \u2014 consumption of beverages at meals and in other social situations \u2014 and by letting their thirst guide them.\"</p> <p><strong>Floating suggestions for health benefits of extra water</strong></p> <p>Contrary to many stories you may hear, there's no real scientific proof that, for otherwise healthy people, drinking extra water has any health benefits. </p> <p>For instance, there's no evidence that drinking more water keeps skin hydrated or makes it look healthier or wrinkle free. Neither is there any connection between drinking water and weight control in adults. </p> <p>While increased water intake in healthy people doesn't enhance kidney function, it may, in specific circumstances, prevent the recurrence of certain types of kidney stones. </p> <p>Real dehydration, when your body has lost a significant amount of water because of illness, excessive exercise or sweating, or an inability to drink, is a serious issue. But people with clinical dehydration almost always have symptoms of some sort. In addition, the frail elderly, often with some degree of cognitive decline, may lose their sense of thirst and be chronically dehydrated, with poorer outcomes. </p> <p><strong>Carried along on currents of cash</strong></p> <p>As bottled water sales continue to rise each year, it's worth noting that many of the studies and news reports trying to convince us to drink more water are often sponsored in some way by the multibillion-dollar beverage industry. </p> <p><strong>Unintended consequences</strong></p> <p>HealthNewsReview.org contributor Dr. Yonni Freedhoff, an assistant professor of family medicine at the University of Ottawa, sees no harm in drinking water when you're not thirsty, but said, \"The main risk of sounding the dehydration alarm is that people will choose beverages other than water to rehydrate, with many of them packing huge punches of free sugars.\"</p> <p>In extreme cases, drinking excess amounts of water can be dangerous, resulting in water intoxication or hyponatremia, especially in athletes. </p> <p><strong>Bottom line: No need to worry</strong></p> <p>Drinking a great deal of extra water is definitely not necessary. If you're exercising or working in the heat, take time to cool off and drink fluids and be aware of thirst. But there's no formal recommendation for a daily amount of water that people need. That depends on what you eat, how big you are and what you're doing.

Breastfeeding your late preterm baby (born between 34 and 38 weeks of gestation) may have some unique challenges. Because they aren't as physically mature as a full-term baby, preterm infants may cue to eat less often, tire more easily while feeding and have less strength to suckle milk from the breast. </p> <p>This doesn't mean you can't exclusively breastfeed. Often, as late preterm babies near their original due date or soon after, they're able to nurse effectively and exclusively from the breast. </p> <p>Here are a few tips to ensure your baby is getting enough to eat, and you're able to maintain your milk supply: </p> <ul> <li>Your baby should be eating every two to three hours around the clock, even if they aren't showing cues. Wake the baby gently with skin-to-skin time, by lightly undressing, talking to them, or changing their diaper. </li> <li>Your baby may not be ready until a few weeks old to fully feed from the breast at every feeding. If they keep falling asleep at the breast within a few minutes, try nursing every other feeding or giving a bottle of pumped milk for the opposite feeding. Or, pump and give baby the expressed milk after they stop breastfeeding. </li> <li>Your baby's cheek muscles may not be fully developed, so they may not be able to extract milk from the breast efficiently quite yet. A nipple shield may be helpful. Your International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) or nurse can help you learn to use it. The shield can be used until baby is able to take all feedings easily from the breast, and then weaned off of it. </li> <li>To maintain a full milk supply, it's a good idea to pump or hand express milk after breastfeeding three to four times a day to stimulate milk production. This should be continued until the baby is nursing well from the breast, and your milk supply is fully established. Most moms are producing at least 16 ounces a day by one week of age. If you're concerned about your supply, reach out to your breastfeeding professional. </li> <li>Your baby's provider will want to monitor their weight to ensure they're growing well.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonPhysical Activity AgingPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. Rozalina McCoyDiabetes one of nearly 30 million Americans with diabetes, you're probably taking at least one medication to control your blood sugar. With multiple glucose-lowering medications approved for treating type 1 or type 2 diabetes, choosing the one that is right for you can be a daunting task. Your choice will depend on many things, including: </p> <ul> <li>Type of diabetes you have</li> <li>How much sugar needs to be lowered</li> <li>Other health conditions</li> <li>Your risk for hypoglycemia </li> <li>Cost insurance coverage</li> </ul> <p><strong>Options for type 1 diabetes</strong></p> <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you need insulin. But there are different kinds of insulin, as well as different ways for it to be delivered. </p> <p>Most patients with type 1 diabetes are treated with analog insulins - long-acting basal insulin and rapid-acting meal-time insulin. However these insulins are expensive, and type 1 diabetes can be managed safely with human insulins (NPH and regular), which are much less expensive. Insulin is generally injected under the skin using insulin pens or syringes/vials. </p> <p>Another option is an insulin pump, which delivers a continuous flow of insulin (usually a rapid-acting analog) through a needle placed under the skin. Insulin-pump therapy isn't for everyone, but it can help improve blood-sugar control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, compared with multiple-dose insulin injections. Some insulin pumps can communicate with a continuous glucose monitor and pause insulin delivery during episodes of hypoglycemia and even adjust basal insulin rates automatically. </p> <p><strong>Options for type 2 diabetes</strong></p> <p>While some patients with type 2 diabetes can control their disease with lifestyle modifications alone, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising, most people eventually require medications. </p> <p>The medication usually started first is metformin, which works by improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. Metformin is effective, safe, inexpensive, doesn't cause hypoglycemia and can help patients lose weight. It also can be used to manage prediabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome. </p> <p>When metformin alone isn't enough or not well tolerated, other medications need to be started. Review this list of the <a href=\"/-/media/ech-media/documents/diabetesmedicationoptions.pdf?la=en&hash=DC9D5469E1AF2E7A7A87D5082194D516\">most commonly used medications</a>, along with some of their benefits and concerns</p> <p><strong>Options for gestational diabetes</strong></p> <p>If you had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before pregnancy, most likely you will need to use insulin during pregnancy. However, some women who didn't have diabetes before they became pregnant develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Many women are able to control their blood sugar with diet and exercise alone. If that isn't enough, medications need to be started. Insulin remains the first-line treatment for gestational diabetes in the U.S., but metformin and glyburide are also safe, effective and frequently used. </p> <p><strong>How to choose the right medication?</strong></p> <p>While metformin is generally the first option, the choice of medications once metformin is no longer enough or not well tolerated, depends on your goals and preferences. It's important to talk with your health care provider about your options. Here are some things to consider: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Sulfonylureas.</strong> Older patients, those with cardiovascular disease or at risk for hypoglycemia should use with caution. </li> <li><strong>SGLT2 inhibitors.</strong> Patients with heart failure and cardiovascular disease may benefit from this option. </li> <li><strong>DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists. </strong>An option for patients with kidney disease and at risk for hypoglycemia. </li> </ul> <p>Cost is another important consideration. Brand-name oral and injectable medications are expensive and may not be covered by your insurance. Some have coupons from the manufacturer to help lower copayments for patients with private health insurance; these coupons last for one year and can be renewed. </p> <p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that you have many options to treat your diabetes. Talk with your health care providers, including your pharmacist, to learn which ones may be best for you. </p> <p><em>Dr. Rozalina McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Primary Care Internal Medicine (PCIM) in Rochester.

They're unleashing the power of play to promote their physical and mental well-being.</p> <p>Play is part of children exploring their world, developing a sense of self and self-esteem, learning what works and what doesn't, and interacting with other children. Good old-fashioned, creative, unstructured playtime not only helps children develop social and language skills, it also gets them moving.</p> <p>In a world where screens are everywhere, it's important for children to seek out other activities. While the screen itself is not harmful, pediatricians worry when it's the only kind of playtime kids are getting \u2014 especially if it takes away from time spent playing with their friends. That's why we ask about it at well-child visits.</p> <p>In general, we like to see children have some active play every day, whether it's formal like being on a sports team or informal such as jumping rope on the playground.</p> <p>One of the benefits of informal play is that it encourages kids to create their own structure and sparks their imagination. They'll surprise you with their creativity, resiliency and ability to work with other kids to reach shared goals. That's when adults need to step back and just let them play. For example, give kids a large cardboard box. Then watch them turn it into a cave, a fort, a spaceship, a boat or a time machine and build a whole world around it.</p> <p>Play also has a special role for children who have experienced difficult situations such as abuse or neglect. It gives them a special language for expressing their feelings and emotions, especially when they might not yet have the skills or words to explain. Communicating through play can be life-changing for them.</p> <p>That's the power of play \u2014 for all kids.</p> <p><a href=\"http://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/angela-mattke-md\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dr. Angela Mattke</em></a><em> is a general pediatrician in Employee and Community Health's (ECH) Division of Community Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (CPAM) at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

While yelling and spanking may be the first approach, it may not be the best. </p> <p>These are often disciplines ingrained in families, cultures and religions, not just in the U.S., but worldwide. However, a growing volume of research is showing that spanking or hitting children actually can have the opposite effect parents were trying to achieve. Research reveals that: </p> <ul> <li>Spanking can increase anger and aggression, instead of teaching responsibility for behaviors. </li> <li>It can confuse children, especially if you're also teaching them that hitting others isn't right. </li> <li>Kids learn that hitting is acceptable. </li> <li>Physical punishment can foster depression and anxiety in children and even affect their performance in school. </li> <li>Spanking damages the whole parent/child relationship because someone they love hurts them. </li> <li>Infants don't understand hitting \u2014 they expect love and comfort from adults \u2014 and it won't change any behavior, but it will recommends against using spanking or other physical punishment to discipline children. Through discipline, the goal is to teach children appropriate behavior. As a result, they learn skills to manage emotions, solve problems and interact with others around them. It's up to parents to model these successful behaviors and skills. </p> <p>Some discipline techniques that have proved to be more effective include: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Redirecting or distracting.</strong> This is particularly effective with young children. For instance, if a child is upset that a sibling took their toy, give them another toy to play with. Redirection/distraction takes some practice to find out what works in different situations. </li> <li><strong>Catching them being good. </strong>Paying attention to kids is a powerful tool for parents. If you try to catch kids being good, they'll respond by wanting to repeat the good behavior. Give positive praise and do it right away. If you see your child sharing, say, \"Oh, I love that you asked your sister nicely for the toy.\" Sometimes all that's needed is a smile to let them know you've noticed. It's about downplaying the bad behavior and rewarding the good. For a rule of thumb, use a ratio of five positive \"catches\" to one negative catch. </li> <li><strong>Taking a time out.</strong> This works for both parent and child! Sometimes parents just need to step away from the situation with their child. While their child is in a time out, they can put themselves in one, too. That can be going to another room or sitting outside. Or, if the parent prefers, they can sit next to their child and say something like, \"I need to calm down, too. Let's both take a break.\" Once everyone is calm, the parent and child can discuss what happened and what would have been a better behavior. This approach makes time outs effective on two levels: the situation is handled more calmly and parents model self-control to their kids. </li> </ul> <p>Mayo Clinic is currently working on introducing No-Hit-Zones at its clinics and hospitals. These zones are a way to promote calm, safe and caring environments for children where no hitting of any kind is allowed. </p> <p>Learning new discipline techniques takes thought and practice on the part of parents.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonFair FoodsPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - our organs are on the inside. One we wear on the outside and see every day is our skin, our largest organ. In adults, it covers 22 square feet and weighs about eight pounds. Our skin serves as a waterproof, insulating, protective shield and is packed with nerves for keeping us in touch with the outside world. </p> <p>So, it's a good idea to pay attention to this amazing organ. Here's the skinny on keeping skin healthy throughout our lives: </p> <p><strong>Wear sunscreen.</strong> A sunscreen with a high SPF protects against skin cancer and other sun damage. Anyone from birth to 99+ should apply it whenever we go outside. Wear a hat and cover up in the sun with long sleeves and pants (check out the new ultraviolet-light screening fabrics) for extra protection. </p> <p><strong>Don't smoke.</strong> Smoking ages our skin, making it look older and leading to wrinkles. It also restricts blood flow that supplies nutrients and oxygen essential for skin health. </p> <p><strong>Eat a healthy, balanced diet \u2014 with plenty of water.</strong> Many of the best foods for healthy skin also promote good overall health. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Research suggests that antioxidant-rich foods like tomatoes, berries, beans, peas and lentils, and fatty fish like salmon, can help protect our skin. The key is variety \u2014 and lots of water to keep skin hydrated. </p> <p><strong>Keep it clean, but gentle.</strong> Use warm rather than hot water when washing, showering or shaving, avoid strong and/or abrasive soaps, pat dry and moisturize all over, especially during the winter. </p> <p><strong>Check it out.</strong> We know our skin and what looks normal for us. Regular skin checks for anything unusual, new, rough, raised, discolored or is taking a long time to heal can catch issues early. A spot getting darker, bigger or more irregular also is a warning sign. Make a note and see your care team. Some health conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, can lead skin to break down, making it more susceptible to sores and ulcers. Your care team can help manage wounds by identifying causes and working on nutrition and ways to promote healing. </p> <p><strong>Older skin, special care.</strong> As we age, our skin ages, too. It becomes thinner, more fragile and less quick to heal. We also tend to bruise easier, especially if we're on any type of blood thinner. The bruises to be concerned about are those in more protected areas that typically don't get bumped. To protect against aging skin, keep it moisturized, avoid bumps and falls and eat a healthy, balanced diet, which includes getting enough calories, protein and fats. </p> <p><em><a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/paul-takahashi-md\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Paul Takahashi</a> is an internal medicine physician in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM) and practices at the Baldwin Building clinic in Rochester.

But why is inflammation bad, and what does food have to do with it? </p> <p>Inflammation is a part of the body's normal response to infection or injury. It's when damaged tissue releases chemicals that tell white blood cells to start repairing. But sometimes inflammation is low-grade, spreads through the body and is chronic. </p> <p>Chronic inflammation can damage the body. It can play a role in the buildup of plaque in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. It's also associated with a higher risk of cancer, diabetes and other chronic conditions. </p> <p><strong>How food can hurt or help</strong></p> <p>The choices you make at the grocery store can affect the inflammation in your body. While scientists are still unraveling how food affects inflammatory processes, they know a few things: </p> <ul> <li>Some foods, like processed sugars, release inflammatory messengers that can raise the risk of chronic inflammation. </li> <li>Other foods, like fruits and veggies, help the body fight against oxidative stress, which can trigger inflammation. </li> <li>Foods that are anti-inflammatory tend to be the same foods that can keep you healthy in other ways. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Add more of these foods to your grocery list</strong></p> <p>Choosing foods to reduce chronic inflammation has layers.

Fortunately, the American Heart Association (AHA) created a simple map, \"Life's Simple 7\", to guide us on a healthy lifestyle. The 7 components we can tackle are: </p> <p><strong>#1 Manage blood pressure</strong></p> <p>Our blood pressure is made up of two numbers: the systolic (higher) number measures the pressure in the arteries during the heartbeat, the diastolic (lower) number measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is resting between beats. Normal is <120/<80. High levels of blood pressure put strain and pressure on the heart, arteries and kidneys over time. Everyone's levels fluctuate during the day, but it's important to be aware of your range and maintain control of your blood pressure. </p> <p><strong>#2 Control cholesterol</strong></p> <p>Cholesterol is a fat substance that comes from two sources \u2014 our body and our diet. There are two types of cholesterol: LDL (\"bad\" cholesterol) and HDL (\"good\" cholesterol). While the HDL (\"good\") cholesterol protects our artery walls, the LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol sticks to them, contributing to plaque build-up, which can clog our arteries. It is important to control our levels of cholesterol to prevent plaque build-up, which leads to heart disease and stroke. </p> <p><strong>#3 Reduce blood sugar</strong></p> <p>The carbohydrates and sugars we eat turn into glucose (sugar) in the stomach and digestive system. This glucose then enters the bloodstream. Insulin is a hormone secreted by our pancreas that lowers blood glucose by helping cells take it in. With diabetes, glucose builds up in the bloodstream because cells are no longer taking it in as effectively. This can be due to genetics, increased weight and our diets. These high levels of blood sugar over time can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves. That's why it's important to keep our blood sugar at a normal level. </p> <p><strong>#4 Get active</strong></p> <p>The goal for activity is at least 150 minutes of moderate level physical activity per week (which equates to 30 minutes, five days a week) and muscle strengthening at least two days a week. Moderate-level physical activity means breaking a sweat and having difficulty maintaining a full conversation during activity. </p> <p><strong>#5 Eat better</strong></p> <p>Eating healthy is an important part of improving our health and staying healthy. The AHA recommends making smart choices to build an overall healthy dietary pattern. There's a right number of calories for you, based on your age, activity level and whether you're trying to lose, gain or maintain your weight. By reading nutrition labels, watching your calorie intake, cooking at home, aiming for vegetables/whole grains and avoiding processed foods, you can go far toward improving your health. </p> <p><strong>#6 Lose weight</strong></p> <p>Staying within a healthy weight range for your body type is essential to keeping your heart, brain and skeleton happy. It's important to understand your calorie intake and activity level in order to help you identify the changes you want to make. </p> <p>Losing weight requires you to burn more calories than you eat. One way to do this is by understanding your body mass index (BMI), which is a numerical value of your weight in relation to your height, and it can help you know you're at a healthy weight or if you need to lose weight. </p> <p><strong>#7 Stop smoking</strong></p> <p>If you smoke, the single best thing you can do for your health is to quit. Smoking can lead to numerous health risks including heart disease, stroke and cancers. The benefits are major and can be felt as soon as one day after you stop! There are many resources to help you quit, and we recommend talking to your health care provider to explore your options. </p> <p>People with at least five ideal Life's Simple 7 metrics had a 78% reduced risk for heart-related death compared to people with no ideal metrics. And the benefits of these Life's Simple 7 metrics go beyond the heart \u2014 they can help you reduce your risk of other chronic diseases as well. In fact, if you can achieve each of these metrics, patients were found to have: </p> <ul> <li>20% lower risk for cancer</li> <li>62% lower chronic kidney disease</li> <li>43% lower risk for pneumonia</li> <li>49% lower risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</li> </ul> <p>The amazing thing about these metrics is that any person can make the changes. The steps aren't expensive, and even small improvements can make a huge difference. Start with one metric, and see how small steps can cascade into a healthy lifestyle. </p> <p>If you'd like to learn more and discover how you can improve your health, visit And talk to your health care provider about how you can optimize your health today!</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/allison-ducharme-smith-md/\">Dr. Allison Ducharme-Smith</a> is an internal medicine physician in Primary Care in Rochester/Kasson's Division of Community Internal Medicine (CIM) and practices at Mayo Family Clinic Northeast in Rochester.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHealthy HeartPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Jennifer (Jenna) menopause can bring with it many expected changes from the end of monthly bleeding to shifts in weight distribution to changes in sleep patterns. But it can also bring a few unexpected surprises that many women wish they had known more about. One of these changes is atrophic vaginitis, which is now called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Possibly related to declining estrogen levels, GSM leads to vagina/vaginal tissues</li> our natural lubrication, an increase in pH</li> <li>Reduction in the normal vaginal flora</li> </ul> <p><strong>Symptoms of GSM</strong></p> <p>For many women, this means a vagina that isn't happy and doesn't feel the same as it used to. It's often experienced as: </p> <ul> <li>Burning and dryness in the tissues and vulva (external vagina)</li> <li>Increased vaginal discharge</li> <li>Vaginal tissues that become easily irritated with intercourse</li> <li>Increased pain, discomfort and bleeding with sex</li> <li>Increased number of vaginal infections</li> <li>Urinary changes, including recurrent urinary tract infections, increased urinary urgency and the need to use the restroom more often at night</li> </ul> <p><strong>Who's at risk</strong></p> <p>Those at GSM are women who:</p> <ul> <li>Have had their ovaries <li>Aren't <li>Smoke</li> </ul> <p>GSM affects more than 50% of women, yet studies show that less than 25% of them actually bring it up to their primary care provider \u2014 and even less actually have treatment for it. that's a lot of women who are suffering unnecessarily!</p> <p><strong>What helps relieve GSM</strong></p> <p>What can help? The first line of treatment for mild symptoms includes using vaginal moisturizers routinely (two to three days a week, every week) and/or a water-based vaginal lubricant with intercourse. Both of these products can be found over the counter in the pharmacy section. For many women, this is all they need. </p> <p><strong>Vaginal estrogen: Another option</strong></p> <p>For more moderate or persistent symptoms, vaginal estrogen treatment is recommended. Although this is a hormone, the effect on the body is primarily in the vaginal/vulvar tissues; many specialists don't feel vaginal estrogen is a system hormone at levels that bring significant risks. Most women can use it without concern. </p> <p>There are several delivery methods for vaginal vagina two to three times a week</li> <li>Insertion of a vaginal ring (Estring), which is left in the vagina for up to 90 days</li> </ul> <p>Choosing the type of vaginal estrogen depends on several factors. Your primary care provider can help determine which one is best for you. Most women find significant improvement in as few as two to four weeks. </p> <p>Vaginal estrogen therapy is often needed indefinitely for ongoing management of GSM. If this therapy isn't effective or not an option for you, there are other treatments, including non-hormonal medications and laser therapy, which are less common. You may be referred to a gynecologist for these options. </p> <p><strong>Not just menopausal women</strong></p> <p>Although GSM is most often related to menopause, there's a small percentage of women who may experience it any time estrogen levels have declined due to causes, including medication side effects, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or surgical changes affecting hormone levels. So even if you haven't started the transition to menopause, talk with your primary care provider if you're experiencing symptoms. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/jennifer-johnson-cnp/\">Jennifer (Jenna) Johnson, APRN, CNP, DNP</a>, is a primary care nurse practitioner with a special interest in Women's Health and has dual certifications in both Adult and Women's Health.

For children, cavities can lead to pain, infections and complications that can cause missed school days and missed work for parents. </p> <p>Starting with the first tooth, parents can help their children by brushing their teeth twice a day with fluorinated toothpaste. Once teeth touch, flossing once daily can help remove those sugar bugs, too. </p> <p>For children under 3, use just a smear of fluorinated toothpaste the size of a grain of rice. Once 3 or older, increase the amount to a pea size. Usually young children need assistance with brushing their teeth until age 8, when their dexterity allows them to adequately cover all of their teeth using a toothbrush. Smartphone apps such as Toothsavers, Disney Magic Timer and Tiny Dentist can encourage your children to brush their teeth, too. </p> <p>Other steps to promote dental health in kids are: </p> <ul> <li>Ensure your child visits a pediatric dentist around 1 year of age or once teeth emerge. </li> <li>If you have well water, call your county and ask about water testing to check the fluoride content of your drinking water. Fluoride can naturally occur in well water. If the fluoride concentration is less than 0.7 parts per million, ask your primary care provider about receiving fluoride supplements. Fluoride also can be applied to your child's teeth during well-child exams. This is recommended two to four times per year for all children under 5. </li> <li>Brush your child's teeth twice a day. If possible, brush after any sugary treats. </li> <li>Limit or avoid sticky candies like fruit snacks that can adhere to teeth. These types of candies promote cavities by sticking to teeth. </li> <li>Encourage water between meals and avoid sugary drinks, such as soda and juice. </li> </ul> <p>Developing good oral care in childhood leads to good habits throughout the life span. </p> <p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p> <p>Pearly whites are important in pregnancy, too. While dental care is not often thought about when considering pregnancy, good dental care before and during pregnancy is important. </p> <p>Pregnancy hormones can increase the chances of periodontal disease, or inflammation of the tissues and structures that support the teeth. Inflammation can cause infections, which can lead to dental decay, tooth loss and bone infection if left untreated. Periodontal disease in mothers has been associated with low birth weights for babies and preeclampsia. </p> <p>It is safe to receive dental care during all trimesters of pregnancy. Receiving good dental care during this time is critical to prevent periodontal disease, tooth pain and tooth loss. If you are pregnant or considering pregnancy, and do not have a dentist, it is best to establish with one as soon as possible. </p> <p><strong>Adults</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately, the risk for periodontal disease increases with age. While you can't control your age, you can take measures to reduce your risk of periodontal disease. Poor dental care can lead to pain, infections and nutritional difficulties later in life. Periodontal disease is associated with worsening diabetic blood sugar control and heart disease. </p> <p><strong>Dental hygiene for all ages</strong></p> <p>The mouth is home to billions of bacteria that thrive on sugar. Like other parts of the body, bacteria need to be kept in balance to prevent dental disease. The mouth has some natural mechanisms to maintain this balance, including the production of saliva, which neutralizes the acid produced by the bacteria and helps clean off food particles from teeth. Medical conditions and medications that cause dry mouth and reduce saliva production can increase a person's risk for tooth decay and periodontal disease. </p> <p>Strategies to treat dry mouth include: </p> <ul> <li>Take frequent sips of </li> include: </p> twice daily dry mouth. snacking. </li> beverages, instead choosing water to stay hydrated. </li> <li>Brushing your teeth, or at a minimum rinsing your mouth with water, if you indulge in a sticky, sweet treat. </li> <li>Avoiding all tobacco use \u2014 smoking, chewing and vaping. </li> </ul> <p>Oral health is critical to overall health throughout the life span.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonOral HygienePrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Marcia Johnson, LICSW, and Craig Sawchuk, PhD, LPWhy mindfulness is all day, and finding perfect bliss. Is that mindfulness? Well, yes \u2014 and no. There's a lot of \"buzz\" these days about the benefits of mindfulness, and the numerous ways to practice it. So what exactly is mindfulness, and why are we so focused on it in health care? </p> <p>We have technology at our fingertips, and we can connect with friends or acquaintances with the tap of a finger. Media allows us to be in touch with people more than any other time in history. We know making these connections are good for our health, but why does it seem like the world is spinning so quickly, and our minds seem to be racing all the time? How do we slow the racing brain and allow ourselves to feel more through both body and mind? </p> <p><strong>What is mindfulness?</strong></p> <p>In the rush of modern life, we tend to lose touch with the peace that's available to each of us in each moment. We'd all love to experience this joyful state of mind and well-being. Mindfulness is the path to connection, to that state of well-being, and it's a learned skill. Once learned, these skills can point you toward a calm state of being when you need it most; when your feeling down, stuck, overwhelmed or stressed, or whenever you want to feel good, energized and enthusiastic about life. </p> <p>Mindfulness helps overcome stress, energizes the mind, develops focused attention, gives guidance to dissolve unhealthy habits and manage sickness and pain. Through practice, we can find inner joy, focus on priorities, find insight and wisdom, and grow in closeness to ourselves and others. </p> <p>In <em>The Joy Compass</em>, Donald Altman, a former Buddhist monk, shares the importance of calibrating the mental tools of awareness: attention and intention. He writes that, \"Mindfulness is the awakening of possibility.\" With mindfulness, you bring a sense of openness and acceptance to what is happening in the moment through the body and mind. </p> <p>Mindfulness is intentional, present-focused and nonjudgmental. Our brains have built-in \"negativity bias\" that prompts us to automatically look for danger or threat. Mindful attention can help you retrain your brain and body to choose joyful thoughts, which leads the physical body to follow by slowing down and becoming more calm. If you can focus on pleasant and productive activities, you'll be more healthy in the physical body. </p> <p><strong>How to learn, practice mindfulness</strong></p> <p>Thich Nhat Hanh, a mindfulness leader, tells us that a smile on our face relaxes hundreds of muscles in our body. And studies have shown that when we flex our facial muscles into expressions of joy, we produce positive effects on our nervous system that stimulate real joy. </p> <p>So why not take a few minutes each day to slow down your brain, reduce some of the \"fight or flight\" chemicals, recharge in a peaceful manner and focus on stillness pointing toward joy. </p> <p>Here are some simple energy:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Light a candle.</li> <li>Sit with a straight back, relax and be aware of the candle.</li> <li>Notice the colors and light.</li> <li>When your mind wanders, bring your attention back to the candle.</li> <li>Keep focused on the candle for about 10 minutes. </li> </ol> <p><strong>For calm:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Sit quietly in a chair, hands on lap, feet on floor. </li> <li>Straighten your back. </li> <li>Stay still for three minutes. </li> <li>Breathe in and out gently, while feeling the presence of your body. </li> <li>While staying upright, let your body relax. </li> </ol> <p><strong>For creativity:</strong></p> <ol> <li>If you're feeling scattered, get up and dance with arms outstretched for about 10 minutes. </li> <li>Move the body slowly in different directions. </li> <li>Feel the flow of energy as you move the parts of your body. </li> <li>Keep the flow going for the full 10 minutes. </li> </ol> <p>Mindfulness and meditative practices take time to develop. Start off with a few minutes each day, and work on building up your mindfulness stamina over time. Some people have also found apps to be helpful to support their practice. Good apps for mindfulness and medication are: Calm, Personal Zen and Mindfulness Coach. </p> <p><em>Marcia Johnson, LICSW, is a social worker/therapist in Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) at Primary Care Clinic Southeast and has worked for 20 years in psychiatry and behavioral health at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonMindfulness 2020Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Dr. stuffed up. You have a fever, a headache and your body aches all over. And you've felt crummy for what seems like forever. You have a cold. </p> <p>So what's a cold and what's the best way to cope with the symptoms while you recover?</p> <p>A cold is: </p> <ul> <li>NOT the flu (influenza). Influenza hits you with severe body aches, high fever, headache, bad cough and feeling like you can't crawl out of bed.</li> <li>Caused by a wide array of viruses. It can last anywhere from 10 to 21 days, depending on the virus. You can be infected with two or even three viruses at the same time. Also, that cold that seems to last forever actually may be back-to-back infections. </li> <li>More common in parents of children in day care or preschool or others in contact with children, such as grandparents and teachers. </li> <li>Transmitted most often by coming in contact with an infected person \u2014 or something they've touched. Hand-to-hand transmission is more common than catching a cold from someone coughing or sneezing. </li> <li>NOT treated with antibiotics. Research has shown that antibiotics do not shorten the length of a cold or ease the symptoms. </li> </ul> <p>The best way to treat a cold is not to get one! That means during cold season, wash your hands and/or use a hand sanitizer and stay away from those who are sick. Avoid touching your face, since your eyes, nose and mouth are easy entry points for viruses that you pick up on your hands. </p> <p>But if you do get a cold, here's how to cope and relieve your symptoms: </p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\"> <li><span>Stay home from work if you're constantly blowing your nose and coughing. You're contagious for three to seven days after you come down with a cold. </span></li> <li><span>Take zinc lozenges (NOT zinc nasal spray) at the first sign of a scratchy throat. Zinc can help shorten the length of your cold. </span></li> <li><span>Using an over-the-counter (OTC) nasal spray such as NasalChrom can help when you first get sick. </span></li> <li><span>Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) on a regular schedule \u2014 by the clock \u2014 not just when you feel achy or feverish. Be sure to follow the instructions on the package; you may want to alternate between the two medications. This remedy can make a huge difference. </span></li> <li><span>To reduce post-nasal drip and runny nose, take a combination antihistamine/decongestant such as Sudafed PR Sinus + Allergy. Choose a medication that doesn't contain acetaminophen; it's better to take that separately. This remedy may make you drowsy, but the \"non-drowsy\" antihistamines (Claritin, Allegra, Zyrtec, etc.) are not as effective for drainage from a cold. </span></li> <li><span>For more serious congestion in your nose, sinuses or ears, use Afrin nasal spray, which is more effective than Sudafed. But use it NO LONGER than three to five days. </span></li> <li><span>To relieve a cough, try an OTC cough medicine. For a more severe cough, talk with your care team about getting a prescription cough syrup that contains codeine and/or Phenergan (promethazine). </span></li> </ul> <p><span>If your fever lasts more than three to five days, if you have chest pain, ear pain, are coughing up blood or cough so hard that you vomit or pass out, you should contact your care team immediately. </span></p> <p><span>Otherwise, rest, drink plenty of fluids and hang in there.

These tools include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Medications.</strong> There are multiple classes of medications that can help patients with chronic pain, but they aren't necessarily pain relievers. These may include medications that help with nerve pain; antidepressants, which have been proven to decrease chronic pain; or cortisone injections. </li> <li><strong>Non-drug therapies.</strong> Pain rehabilitation can involve acupuncture, massage, an exercise program and physical therapy to help patients manage pain in their day-to-day lives and work. Equally important is mental health wellness, with an emphasis on identifying and treating depression, stress and anxiety. </li> </ul> <p>These options are all part of a discussion that starts with your health care provider and may involve other providers or a center that specializes in pain, such as Mayo Clinic's Pain Rehabilitation Center, which helps people with chronic pain return to a more active lifestyle. </p> <p>We know that having this discussion with your provider can be scary and very emotional. But know that we will stick with you through the transition and be there to help you through it. You won't be left to handle this on your own. It won't be easy or necessarily pain free.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHealthy Start BabyPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Maegen Storm, APRN, CNP4 success tips women who breastfeed work outside the home. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends only breastfeeding until your baby is six months old, followed by breastfeeding, complemented by solid foods, until your child is one. Studies show that not only does breastfeeding provide health benefits to both mother and baby, but working parents of breastfed infants also have an absenteeism rate three times lower than those whose infants are formula fed. </p> <p>Pumping at work may seem like a challenge, but these four tips can ease the transition form home to work while providing the best nutrition possible for your little one. </p> <p><strong>#1: Set yourself up for success</strong></p> <p>Work with your supervisor to accommodate your needs. A flexible schedule or splitting up your break time(s) can give you the pumping frequency you need. Where you pump should be private and have electricity Some items that can make pumping more manageable are: </p> <ul> <li>Extra set of pump parts</li> <li>Hands-free bag to sterilize pump parts. </li> </ul> <p>Bring a cooler with refreezable ice packs to store your milk until you get home. Milk can be stored: at room temperature up to eight hours, in an ice-packed cooler up to 24 hours, and in the refrigerator up to eight days. </p> <p><strong>#2: Practice introducing a bottle</strong></p> <p>Typically, it is wise to introduce a bottle to your baby when they are about three to six weeks old so they will be comfortable using it while you are at work. Breastfeeding usually is established by this time; babies older than six weeks may refuse to take a bottle. At first, be sure to use a slow-flow nipple. If your baby isn't taking to bottle feeding, try: </p> <ul> <li>Different feeding positions</li> <li>Having someone milk temperatures</li> your pump</strong></p> <p>About two weeks before returning to work, start pumping an additional time to store up some milk. At first, you will not pump much milk, but you are setting your body up to make more later. When you do pump some extra, freeze it for use on the day you return to work. Once back at work: </p> <ul> <li>Try to relax and consider bringing sensory cues, such as a photo, a onesie your baby has worn or an audio of them crying. </li> <li>You should pump as often as your baby typically nurses. </li> <li>If your baby is a frequent nurser, you may need to space out your pumping times, but setting aside about 15-20 minutes should be sufficient. </li> <li>You should pump until no more milk comes out, and then for another minute or two if you are trying to boost your supply. You may also use the let-down button on your pump to trigger more rapid suction, which stimulates a second milk let-down. </li> <li>To completely remove milk, hands-on pumping using breast compression, massage and then finishing with self-expression can increase your pumped volume. </li> </ul> <p><strong>#4: Skin-to-skin time</strong></p> <p>Once you are home from work -- especially if you are experiencing a dip in volume pumped -- allow your baby to nurse on demand while cuddling them skin-to-skin. Some babies take less volume by bottle during the day and prefer to nurse more often in the evenings. </p> <p>If you need support or guidance on pumping while at work, talk with your local lactation specialist -- they are here to help you succeed! Also, consider enrolling in a free class from the Mayo Clinic Perinatal Education department.

Stressful times do come and go. When things are feeling more uncertain, try to focus on those things you can control. Here are active steps you can take to manage stress brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak. </p> <p><strong>Maintain healthy habits</strong></p> <p>An important first step is keeping a daily schedule. Setting up healthy habits and routines can help boost your mood and energy levels:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Make sleep a priority.</strong> Get up and go to bed at routine times each day. Make sure that you're getting adequate, restful sleep. Sleeping too little or too much tends to cause problems. </li> <li><strong>Be physical.</strong> Plan 30 minutes of physical activity, walking or exercise each day. Mix and match your exercises for variety. Try to get outside every day for fresh air. </li> <li><strong>Eat well.</strong> Nourish your body with foods that support your health: fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, whole grains, fish, lean meats, beans and legumes. These foods give longer-lasting energy. Keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water. </li> <li><strong>Care for yourself.</strong> Start each day be showering and getting dressed. This will help wake up your brain. Stay engaged with personally meaningful activities. Be productive and keep up with daily chores. Set reminders if you need to take any medications.</li> </ul> <p>Making a plan can be helpful for structuring your daily schedule. Focus on a few tasks that are most important to you rather than changing your whole routine. Calendars and reminders can help you set up and stick to a daily schedule. </p> <p><strong>Stay connected and disconnected</strong></p> <p>Stay connected with family members, friends and other social supports who reliably build you up. During times when social distancing is recommended, rely on virtual options, such as phone, text and video messaging. Keeping up with our social network is essential to our well-being</p> <p>Set limits on social media and the news. Choose a trusted news source. Staying informed is helpful, but at some point, it can be too much of a good thing. It's important to disconnect from information overload during the day. Try scheduling 15-30 minutes twice a day to stay up to date on the latest events. Know that it's okay to disconnect if you feel your stress level rising. </p> <p><strong>Relax, relax, relax</strong></p> <p>Consider all the ways you can relax and manage stress, such as breathing deeply, practicing mindfulness or meditation, listening to music, reading a book or watching something that makes you laugh. Make a list of your options and put it where you can see it. Building in small amounts of relaxation throughout the day can help bring your stress level down.</p> <p>Worries force you to focus inward on distressing thoughts. Mindfulness helps you learn how to change your focus to the environment around you: </p> <ul> <li>When you're mindful, you don't fight with your thoughts. </li> <li>You learn how to direct your attention, awareness and thoughts back to the present moment. </li> <li>Mindfulness is about focus. You focus only on what is happening right now with intention and purpose, without judgment. </li> <li>When you're being mindful, you're present in the moment and accept the moment as it is. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Keep your thinking in check</strong></p> <p>Worry is common during times of stress. Worry can change our thinking in three ways:</p> <ul> <li>Catastrophizing (thinking the worst)</li> <li>Overestimating the likelihood happening</li> <li>Underestimating our ability to cope</li> </ul> <p>The more anxious we get, the less flexible our thinking becomes. Keep in mind: </p> <ul> <li>The <strong>most</strong> catastrophic outcomes likely</strong> to happen. </li> <li>The <strong>least</strong> catastrophic outcomes the <strong>most likely</strong> to happen. </li> </ul> <p>If you find yourself caught up in cycles of worry, practice this exercise for more flexible thinking. Start by writing down five worries. Next, directly challenge these thoughts by writing answers to these questions: </p> <ul> <li>What is another, less bad way to look at this situation?</li> <li>What is the actual likelihood that these worries will happen?</li> <li>What objective evidence do I have for these worries?</li> <li>What objective evidence do I have against these worries?</li> <li>How have I coped with situations like this in the past? </li> </ul> <p>It's important to write out these thoughts; it helps you train your brain to be more flexible. </p> <p><strong>Mind your manners</strong></p> <p>Be patient. Be kind. Be helpful. As stress goes up, our tolerance can go down. Do what you can to be a positive influence on others. Work together as a team. Think about ways you can help those who may be in need \u2014 give to the food pantry or participate in donating blood. </p> <p><strong>Take reasonable precautions</strong></p> <p>Keep up to date with your health authorities or the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> about appropriate steps for handwashing, disinfecting surfaces and using face masks. Avoid going above and beyond recommended precautions. Take stock of what you have at home and keep a shopping list of what you actually need. Don't go overboard with purchasing too many things you feel you might need at some point in the future. </p> <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p> <p>Time and experience will help move things from being uncertain to being more certain. Know your limits. Keep track of your overall stress level and those things that are helpful for relieving it.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonCOVID StressPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Lisa Burke, LICSWFriendship: A plus for a mutual interest in another person's experiences and thoughts. Friendships require two key elements: a common interest and desire to get to know each other. Friendships aren't just for children \u2014 they provide us with health and well-being benefits no matter our age. And they vary through our life stages:</p> <p><strong>Young children.</strong> Friends are typically found among those nearby, perhaps children of family friends or kids in the neighborhood. Preschool friendships help children develop social and emotional skills, increase a sense of belonging and decrease stress. At this stage, it's important for parents to model good friendship skills and to help encourage friendships important to the child. </p> <p><strong>Adolescents/young adults.</strong> Adolescents typically choose to be close to those who share the same interests. Young adulthood is a time when we start finding our own sense of identity. That's when we seek people who will challenge us to try new things or provide encouragement when we're starting new careers. Friendships also evolve when romantic relationships begin. </p> <p><strong>Adulthood.</strong> This is a time when friendships can take a backseat as we start families or become more wrapped up in careers. It takes effort to meet up with friends given the needs of family members, whether they're our kids or elderly parents. However, friends understand (they're often in the same boat), and when time is spent together, we can pick up as if no time has passed. </p> <p><strong>Later adulthood.</strong> Friendship circles start decreasing due to death, limited mobility or relocation. Depression and loneliness can affect us as we experience this shrinking friend group. That's why it's so essential for us to stay as active as possible, whether it's participating in church groups, visiting neighbors, volunteering, playing cards or engaging in other social activities. </p> <p><strong>Care and feeding of friendships</strong></p> <p>No matter our stage in life, friendships can protect against loneliness, decrease anxiety and improve our physical health and well-being. But they do require care and feeding. Here are some tips for making and keeping friends. </p> <p>Taking time to foster friendships can provide health benefits throughout the year \u2014 and throughout lives:</p> <ul> <li>Acts of kindness are helpful in maintaining friendships; it's not always about buying them a gift for a holiday or birthday. Make plans to spend quality time together or go to a child's event. </li> <li>Invite a friend to do something you're already planning to do. Even with busy schedules, friends can meet for exercise or a cup of coffee. </li> <li>Stay connected with friends, even if you're separated by distance. Pick up the phone occasionally or send a letter in the mail \u2014 don't just text. Do little things to stay connected. </li> <li>Plan to get together as often as possible. When spending time together, ask intentional, open-ended questions to show curiosity in your friend's experiences. </li> </ul> <p><em>Lisa Burke, LICSW, is a clinical social worker serving adults in Employee and Community Health (ECH) at the Baldwin Building. </em></p><img src=\"/-/media/ech-media/images/widgets/people/ech_friendship_widget.jpg?h=65&la=en&w=100&hash=19BA0035BED1987ED62DA0D9B1EAB69B\" alt=\"ECH_friendship_widget\" width=\"100\" height=\"65\" DisableNVelocity=\"true\" />Friendships can reap health benefits throughout our lives.

He describes Sharon as having a one-of-a-kind personality, and he recalls her Mayo Clinic team of surgeons and specialists giving her the nickname \"Tough Cookie.\"</p> <p>Sharon was born with congenital heart defects. In June 1956, she made history by being one of 15 patients to receive a new lifesaving surgery made possible with the invention of the heart-lung bypass machine at Mayo Clinic. She also was the first woman to give birth successfully after having that surgery. </p> <p>Fifty-eight years after Sharon's heart surgery, she was due for a heart valve replacement. The surgery was deemed a success. But one hour later, Sharon's life was in peril as she endured a 33-minute Code Blue (medical emergency). A 75-day recovery followed. </p> <p>Sharon had to learn how to breathe and walk again with the help of her loving family and the dedicated staff at Mayo Clinic. Her determination and Tough Cookie attitude allowed her to welcome her four great-grandchildren into the world over the next five years. </p> <p>The ordeal had taken a toll on Sharon's lungs, however.

INR self-testing has been shown to provide effective control of warfarin anticoagulation. Patients also tend to have the lowest risk of either bleeding or clotting episodes. </p> <p>Patients appropriate for this program are required to be on warfarin therapy for an indefinite period of time, such as for a mechanical heart valve, chronic atrial fibrillation or recurrent venous thromboembolism. They also should:</p> <ul> <li>Be on warfarin for at least 30 days and show consistent anticoagulation control. </li> <li>Be able and willing to learn to perform the finger-stick test, which is a straightforward technique similar to that of glucose testing. Caregivers are welcome to learn, too. </li> <li>Demonstrate a consistent pattern of communicating with their health care team about their warfarin therapy. </li> </ul> <p>Once patients are enrolled in the program, they will:</p> <ul> <li>Visit with the anticoagulation nursing staff to establish the frequency of testing and reporting. </li> <li>Obtain the meter, supplies and training through the Mayo Clinic Store on the 17th floor of the Gonda Building at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. </li> <li>Test their INR weekly and report the results to the Anticoagulation Clinic every month, or earlier if a result is out of range. </li> </ul> <p>In-home monitoring is available for patients who have commercial insurance, Medicare or other government-sponsored insurance. The actual amount will depend on the individual's insurance. The specifics of the plan, deductible and copay amounts all vary. It will be the patient's responsibility to contact his or her insurance carrier to know the exact amount of out-of-pocket cost.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonHome INR Testing 032221Primary Care in biting a hangnail, twisting your hair \u2014 these are all common things people do when stressed or bored. They also can be nervous habits or ways to get rid of bodily imperfections. </p> <p>Most of the time, these behaviors are infrequent, temporary and do not cause physical damage. However, for some people, skin picking, nail biting and hair pulling can become such a problem that they struggle to control these behaviors to the point where wounds do not heal, nails become ripped and bleed, and bald patches appear on the scalp. </p> <p><strong>What's in a name?</strong></p> <p>Body-focused repetitive behaviors involve any self-grooming behavior that damages the body. The most common body-focused repetitive behaviors are skin picking, nail biting and hair pulling. These behaviors also go by a variety of names \u2014trichotillomania, dermatillomania, factitial dermatitis, excoriation disease, neurotic disorder, impulse control disorder and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, just to name a few. </p> <p><strong>How common are these behaviors?</strong></p> <p>Up to 60% of the population may experience times in their life when they may get caught up in cycles of picking, biting and pulling behaviors. Approximately 1%-5% of people suffer with body-focused repetitive behaviors, which are recurring patterns of behavior that can be difficult to control. These behaviors often result in significant distress and may lead to serious health consequences. </p> <p>Body-focused repetitive behaviors usually start in late childhood through the teenage years, and these behaviors can become a chronic, lifelong problem if left untreated. These behaviors are equally common among girls and boys in childhood, but they become much more frequent in females than males into adulthood. Body-focused repetitive behaviors also can occur, along with anxiety and mood disorders. </p> <p><strong>Types of body-focused repetitive behaviors</strong></p> <p>Body-focused repetitive behaviors <ul> <li><strong>Impulsive</strong></li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The impulsive type tends to be automatic, with picking, biting or pulling often happening outside of one's awareness. It happens in a wide variety of situations, tends to be frequent and brief, and often comes out during times of boredom and stress, such as while watching TV, driving or working on the computer. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Compulsive</strong></li> </ul> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">The compulsive type tends to be deliberate and purposeful, such as getting in front of a mirror and looking for wiry hairs that need to be plucked out. These episodes also tend to happen in private settings, such as the bathroom or bedroom, and often occur during times of high stress. While compulsive behaviors happen less frequently, when they happen, they can last for much longer periods of time, increasing the likelihood of causing serious damage to skin, nails and hair. People who engage in compulsive repetitive behaviors also may use instruments, such as tweezers, clippers, pins and needles. Many people can have impulsive and compulsive features of their body-focused repetitive behaviors. </p> <p><strong>Treating body-focused repetitive behaviors with habit control therapy</strong></p> <p>Body-focused repetitive behaviors are treatable conditions, but they take work. The most-effective behavioral intervention is called habit reversal therapy, which essentially involves trying to learn and strengthen new habits to reduce and offset the body-focused repetitive behaviors. </p> <p>Habit reversal <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During this phase, people monitor where, when, how often and how long they engage in body-focused repetitive behaviors. They also may rate their emotions and physical sensations before, during and after these episodes. Then they start to learn to pay attention to how their hands move when engaging in these behaviors to serve as an \"early warning detection system.\" They also may place external reminders in high-risk environments, such as brightly-colored stickers on a computer monitor, to remind them to be more aware of their hands and the risk for engaging in body-focused repetitive behaviors. </p> <p>2. <strong>Competing response training </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During this stage, people learn and practice alternate behaviors that interfere with or disrupt the body-focused repetitive behavior. They may practice tensing and releasing muscles in their hands and fists, or fanning out their hands and fingers as a means of reducing tension. Some of the most-helpful competing responses involve fiddling with objects that have a unique texture, such as a nail file, pen or ridges on a coin. It is important to test out a variety of objects to find one that best holds their attention. The goal is to practice these competing habits several times per day in a wide variety of environments. </p> <p>3. <strong>Increasing habit strength </strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During this phase, people deliberately go into the high-risk body-focused repetitive behavior environments and routinely practice their competing responses. Engaging in their competing responses several times per day for several minutes each time will help increase the strength of these alternate habits while weakening the body-focused repetitive behavior habit. </p> <p>4. <strong>Overcorrection</strong></p> <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">During this stage, people continue to work on increasing the strength of their competing responses. Any time they notice engaging in a body-focused repetitive behavior, they try to stop as best they can, estimate how long they were engaging in the behavior, and then immediately start practicing their competing responses for twice as long. For example, if a person was picking at the skin for about three minutes, then that person would practice their competing responses for six minutes. Doing so increases the likelihood that the competing responses now become the new, dominant habit as they start to become associated with these high-risk body-focused repetitive behavior environments. </p> <p><strong>Additional tips</strong></p> <p> Body-focused repetitive behaviors can be difficult to treat, and these behaviors are often frustrating and embarrassing for the people who struggle with them. </p> <p>Additional ideas to help manage body-focused repetitive <p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">It is good to have support from family members who notice the body-focused repetitive behaviors. Rather than criticizing or routinely telling people to stop, it is useful to work out a game plan where family members can help people be more aware of their hands, such as \"Notice your hands,\" and encourage them to practice their competing responses. The compulsive type of body-focused repetitive behaviors can be private, so it can be helpful to ask a family member to check on people if they have been in their bathroom or bedroom for too long. </p> can be helpful to wear gloves, Band-Aids or hats to offset the likelihood of further damaging the body. However, these blocking behaviors tend to help only temporarily while working to increase the habit strength of their competing responses. </p> underlying or co-occurring mental health condition also can reduce problems and impairments associated with body-focused repetitive behaviors. Working with a therapist to learn cognitive behavioral therapy, or meeting with a primary care provider or psychiatrist for medication management can improve one's mood and overall functioning. In some cases, effectively treating an anxiety or mood disorder can result in \"self-correcting\" the body-focused repetitive behavior. Impulsive and compulsive body-focused repetitive behaviors place people at risk for chronic infections and further bodily damage. A referral to a healthcare specialist, such as a dermatologist, can help treat body-focused repetitive behaviors. Sometimes, underlying medical conditions that cause skin, nail and hair problems can be properly addressed, thereby reducing certain triggers for these behaviors. </p> <p> <strong> Getting help </strong></p> <p> Body-focused repetitive behaviors are treatable conditions. Talk with your primary care team about available treatment options. Gaining education on the nature and effective management of hair pulling, nail biting and skin picking is an important first step. <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.bfrb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors</a> is an excellent source that provides information, support and resources for these behaviors, including a locator to identify therapists who are trained in evidence-based, habit reversal therapy. clinical health psychology fellows in Primary clinical psychologist in Primary Care in Rochester and Kasson and co-chairs the Division of it takes work.

But as Mary Poppins says, \"In every task that must be done, there's an element of fun\". In this case, it's not only fun, but also a time for parents and kids to talk as they gather food groups and ingredients to build healthy lunches. </p> <p>The conversations can be about anything, but this is prime time to talk with your kids about making healthy food choices, while packing lunches they'll enjoy. (You can pack yours for work, too!)</p> <p>To get started on your family lunch-packing project:</p> you've got good lunch-carrying supplies on hand: a good-quality lunch box, water bottle, thermal beverage container, some cool packs, and reusable containers. Keep a variety of sizes of zipper food storage bags \u2014 both sandwich and snack size \u2014 to pack kid-sized portions from family-sized containers such as pretzels, dry cereal, dried fruits or nuts. </li> <li>Make a plan for lunches based on what you've got on hand, what leftovers could be re-imagined into sandwiches, salads or something hot for a chilly day, and what you need from the store. </li> <li>Have kids come shopping with you to pick out food they like \u2014 and maybe try new ones. Are they studying a particular country or doing a unit on health? These can help you work in new options such as a food from that country or from something they're learning. But there's no shortage of familiar ones to choose from: ready-to-pack cut fruits and veggies, dried fruits and unsalted nuts, pre-portioned cheese and single-serve yogurts, hummus and cracker cups, and tuna and chicken pouches. </li> <li>Clear a work place on the kitchen counter or table and gather your ingredients. </li> </ul> <p>As you assemble the lunches, try these talk topics:</p> <ul> <li>Why are these good choices. Food is fuel, it powers their bodies \u2014 both brains AND muscles \u2014 throughout the day and helps their school and sports performance. </li> <li>Food likes and dislikes, and why. Is it taste, texture, color or just too \"yucky\". Why do they like what they like? </li> <li>How to build a healthy lunch. One typically contains three to five of the food groups \u2014 fruits, vegetables, protein, grains and dairy. A granola bar and grapes might be a good start for a packed lunch \u2014 grain and fruit \u2014 but what needs to be added to make the lunch more complete? </li> <li>What do other kids bring in their lunches. Is there something they'd like to try? </li> </ul> <p>But don't forget the fun: </p> <ul> <li>Once sandwiches are made, let your child use cookie cutters to create fun, bite-size portions. </li> <li>Use a crinkle cutter to cut fruits and veggies with zigzag edges. </li> <li>As a random surprise, tuck a cheerful note, fun sticker, comic strip or fortune cookie into their lunch box. </li> </ul> <p><em>Michaeleen Burroughs, MS, RDN, LD, has worked in Employee and Community Health (ECH) in Family Medicine for 20 years.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonWater Is Good For YouPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Libby Curry, D.O.Acne problem that often shows up during teenage years and can persist into adulthood. It can be confusing to determine what products to use because so many are available in the drugstore. </p> <p><strong>What causes acne?</strong></p> <p>Acne is caused by the body's inflammatory reaction to bacteria within the oil gland around a hair follicle. </p> <p><strong>How can you treat acne at home?</strong></p> <p>General principles for home treatment of acne include:</p> <ul> <li>Be persistent. It can take two to three months to see the effects of treatment. </li> <li>Don't touch your face. Avoid scarring by not picking or popping acne lesions. </li> <li>More is not always better. Washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser is enough. You don't need to scrub your face. Using a nickel-size amount of product should cover your whole face. </li> <li>Start slow. Many treatments for acne can cause dryness, redness or irritation. Start by applying products every other day. If you tolerate the products, then consider increasing to daily use. </li> <li>Keep things that touch your face clean. Disinfect phones and wash masks regularly. </li> </ul> <p>Here are some things to remember: </p> <ul> <li>Don't touch your face, and use a gentle face wash, such as Cetaphil, Vanicream, Purpose or Dove Sensitive Skin twice daily. </li> <li>Make sure you use makeup and products with \"noncomedogenic\" on the packaging. This means it won't clog pores. </li> <li>Try a product with benzoyl peroxide \u2014 a mainstay of acne treatment. Luckily, you'll find plenty of over-the-counter products with this active ingredient in any drugstore, including washes, lotions or spot treatment. Spot treatments are often stronger and have higher percentages of benzoyl peroxide but remember more is not always better. A lotion containing a lower percent \u2014 less than 5% \u2014 covering the whole face once daily after morning cleansing is a good starting point, or every other day initially to reduce irritation. Another option would be to use a face wash containing benzoyl peroxide once daily in the morning and a gentle cleanser in the evening. Starting with a lower percentage of benzoyl peroxide will reduce the likelihood of dryness, redness and irritation. Remember that products containing benzoyl peroxide can bleach clothes, towels and pillowcases. </li> </ul> <p><strong>When should you see your health care provider for acne?</strong></p> <p>If you have significant acne, it is causing scarring, or it is causing emotional distress, see your health care provider so he or she can evaluate it and help you develop a treatment plan. Remember there are many good treatments for acne, but if you have tried some over-the-counter products and they are not helping, your health care provider can help find alternative products for you. </p> <p><strong>Can you use over-the-counter treatments when you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant? </strong></p> <p>Do not use over-the-counter products. If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, discuss your acne with your health care provider. Treatments are available, but they require a prescription. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/elizabeth-curry-do/\">Libby Curry, D.O.</a>, is a Senior Associate Consultant and Instructor in the Department of Family Medicine.

Primary Care in Rochester and KassonBreast Milk Depot AnniversaryPrimary Care in Rochester and Kasson - Katy Maeder, Donor ServicesBlood Donation: Living just 15 years old, doctors discovered her brain was herniated at the base of her skull, which caused a large cyst in her spinal cord. By age 18, she had been diagnosed with another four conditions and had already undergone 12 brain and spine surgeries. This was the start of Joanna's long medical journey \u2014 one that is still ongoing today at the age of 33. </p> <p>But despite her 63 surgeries, over 100 blood transfusions, and more than 10 rare medical conditions \u2014 Joanna remains optimistic and grateful for life. </p> <p>While each of Joanna's conditions has a different set of symptoms, they all affect each other, causing each one to behave differently than it would on its own. Her physicians describe it as the perfect storm \u2014 you can never treat just one condition, and you have to factor in how the other conditions will react before deciding on treatment. </p> <p>One of Joanna's conditions is a buildup of excess cerebrospinal fluid in her brain. For years, she has had a shunt, which is a medical device implanted in her brain to relieve pressure by diverting the excess fluid into her heart. Shunts generally last anywhere from several years to a lifetime, but Joanna's shunt required replacement every three to six months, and each brain surgery to replace it got increasingly difficult and dangerous. In the spring of 2012, Joanna's care team in Atlanta contacted Mayo Clinic for help determining why her shunt was failing much more than normal. </p> <p><strong>Finding an answer</strong></p> <p>Joanna's first trip to Mayo in April 2012 included testing and consultations with nine different departments. She finally received an answer after a visit to the Hematology Department. After many tests, she was diagnosed with an autoimmune blood-clotting disorder that was causing tiny blood clots to form around the tip of her shunt, which stopped it from being able to drain properly and led to failure. </p> <p>No one had ever seen this condition cause this complication before, but her team at Mayo decided to begin treatment in hopes it would help. There is no cure for Joanna's condition, but it can be treated with blood thinners that make it hard for the body to develop blood clots. She has been giving herself anticoagulant injections every day since her diagnosis. </p> <p>Facing emergency brain surgery every few months, Joanna found it difficult to live day-to-day and plan for the future. However, the diagnosis she received at Mayo Clinic saved and changed her life. Her shunt has continued working since she began treatments; this is the longest she's every gone without needing brain surgery to replace it. </p> <p><strong>Accident deals her a setback</strong></p> <p>Joanna had a couple stable and wonderful years following that diagnosis, despite the chronic conditions that she continued to manage. That changed suddenly in 2015 when she was hit by a large delivery truck. This accident resulted in injuries that required emergency brain surgery and a shoulder injury that left her with almost no use of her right arm. </p> <p>Joanna returned to Mayo earlier this year and underwent a major surgery for her shoulder with the Orthopedic Department, which included a triple-tendon transfer and a scapuloplexy. She spent the four months following the operation immobilized in an upper-body brace, but she is happy to report that she now has more use of her right arm than she has had since the accident. </p> <p>While Joanna recovers from her surgeries and lives with many chronic symptoms, she remains positive and optimistic about life. She is thankful for her wonderful support system and the dedicated support of her health care team. </p> <p>\"I am especially grateful for the innovative and advanced diagnosis that I have received, along with Mayo Clinic's expertise in treating rare and complicated conditions. I don't believe I would still be here without the help of Mayo Clinic,\" she says. </p> <p>Joanna receives frequent blood transfusions, so she is able to spend more time and special occasions with her family. Because of this, her family members make a point to donate at the Mayo Clinic Blood Donor Center whenever they are in Rochester for her checkups or surgeries.

Platelets from your own blood are isolated and concentrated into PRP and injected into damaged or inflamed regions to improve pain and function. PRP preparations can be individualized to meet your specific needs. The quality control program ensures that PRP preparations are consistent and high quality. </p> <p><strong>Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC):</strong> Your bone marrow contains a variety of potentially powerful therapeutic cells, including stem cells. These cells modulate inflammation, promote repair of damaged cells and tissues, and can stimulate tissue and cell growth. Bone marrow is taken from your pelvic bone, concentrated to remove unwanted portions, and injected into the injured area to reduce pain, improve function and promote healing. </p> <p>You may be a good candidate for a regenerative medicine procedure if you meet the following criteria: </p> <ul> <li>Have a specific musculoskeletal or orthopedic diagnosis (i.e. unspecified knee pain is not acceptable). </li> <li>No active cancer of any type. </li> <li>No history of cancer within the past five years, other than non-melanoma skin cancer. </li> <li>No history of any undiagnosed bone marrow disease. </li> <li>Must weigh less than 415 lbs. </li> <li>No chronic systemic infection. </li> <li>Acknowledge that procedures are not covered by insurance and are an out-of-pocket expense.

It can cause coughs, cold-like symptoms and fever, and lead to ear, sinus, eye and lung infections. Almost all children get infected at least once by two years of age. Most of us continue to get re-infections from RSV the rest of our lives. </p> <p><strong>What's the risk? </strong></p> <p>RSV infections occur most commonly in winter. In Minnesota, they start as early as November and run through April. RSV may be responsible for as many as 25% of wintertime deaths once blamed Prevention (CDC)</a> reports each year that RSV results in 2 million outpatient visits and 50,000 hospitalizations among U.S. children under five years of age. RSV causes nearly 180,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among U.S. adults 65 years and older. </p> <p><strong>How does RSV affect us?</strong> </p> <p>How RSV affects you depends on your age and whether you've had it before. </p> <ul> <li> In infants and young children, RSV causes a wheezy type of lung infection (bronchiolitis). Patients look and sound like they're having an asthma attack. Unlike asthma, infants with bronchiolitis don't respond to asthma medicines, such as albuterol and corticosteroids. </li> <li> Premature infants, as well as full-term infants with underlying health conditions, may need to go to the hospital due to RSV. There, doctors and nurses can support them with intravenous fluids and oxygen until they recover. </li> <li> RSV is particularly bad for older adults and those whose immune systems are weakened by medicines or disease. </li> </ul> <p>No matter the age, during this COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory illnesses may require testing to rule out COVID-19 infections. If we do not test, we may let individuals with COVID-19 go undetected and unknown. These individuals can spread the infection to others in their household and community. </p> <p><strong>Is there a vaccine against RSV?</strong> </p> <p>We don't have a vaccine to prevent RSV. We do have a treatment that gives temporary immunity. Palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae) is given as an intramuscular injection once a month. High-risk babies get palivizumab from November through March. The treatment reduces the risk of hospitalization from RSV, but it hasn't been shown to prevent deaths. </p> <p><strong>What can we do to prevent RSV infection?</strong> </p> <p>There are some things you and your family can do: </p> <ul> <li> Avoid exposure to tobacco and other smoke. </li> <li> If possible, keep infants at high risk from daycare during the RSV season. </li> <li> settings. </li> </ul> <p> Masking, handwashing, social distancing, and avoiding crowds will reduce your exposure to RSV as it will COVID-19. If you're ill with what seems like RSV, stay home until your fever is gone for 24 hours, cover your cough (into the inside of your elbow) and wash your hands. Most people are infectious for three to eight days; infants can be infectious for a month. Furthermore, now during the pandemic, consider getting tested for COVID-19. </p> <p><strong>Who should get tested for COVID-19?</strong> </p> <ul> <li> People who have symptoms of COVID-19 such as the cough or fever that RSV can cause. Not everyone needs testing but call your care team or use the <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" need testing. </li> <li> People who have had close contact (within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes) with someone with confirmed COVID-19. </li> <li> People who have been asked or referred to get testing by their healthcare provider, local public health official, or state health department. </li> </ul> <p> If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional. </p> <p><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/robert-jacobson-md\"><em>Dr. Robert M.

But you don't have to be famous \u2014 anyone can contract this \"silent\" eye disease, which typically has no symptoms until damage has been done. So take a moment to test your glaucoma IQ. </p> <p><strong>Q: What is glaucoma?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Glaucoma is a disease that is caused by increased pressure in the eye, leading to nerve damage and blindness. </p> <p><strong>Q: Why is it important to recognize glaucoma early?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The effects of glaucoma can be so gradual that you may not notice a change in your vision until the condition is at an advanced, irreversible stage. If glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. </p> <p><strong>Q: What are the types of glaucoma?</strong></p> two main types: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Angle-closure glaucoma.</strong> This can come on suddenly and is caused by a rapid rise in eye pressure due to poor drainage. </li> <li><strong>Open-angle glaucoma.</strong> This is the most common type of the disease. Pressure build up is gradual and so is loss of vision.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Q: Who is at risk for glaucoma?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Glaucoma occurs mostly in people age 60 or older. African-Americans are at higher risk, while angle-closure glaucoma is more common in Asians. A family history of glaucoma also is a risk. In addition, certain medical conditions, including hypertension, sleep apnea and long-term corticosteroid use can put you at risk. </p> <p><strong>Q: What are the symptoms of glaucoma? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The most common symptoms are vision loss, needing more light for reading or tasks, eye pain, seeing haloes or rainbows around lights or redness in your eye. You also may experience narrowing of vision or tunnel vision, difficulty distinguishing boundaries and colors, headaches, nausea and vomiting. </p> <p><strong>Q: When should I see a doctor?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> If you experience sudden or rapidly changing vision, in addition to severe headache, severe eye pain, nausea or vomiting, you should seek care immediately. </p> <p><strong>Q: Is there a test for glaucoma?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> If you are having any symptoms of glaucoma, ask your primary care provider to do an eye (funduscopic) exam and test your field of vision. If needed, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist for more detailed testing. This includes a tonometry test that measures the pressure in the eyes. If you think you are at risk, you should address your concerns with your primary care provider. Glaucoma screening frequently is done when getting your vision checked. </p> <p><strong>Q: How is glaucoma treated?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Several treatments are on the type of glaucoma: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Closed-angle glaucoma.</strong> Urgent treatment is required, which can include IV medications and/or laser surgery. This treatment often is done also in the unaffected eye as a preventive measure. </li> <li><strong>Open-angle glaucoma.</strong> The most-common treatment is eye drops. Sometimes pills are prescribed to lower the pressure inside the eye. </li> </ul> <p>If these more conservative treatments aren't effective or the glaucoma is more severe, there are surgical options. These include laser therapy to open blocked channels and fluid drainage through minimally invasive surgeries. </p> <p><strong>Q: Is there anything new in glaucoma treatment?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> There's been improvement in laser and minimally invasive surgery techniques. In addition, new topical medications have been approved. </p> <p><strong>Q: Can glaucoma be cured?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured and damage caused by the disease cannot be reversed. It's a chronic disease best managed by early detection and regular assessment, in addition to the treatments described above. Treatment for glaucoma is generally lifelong. </p> <p>Angle-closure glaucoma is an opthalmologic emergency. Treatment depends on the cause, such as pupillary block, blockage by a tumor and hyperopia. Getting immediate care to relieve the high pressure can lead to better results. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://communityhealth.mayoclinic.org/providers/bernard-aoun-md/\">Dr. Bernard Aoun</a> practices in Primary Care in Rochester's Department of Community Internal Medicine (CIM) at Mayo Family Clinic Northwest and Senior Services.
