We combine the best in traditional chiropractic care with innovative wellness solutions that help you achieve total health. I am committed to not only promoting the amazing benefits of chiropractic but also educating people about light therapy and other forms of natural healing. Dr Harvey and Dr Kasper are b both EXCELLENT Chiropractors because they CARE. My mom was a point where her Dr wanted her to see a surgeon for her back pain. Dr Harvey has taken his time to listen and get my mom on the road back to a pain free life. He takes him time to explain what he is doing and why. He has worked with her fears and he also worked with her to form a long term plan. I highly recommend Back in Motion Chiropractic myself AND on behalf of my Mom. As a business owner in Downtown Shawnee I am so proud to have them in our community! They are an asset to our city! You guys are awesome didn't do a hole lot but i got relaxed and some relief finally went home and slept till 7p that's the most sleep I've had in a while thank you. I have finally found my \"forever\" chiropractor & I'm so excited!!! Never been to one before they are the best. Makes you feel so comfortable when going to them. Dr Kaspar, aka Magic Hands, is the best! I can go into her clinic hardly able to move and walk out feeling wonderful. Recently, I fell and injured my ankle so badly that I couldn't put any weight on it. After 3 laser treatments, I was walking normally. This is a place filled with love and healing. I have only good things to say about her and her staff. They just want you to be well!!! I have been a patient at this practice for over 10 years. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Dr. Kaspar is professional, competent, and compassionate. She does immense research in order to provide her clients with state of the art care. I have nothing but respect for her and the staff and I trust them completely. Dr. Kaspar is awesome!! My son has Down Syndrome and was having problems with gout. After a few laser treatments with Dr. Kaspar he was walking great again and back to normal. She was exceptional with him and made him so comfortable during his visits. I would HIGHLY recommend her! Unlike most medical offices Back in Motion wants to truly help people out and fix the issue causing the pain on a long term even, permanent basis, not just help it disappear for a few weeks or months. I think it is awesome that they lay the cost out in front of you and give you payment options that will work for you. Their main priority is your health and well being. They have huge hearts and are willing to help anyone and everyone they can. They do everything they can to avoid surgery and unnecessary pain medications. They have changed the lives of many people. They have personally changed my life. After a major car accident in June of 2015 and headaches everyday, I started treatment in Oct 2015. I have been headache free for 7 months. I can not tell you the last time I took Tylenol or Advil. I'm beyond thankful for Dr. Kaspar and Dr. Harvey. Just keep in mind if you want an old fashion rack em crack, 5 minutes with the dr., and a dr. who doesn't remember your name much less your families...this isn't the place for you. Where do I start, since moving down here in 2006 I was in dire need of a chiropractor and was recommended Energy In Motion. What a God send!!! Dr. Kasper is the most amazing, intelligent women I have ever met. She has seen me through on a pinched nerve, low back pain and recently hip and groin pain. Sounds like I'm falling apart but she pulls me through every single time. An angle I would call her, my savior!!!! I've been to several chiropractic offices in my lifetime and this is by far the best one. Doctors Harvey and Kaspar are very thorough...this is not your run of the mill rack and crack shop. Before any manipulation is performed they will take the time to identify the cause of the problem which does include X-rays. Unlike the previous poster, I view this as an extremely positive thing. I mean, doesn't it make sense for any doctor to have all the facts before doling out treatment? How else would they know what problems lie beneath the skin? With regard to cost it's true that it can be a little expensive IN THE BEGINNING. Total improvement doesn't happen overnight and frequent visits are required long-term change. In order to maximize the benefits of your care, you as a patient must be willing to commit yourself to the initial program just to get your body right, then continue indefinitely with regular \"maintenance visits.\" Prior to treating with Dr. Harvey I was experiencing lower back pain almost constantly, including sciatic nerve pain for years. A year and a half later I live pain free except for occasional flare ups which are always self induced (usually by lifting heavy objects or sports injuries). Going in for the initial consultation was one of the best decisions I've ever made and has been life changing. All that being said, I give Back in Motion my highest recommendation and encourage anybody in need of a doctor who cares to stop in. Amazing place! The staff is great and the office is very comfortable. They have worked on me for years now and have really helped my lower back and hip pain. I highly recommended. I would give them 6 stars if I could. Nice environment, workers are friendly, appointments rarely run late and my posture has improved. Absolutely the best chiropractic clinic I've ever been too! I used to have the worst migraines and lived on ibuprofen but since I started treatment I haven't had a single one and I'm off ibuprofen. Couldn't be happier! I highly recommend Back in Motion Chiropractic. I want to share my experience because I feel very grateful for the treatment I have received by both Dr. Kaspar and Dr. Harvey. 2 years ago I was in a bad car accident and have seen many chiropractors that just seemed to rush me in, crack, and rush me out with no long term relief from my pain. 6 months ago I walked into their office and could hardly see straight from headaches. Since then my pain has gone away and my quality of life has increased- I sleep better and feel better all day because of the treatment received at Back in Motion Chiropractic. When you walk in their door they care about you and have a commitment to their patients everyday to make them feel their best. Could not say enough good things about both Dr. Harvey and Kaspar! They are absolutely fantastic!!! They will find your pain and treat it. Best chiropractor I have ever been to. They are both great doctors. Friendly and knowledgeable. If you want a truly personal experience from doctors who actually care about ALL aspects of your life then you have to come here!!! Dr. Harvey & Dr. Kaspar are not just chiropractors...they are wonderful people who truly care about their patients. Both the doctors and staff are very professional and attentive. I have never walked in the office without a \"Hi!\" \"Good Morning!\" and they always address you by name. I was in a bad way from an old neck/head injury and I am making such progress with the help of these wonderful doctors! I do their laser treatments twice a week and I have had such a significant reduction in my headaches. It's unbelievable! I highly HIGHLY recommend Back in Motion to anyone and everyone...babies, children, adults, and the elderly. EVERYONE can benefit! Great chiropractors! Their practice is professional, courteous and very friendly. They are prompt, attentive and wonderful to work with. They make you feel like family. There are a lot of chiropractors closer to my home and office, but I happily travel the extra distance because of the great experience and the results I get. I highly recommend them! I stumbled into this quaint business a little less than a year ago. I am so happy that I did. I was quickly greeted by Dr. Kile Kaspar with a great smile and energetic enthusiasm. I immediately asked questions about what they did and she responded with, We are a full service chiropractic office. They are not the run of the mill chiropractor. They take the time to heal you for life rather than a quick rack and crack like other chiropractic offices. Both Dr. Kile and Scott take their time to educate and treat your individual symptoms from head to toe. They use innovative technology along with traditional chiropractic work to heal you. Both Dr.s treat you as family and take their time to make sure when you leave you are feeling and moving better than when you entered. They have worked miracles on my back and knee that no other chiropractic offices have been able to do. I highly recommend Back in Motion and both doctors Kile Kaspar and Scott Harvey . Once you enter you will return over and over again. You will be in good hands, literally. Cannot say enough good things about this practice. My wife and I have been seeing Kyle for over a year, and she is amazing! You can tell that she truly cares about getting you better. "}
