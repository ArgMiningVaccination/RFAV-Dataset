If an employer's benefit Plan is subject to ERISA, each time you request Services that must be ap proved before the Service is provided, you are filing a \"pre -service claim\" for benefits. You are filing a \"post -service claim \" when you ask us to pay for or cover Services that have already been received. You must follow our procedure for filing claims, a nd we must follow certain rules established by ERISA for responding to claims. General Information This Added Choice\u00ae Deductible Plan lets you choose to receive covered Services from Select Providers, PPO Providers, or Non -Participating Providers . You may also choose different providers for different covered Services. The Services we cover, and the amounts you pay for covered Services, will differ depending on the provider you choose .

Non-Participating Providers When you receive covered Services from Non -Participating Providers, your Cost Share will typically be higher than when you receive covered Services from Select Providers or PPO Providers. See your \"Benefit Summary\" for your Cost Share when you receive covered Services from a Non -Participating Provider. We pay for covered Services from Non -Participating Providers up to the Allowed Amount.

SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 10 OM-ALTC -VX You are responsible for assuring your Non -Participating Provider has obtained necessary pr ior authorization. You may be required to pay the full amount for the Services you receive and submit a claim form to us for reimbursement.

Except for Emergency Services and Urgent Care, we do not cover Services you receive from Non -Participating Providers outside the United States. We will not directly or indirectly prohibit you from freely contracting at any time to obtain non -covered Services. However, if you choose to receive non -covered Services, you will be responsible for the full price of the Services. Company is not responsible for any amounts you are billed for non -covered Services. Any amounts you pay for non -covered Services will not count toward your Deductible or Out -of-Pocket Maximum. Using Your Identification Card We provide each Member with a Company identification (ID) card that contains the Member health record number. Have your health record number available when you call for advice, make an appointment, or seek Services. We use your health record number to identify your medical records, for billing purposes, and for membership information. You should always have the same health record number. If we ever inadvertently issue you more than one health record number, please let us know by calling Member Services . If you need to replace your ID card, please call Member Serv ices.

Your PPO Provider's or Non -Participating Provider's office may have advice personnel to assist you. To learn more, check with their office. Your Primary Care Provider We recommend each Member choose a Select Provider or a PPO Provider as their primary care provider. A primary care provider is a provider specializing in family practice, general practice, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Members may choose a Select Provider or a PPO Provider specializing in obstetrics or gynecology; or a nurse practitioner, a certified nurse midwife, or a physician assistant specializing in women's health care as their primary care provider. One primary care provider may be selected for an e ntire family, or a different primary care provider may be selected for each family member. This decision is important since the primary care provider can provide most of your health care and, when necessary, arrange for your health care with other provider s. You have a right to designate any primary care provider who participates in this Plan and who is available to accept you. For children, you may select a pediatrician as the primary care provider. SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 11 OM-ALTC -VX Not all Select Providers or PPO Providers with the specia lties listed above are designated primary care providers.

SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 13 OM-ALTC -VX When Referrals are Required Referrals to Select Providers In most case s, you will need a referral from a Select Provider to see a Specialist the first time . In some cases, a standing referral is allowed to a Specialist for a time period that is in accord with your individual medical needs as determined by the Select Provider and Company. Some outpatient specialty care is available from Select Providers without a referral. You do not need a referral for outpatient Services provided in the following departments at medical offices owned and operated by Kaiser Permanente. Please call Member Services to schedule routine appointments in these departments: Audiology (routine hearing exams). Cancer Counseling. Chemical Dependency Services. Mental Health Services. Obstetrics/Gynecology. Occupational Health. Optometry (routine eye exams). Social Services. Referrals to PPO Providers and Non-Participating Providers You do not need a referral to obtain Services from PPO Providers or Non-Participating Providers. However, you should contact the provider's office to see if they have any r equirements before you make your appointment. For example, some specialist providers may want you to see your primary care provider first, or the specialist provider may ask you to obtain a referral, order, or plan of care from your primary care provider before the specialist provider's office will make your appointment. Even if you need a referral, it is important to remember that when you obtain covered Services from a PPO Provider or a Non -Participating Provider , your benefit and Cost Share is based on w ho provides the Services , not on who makes the referral. If a PPO Provider p rovides the Services, your PPO Provider benefit applies. If a Non-Participating Provider provides the Services , your Non-Participating Provider benefit applies. Some Services requi re prior authorization in order to be covered, as described in the \"Prior Authorization Review Requirements\" section below. Prior Authorization Review Requirements Some covered Services require prior authorization by Company at least 72 hours in advance. The Services that require prior authorization are described under \"Services Subject to Prior Authorization Review\" in this \"How to Obtain Services\" section.

Except in the case of misrepresentation, prior authorization determinations that relate to your membership eligibility are binding on us if obtained no more than five business days before you receive the Service. Prior authorization determinations that relate to whether the Service is Medically Necessary or are covered under this Plan are binding on us if obtained no more than 60 days before you receive the Service. We may revoke or amend a prior authorization for Services you have not yet received if your member ship terminates, if your coverage changes, or you lose your eligibility.

Drugs on the formulary have been approved b y the FDA . The Kaiser Permanente Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee is made up of Select Physicians, other Select Providers, and administrative staff. The committee chooses drugs for the formulary based on several factors, including safety and e ffectiveness as determined from a review of the scientific literature. They may not approve a drug if there is not enough scientific evidence that it is clinically effective. They may also exclude a drug if it does not have a clinical or cost advantage ove r comparable formulary drugs. The Regional Formulary and Therapeutics Committee meets to review new drugs and reconsider drugs currently on the market. After this review, they may add drugs to the formulary or remove drugs from it. If a drug is removed from the formulary, you will need to switch to another comparable drug that is on the drug formulary, unless your old drug meets exception criteria. Refer to the \"Drug Formulary Exception Process\" in this \"Outpatient Prescription Drugs and Supp lies\" section for more information. If a formulary change affects a prescription drug you are taking, we encourage you to discuss any questions or concerns with your prescribing provider or another member of your health care team.

SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 57 OM-ALTC -VX REDUCTIONS Coordination of Benefits The Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under more than one Plan. Plan is defined below. The o rder of benefit determination rules govern s the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits. The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benefits in accordance with its policy terms without regard to the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan . The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense. Definitions A. A Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts o f the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts . (1) Plan includes: group and individual health insurance contracts, health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts, group or individual closed panel Plans , other forms of group or group -type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); medical care components of group long -term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; Medicare or any other federal governmental Plan, as permitted by law ; and group and individual insurance contracts and subscri ber contracts that pay or reimburse for the cost of dental care . (2) Plan does not include: independent, non -coordinated hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage; accident only coverage; specified disease or specified accident coverage; sc hool accident type coverage; benefits for non -medical components of group long -term care policies; Medicare supplement policies; Medicaid policies; or coverage under other federal governmental Plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage under (1) or (2) is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan . B. This Plan means, in a COB provision, the part of the contract providing the health care benef its to which the COB provision applies and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other Plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, su ch as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benefits . C. The order of benefit determination rules determine s whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when the person has health care coverage under more than one Plan . When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benefits first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable expense . D. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including deductibles, coinsurance and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering the person. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of Services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Pla n covering the person is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging a covered person is not an Allowable expense . The following are examples of expense s that are not Allowable expenses : SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 58 OM-ALTC -VX (1) The difference between the cost of a semi -private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses . (2) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that compute their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement am ount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable expense . (3) If a person is covered by two or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expens e. (4) If a person is covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement methodology or other similar reimbursement methodology and another Plan that provides its b enefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement shall be the Allowable expense for all Plans. However, if the provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negot iated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment shall be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits . (5) The am ount of any benefit reduction by the Primary Plan because a covered person has failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertification of admission s, and preferred provider arrangements . E. Closed panel Plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits to covered persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that have contracted with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member . F. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the c hild resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation . Order of Benefit Determination Rules When a person is covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are as follows : A. The Prim ary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of under any other Plan. B. (1) Except as provided in Paragraph (2), a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benefits provision that is cons istent with this regulation is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. (2) Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefit s and provides that this supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical ben efits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel Plan to provide out-of-network benefits. C. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is seco ndary to that other Plan . D. Each Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply : SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 59 OM-ALTC -VX (1) Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers the person other than as a dependent, for example as an employee, member, subs criber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covers the person as a dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering the person as a dep endent; and primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. a retired employee); then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan is the Primary plan . (2) Dependent child covered under more than one Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows : (a) For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: (i) The Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan; or (ii) If both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan . (b) For a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married : (i) If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree ; (ii) If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall determine the order of benefits ; (iii) If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) above shall d etermine the order of benefits; or (iv) If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows : 1. The Plan covering the Custodial parent ; 2. The Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent ; 3. The Plan covering the non -custodial parent ; and then 4. The Plan covering the spouse of the non -custodial parent . (c) For a dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of subparagraph (a) or (b) above shall determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child . (d) For a dependent child: (i) Who has coverage under either or both parents' plans and also has coverage as a dependent under a spouse's plan, the rule in paragraph (5) applies. (ii) In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' plans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule in subparagraph (a) to the dependent child's parent and the dependent's spouse. SAMPLE EOSG3TPOSDED0122 60 OM-ALTC -VX (3) Active employee or retired or laid -off employee. The Plan that covers a person as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid -off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan covering that same person as a retired or laid -off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of an active emp loyee and that same person is a dependent of a retired or laid - off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1 ) can determine the order of benefits . (4) COBRA or state continuation coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law is covered under another Plan, the Plan cover ing the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if the rule labeled D(1) can determine the order of benefits . (5) Longer or shorter length of coverage. T he Plan that covered the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered the person the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan . (6) If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefit s, the Allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan . Effect on the Benefits of This Plan A. When This Plan is sec ondary, it may reduce its benefits so that the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans during a plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benefit s it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combin ed with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benefits paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. In addition, the Secondary Plan shall credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would h ave credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage . B. If a covered person is enrolled in two or more Closed panel Plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non -panel provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed panel Plan, COB shall not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel Plans . Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefit s payable under This P lan and other Plans. We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claimin g benefits. We need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under This Plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of Payment A payment made under another P lan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, we may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.
