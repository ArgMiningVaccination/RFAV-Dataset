DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 91-149-51 Oriental Fruit Fly; Removal of Quarantined Area AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: We are amending the Oriental fruit fly regulations by removing the quarantine on a portion of San Diego County, CA, and by removing the imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from that area. The regulations, including the quarantine of a portion of San Diego County, were established to prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly into noninfested areas of the United States. We have determined that the Oriental fruit fly has been eradicated from San Diego County and that the quarantine and restrictions are no longer necessary. DATES: Interim rule effective June 29, 1993. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before September 7, 1993. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 91- 149-5. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through, Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are encouraged to call ahead on (202) 690-2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Michael B. Stefan, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, PPQ APHIS, USDA, room 640, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436--8247. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background We established the Oriental fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.93 through 301.93-10; referred to below as the regulations) and quarantined a portion of San Diego County, CA, in a document effective on February 10, 1993, and published in the Federal Register on February 16, 1993 (58 FR 8517-8524, Docket No. 91-149-4). The regulations imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from the quarantined area to prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly into noninfested areas of the United States. The regulations also designated soil and a large number of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and berries as regulated articles. Based on insect trapping surveys c6nducted by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, we have determined that the Oriental fruit fly has been eradicated from the previously quarantined portion of San Diego County, CA. The last finding of Oriental fruit fly in this area was December 2, 1992. Since then, no evidence of Oriental fruit fly infestations has been found in this area. Based on Departmental experience, we have determined that sufficient time has passed without finding additional flies or other evidence of infestation to conclude that Oriental fruit fly infestations no longer exist in San Diego County, CA. Further, Oriental fruit fly infestations are not known to exist anywhere else in the continental United States. Therefore, we are removing San Diego County, CA, from the list of quarantined areas in \u00a7 301.93-3(c), and adding to \u00a7 301.93- 3(c) a statement that the Oriental fruit fly is not known to exist anywhere in the continental United States. Immediate Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, hasdetermined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted to remove an unnecessary regulatory burden on the public. A portion of San Diego County, CA, was quarantined due to the possibility that the Oriental fruit fly could be spread from this area to noninfested areas of the United States. Since this situation no longer exists, immediate action is necessary to remove the quarantine on San Diego County, CA, and to relieve the imposed restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from that area. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the Federal Register. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12291. This interim rule relieves restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from a portion of San Diego County, CA. There is very little commercial activity in the previously quarantined area that may be affected by 36590 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations this rule. The approximately 11 small entities that may be affected include 3 nurseries and 8 fruit vendors. These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State of California. Most of these small entities sold previously regulated articles primarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement. The sale of these articles will therefore remain unaffected by the regulatory provisions we are removing. Also, many of these entities sold other items in addition to the previously regulated articles so that the effect, if any, of this regulation on these entities will be minimal. The effect of this regulation on these entities that did move previously regulated articles interstate was minimized by the availability of various treatments specified in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, incorporated by reference in the regulations. The specified treatments, in most cases, allowed these small entities to move previously regulated articles interstate with very little additional cost. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1),Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the witchweed quarantine and regulations by adding sorghum to the list of regulated articles whose interstate movement is restricted to prevent the artificial spread of witchweed. In that interim rule, we also amended the list of suppressive areas under the witchweed quarantine and regulations by adding and deleting specified areas in 10 counties in North Carolina and 1 county in South Carolina. The Interim rule was necessary to prevent the artificial spread of witchweed into noninfested areas of the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1993.

We also amended \u00a7 301.80-2a, which lists generally infested and suppressive areas, by adding and deleting specified areas in 10 counties in North Carolina and 1 county in South Carolina to the list of suppressive areas. We added areas in two new counties, Harnett and Lenoir, in North Carolina. We also added areas in Craven, Cumberland, Greene, Pender, and Wayne Counties in North Carolina, and areas in Horry County in South Carolina. We removed areas in Columbus, Cumberland, Duplin, Greene, Pender, Pitt, and Wayne Counties in North Carolina. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before March 8, 1993. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12291.

No. 129 / Thursday, July 8. 1993 / Rules and Regulations 7 CFR Part 301 (Docket No. 93-066-1) Pink Bollworm Regulated Areas AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: We are amending the pink bollworm regulations by adding Missouri to the list of States quarantined because of pink bollworm and to the list of generally infested areas. This action is necessary to prevent the interstate movement of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. DATES: Interim rule effective July 8, 1993. Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before September 7, 1993. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 93- 066-1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are encouraged to call ahead on (202) 690- 2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William J. Grefenstette, Operations Officer, Domestic and Emergency Operations, PPQ, APHIS, USDA, room 643, Federal The bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), is one of the world's most destructive pests of cotton. This insect spread to the United States from Mexico in 1917, and now exists throughout most of the cotton- producing States west of the Mississippi River. The pink bollworm regulations contained in 7 CFR 301.52 et seq. (referred to below as the regulations) quarantine certain States and restrict the interstate movement of regulated articles from regulated areas in quarantined States for the purpose of preventing the spread of pink bollworm. Regulated areas for the pink bollworm are designated as either suppressive areas or generally infested areas.Restrictions are imposed on the interstate movement of regulated articles from both types of areas in order to prevent the movement of pink bollworm into noninfested areas. However, the management and containment of pink bollworm is undertaken as an objective only in places that are designated as suppressive areas. Prior to the effective date of this document, Missouri was not regulated because of pink bollworm. Surveys conducted by inspectors of the United States Department of Agriculture and by State agencies in Missouri have established that pink bollworm has spread into Dunklin County, Missouri. Section 301.52-2 of the regulations states that less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the State is enforcing a quarantine or regulations that impose restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under the Federal regulations. Currently, Missouri is not enforcing such a quarantine or such regulations. Therefore, in order to prevent the spread of pink bollworm, we are amending the list of regulated areas in \u00a7 301.52-2a of the regulations by designating Missouri as a pink bollworm generally infested area. We are also adding Missouri to the list of States in \u00a7 301.52(a) that are quarantined because of pink bollworm. Emergency Action The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to prevent the artificial spread of pink bollworm to noninfested areas of the United States. Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the Federal Register. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the Federal Register. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in- the Federal Register. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as result of the comments.Executive Order 12291 We are issuing this interim rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this interim rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumerg, individual industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12291. Regulatory Flexibility Act This emergency situation makes compliance with section 603 and timely compliance with section 604 of the, Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604) impracticable. This rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If we determine this is so, then we will discuss the issues raised by section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act in our Final Regulatory Impact Analysis. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with it; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this interim rule.

ACTION: Interim Rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's (FCIC) procedures for implementing the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 were published in 1989. Since that time, disaster assistance has been made available under several statutes, most of which make reference to, and incorporate the mandatory FCIC provisions of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988. This rule makes the FCIC regulations implementing the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 applicable to those provisions of subsequent Acts. DATES: Effective date July 8. 1993. COMMENT DATE: Comments may be submitted on or before September 7, 1993.ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to Mar L. Dunleavy, Acting Director, Regulatory and Procedural Development, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, 20250. Telephone (202) 254-8314. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mar L. Dunleavy, Telephone (202) 254- 8314. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Departmental Regulation 1512-1. This action does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of the regulations affected by this rule under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is May 1, 1994. Kathleen Connelly, Acting Manager, FCIC, has determined that this action is not a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291 because it will not result in: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) major increases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local governments, or a geographical region; or (c) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Kathleen Connelly also certifies that this action will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals, small businesses, and other persons. The action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, or on the farmers served by this totally voluntary crop insurance program because this action does not require significant actions on their part. This action imposes no additional burden on the insured farmer, does not require participation in the program, or increase what is currently paid to gain insurance protection. The reinsured company or sales and service contractor affected by this action perform less when purchase of insurance is mandated by various disaster acts. This rule only serves to reduce compensation to conform to the services required. The reduction is mandated by statute and allowed in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement and Agency Sales and Service Contract. Therefore, this action is determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. Section 207 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 (the \"ACT\") mandated the purchase of crop insurance coverage as a requirement of eligibility for certain disaster assistance benefits. A rule carrying out this directive was promulgated on June 7, 1989, and incorporated the applicable dates for implementation for the 1989 crop year. However, these dates are not relevant to the subsequant Disaster Acts or subsequent crop years. Since provisions for sign-up for disaster payments for the 1992 crop year have recently been extended by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) until May 7, it is imperative that the rule be promulgated prior to that date. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, an emergency situation exists and FCIC has determined that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. However, FCIC is soliciting comments for 60 days after the effective date of this rule and will consider the comments prior to the final issuance of the rule. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 400 Crop insurance, Disaster Assistance Act of 1988; Procedures for implementation. Interim Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby amends the General Administrative Regulations (7 CFR part 400) as follows: PART 400--AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 400 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1506, 1516. Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Subpart N-Disaster Assistance Act of 1988; Procedures for Implementation 2. Section 400.250 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7400.250 General statement The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, subsequent disaster acts and disaster provisions in subsequent acts and the Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.) have required that, subject to certain provisions in those enactments, procedures on a farm, in order to be eligible to receive benefits under the various provisions, would be required to purchase Federal crop insurance when the disaster for which benefits are being obtained are related to a peril which should be covered under the insurance policy. Most of these legislative provisions require that regulations be promulgated to provide for a reduction in the commissions paid to private insurance agents, brokers, or companies on contracts for crop insurance entered into under such disaster provisions. Said reductions must be sufficient to reflect that such insurance contracts principally involve only a servicing function to be performed by the agent, broker, or company. \u00a7400.251 [Amended] 3. Section 400.251(a) is amended by removing phrase, \"the provisions of the ACT\" and inserting in its place the phrase, \"various disaster acts and disaster provisions which require the purchase of crop insurance issued under the Federal Crop Insurance Act\". 4. Section 400.251(b) is amended by removing the year \"1989\" and by removing the phrase, \"the provisions of section 207 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, as set forth in subsections (c)(2) and (3) of said ACT\" and inserting in its place the phrase, \"the requirements of various disaster acts or provisions requiring the purchase of crop insurance issued under the Federal Crop Insurance Act\". \u00a7 400.252 [Amended] 5. Section 400.252 is amended by removing the words \"the ACT\" wherever they appear and inserting in their place the words, \"various disaster acts or disaster provisions\". 6. Section 400.252(a) is further amended by removing the year \"1988\" and by removing the year \"1989\" wherever it appears and inserting in its place the word \"next\". 7. Section 400(b) is further amended byremoving the phrase, \"crop year 1989\" and inserting in its place the phrase, \"the next crop year\" and by removing the phrase, \"3 percent (3%)\"and inserting in its place the phrase, \"11/2 percent\".

ACTION: Affirmation of interim rule as final rule. SUMMARY: We are affirming as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations to add certain restrictions concerning the importation into the United States of pork and pork products from Denmark. The imposition of additional import restrictions was a necessary response to conditions which make possible the commingling of swine vesicular disease- contaminated pork or pork products with disease-free pork and pork products in Denmark. The rule protects against the introduction in the United States of swine vesicular disease. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 9, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. John W.

SUMMARY: We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations by removing Denmark from the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists. Denmark was added to the list in September 1992 after the disease was diagnosed in a cow in that country. We removed Denmark from the list in January 1993 after epidemiological investigations revealed that the disease occurred in only one animal imported into Denmark from Great Britain, and that the animal and the herd into which it was imported had been destroyed. The effect of that action was to relieve certain prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of certain fresh, chilled, and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts from ruminants which had been in Denmark, without presenting a significant risk of introducing BSE into the United States.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are declaring France free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). There have been no outbreaks of FMD in France since 1981, and we have determined that rinderpest has not existed there since 1870. We are also adding France to a list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and FMD, are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. This revision removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from France, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation, from France, of milk and milk products from ruminants. France is not declared to be free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. Therefore, the importation from France of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine will continue to be restricted because of these diseases. Similarly, certain restrictions on the importation, from France, of ruminant meat and edible products from Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations ruminants will remain in effect because bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists in France. We are also adding France to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas is restricted. We are adding Spain to that list as well, in order to correct an earlier error. Finally, we are removing an outdated reference to the Panama Canal Zone, which no longer exists as a political entity. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 23, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Harvey A. Kryder, Chief Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, room 753, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-7885. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as \"the regulations\") restrict the importation into the United States of certain animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction of various diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine. On March 16, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 14174- 14177, Docket No. 92-196-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by adding France to the list in \u00a7 94.1(a)(2) of countries that are declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. In that document, we also proposed to add France to the list in \u00a7 94.11(a) of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and FMD, are subject to special restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. We further proposed to make several nonsubstantive editorial changes in the regulations. We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 60-day period ending on May 17, 1993. We received one comment by that date. The comment fully supported the proposed action. Since the proposed rule was published, two more countries have been added to the list in \u00a7 94.1(a)(2) of countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Spain was added by a final rule published in the Federal Register on February 25, 1993 (58 FR 11365-11367. Docket No. 92-147-2) and effective March 29, 1993, and The Netherlands was added by a final rule published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1993(58 FR 28343-28345, Docket No. 92- 154-2) and effective June 14, 1993. When Spain was declared free of rinderpest and FMD in the February 25. 1993, final rule mentioned above, it should have also been added to the list in \u00a7 94.1(d)(1) of countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist and that were declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990. However, we inadvertently neglected to add Spain to that list. Therefore, in this final rule we will correct that omission by adding Spain to the list in \u00a7 94.1(d)(1). Also in this final rule, we are removing an outdated reference to the Panama Canal Zone, which no longer exists as a political entity, from the list in \u00a7 94.1(a)(2) of countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Panama is considered to be free of rinderpest and FMD, so removing the former Canal Zone from the list will have no effect on the rinderpest and FMD status of any part of the country. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposed rule as a final rule, with the changes discussed in this document. Effective Date This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from France, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation, from France, of milk and milk products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure that APHIS personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change in the regulations. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be made effective 15 days after publication in the Federal Register. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or localgovernment agencies, or geographic regions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity. innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enter prises to compete with foreign-base enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12291. This rule adds France to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be-free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from France, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation, from France, of milk and milk products from ruminants. This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine from France because France is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD. Similarly, this action does not relieve certain restrictions on the importation, from France, of ruminant meat and edible products from ruminants because BSE exists in France. Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from France into the United States as a result of this rule. The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1991 was $951.6 million, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1991 was about $1.6 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from France during 1991. In fact, no cattle or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1991 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], \"Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,\" 1992). Clearly, Western Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring France free of rinderpest and FMD will have any effect on the existing trade patterns. In 1991, only 0.0002 percent of all beef and veal imported into the United States was imported from France (USDA, ERS, \"Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,\" 1992). Overall, France is a net importer of fresh, chilled, and frozen meat and meat extracts (Food and Agriculture Organization, \"Trade Yearbook,\" 1990). Given France's general excess demand for meat products and the small percentage of its meat exports that are36595 36596 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations sent to the United States, it is unlikely that declaring France free of rinderpest and FMD will significantly change existing patterns of trade. Therefore, any effect on domestic meat prices or supplies will be insignificant. As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from France into the United States as a result of this rule. The importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although the-importation of casein into. the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator. The eight APHIS-approved producers of casein in France provided approximately 7 percent of the casein imported into the United States from France in 1991 (USDA, ERS, \"Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,\" 1992). Declaring France free of rinderpest and FMD, thus removing the requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States from France because the restrictions that we are removing did not substantially impede imports. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB), and there are no new requirements.

[FR Doc. 93-16131 Filed 7-7-93; 8:45 am) BILLING CODE 3410-4-P DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93-AGL-61 Transition Area Alteration, Pontiac, IL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action alters the Pontiac, IL, transition area to accommodate a new VOR runway 24 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) to the New Pontiac Municipal Airport, Pontiac, IL. This action also reflects the new location of Pontiac Municipal Airport by updating the airport's geographic position. The intended affect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, September 16, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Douglas F. Powers, Air Traffic Division, System Management Branch, AGL-530, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (312) 694-7568. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On Wednesday, April 7, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter the existing Pontiac, IL, transition area (58 FR 18054). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Transition areas are published in Section 71.181 of FAA Order 7400.7A dated November 2, 1992, and effective November 27, 1992, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The transition area listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters the Pontiac, IL, transition area to accommodate a new VOR runway 24 SIAP to the now Pontiac Municipal Airport, Pontiac, IL. This proposal also reflects the new location of Pontiac Municipal Airport up updating the airport's geographic position. The development of a new SLAP requires that the FAA alter the designated airspace to ensure that the procedure will be contained within controlled airspace. The minimum descent altitude for this procedure may be established below the floor of the 700-foot controlled airspace. Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established- body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore--(1) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Transition areas. Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows:PART 71--[AMENDED] 1.

ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is temporarily expanding Security Zone D in New London Harbor at the Naval Underwater Warfare Center in New London, CT on July 9, 1993. This action is needed to protect the USS NEBRASKA (SSBN 739) against damage, sabotage or other subversive acts while the vessel is in New London for its commissioning. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation is effective from July 9, 1993 at 6 p.m. through July 10, 1993 at 1 p.m. unless terminated sooner by the Captain of the* Port. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant Commander D.D. Skewes, Chief of Port Operations, Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound at (203) 468- 4464.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of this notice are LCDR D.D. Skewes, project officer for Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound, and LCDR J. Stieb, project attorney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposedrulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. The Coast Guard did not receive from the sponsor the final details concerning the event's exact location and position, which are essential information for the purposes of expanding the security zone, until June 15, 1993. There was not sufficient time to publish a proposed rule in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the date of the event would be contrary to the public interest. Background and Purpose The event requiring this regulation is the launching of the USS NEBRASKA (SSBN 739) at the Naval Underwater Warfare Center on the Thames River in New London, CT. This zone is required to provide security for the USS NEBRASKA prior to and during its commissioning. Security Zone D, as presently published in 33 CFR 165.140(a)(4) will be temporarily expanded for this launching. Regulatory Evaluation These regulations are not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The event will last approximately 60 minutes. Because of the short duration of the event and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities will be able to adjust to any disruptions. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This security zone does not close the harbor to commercial traffic. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \"Small entities\" include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify36597 36598 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations as \"small business concerns\" under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons addressed under the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal and! certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that these regulations do not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M1647t.1B, they are in action to protect public safety and they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be made available in the docket. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165 Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways.

Following is a breakdown of the sources of these letters: Four were from mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) owners/operators: One was from a MODU operator association; One was from a tankship owner/ operator; One was from a tank barge owner/ operator; One came from an offshore supply vessel (OSV) owner/operator; Seven came from Great Lakes and/or oceangoing cargo ship owners/ operators; Two were from cargo ship associations; One more came from a cargo ship captain; One was from a shipyard; One came from a naval architecture firm; One was from a river passenger vessel owner/operator; One was from a passenger vessel owners' association; One came from the Military Sealift Command:One came from the Naval Sea Systems Command; One was from the State of Texas Transportation Department; Three came from Coast Guard field offices/personnel. A public hearing was requested in only one of the comment letters and the Coast Guard decided at the time that a public hearing was not necessary because the concerns addressed in this letter were resolved in the final rule. Only four of the 28 letters received included comments on specific costs associated with performance of the proposed periodic lightweight surveys, Two of the cost estimates were associated with small passenger vessels, one addressed offshore supply vessels and the other one addressed an ocean- going cargo ship. Where applicable, the economic assessment for the proposal was adjusted in response to these comments. On September 11, 1992, the Coast Guard published a final rule entitled Stability Design and Operational Regulations in the Federal Register (57 FR 41812) which adopted periodic survey requirements from proposed Rule. Reason for Suspension of Effective Date Following publication of the final rule, five letters were received questioning the cost and applicability of the periodic lightweight surveys in 46 CFR \u00a7 170.210 to mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) and small passenger vessels. These issues, as related to MODUs, were again raised during the National Offshore Safety Advisory Committee meeting on. December 1, 1992, at New Orleans, Louisiana. As a result of the information received, the Coast Guard issued a notice indefinitely suspending the effective date of periodic survey requirements under 46 CFR 170.210 ,on December 10, 1992. Drafting Information The principal persons involved in the drafting of this notice are Ms. Patricia L. ,Carrigan, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection and LT Ralph L. Hetzel, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Request for Data, Information, and Comments This notice encourages the submission of specific information and comments. It is the goal of the Coast Guard to propose regulations that will best address both the safety and operational needs of vessels. However, due to the variety of vessels affected by36601 36602 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations the requirement in \u00a7 170.210 and the lack of comments submitted to the docket for certain vessel types, it was difficult to adequately address and analyze the effect that this regulation would have on all vessel types. Therefore, the Coast Guard again seeks input on aspects associated with compliance with \u00a7 170.210 from vessel owners, operators, naval architects, shipyards, Coast Guard and classification society inspectors, consumers, and others involved with the affected vessels. Interested persons are invited and encouraged to participate by submitting written views, data or arguments and, if possible, attending the public hearingm The Coast Guard would lIke members of the concerned public to comment on a number of specific issues. In considering these issues, the following specific vessel types should be addressed separately in order to allow the Coast Guard to accurately evaluate the applicability and cost of the suspended section of this regulation: (a) Tank vessels (Subchapter D) (Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(5), or (e)(6).1; (b) Large passenger vessels (Subchapter H) [Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(3) or (e)(6).J; (c) Miscellaneous industrial and cargo vessels (Subchapter I) [Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(3), (e)(5), or (e)(6).]; (d) MODUs (Subchapter I-A) (Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(3), (e)(4), or (e)(6).1, (e) Special purpose vessels (Subchapter R) [Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(3) or (e)(6).], (f) Small passenger vessels (Subchapter T) [Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(1). (e)(3) or (e)(6).]; and (g) Oceanographic research (Subchapter U) vessels [Do not address vessels which qualify for the existing applicability exceptions in \u00a7 170.210(e)(3) or (e)(6).]. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (CGD 89-037), identify the specific area of the section to which each comment applies, and include supporting documents or sufficient detail to indicate the reason for each comment. Receipt of comments will be acknowledged if a stamped self-addressed post card or envelope is enclosed with the comments. All comments received before the expiration of the comment period will be considered before further action is taken on this section of the stability regulations. After completion of fiuther investigation of this issue, the Coast Guard expects to publish either a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking or a new effective date for this section. Specific Issues on Need and Applicability Issue 1. It is rare that a single identifiable hazard is the sole cause of a stability casualty; however weight growth has been identified as a contributing factor. Weight growth is the unaccounted for accumulation, deletion, or relocation of untracked amounts of weight, such as dunnage, waste, paint, redecoration, disused but not discarded equipment and spare parts, sludge, and similar materials. Accurate tracked weight changes to a vessel are not considered to be weight growth. To allow a better evaluation of the scope of this problem, please provide comments concerning the amount of weight growth you have seen or experienced. Please provide specific examples of amount of, or lack of, weight growth over a specific period of time on a given size and type of vessel as evidenced by the discovery, or lack of discovery, of weight changes during subsequent inspections, deadweight surveys, inclining tests, or casualty investigations. Issue 2. Where weight changes have been discovered at subsequent deadweight surveys or inclining tests, please comment on whether there was a reduction or increase in stability (change in GM or KG) due to untracked weight changes. Please include specifics of vessel type and size. Issue 3. Under current regulations, vessels are inclined only at the time of build, after a major modification, or if the stability is questioned by the Officer In Charge of Marine Inspections (OCMI). This means that while the vessel meets the stability criteria at these specific times, at any time thereafter the vessel may no longer meet the stability criteria due to untracked weight changes. 46 CFR 170.210 requires that a deadweight survey check be made on 5 year intervals to verify that a vessel still meets the stability requirements and that the stability information carried aboard the vessel is still appropriate. Please comment on whether this time period is appropriate or if the interval should be different for different vessel types.Issue 4. No specific requirements on the actual recording of changes in weight onboard vessels are given in the regulations. Therefore, the type and amount of records maintained on weight changes will vary among operators. -While some operators try to be diligent and track all known weight changes, other operators track only those changes they think will substantially effect their lightship weight..Even for prudent operators, some weight growth will go unrecorded because of the nature of the problem. Draft marks and load lines may or may not serve as indicators of weight growth. Other than a periodic weight check, please comment by suggesting other reliable methods that could effectively be used to evaluate weight growth problems? Please be specific and provide any available data that supports your suggestion. Issue 5. The Coast Guard regulations set minimum standards for safety. It is the Coast Guard's position that the tolerances in \u00a7 170.201(b) are reasonable and achievable and that excessive weight change over a vessel's life without a stability review is an unsafe practice. Please comment concerning whether the margins in \u00a7 170.210(b) are reasonable or unreasonable. Please explain the basis for your opinion and supply any available data that supports your answer. Issue 6. In \u00a7 170.210(e)(5), vessels regulated under Subchapter D, or Subchapter I of this Chapter, whose lightweight displacement comprises less than 35 percent of their total fully loaded displacement are exempted from the periodic lightweight verification. This exemption was added to the final rule after reviewing the arguments and data provided in the comments on vessels such as oceangoing cargo ships and tankers, showing that changes in these vessels' lightweight has a significantly smaller effect than that of other ship types. However, realizing that fixed permanent ballast is considered to be a part of a vessel's lightweight, in your comments, please consider whether the lightweight used in this exemption ratio should exclude the weight of the permanent ballast or if the ratio should be adjusted to account for permanent ballast. Issues Concerning Requirement Costs Issue 7. Concern has been raised about the cost of these requirements. In your comments provide estimated costs, if known, for performing a deadweight survey vs. a full inclining test on a given type and size of vessel. Please include itemized data on out-of-service costs, professional fees and any ancillary costs, if available. In calculating the Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations estimated costs, remember that it is not always necessary for all the items not part of the lightweight to be removed from the vessel to complete a deadweight survey. It is necessary, however, to accurately record the. weight and location of each item not part of the lightweight. Issue 8. At the time some owners purchase a vessel, they elect to not purchase the stability related vessel plans. This problem seems to apply mainly to small passenger vessels (Subchapter T). There is a concern that If redrawn plans are necessary, some differences in vessel characteristics could result from variances between the old and new plans rather than from any changes in the vessel. Please comment on the expected accuracy of new lines plans drawn of an existing small passenger vessel. In your comments consider, for vessels not having their original vessel plans, whether it may be possible to alleviate the need for new plans and still meet the safety goals of this section of the regulation. Issue 9. One estimated cost, provided in the comments on the NPRM, was for redrawn small passenger vessel lines plans at $4000-$6000. All vessels normally undergo some degree of modification, improvement, or repair sometime during their life that require having a set of the vessel's plans. If the vessel owner does not choose to buy the plans for the vessel at the time of build, the owner must still be responsible for the cost of redrawn plans when improvements, maintenance, or repairs are done on the vessel. Owners purchasing a vessel sometime after uild must also figure into the purchase the costs of the plans for the vessel to carry out improvements, maintenance, or repairs. It is the Coast Guard's position that an owner's decision on whether or not to acquire the relevant vessel plans at the time of build or purchase of the vessel is their own, and not a cost attributable to periodic lightweight verification. Please comment on whether a prospective purchaser of a new or a usedvessel should consider the cost of securing the vessel plans and documentation necessary to carry out improvements, maintenance, or repairs. If possible, discuss any other reasons to have vessel plans other than to comply with \u00a7 170.210. In your comments, explain the basis for your opinion. Also, for specific vessel types and sizes you may have knowledge about, please estimate general costs associated with redrawing of vessel plans in your comments. Issue 10. Plesase consider the geographic locations and facilities svailable to perform deadweight surveysfor different vessel types in your comments. Discuss advantages or disadvantages associated with specific vessel types or sizes during performance of deadweight survey and/or inclining tests dockside, or in the case of MODUs, on station. Issues Released to Implementation Issue 11. The Coast Guard intends to phase-in the requirement for periodic ightweight verification over a five year period as stated in \u00a7 170.210(a)(2). For each affected vessel, the date by which its initial periodic lightweight verification must be carried out will be determined by a number of factors, including the history and condition of the vessel, the date of the vessel's last lightweight verification, the date of the vessel's next credit drydocking, and the expiration date of the vessel's Load Line Certificate. The Coast Guard intends that this verification be completed in conjunction with other required surveys to try to avoid a vessel being taken from service solely to perform the lightweight verification. The Coast Guard will publish a Navigation and Inspection Circular containing specific guidance on the phase-in process. Please comment on whether this type of phase-in period is appropriate. If possible, please suggest improvements in the implementation of this phase-in period. Consider whether it should be shorter, longer or keyed to different vessel requirements. Issue 12. In the final rule, the Coast Guard agreed that \"bare bones\" vessels which are constructed or operated such that a significant amount of weight growth cannot occur would be exempted from this requirement through the application of \u00a7 170.210(e)(6). Please discuss in your comments specific vessel types that should qualify for this exemption. Also, the procedure under consideration for obtaining this exemption is as follows: Step 1.Apply to local C4 for this exemption providing background and data on the specific vessel that supports the contention that the vessel is a \"bare bones\" vessel and it is not subject to significant weight growth. Step 2. The OCMI, as the authority most familiar with the operation of the particular vessel, will add either an endorsement or a recommendation for denial, before forwarding the request to Commandant. Step 3. Commandant(G-MTH) will either grant or deny the request for the exemption based on the input received from the requestor and the OGMI while maintaining an equivalent application of this exemption across all Coast Guard districts.This procedure should allow latitude to the OCMI in determining whether or not a vessel needs a periodic survey. Please comment on whether this procedure could be improved and still maintain latitude for OCI and equivalency of application among districts. Public Hearing Meeting Date The Coast Guard has determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process and a public hearing is planned. The public hearing is set for 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. on August 5, 1993 in room 2415 of Coast Guard Headquarters, Washington, DC 20593. More information about this public hearing is available by contacting the person listed in FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Requirement for Periodic Lightweight Verification The section containing the requirements under discussion is reproduced below for reference. \u00a7 170.210 Lightweight verification. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, verification of a vessel's lightweight displacement and longitudinal center of gravity is required for all vessels, including vessels built prior to January 3, 1984, as follows: (1) The owner must conduct a deadweight survey at intervals not exceeding 5 years to determine the lightweight displacement and longitudinal center of gravity, unless otherwise authorized by the Commandant. (2) For each vessel, the date by which its initial periodic lightweight verification must be carried out will be determined by the OCMI by consideration of a number of factors. These factors include the history and condition of the vessel, the date of the vessel's last lightweight verification, the date of the vessel's next credit drydocking, and the expiration of the vessel's Load Line Certificate. (3) An authorized Coast Guard representative must be present at each deadweight survey conducted under this section. (4) If the deviation from the lightweight displacement and longitudinal center of gravity does not exceed the values in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner must certify to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center that the lightweight characteristics have not changed. The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may accept the certification or require the owner to provide supporting calculations for review and approval.36603 36604 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations (b) The owner must conduct a stability test in accordance with subpart F of this part, if- (1) The deviation of the lightweight displacement calculated from the last stability test exceeds 3 percent of the lightweight displacement; (2) The deviation of the longitudinal center of gravity calculated from the last stability test exceeds 1 percent of LBP (length between perpendiculars); (3) The deviation from the previously approved lightweight displacement, updated by documented alterations, exceeds 2 percent of the lightweight displacement; or (4) The deviation from the previously approved longitudinal center of gravity, updated by documented alterations, exceeds 1 percent of LBP. (c) If a stability test is required by paragraph (b) of this section, the stability booklet must be updated in accordance with \u00a7 170.110 to reflect the current stability condition of the vessel. (d) The deadweight survey required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be repeated as part of the stability test required in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the entire stability test including the deadweight survey is completed at the same time. (e) Periodic lightweight verification is not required for the following: (1) Vessels to which the simplified stability test of \u00a7 171.030 of this chapter was applied; (2) Vessels with an estimated lightweight center of gravity determined in accordance with \u00a7 170.200; (3) Vessels to which \u00a7 170.175(d) applies; (4) Self-elevating mobile offshore drilling units; (5) Vessels regulated under Subchapter D or Subchapter I of this Chapter whose lightweight displacement comprises less than 35 percent of their total fully loaded displacement; or (6) Vessels exempted by the Commandant.

Phemister, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone 202-366-0635). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Statutory Background Sections 10 and 21 of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA), PublicLaw 100-342, 102 Stat. 624 (June 22, 1988), provide that The Secretary shall, within 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, issue such rules, regulations, standards, and orders as may be necessary to enhance safety by requiring that trains be equipped with event recorders within I year after such rules, regulations, orders, and standards are issued. If the Secretary finds that it is impracticable to equip trains as required within the time limit, the Secretary may extend the deadline for compliance with such requirement, but in no event shall such deadline be extended past 18 months after such rules, regulations, orders, and standards are issued. The term\"event recorders\" means devices that-record train speed, hot box detection, throttle position, brake application, brake operations, and any other function the Secretary considers necessary to record to assist in monitoring the safety of train operation, such as time and signal indication; and are designed to resist tampering. Sec. 21. Tampering With Safety Devices. Section 202 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection: \"[o)(1) The Secretary shall,. issue such rules, regulations, orders, and standards as may be necessary to prohibit the willful tampering with, or disabling of, specified railroad safety or operational monitoring devices. Proceedings to Date On November 23, 1988, FRA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) in this docket. 53 FR 47557. The ANPRM summarized the state of FRA's knowledge about event recorders, called for written comments, and announced a public hearing to gather further information. The substantive comments submitted by interested parties, the testimony given, and the exhibits received at the January 1989 hearing were helpful to the agency. On February 3, 1.989, in a related proceeding, FRA published a final rule in Docket RSOR-10 (54 FR 5485). Published primarily in implementation of section 21 of the RSIA, that rule prohibited tampering with event recorders and granted limited authority to deactivate such devices as were currently installed. On June 18, 1991, FRA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in this docket. 56 FR 27931. The NPRM summarized the issues surfaced by the ANPRM and the comments of interested parties on those issues. Two public hearings were held in order to facilitate public participation; the written comments submitted in response to the NPRM are extensive, detailed, and helpful. FRA is grateful that the regulated community (both managementand labor), the supply industry, individual citizens, and sister Federal agencies were so generous with their time and their knowledge. Background As reported in the ANPRM, railroad industry statistics show that there were approximately 20,000 locomotive units in service on the major freight railroads and Amtrak at the close of 1988. The vast majority of these were in freight or passenger road service. About two- thirds of the fleet has been added since 1970 and just under one-fourth of locomotives are eight years old or less. Of the road locomotives in the national fleet, over 17,000 are owned and operated by ten major railroads and Amtrak. Every major railroad uses event recorders of some type. More than 10,500 locomotives are now equipped with a recorder retaining eight or more events and over 3,500 carry recorders for two or three events. This total of about 14,000 locomotives is a significant increase from the nearly 7,500 locomotives determined to be equipped at the time FRA published the ANPRM in this proceeding in November 1988; more than 70 percent of the road locomotives on the nation's major railroads are now equipped with some form of event recorder. What An Event Recorder Does Comments made in response to both the ANPRM and the NPRM show that the public perception of the role and capabilities of an event recorder is largely based on the use made of such devices in the air transport industry. In the investigation of an air disaster, it is often the flight data recorder that, together with the cockpit voice recorder, provides either the key clues about what happened leading up to the crash or the most reliable verification of a disaster hypothesis based on observations made of the debris. The importance of a flight data recorder stems from the complex, three dimensional,,environment in which airplanes move, the typical disintegration of the aircraft when it hits the ground, and the fact that the plane may fall to earth a considerable distance, both vertically and horizontally, from the actual \"place\" where the catastrophic event took place. By contrast, railroads operate fundamentally In two dimensions and, except in rare cases, investigators usually have significantly more wreckage at the actual site of the accident from which they can glean the clues that lead to a determination of cause. None of the locomotive event recorders in common use on America's36605 36606 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations railroads records as wide a range of data as the black boxes in a commercial airplane and FRA has not found any railroad equipping its locomotives with anything like the cockpit voice recorders found in large passenger airplanes. This preamble will contain a brief discussion of a plan FRA has to significantly advance the development of event recorders for railroads; it will draw on the experience of the airline industry. Section 10 of the RSIA defines an event recorder as a device that records \"train speed, hot box detection, throttle position, brake application, brake operations,\" and other functions the Secretary considers necessary to assist in monitoring the safety of train operations, \"such as time and signal indications.\" The newer recorders in common use by the railroad industry, those on the more than 10,500 road locomotives already equipped with a device that records at least eight events, accumulate the following information: 1. Time; 2. Speed; 3. Traction motor amperage; 4. Distance traveled; 5. Throttle position; 6. Dynamic brakes; 7. Locomotive independent brake; and 8. Train brake pipe pressure reduction. A typical locomotive-mounted device records (on magnetic tape or in digital form in a computer \"memory\") the last 48 hours of locomotive events. The information is stored on three data channels, with a fourth dedicated to tracking elapsed time. The timing channel carries a constant, analog signal of 6.25 Hertz used as a time reference, especially when the data are played back. This channel is used in the generation of time, speed, and distance. A second channel records wheel revolutions. When calibrated for drive wheel diameter, this channel, working with the time signal, is used to generate unit speed and distancetravelled. A third channel records traction motor current, thus measuring the amount of \"work\" the motor is performing. Among other derivatives of these data are the determination of the presence and force of the dynamic brake. The fourth channel records what has been called a \"digital word.\" Such a word, with eight bits of information, is used to retain information on throttle position, automatic brake pipe pressure, application of the locomotive (the \"independent\") brake, and such parameters as direction of travel. Each condition is sampled, placed intocorrect order within the eight-bit digital word, and recorded. When and if these data are retrieved, a playback unit reads and decodes the proper sequence and displays the data on a readout medium such as a strip chart. Because the \"digital word\" recorder collects and stores \"samples\" of conditions, a condition change may be noted after the time in which it actually happens. This lag may be as much as 15 seponds. Skilled technicians can use recorder data to recreate, typically, a history of the last 48 hours of a locomotive's operation. While airplane black boxes usually retain only the final minutes of a trip, locomotives need to record over a longer interval. Unless damaged, for instance, the power consist on a train is often used to remove from the scene any cars still on the tracks, clearing them for the rerailing and cleanup crews. A 48- hour \"tape loop\" is common, both to provide a picture of the entire trip leading up to the accident and to allow the locomotives pulling a train involved in an accident to play a clean-up role without \"erasing\" essential data by recording over it. Experts in accident reconstruction use all available data to determine the cause of an accident and are almost always successful. Sometimes, the initial determination is relatively easy: if the cars are tipped off the track and lying in consist order along the outside of a curve, overspeed is a safe initial assumption. Cause is also readily determined from visible evidence in cases such as a broken wheel on the first car derailed, a rail turned under the second locomotive, or marks of a derailed wheel down the ties until that car meets a switch or a grade crossing..Other accidents are more difficult to analyze, and even seemingly simple accidents may occasionally have contributing causes that elude investigators. FRA believes it has generally been successful in determining the cause of an accident, whether or not event recorder data are available. Of the nearly 300 accidents (of all types, including grade crossing accidents and employee fatalities) directly investigated by the agency each year, all but 3 to 6 percent are closed with a known cause or causes. Because of the nature of the railroad environment, it is usually possible to interview the crew and learn from them what was happening immediately before the accident. With recorder data, the accuracy of their statements can be verified, as can the accuracy of a train simulation run on the basis of their statements. Event recorder data increase both the quality and the quantity of informationavailable to the investigator, an especially important factor in analyzing complex post-accident scenes. When the death of the head-end crew means that eyewitness testimony is not available, or when the combined effects of derailment, collision, or fire make it extremely difficult to read the physical evidence, the event recorder may provide or lead to vital intelligence otherwise destroyed..Even though they cannot guarantee discovery of the cause of an accident, event recorder data have demonstrated their utility. On May 12, 1989, a Southern Pacific train ran away on a hill outside San Bernardino, California, and derailed at a curve near the bottom of the hill. Portions of the train and its cargo landed in a residential area, resulting in four fatalities, two serious injuries, and seventeen minor ones. An early suspected cause was poor train handling by the crew, but after rigorous analysis of all the data, including that available from the event recorders, the National Transportation Safety Board absolved the crew from blame. Instead, the crucial factors included a failure to accurately report the total weight of the train, a failure to tell the crew about the condition of the dynamic brakes available to'them, and an unclear operating rule about brake applications with heavy trailing tonnage on grades. At San Bernardino, it was immediately obvious that the train left the tracks because it was going too fast, but the data provided by the on-board event recorder also allowed investigators to look more closely at and for the cause of the overspeed. Once this was known, a \"lessons learned\" approach led to operational corrections aimed at enhancing the quality of information available to the engineer and improving the decision-making capabilities of this key position. FRA understands that Southern Pacific has made operational changes to its train handling procedures, including a change in its air brake rules, as a result of the information learned in this accident investigation. The Presence of Event Recorders in the Railroad Industry As noted, major freight railroads in the United States already have more than 70 percent of their road locomotives equipped with an event recorder of some type; because most trains are powered by more than one locomotive, it is well within probability that up to 90 percent of the major freight railroads' trains are equipped with event recorders. Essentially all of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation's (Amtrak's) locomotives are equipped Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations and, while FRA's information is not fully complete, some commuter railroads have event recorder equipped locomotives and others are working with the supply industry to develop the\"standard\" commuter-railroad event recorder. Only a very few of the switching and terminal railroads and smaller line-haul companies have equipped their locomotives with event recorders, but these power units are most often used in low speed operations for which speed indicators are not required. So far as FRA has been able to determine, virtually all new road locomotives purchased by major United States railroads are factory equipped with an event recorder capable of gathering and retaining information on the parameters established by the RSIA, with one exception: \"Hot box\" (over- heated journal) detection. The reasons for not recording this \"event\" on a locomotive-mounted recorder are simple: First, the railroads have determined that hot box readings should be recorded and monitored at central locations. Second, wayside hot box detector signals are now routed to other locations on a railroad; bringing that signal \"on board\" could be done, but recording data on the locomotive that are now recorded elsewhere would be duplicative and would serve no apparent safety purpose. Third, FRA believes that the present method of hot box detection and recording is more complete than merely recording an overly hot journal reading on a moving recorder; it is also more secure in that there is virtually no chance that the data would be destroyed, altered, or tampered with in an accident. Some railroads notify the crew of a train passing a hot box detector of both negative and positive readings but the common procedure is either to call the crew with orders to stop and inspect a suspected hot box or to have a wayside indicator convey the same message. In either event, the fact of the detection of a suspected over-heated journal and of the notification to the crew is recorded and available for examination by FRA and railroadofficials. FRA's review of the railroad industry's practices regarding hot box detection, reporting, and recording have convinced the agency that no additional requirements are necessary. There would be no safety purpose served by requiring the recording of hot box detection by a device mounted on a locomotive. Cost and Utility Considerations Approximately 10,500 of the nearly 20,000 locomotives operated by the railroads are now equipped with eitheran eight (8) track or a digital recorder: Essentially all of Amtrak's locomotives, the great majority of Class I freight railroads' locomotives, and far fewer commuter and short line/regional - railroad locomotives FRA estimates that equipping enough locomotives with event recorders to comply with the rule issued in this notice will cost the railroads slightly less than $46 million, with an annual maintenance cost of just under $1.8 million. According to the regulatory impact analysis in the docket of this proceeding, the major railroads will bear 49 percent of this cost, the short lines and regional railroads about 5 percent, and the commuter railroads about 45 percent. Because the smaller freight railroads are not now equipped with recorders as a general rule, the cost impact of a rule requiring event recorders on each locomotive would be borne disproportionately by this segment of the industry. However, section 10 of the RSIA does not require each locomotive toabe equipped; the statutory requirement is that, where necessary to enhance safety, trains shall be equipped. Unlike good brakes, sound track, and qualified engineers, event recorders only indirectly prevent accidents. Their primary safety benefit lies in their use s a tool to diagnose train handling accidents, to continue building a knowledge base of accident causation and, through sampling actual train movements, to evaluate changes in methods of train operation. Event recorders also provide a way to sample the train-handling ability of an engineer in a real-world environment. Another regulatory proceeding, Docket No. RSOR-9, Qualifications for Locomotive Engineers, (56 FR 28228) has dealt more directly with the potential applications for event recorders in monitoring the performance of locomotive engineers. The Need for Event Recorders FRA has determined that event recorders enhance railroad safety. Whether they are used to aid accident analysis, to monitor locomotive engineers' performance, or to monitor equipment performance, event recorders provide data that are free from bias, free m the inconsistent powers of human observation, and free from the possible taint of self-interest. The data extracted from recorders can be played over and over as part of the analysis process without losing their consistency. Event recorders provide FRA with a growing pool of verifiable factual information about how trains are operated and what happens when they become part of an accident. Even the presence of event recorder data will notensure the discovery of the cause of every accident nor eliminate all sources of controversy about causation, but as shown in the Southern Pacific's San Bernardino derailment, event recorder data can help direct the attention of an accident investigator to possible causes not at first suspected. In addition, by reducing the potential for bias from accident investigations, the data from event recorders can help pinpoint operational changes that may prevent the next accident. Issues and Discussion Those filing comments and presenting testimony at the hearings held following Kublication of the NPRM in this matter ave provided the agency with a wealth of facts and informed opinions and have been extremely helpful to FRA in resolving the issues. Eleven persons or organizations made formal statements at one of the two hearing sessions and 37 sets of comments were filed, including the supplemental comments filed by several parties after the hearings. In addition to participation by large and' small railroads and their industry associations, FRA has received material from rail labor, from manufacturers of event recorders and related equipment, from specialized parts of the railroad industry, and from private individuals.

While most commenters spoke or wrote on more than one issue, and while most36607 36608 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations of the comments supported the position(s) of at least one other commenter, the issue$ themselves were grouped around a few key points. Rather than attempt to paraphrase each commenter's response to each of the proposed regulatory sections in the NPRM, FRA believes it is better, and more understandable, to discuss the several key issues in this proceeding and to relate the thrust of the comments on each of these. What events should be recorded? The RSIA defines event recorders as devices that record \"train speed, hot box detection, throttle position, brake application, brake operations, and other functions the Secretary considers necessary to record to assist in monitoring the safety of train operation.\" FRA determined, as explained above, that the recording of hot box detection was more effectively accomplished at a central location than on board a train, but proposed in the NPRM to define an event recorder as a device to monitor and record \"speed, direction of motion, time, distance, throttle position, and brake applications and operations (including dynamic brake applications and operations).\" No commenter said anything against FRA's proposal to continue the present method of monitoring and recording hot boxes. Some commenters proposed adding to the \"events\" to be recorded; suggested candidates include the bell/horn, cab signals, wayside signals, and other automated signal features. Other commenters requested that some present devices, either capable of recording only time, speed, and distance, or capable of recording the pr6posed events but for a shorter time and only while the locomotive is in motion, be \"grandfathered,\" that is, be considered as acceptable alternatives pending a phase-in period. FRA seriously considered adding a requirement to record the functioning of the bell or horn but has not done so for now because sampling rate of the Industry \"standard\" magnetic tape machine can result in a lag of several seconds between the sounding of the horn and the capturing of it on tape. At mainline speeds, such a delay means that locating the point at which the horn blew is conjecture at best and horn/bell data of that caliber have no utility in accident investigation. As will be discussed below, FRA will be working towards a true \"state of the art\" event recorder and will consider requiring recording the horn/bell then. Hot box detector readings happen outside the cab and so do wayside signal aspects; bringing this information on board requires precise and expensivetechnology for which there is no current pressing need. A \"wayside signal\" is one placed along side the track (or above it) and that displays, by means of lights or signal \"arms,\" information about the occupancy or condition of the track ahead of the train. The signals are changed either by the passing of a train or from a central control station. Just as there is no signal inside a motor vehicle that the traffic light ahead has turned red, wayside signals do not have a corresponding reading at the control stand of a locomotive engineer. FRA will continue to evaluate the need to record wayside signals, particularly as event recorders improve. Cab signals are another matter entirely; they already appear inside the cab at the engineer's control stand. Wiring an event recorder to pick up the aspect being displayed is not only relatively easy, but will provide a \"witness\" to the display that would otherwise not be available. At least one commenter said that recording cab signals would help resolve issues as to the cause of accidents where signals are involved. FRA agrees and this final rule adds cab signals, where the locomotive is so equipped, to the parameters required to be recorded. The major railroads have, as might be expected, installed a number of different types of event recorders on their equipment. In addition to recorders that fully comply with the final rule announced by this notice, some have installed machines that retain data only on time, speed, and distance. These railroads have requested that these machines be \"grandfathered\" for ten years (reduced to five in testimony at one of the hearings) to allow the orderly phase-in of newer, more complete recorders. Other commenters urged FRA not to allow a three-event recorder to serve as the only event recorder on a train. FRA is aware that the three-event recorder has a good history of helping accident investigators reconstruct what happened, but these devices simply do not provide all the data FRA, as guided by the RSIA and its own experience, believes necessary. Accordingly, three- event recorders cannot be\"grandfathered,\" but FRA knows that it Is impracticable to replace these recorders in a short time, both because too many units would have to be changed out in the time available and because there is the strong probability that the supply industry could not meet a sudden spike in orders for more capable event recorders. For these reasons, the final rule in this docket provides for an eighteen month phase- in period.Because the rule in this matter requires that trains rather than locomotives be equipped, railroads with large numbers of three-event recorders may be able to accomplish with equipment scheduling what their mechanical departments are not able to accomplish with purchase and installation of complying event recorders. Certainly any requests for waiver and extension of time would have to deal with all possible means of achieving compliance. Another kind of event recorder in use in significant numbers in the North American locomotive fleet records the required events but only while the train is moving and only for the most recent eight hours of movement. (A locomotive making several stops will produce a tape that extends back over considerably more than the most recent eight clock hours.) Eight hours is enough in virtually all cases to get a clear picture of any equipment problems with the locomotive on which the recorder is installed and certainly enough to note train handling difficulties immediately prior to an accident. If the train pulled by a locomotive thus equipped is involved in an accident and the locomotive is needed to assist in wreck clearing, the operating railroad can pres erve the evidence recorded just prior to the accident by disconnecting the recorder, that is, by taking it out of service in the manner allowed by the final rule. The primary problem with these machines is that they do not record air brake tests made while the train is standing; FRA believes, however, that this lack will not fatally affect accident reconstruction. FRA does not believe.that the motion-only recorder is the way for the future, but will allow units in place as of the date of publication of this final rule to be\"counted\" in assembling power consists to move trains. The commuter railroads suggested that, for them, the recorded parameters need to be different. FRA sees the functional parameters required by this rule as broad enough to address the needs of the commuter railroads. Taken together, for instance, it would appear that \"throttle position\" and \"brake applications and operations\" cover the same parameters as \"motoring mode\" and '\"braking mode.\" FRA does not wish to restrict either technological advances or the unique needs of any segment of its regulated community and the agency thinks it has not. FRA believes that the event recorder \"defined\" by this final rule will fit the operations of commuter railroads, and, indeed, of any railroad within FRA's jurisdiction. If this is not the case, respondents have available to Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations them petitions for reconsideration and petitions for waiver. Some commenters raised issues about the recorder's sampling intervals and sampling accuracy. FRA certainly expects that event recorders will be as accurate as present standards for speed indicators and for air gauges, but the agency realizes that more developmental work needs to be done in this area. FRA has decided not to further delay the requirement to have event recorders on trains and will postpone for now standards that would require resolution of technological issues that are intertwined with the extended development of solid state recorders and with recommendations that event recorders be standardized as to size, location, and crashworthiness. Event recorder developmental issues are discussed in more detail below. Several participants expressed a desire to have a \"status indicator,\" usually in the form of a warning light, to show the engineer whether or not the event recorder is working. Such lights are typically one of two kinds: either they show that the recorder is receiving electrical power or they show that the capstan drive (which moves magnetic tape across the recording heads) is turning. The problem with both indications is that they do not show that the recorder is actually capturing data and correctly storing it. The surest way to do that is to remove the tape and play it back, but that only shows that the device was working. FRA will delay a requirement for a status light until one is developed that will truly show whether or not the machine is functioning as intended. Finally, one participant sought a requirement that the recorder keep a record of cars in the train that experience undesired emergency brake applications. The problem with current technology is that, while it can detect an emergency brake application, it cannot pinpoint the location of a \"dynamiter\" within the train. This participant also requested that the recorder keep track of the train's profile, or weight distribution. FRA is not aware of an on- board recorder that will measure and record this information; while draft and buff forces might be measurable with an adaptation of current technology, detecting these forces beyond the pulling coupler of the locomotive is not yet a standard option. . What trains should be equipped with event recorders? Section 10 of the RSIA requires event recorders on trains where they will enhance safety. FRA has discussed at some length, both in this preamble and in the preambles to the ANPRM and the NPRM in this docket,that the primary benefit from event recorders is the assistance they provide to accident investigators attempting to reconstruct complex accidents. The NPRM proposed that all passenger trains and freight trains operated at 30 miles per hour or faster, pulling more than 50 cars, be powered by at least one locomotive with an event recorder. Some commenters wanted certain categories of railroads eliminated from the requirements for event recorders; others wanted certain types of operations. Others said that their equipment wasn't compatible with event recorders or that, with steam excluded, it was unfair not to also exclude historical diesel or electric locomotives. Still others requested that\"passenger\" be defined to exclude tourist or excursion railroads or the operation of special Christmas or charity trains. Yet another commenter wanted coverage on everything operated outside yard limits. Because the primary benefit of the event recorder is the assistance it can provide for accident analysis, the requirement to equip trains can only be viewed in that light. Class II and Class III railroads are defined by the Interstate Commerce Commission on the basis of their economic activity, not their operating speeds. To exclude \"tourist,\"\"excursion,\" \"historic,\" \"museum,\" and other special trains by defining those persons who ride them as other than\"passengers\" strains credibility. FRA has reconsidered its initial proposal to include train length and speed as joint criteria for determining which operations must be covered with an event recorder and has concluded that speed alone should govern. As was pointed out in the NPRM, the energy that must be dissipated in a train accident varies with -the square of speed. Requiring that both speed and trailing tonnage be considered introduces unnecessary complication, especially when no distinction is made between empty and loaded cars. Likewise, FRA realizes that accident complication is more a function of speed than of equipment and that an\"unequipped\" speed for passenger service is both possible and justified. While FRA recognizes a special duty of care owed to railroad passengers, this agency is also aware that passenger trains have significant operational and equipment differences from freight trains and that these differences lead to more predictable behavior in an accident by the passenger equipment. In general: 9 Passenger trains have faster acting brakes than freight trains (with less draft gear slack their brake control valves canbe designed to produce faster application); * Passenger trains have a graduated release feature and a higher brake pipe pressure; with a brake pipe that is typically shorter than a freight train's, they also have less pressure gradient; 9 Passenger trains have more even brake application throughout the train because there is only a little variation between the empty and loaded weight of passenger cars and because there is significantly less variation in density throughout the train; * Passenger trains have an anti-skid feature that allows more controlled stops under adverse traction conditions; Passenger equipment in general, and commuter equipment in particular, is not interchanged away from its owner; thus allowing inspection and maintenance forces to become more familiar with each piece of equipment; and * Commuter operations are characterized by tight control over trains through automatic train control, centralized dispatching, short blocks, tight schedules, cab signals, and short trains; these factors allow fairly precise isolation of accident causes. FRA received comments strongly advocating that event recorders be required regardless of speed because of the number of accidents that happen on low speed track; other comments urged ,the adoption of 40 miles per hour as the appropriate recorder/no recorder speed. FRA is not persuaded that event recorders need to be present in order to capture information about accidents that occur on low speed track. FRA has previously concluded that the operational safety factors inherent in slow speed operations are not sufficient to require that all locomotives be equipped with speed indicators (49 CFR 229.117). To now require the equipping of such locomotives with event recorders, which do not directly enhance the locomotive's operational safety, is not appropriate. Besides, the rule on event recorders is not an attempt to provide automated analysis of every accident, but only to provide an aid for expert investigators dealing with complicated post-accident scenes. FRA has determined that these accidents are more likely to occur during higher -speed operations, whether those operations are of freight or passenger trains. FRA's experience is that Class two track (with maximum speeds of 25 miles per hour for freight trains and 30 miles per hour for passenger) does not produce the kinds of complex post- accident environments that demand calling the full capabilities of event recorders into play. FRA also does not36609 36610 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations agree with the suggestion for raising the speed to 40 miles per hour as the recorder/no recorder threshold. As noted earlier, the energy that must be dissipated in an accident rises geometrically as train speed increases. In FRA's judgement the types of accidents in which event recorder data will prove useful occur at speeds higher than 30 miles per hour. Thus, this final rule requires event recorders on all trains operating faster than 30 miles per hour. To a degree, the remaining commenter concerns about the appropriate threshold for equipping locomotives are misplaced. For example, the rule FRA is adopting amends part 229 without altering the scope or applicability section of that part. Part 229 does not apply to steam locomotives or to railroads that are not part of the general system. Similarly, operation of a train without a recorder for special occasions (e.g.. the movement of historical equipment on the general system) could possibly be accomplished by a waiver or the use of complying equipment for the lead locomotive without unnecessarily complicating the regulatory criteria for when event recorders must be present. Consequently, the final rule does not contain the suggested discrete changes to the equipping threshold. New and rebuilt locomotives. FRA's initial proposal would have required event recorders on all new and rebuilt locomotives, primarily as a step towards the day when all locomotives (equipped with speed indicators) would have event recorders. The \"new and rebuilt\" category was proposed to avoid the economic penalties of retrofitting event recorders to otherwise serviceable locomotives. The desirability of ultimately equipping all locomotives was underscored by comments filed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in which they emphasized their desire to capture and have available data concerning the functioning of each locomotive unit. Upon review of the comments and testimony, however, FRA has decided not to require all new and rebuilt locomotives to be equipped with event recorders at this time even though that is the unmistakable trend in the industry. First, a rule keyed to new and rebuilt locomotives does not reflect the best interpretation of the mandate in RSIA to equip trains where doing so will enhance safety. FRA believes the option it has chosen, requiring event recorder-equipped lead locomotives on trains operated faster than 30 miles per hour, does satisfy the best interpretation of the statute. Second, FRA has learned that several railroads believe that thenumber of recorder equipped locomotives in their current fleet will enable them to comply with a requirement for an event recorder in the lead locomotive of every train operated at more than 30 miles per hour. For these railroads, a requirement to equip each new or rebuilt locomotive with an event recorder would be an unjustified burden. \"Heavy-electric\" commuter equipment. Much of the service provided by commuter railroads, and it is estimated that this group of railroads will bear about 45 percent of the industry's cost for event recorders, uses locomotives that are not essentially different from those of Amtrak or the freight railroads, at least in so far as equipping them to comply with this rule is concerned. FRA is, however, aware that a significant number of carriers use \"heavy-electric\" equipment, that Is, passenger carrying cars that are capable of self-propulsion (by drawing power from ground level \"third rails\" or overhead catenary). Just as the design of this equipment is different from that of typical locomotives, the operating characteristics for this equipment are different. Heavy electric equipment, in particular, is not interchanged away from its owner (thus allowing inspection and maintenance forces to become more familiar with each piece of equipment) and different in that heavy electric operations are characterized by tight control over trains .through automatic train control, centralized dispatching, short blocks, tight schedules, cab signals, and short trains. These differences, however, do not provide a basis for treating heavy electric operations differently under this rule. Indeed, the use of this equipment for the transportation of passengers and the relatively high speeds and short headways that characterize this type nf service clearly require that it be subject to this final rule. Each train comprised of heavy electric equipment must have an in-service event recorder in the lead locomotive. Railroads using heavy-electric equipment, and Long Island Railroad, Metro North Commuter Railroad, NJ Transit, Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority all submitted statements in response to the NPRM, have provided valuable insight into their unique equipment and into their operating environments. FRA appreciates the activities of the heavy- electric commuter operators in working with the supply industry to develop a\"standard\" commuter-railroad event recorder. This agency is aware of thetechnological problems facing heavy- electric operators, especially the poor performance of magnetic tape recorders in tunnel operations. FRA welcomes a continuing dialogue with the commuter railroads concerning the use of newly developed digital recorders. All Locomotives. The NTSB commented that all locomotives in a train should be equipped in order to permit accident investigators to determine the performance of each locomotive in the consist. In addition to the obvious cost implications of this suggestion, there are sound reasons for not attempting to mandate equipping all locomotives at this time. FRA knows that event recorder technology is likely to advance rapidly. Accordingly, rather than establish a rule that would eventually require an event recorder meeting today's standard on every locomotive (except those traveling so slowly they do not even need speed indicators), FRA believes that it is wise to wait to see whether the recorders themselves become significantly better than they now are. FRA agrees with the NTSB that standards should be set for sampling intervals, the ranges of recorded parameters, andthe accuracy of their recording. Performance standards for accident survivability should be explored, with the objective of attaining cost effective improvements that will prevent destruction of data by fire or impact. It is also likely that standardized data extraction protocols would enhance the utility of the event recorder immensely. As good as these ideas are, FRA cannot simply bring them into being by mandating them. Time will be required to bring these concepts to mature and practical fruition. The Federal entity with more experience than any other in reading and using event recorders is the NTSB. FRA will be consulting with the Board to determine how best to use its expertise in working with the supply industry, the railroads, and other interested parties, including most certainly those representing the locomotive engineers, to develop standards for accuracy, for crashworthiness, and for utility for the next generation of event recorders. Equipping trains operating faster than 30 miles per hour now with event recorders, maintained as required, will also enhance this effort by helping to create a data base about recorders themselves. Where should the event recorders be? The NPRM would have required that any one of the locomotives powering a train carry an in-service event recorder. For recording the basic events of a trip, Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations this might have been adequate, but FRA has determined that the recorder will be most helpful if it records the events happening in the locomotive occupied by the engineer, that is, the lead locomotive. Only that locomotive, for instance, can record the cab signal aspect displayed to the engineer. because every subsequent locomotive in the power consist will \"see\" the most restrictive aspect as soon as the lead unit passes the signal. Only the lead locomotive's device will record the engineer's actions in throttle control or in setting up the dynamic brake- recorders on trailing units will note the\"message\" received, the action they were requested to take, but only the lead locomotive will record the direct input of the person in control. The benefits of this are evident both for accident analysis and for evaluating the performance of the engineer. Experience shows that a good engineer can give an accurate narrative account of the events of a trip leading up to an accident. In the past, these explanations have been programed into simulators and the recreations, more often than not, show that the person at the control stand correctly described what took place. With the in-service event recorder required to be in the lead unit, additional verification will be provided. The final rule requires that trains operated faster than 30 miles per hour must have an in-service event recorder in the lead locomotive. In order to keep the recorder in the lead unit as much of the time as possible without requiring undue, and possibly dangerous, switching of locomotives within the power consist, the final rule also states that a lead locomotive with its recorder taken out of service may not remain as the lead locomotive beyond the next calendar day inspection. FRA is aware that push-pull commuter operations don't have a traditional \"locomotive\" at the lead in one direction and that this may present problems in some cases. The ideal solution would be for the actions taken at the engineer's stand in the control car to be recorded on the device in the locomotive. This agency welcomes suggested solutions for any operations where this part of the final rule presents problems. How should event recorders be maintained? The NPRM proposed a requirement that event recorders be maintained at the quarterly periodic inspection, according to written instructions which were to the kept at the site of the work; this requirement supplemented a more basic performance requirement, that the event recorders on trains be \"in-service.\" Two commentersobjected and wanted maintenance requirements more tightly drawn. FRA agrees that the proposal left room for confusion. The line between a performance standard and a regulatory specification is hard to draw and the performance specification is often criticized for being either too lax or so strict that it becomes what one safety expert called \"a hanging rule:\" any deviation from perfection is an offense. Obviously, neither extreme was intended by FRA and a definition of \"In-service\" has been added to \u00a7 229.5. In addition, FRA's final rule now states explicitly that the quarterly maintenance procedure shall include a thorough test of all of the operating functions captured by the recorder and that the readout of the test tape showing the results of this systems check shall be kept with the locomotive maintenance records until the next one is filed. FRA has no desire to create unnecessary maintenance burdens on the railroads, on the one hand, but, on the other, it cannot condone event recorders which fail for lack of effective maintenance. Testimony and comments by representatives of the railroads and of the suppliers demonstrate agreement that a properly maintained recorder will operate from one quarterly inspection to the next without failure, virtually all of the time. The final rule recognizes what industry has said and, accordingly, requires event recorders to be maintained so well that 90 percent 'of them are still functioning as intended when they arrive at the quarterly inspection. If this level of performance cannot be met on a month-to-month basis, the final rule then requires maintenance intervals and practices to be adjusted so that it can. Although no parties commented on this aspect of the proposed rule, FRA notes that the maintenance requirements in.\u00a7 229.25 are\"mandatory\" in the sense that \u00a7 229.23 requires all non-complying conditions to be corrected before the locomotive is used; under new \u00a7 229.135(e) a locomotive, due for a periodic inspection, with an inoperative event recorder is a non-complying locomotive under \u00a7\u00a7 229.7 and 229.9. This means that a locomotive with an inoperative recorder may not be dispatched from the 92-day inspection. How should data be preserved following an accident? The NPRM proposed two ways to ensure that data in the event recorder are preserved following an accident. First, tampering with the recorder or the data in it was prohibited and made actionable under civil penalty procedures and proceedings for disqualification fromperforming safety-sensitive functions. Second, immediately following an accident, the railroad was required to take action to preserve the data recorded by the event recorder, either by safeguarding the locomotive or by removing the tape or the recorder itself and storing them in a secure place for later analysis. Several commenters suggested amending the proposal. The railroads noted that they need immediate access to the data for their own investigation, both to compare the recorder readout with the physical evidence and to direct their search of the derailment site. One commenter suggested that FRA be extremely cautious about access to recorder data in the post-accident environment to'prevent bias from entering the investigation. Another commenter requested timely access to recorder data by, among others, involved rail labor organizations, and the NTSB asked FRA to require the railroads to comply with Board rules on the preservation of evidence. FRA recognizes the legitimate needs of both management and labor to the operational data stored in event recorders. But Congress, in enacting the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988, said that event recorders were being required to \"enhance safety.\" This places the public interest at the top of the needs to be satisfied through analysis of event recorder data. FRA's initial proposal attempted to weave together the investigatory needs and authorities of the National Transportation Safety Board and of this agency; on reflection, and considering the written comments and oral testimony, FRA has concluded that they are best handled separately. The NTSB has made it clear that they want only the unread, original tape or other data from the event recorders; FRA is willing. to let the railroad analyze recorder data as long as a duplicate original is preserved for Federal analysis. The final rule provides that, after an accident reportable to the Board, the railroad will take no action (except as necessary to avoid outright destruction of the data) until the Board has had eight hours from the time of notification of the National Response Center to declare that it will conduct an investigation of the accident. After the eight hour period (or earlier if the Board makes a \"no investigation\" determination) the railroad is still required to preserve the data on an FRA- reportable accident; the difference at this level is that the company can now duplicate it and put the copy on its own readout machine. If, during the eight hour period, the Board notifies the36611 36612 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations railroad that an investigation will be conducted, the railroad will be governed by the Board's instructions. Relation to Other Rulemaking Proceedings In its fina rule proscribing tampering with safety devices, published February 3, 1989 (54 FR 5485), FRA required installed event recorders to be operative unless the locomotive was being hauled dead-in-tow or unless the event recorder became inoperative enroute, in which case FRA imposed a notification requirement similar to that used for certain signal-related equipment that controls or restricts train operations. The AAR filed a Petition for. Reconsideration in that Docket. Some of what is in this final rule responds to that petition. FRA agrees that it serves no safety purpose to create a situation in which a locomotive without an installed event recorder could be used in a power consist while a locomotive with an inoperative event recorder could not. FRA notes that section 10 of the RSIA seeks to have event recorders not on locomotives but on those trains where the equipment is necessary to enhance safety. While this rule requires event recorders to be in operating order at the time the locomotive is cleared from the quarterly inspection, these devices, like any mechanical or electronic device, are subject to random failures. FRA sees no safety benefit in severely restricting the operation of a locomotive costing upwards of a million dollars because of the failure of a fifty dollar part in a black box. The final rule in this docket would permit operation of a locomotive with an event recorder known to have failed but it could not be the sole power, nor the lead locomotive, on a train operated faster than 30 miles per hour. Based on FRA's further analysis and on the arguments advanced in the AAR's Petition for Reconsideration, FRA believes that, while event recorders come under the general category of safety devices by some meanings of that term and, while they may positively encourage crews to obey the law, they are not the kind of active safety devices that have an immediate effect on train operations. Event recorders do not function in the san~e way or for the same purpose as does equipment used to assure that the locomotive operator is alert, or that the engineer is not physically incapacitated, or that the person at the controls is aware of and complying with the indications of a signal or other operational-control system.Accordingly, FRA has removed references to event recorders from subpart D of part 218 and has included all regulations relating to event recorders (including a provision prohibiting tampering with such recorders) in the Railroad Locomotive Safety Standards in part 229. In Docket No. RSOR-9, Qualifications for Locomotive Engineers (56 FR 28228), FRA has discussed the use of event recorders to monitor locomotive engineer performance. Analysis by Section Section 229.5. This section is amended by adding a definition of\"event recorder\" as a tamper-resistant device to record data on train speed. direction of motion, time, distance, throttle position, and brake applications and operations over the most recent 48 hours of operation of the electrical system of the locomotive on which it is installed and by adding a definition of \"in-service\" as an event recorder successfully tested at its most recent periodic inspection and not known to have suffered any failures since then. Section 229.25. This section is amended by adding a requirement that event recorders be maintained according to standards set by the manufacturer, the supplier, or the owner of the unit; a written copy of the maintenance instructions shall be maintained at the location where the work is being done. At a minimum, event recorders must be run through the full range of each of the operational parameters they were recording and verification of the correct functioning of the recorder, in the form of a read out tape, must be filed with other locomotive maintenance records until the next inspection and maintenance episode. Finally, a performance standard for the effective maintenance of event recorders requires that 90 percent of them be still fully functional when they arrive for periodic inspection. If the \"ready rate\" drops below this, railroads are required to adjust maintenance intervals or operations so that this performance level is achieved. This maintenance provision will take effect on the effective date of this rule, that is, it will apply to event recorders (as defined by this rule) already installed on that date. Section 229.135. This new section of the regulations contains the essence of FRA's event recorder requirements. Subsection (a) requires that, eighteen months after the effective date of this final rule, trains operating faster than 30 miles per hour must have an in-service event recorder in the lead locomotive. This is the only provision of the finalrule that takes effect after the effective date of the rule. Subsection (b) provides that a locomotive on which the event recorder has been taken out of service may not remain as the lead locomotive beyond the next calendar day inspection. This subsection also provides that event recorder inspection, maintenance, and testing is limited to that required by \u00a7 229.25(e). Subsection (c) allows a railroad to take an event recorder out of service, and requires it in the case of known failures, upon the authorization of a qualified person. Out of service event recorders must be tagged and may not remain out of service beyond the next periodic inspection. Subsection (d) provides for the security, and subsequent use by Federal investigators, of data from the recorders of locomotives involved in accidents. Subsection (e) provides that individuals who willfully disable event recorders or alter the data recorded by them are subject to civil penalties and disqualification proceedings. Regulatory Impact E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies This final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policies and procedures, and is considered to be non- major under Executive Order 12291 but significant under DoT policies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). In an effort to design a regulatory approach that would achieve the maximum benefits at the minimum cost to the industry, FRA developed six regulatory options: (1) Taking no action; (2) requiring the installation of event recorders on all locomotives; (3) requiring the installation of event recorders on all new and rebuilt locomotives; (4) requiring event recorders on Amtrak inter-city passenger trains as well as all high- speed, heavy-tonnage freight trains; (5) requiring event recorders on all passenger trains, high-speed and heavy tonnage freight trains, and all new and rebuilt locomotives; and (6) requiring event recorders on all trains operated faster than 30 miles per hour. FRA's analysis shows that the sixth option is both economically reasonable and fully responsive to the public interest as expressed by Congress in the RSIA. It has a 20-year discounted cost of just over $60 million dollars. It will result in event recorders first being present when and where they do the most good. FRA contemplates that, after a research and development effort yields performance standards with which all Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 I Thursday, July 8, 1993 I Rules and Regulations 36&13 manufacturers may be required to comply, virtually all locomotives will be equipped, thus increasing, for example, the potential that at least one unit's event recorder data will survive even a major, head-on collision. The chosen option avoids a massive, immediate, and costly full retrofit program, analyzed by FRA to have a 20-year discounted cost of over $92 million dollars, the burden of which would fall disproportionately on small and medium sized railroads, and it will improve FRA's ability to accurately identify the causes of accidents involving complex scenarios involving train handling and train dynamics. A full analysis of economic impact, including the impact on small entities pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), of the rule proposed here and of the other options considered by FRA has been made and is included in the docket file of this proceeding. Regulatory Flexibility Act These regulations have been revised to reduce their impact on small entities to the bare minimum consistent with Congressional intent. FRA certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act The proposed rule contains information collection requirements. FRA has endeavored to keep the burden associated with this proposal as simple and minimal as possible. The proposed sections that contain information collection requirements and the estimated time to fulfill each requirement are as follows: Proposed Brief d Estimated section Bavg. time 229.25(e) 15 min. facturers, mainte- and test- I hr. readout record. 229.135(c) Tagging mason for I min. removing event recorder from service. 229.135(d) Record of \"secu- 15 min. rity' of event re- corder data All estimates include the time for reviewing instructions; searching existing data sources; gathering ormaintaining the needed data; and reviewing the information. FRA solicits comments on the accuracy of the estimates, the practical utility of the information, and alternative methods that might be less burdensome to obtain this information. Persons desiring to comment on this topic should submit their views in writing to FRA and to FRA Desk Officer, Regulatory Policy Branch (OMB No. 2130-0004),.Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20530. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) FRA has submitted the information collection requirements in this rule to the Office of Management and Budget and has obtained approval under OMB approval number 2130- 0004. Environmental Impact This rule will not have any identifiable environmental impact. Federalism Implications This rule should not have substantial effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends two aspects of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems, in response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by Rockwell International. First, the rule amends the adjustment procedure for brake burnish during road and dynamometer testing; and second, it amends the dynamometer test's recovery requirement applicable to truck and bus front brakes. With respect to brake burnish, the rule allows up to three brake adjustments during the burnish procedure at intervals specified by the vehicle manufacturer and at the conclusion of burnishing. The agency believes that this amendment brings the burnish test procedures closer to conditions found in actual vehicle usage. With respect to the recovery requirements, the rule no longer requires front axle brakes on trucks and buses to comply with the minimum pressure requirements related to the brake chamber. The agency believes that this amendment improves brake performance by removing a provision that may prevent the use of larger, more effective brakes on front axles. DATES: Effective Date: The amendments become effective on August 9, 1993. Petitions for Reconsideration: Any petitions for reconsideration of this rule must be received by NHTSA no later than August 9, 1993. ADDRESSES: Petitions for reconsideration of this rule should refer to Docket 91- 65; Notice 2 and should be submitted to: Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Richard C. Carter, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. (202-366-5274).SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Burnish Requirements Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems (49 CFR 571.121), specifies road tests and dynamometer tests to measure whether vehicles equipped with air brakes comply with the standard's performance requirements. For instance, such vehicles are subject to \"burnish\" procedures conducted at the outset of road testing and dynamometer testing. A burnish procedure consists of a series of brake applications, which are also known as \"snubs,\" that serve to simulate the break-in of the brakes on new vehicles under normal driving conditions. Under the current road test burnish procedures, two options, \"a\" and \"b\", are available until September 1, 1993 (see S6.1.8.1). Brakes on vehicles manufactured on or after that date must be burnished under option \"b.\" The burnish procedures in both options consist of 500 snubs. In addition, both options specify that the brakes be adjusted during the burnish procedure, if necessary, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, after the 125th, 250th, and 375th snubs and after burnish is completed. Standard No. 121 also specifies a dynamometer test to measure mechanical force (see S6.2.6). Before the dynamometer test, brakes are burnished by making 400 stops from 40 mph at a deceleration of 10 f.p.s.p.s. For these brake applications, the standard specifies that the \"initial brake temperature\" must be within a stated range. The term \"initial brake temperature\" Is defined as \"the average temperature of the service brakes on the hottest axle of the vehicle 0.2 mile before any brake application.\" The current burnish procedures resulted from a rulemaking conducted in response to a petition from International Harvester that culminated in a final rule published on March 14, 1988 (49 FR 8191). After several notices, the agency adopted a burnish procedure in which the brakes on heavy duty vehicles were burnished by 500 snubs slowing the vehicle from 40 mph to 20 mph, without regard to brake temperatures generated during the burnish. The burnish procedure also permitted manual brake adjustments at specified intervals. In the final rule, the agency stated that standardizing intervals at which adjustments could be made would reduce a potential source of variability.3.6615 36616 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations B. Brake Recovery During Dynamometer Testing At present, section S5.4 specifies requirements that foundation brake assemblies must meet during dynamometer tests for retardation, brake power, and recovery. During brake recovery, the chamber pressure for non- antilock systems must be within a range of 85 to 20 psi. (Anti-lock systems have a range between 85 and 12 psi). The purpose of the 85 psi requirement at the high end of the test specification is to ensure that the brakes can recover from the elevated temperatures which cause brakes to fade. Along with causing brake fade, these elevated temperatures may also permanently alter the physical characteristics of the brake block material. The purpose of the 20 psi and 12 psi requirements at the low end of the test specification is to check for overly aggressive brake blocks with an unstable coefficient of friction resulting from the exposure to high temperature conditions. II. Petition On January 8, 1991, Rockwell International (Rockwell) submitted a petition for rulemaking, requesting that the agency amend two aspects of Standard No. 121: (1) The adjustment procedure for brake burnish; and (2) the recovery requirement for front brakes on trucks and buses. With respect to brake burnish, Rockwell explained that it has experienced problems with brake drag under the current adjustment procedures. For Rockwell's brake design under the current regulation, a manual adjustment is not allowed at the 50th snub, even though such an adjustment would reduce brake swell. Rockwell requested that the Standard be amended to permit manual adjustment at four - intervals at the manufacturer's discretion, if necessary. The petition did not request changes to the brake adjustment provisions in the dynamometer test. With respect to brake recovery, Rockwell stated that the 20 psi requirement results in brake size and input power being limited because if a brake's performance level is too high, the pressure will be less than 20 psi. This limitation historically has had limited impact because recovery typically has fallen at mid-range. However, the petitioner requested that the standard be amended to exclude truck and bus front axle brakes from the minimum pressure requirements to allow use of larger front brake sizes and input powers. The petitioner believed that concern about early lock-up wouldgenerally not apply to front axle brakes because of the dynamic weight transfer to front axles during deceleration. HI. Agency Proposal On December 23, 1991, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend Standard No. 121 in two respects in response to Rockwell's petition. (56 FR 66395). First, the notice proposed amending the burnish requirements in the road and dynamometer test conditions to allow up to three brake adjustments during the burnish procedure, at intervals specified by the vehicle manufacturer, and a final adjustment at the conclusion of burnishing. The agency believed that this proposal would bring the burnish procedures closer to conditions found in actual vehicle usage, given the development of non-asbestos brake blocks that respond to elevated temperatures with increased swelling. Second, the notice proposed amending the brake recovery requirement to exclude the front brakes of trucks and buses from the minimum pressure requirement. The agency believed that this amendment would remove a requirement that might impede the development of larger front brakes on heavy vehicles. IV. Comments to the NPRM and the Agency's Response NHTSA received comments in response to the NPRM from motor vehicle manufacturers including General Motors (GM), International Harvester (ER), Ford, and Freightliner and brake equipment suppliers including Ferodo America, Abex, Motion Control Industries, and Echlin. The commenters generally agreed with the proposals to amend the brake adjustment schedule during the burnish requirements and to amend the brake recovery requirements with respect to front brakes on trucks and buses. In addition, commenters addressed specific matters in the proposed regulation, including the need to apply the proposed exclusion to the brake recovery requirements to anti-lock systems. The agency has considered the points raised by the commenters in developing the final rule. The agency's discussion of the more significant comments and other relevant information is set forth below. The notice first addresses issues about brake adjustment during braking and then addresses truck and bus front axle brake recovery.A. Brake Adjustment During Burnish As explained above, Standard No. 121 specifies a burnish procedure requiring a series of snubs that simulate the break- in that brakes get when they are initially used on the public roads. In the 1988 rulemaking about burnish, NHTSA decided to specify the intervals at which manual adjustments could be made. Specifically, manual adjustments were permitted after the 125th, 250th, and 375th snubs and after completing the burnish, with each adjustment made in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. After evaluating the Rockwell petition, NHTSA proposed amending the adjustment schedule during brake burnish to permit adjustment at intervals specified by the vehicle manufacturer, if necessary. The agency reasoned that the amendment might be necessary to accommodate the new generation of non-asbestos brake blocks. In addition, the agency believed that in currently specifying the adjustment intervals, the standard did not account for differences among brakes. The agency requested comment about the best way to prescribe the adjustment schedule to allow flexibility to accommodate new brake designs, while ensuring that the burnish requirements were enforceable and appropriate. The NPRM addressed two other considerations related to the brake adjustment schedule during burnish. First, the agency proposed amending the brake adjustment intervals specified for the dynamometer test conditions in S6.2 to be consistent with. the adjustment schedule during the road test procedures. Second, the agency proposed changing the definition for \"initial brake temperature\" to be more appropriate for dynamometer testing. Several commenters addressed the issue related to the adjustment schedule during brake burnish. GM agreed with the rationale set forth in the preamble that different brake system designs may require manual adjustments at different times. Ford supported the proposal although the proposed changes would not benefit its vehicles. Ferodo commented that the proposed readjustment procedure would eliminate problems associated with the burnish procedures. Abex supported allowing three adjustments during the burnish. Rockwell commented that its petition was intended to provide manufacturers with flexibility to make up to three adjustments as necessary during the burnish test and not to specify predetermined adjustment points. It stated that to provide greater flexibility, the phrase \"at intervals Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations specified by the vehicle manufacturer\" should be deleted. Several commenters, including Rockwell stated that the adjustments for both the road and dynamometer tests should be done pursuant to the brake manufacturer's schedule. Rockwell commented that it would be an unnecessary burden to repeat tests using all the potential vehicle manufacturer adjustment procedures. Abex commented that the brake manufacturer's schedule should be followed because conditions controlling the need for readjustments will vary significantly due to ambient conditions, vehicle configuration, brake size, axle ratings, friction material properties, and the predetermined axle by axle brake balance of the specific vehicle being tested. After reviewing these comments, NHTSA believes that its proposal to amend the adjustment schedule during brake burnish is appropriate. The agency believes that this amendment will provide increased flexibility to manufacturers without resulting in any safety problems. In response to the comments that adjustments should be made at the brake manufacturer's discretion, the agency believes that the vehicle manufacturer's adjustment procedure should be followed instead of the brake manufacturer's. While NHTSA is aware that the brake manufacturer frequently conducts the brake development testing, the agency notes that the vehicle manufacturer is the entity ultimately responsible for certifying that the air brakes comply with standard No. 121. Therefore, the vehicle manufacturer should be responsible for the adjustment schedule. NHTSA believes that having the regulatory text state that the vehicle manufacturer is responsible for specifying the brake adjustment intervals should not result in any significant change in the relationship between the brake supplier and the vehicle manufacturer. The agency believes that the vehicle manufacturer and its axle or brake supplier would coordinate their compliance testing efforts. The agency would not necessarily expect the burnish adjustment points to be identical in all cases. Since the dynamometer and road tests are run under different cooling conditions, the agency would expect the drum and lining expansion rates to be different, resulting in unique schedules of adjustment for each participant. With respect to the definition for \"initial brake temperature,\" GM, Abex, and Rockwell commented that the time should be changed to 18 seconds (0.2 miles/40 mph), instead of 12 seconds asproposed in Notice 1, since all burnish snubs will be conducted from 40 mph beginning September 1, 1993. The agency agrees with these commenters that the time should be changed to 18 seconds to make the dynamometer and road tests consistent. Ferodo recommended that the definition of initial brake temperature should be amended to mean the \"temperature of the hottest brake at brake apply.\" Ferodo also expressed concern that adding an interval of 12 seconds between initial brake temperature and brake apply will add a variable and degrade temperature control. NHTSA believes that if Ferodo has a problem with accessing of temperature data in 12 seconds (now 18 seconds), then they must have misinterpreted how they should be performing the test. Under S6.2.6, the initial brake temperature means the average temperature of the service brakes on the hottest axle of the vehicle 0.2 miles before any brake application. In the dynamometer tests, they would convert the 0.2 miles to a time since the brake system they were testing was not being run on a vehicle on a test track. The agency notes that no other axle or brake material supplier expressed having a problem with the proposed timing change. In addition, the agency believes that the amendment will only necessitate having manufacturers change several lines \"of computer code. Based on the above considerations, the agency has determined that Ferodo's concerns are unfounded. B. Brake Chamber Pressure During Recovery As explained above, Standard No, 121 currently specifies provisions about a vehicle's brake recovery during the dynamometer testing. (see section S5.4.3) Within two minutes after completing the brake power tests, the brake of a vehicle (other than either front axle brake of a truck-tractor) is required to make 20 consecutive stops from 30 mph at a deceleration rate of 12 f.p.s.p.s. During these stops, the service line air pressure needed to attain the deceleration rate must be not more than 85 lb per square inch and not less than 20 lb/square inch for non antilock brake systems (or 12 lb/square inch for brakes controlled by an antilock system). As explained above, the requirements at the low end of the specification are to prevent overly aggressive brake blocks with an unstable coefficient of friction resulting from exposure to high temperature conditions. One effect of the low end requirements is to prevent the use of larger brakes on the front axlebecause such systems may go below the fixed lower pressure limit. NHTSA proposed amending the requirement so that front axle brakes on trucks and buses would no longer have to comply with the minimum pressure requirements for the brake chamber during the recovery tests. The agency believed that this proposed amendment would result in eliminating a regulation that might serve to impede the use of larger, more effective front brakes. Such an amendment would be consistent with the agency policy of encouraging the use of large front brakes. .Several commenters addressed the issue of the brake recovery requirements. GM supported the proposal to remove the 20 psi recovery requirement, stating that the proposal could enhance overall brake system performance by facilitating the use of larger front foundation brakes. GM stated that it has had to limit front brake size due to the 2 psi lower limit requirement. Rockwell, Abex, and Navistar recommended eliminating all minimum pressure requirements for truck and bus front brakes regardless of whether they are controlled by ABS. Believing that this situation resulted from an oversight because antilock brakes are more forgiving of over- recovery, Navistar requested that both the 12 psi and 20 psi requirements be eliminated. In addition, Navistar requested that $5.4.3.(a) and S5.4.3(b) be removed from the proposed regulatory text. Echlin disagreed with the proposal to eliminate the lower pressure limits, stating that such an action would defeat the purpose of controls that help prevent degraded vehicle control. It believed that as a result of this proposal, brake block materials with overly aggressive recovery characteristics could return. Echlin believed that more effective front brakes could be allowed by testing on the dynamometer at a load higher than the gross axle weight rating (GAWR). NHTSA agrees with Rockwell, Abex and Navistar that the lower limit recovery requirement applicable to antilock systems on front brakes should be eliminated. This decision results in more consistent treatment for antilock and non-antilock brake systems. Regulatory Analyses and Notices A. Executive Order 12291 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking and determined that it is neither\"major\" within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 nor \"significant\"36617 36618 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The main effect of the burnish amendment is to provide burnish procedures that are more representative of the actual \"break-in\" that vehicle brakes typically receive while in use on the nation's roads, without favoring any particular braking system design. In particular, allowing adjustment consistent with the vehicle manufacturer's recommended adjustment schedule more fully accounts for differences among brake systems. The main effect of the amendment about recovery requirements is to remove a restriction that prevents the installation of better performing front brakes. The amendment to the burnish procedures will not result in any cost increase because it does not impose any new requirements on manufacturters. Rather, it provides greater flexibility to manufacturers to conduct the burnish testing. The amendment to-the recovery requirements will result in a cost savings because front axle brakes on trucks and buses no longer have to comply with certain requirements. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this rulemaking on small entities. Based on this evaluation, I hereby certify that the amendments will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Few of the truck tractor or brake manufacturers may qualify as small entities. While some trailer manufacturers may qualify as small entities, this rule will not significantly increase the production or certification costs for those manufacturers that qualify as small entities. Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions which purchase these vehicles will not be affected since the cost impacts of this rule are minimal. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been performed. C. Federalism Assessment This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612. NHTSA has determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. No state laws will be affected. D. Environmental Impacts In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts of this rule. Theagency has determined that this rule will not have a significant affect on the quality of the human environment. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Incorporation by reference.

ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Division of Federal Aid, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Room 140 ARLSO 4401 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia 22203, or delivered to the same address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Columbus Brown, Chief, Division of Federal Aid, (703) 358-2156. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Sewage discharged by recreational boaters may be a substantial contributor to localized degradation of water quality in the United States. The discharge of untreated sewage by boaters is prohibited under Federal law in all areas within the navigable waters of theUnited States. Many boaters have Type I marine sanitation devices (holding tanks), or portable toilets for sewage. However, there is currently an inadequate number of pumpout stations and waste reception facilities (dump stations) for boaters to dispose of their sewage. The purpose of the Act, therefore, is to provide funds to States for the construction, renovation, operation, and maintenance of pumpout and dump stations to improve water quality. Section 5604 of the Clean Vessel Act (Pub. L. 102-587, Subtitle F) authorizes the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Director) to make grants to coastal States for conducting surveys of the status of existing facilities and need for additional facilities, and developing plans for the provision'of facilities; and to all States for constructing/renovating pumpout and dump stations and for implementing associated education programs. Funds will be available on a competitive basis to ensure that grants address the highest national priorities. Amounts made available in a fiscal year are available for two years for obligation. Environmental Effects Because this rule is an administrative action, the effects on the physical, biological and sociological environment are too broad, speculative, and conjectural to be analyzed meaningfully. Therefore, the action is categorically excluded from any environmental documentation pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. However, construction/renovation of pumpout and dump stations will require separate environmental consideration. All actions that may be funded by this national grant program will comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (Appendix I of 516 Department Manual 6) prior to the funding. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental laws related to the Endangered Species Act, Coastal Barriers Resources Act as amended by the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Executive Orders on Floodplains (E.O. 11988) and Wetlands (E.O. 11990), historic/cultural resources, prime and unique farmlands, and the Clean Water Act shall be completed before grant agreements are approved by the Fish and Wildlife Services. Information Collection Requirements The information collection requirements contained in this rule, except for surveys, are only those necessary to fulfill applicable36619 36620 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations requirements of 43 CFR part 12, and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The collection of survey information contained in this rule will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The collection of this information will not be required until it has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Public Comment The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments, suggestions or objections regarding the interim rule to the office identified in the Address Section of this preamble. Comments must be received on or before August 23, 1993. Statement of Effects The interim rule will have no economic/cost or price effects. It will not cause a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. The grant program does not involve \"taking\" as described in Executive Order 12630. The rule allows eligible States to make decisions regarding the development and submission of proposed grants for surveys, plans, construction/renovation and education. Therefore, it is consistent with Executive Order 12612 on Federalism. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs This Clean Vessel Act Grant Program is covered under Executive Order 12372 \"Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs\" and 43 CFR part 9 \"Intergovernmental Review of Department of the Interior Programs and Activities,\" Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. States and Territories that participate in the Executive Order process have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants should alert their SPOCs to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions to provide material as required by theSPOC. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the narrative. Applicants from States that choose to exempt the grants need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Author The primary author of these rules is Robert D. Pacific, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 9 CFR Part 94 [Docket No. 92-197-1] Change In Disease Status of New Caledonia Because of Rinderpest and Foot-and-Mouth Disease AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: We are proposing to declare New Caledonia free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). We have determined that New Caledonia, which has never had an outbreak of either disease, meets all of the criteria for being declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Although New Caledonia is a possession of France, New Caledonia meets the requirements of the regulations for receiving separate status as to rinderpest and FMD. This proposed revision would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from New Caledonia, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and would relieve restrictions on the importation, from New Caledonia, of milk and milk products from ruminants. This proposed revision would also ensure that New Caledonia's animal health status would not be affected should the rinderpest and FMD status of France change. This proposed revision would not give New Caledonia separate status from France in terms of diseases other than rinderpest and FMD, and France is not declared to be free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. Therefore, even if this proposal is adopted, the importation from New Caledonia of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine would continue to be restricted because of those diseases. Similarly, certain restrictions on the importation, from New Caledonia, of ruminant meat and edible products from ruminants would remain in effectbecause bovine spongiform encephalopathy exists in France. DATES: Consideration will be given only to comments received on or before September 7, 1993. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of your comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your comments refer to Docket No. 92- 197-1. Comments received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments are encouraged to call ahead (202-690-2817) to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Harvey A. Kryder, Chief Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, VS, APHIS, USDA, room 753, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-7885. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as \"the regulations\") govern the importation into the United States of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases, including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants and swine. Section 94.1(a)(1) of the regulations provides that rinderpest or FMD exists in all countries of the world except those listed in \u00a7 94.1(a)(2), which are declared to be free of both diseases. We are proposing to add New Caledonia to that list. New Caledonia is a possession of France, but it meets all of the criteria specified in \u00a7 94.1a of the regulations for determining the separate status of a territory or possession with regard to rinderpest and FMD. We will consider declaring a country to be free of rinderpest and FMD if there have been no reported cases of the diseases in that country for at least the previous 1-year period, and novaccinations for rinderpest or FMD have been administered to swine or ruminants in that country for at least the previous 1-year period. In the case of New Caledonia, there has never been an outbreak of rinderpest or FMD, and no ruminants or swine have ever been vaccinated for either disease. New Caledonia has applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be recognized as free of rinderpest and FMD. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has reviewed the documentation submitted by the government of New Caledonia in support of its request. In addition, APHIS officials have evaluated the capability of New Caledonia's veterinary services, laboratory and diagnostic procedures, vaccination practices, and the administration of laws and regulations to ensure against the introduction of disease into New Caledonia through the importation of animals, meat, and animal products. The APHIS officials conducting the evaluation concluded that New Caledonia is free of rinderpest and FMD. Details concerning the evaluation are available upon written request from the person listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Based on the information discussed above, we believe that New Caledonia qualifies for listing in \u00a7 94.1(a)(2) of the regulations as a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Although New Caledonia is a possession of France, and APHIS is in the process of declaring France to be free of rinderpest and FMD, we have determined that New Caledonia should receive separate status to ensure that New Caledonia's animal health status would not be affected if an outbreak of rinderpest or FMID should occur in France in the future. This action would remove the prohibition on the importation, from New Caledonia, of fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and milk and milk products from ruminants. This action would not give New Caledonia separate status from France in terms of diseases other than rinderpest and FMD, so importations from New Caledonia of live swine and fresh, chilled, or frozen meat from swine would continue to be restricted under 9 CFR part 94 because France has not been declared free of hog cholera and SVD. Similarly, the importation, from New Caledonia, of ruminant meat and edible products from ruminants would Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 1e9 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules continue to be restricted under \u00a7 94.18 because BSE exists in France. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this proposed rule would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office'of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12291. We are proposing to declare New Caledonia free of rinderpest and FMD. We have determined that New Caledonia, which has never had an outbreak of either disease, meets all of the criteria for being declared free of rinderpest and FMD. This proposed revision would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from New Caledonia, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and, frozen meat from ruminants, and would relieve restrictions on the importation, from New Caledonia, of milk and milk products from ruminants. New Caledonia is a net importer of meat. No meat exports from New Caledonia were reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1989, while approximately $12.4 million worth of fresh, chilled, and frozen meat was imported into New Caledonia during the same year (FAO, \"Trade Yearbook,\" 1990). FAO and USDA production and trade data indicate that approximately 40 percent of New Caledonia's beef and veal is imported (FAO, \"Trade Yearbook,\" 1990, and USDA, Economic Research Service, \"Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States; Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,\" 1992). It is unlikely, therefore, that there would be any new imports of beef or veal into the United States from New Caledonia. New Caledonia has a game ranching industry, and this proposed rule would allow deer meat from New Caledonia to be imported into the United States.According to the North American Deer Farmers Association, 80 percent of the commercially produced venison consumed in the United States is imported from New Zealand, where deer farming is a mature industry. Commercial venison production in the United States, where deer farming is still a new industry, complements, rather than competes with, the venison imports from New Zealand because the U.S. peak production season is opposite that of New Zealand. New Caledonia and New Zealand share the same peak production season, so exports of venison from those two countries would be in direct competition in the U.S. market. Venison from New Caledonia would enter the U.S. market at the expense of producers in New Zealand, rather than at the expense of domestic producers of venison, so the impact on the U.S. deer farming industry is expected to be minimal. As demand for venison grows, the cost advantages of domestic production are likely to reduce U.S. reliance on all imports of venison. As stated above, this proposed revision would remove restrictions on the importation of milk and milk products from ruminants into the United States from New Caledonia. The United States does not import casein from New Caledonia, and total U.S. imports of other dairy products from all Pacific island countries other than Australia and New Zealand were valued at only $2,000 in 1991 (USDA, Economic Research Service, \"Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States; Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,\" 1992). Therefore, we do not expect that this proposed revision would have any effect on U.S. businesses that rely on imported milk or milk products from ruminants. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number. is 0579-0015.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 98 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation of certain animal embryos and semen to protect the health of U.S. livestock and poultry. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers these regulations. APHIS officials believe that amendments to the regulations may be appropriate at this time as a result of advances in veterinary technology. Accordingly, we are seeking input from the public on the practicability, economic implications, and animal health ramifications of the regulations and any suggested amendments. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the regulations by contacting the person listed above under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The regulations are divided into three subparts. Subpart A provides the requirements for importing ruminant and swine embryos from countries free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease and for importing embryos of horses and asses. The regulations require, among other things, that importers of these embryos obtain an import permit from APHIS. The regulations also provide specific conditions regarding the conception, collection, and transport of imported embryos. Upon arrival in this country, an embryo must be accompanied by a health certificate, and the importer must provide a document that includescertain information to an inspector at the port. Subpart B provides the requirements for importing cattle embryos from countries where rinderpest or foot-and- mouth disease exists. The regulations in this part include some of the same requirements as in Subpart A, but Subpart B includes many additional requirements to ensure that imported cattle embryos from these countries do not introduce either of these serious diseases. For example, the regulations in Subpart B contain detailed requirements concerning the health status of the donor dam, the layout and construction of the embryo collection unit, and various procedures, Including procedures for.embryo collection. Subpart C pertains to the importation of certain animal semen. Among other things, the regulations require that importers of certain animal semen obtain an import permit from APHIS and provide a declaration including certain information to an inspector at the port upon the semen's arrival. The regulations also include specific requirements for the importation of semen from countries affected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease. We believe several aspects of the regulations could be revised to make the importation of certain animal embryos and semen more practical for importers without increasing the risk that these products will introduce exotic livestock and poultry diseases into the United States. For example, thp regulations for importing. cattle embryos from countries where rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists specify that, among other things, the donor dams must undergo several tests and the embryos must be washed at least times prior to exportation. Recent scientific data has confirmed what we had suspected-that embryo washing is a more effective disease control tool than had been previously believed. As a result, we now elieve some of the required disease testing of the donor dams could be reduced or eliminated without increasing the chances of importing infected embryos from these countries. We are particularly interested in receiving comments concerning the importation of embryos and semen from countries affected with serious livestock diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease and hog cholera, that are exotic to the United States. Such comments should address potential risks and recommendations for reducing them. We would appreciate it if the comments are supported by references from scientific and professional literature. Commenters who are aware of opposing viewpoints to their positions are alsoencouraged to cite such contradictory opinions and their reasons for refuting them. APHIS officials will carefully review all comments received by the close of the comment period. If we decide to propose amendments to the regulations, we will publish a proposal in the Federal Register. Authority. 7 U.S.C. 1622; 21 U.S.C. 371.2(d).

Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model 146 series airplanes. The CAA advises that lift spoiler jacks were manufactured with an excess of cadmium plating on the spindles. This excess of cadmium plating may cause the spindles to stick, and subsequently, the lift spoiler warning system may indicate falsely that lift spoilers are unlocked. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a. failure of the \"LIFT SPOILER UNLOCKED\" indication system. British Aerospace has issued BAe 146 Inspection Service Bulletin S.B.27-137, dated November 17, 1992, that describes procedures for a functional test to ensure proper operation of the \"LIFT SPOILER UNLOCKED\" indication system and repair or replacement of any lift spoiler jack spindle that fails the functional test. (This service bulletin refers to Dowty Aerospace Wolverhampton Service Bulletin P308- 27-005, dated October 2, 1992, as an additional service information source.) The CAA classified the British Aerospace service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of \u00a7 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation36627 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a functional test to ensure proper operation of the \"LIFT SPOILER UNLOCKED\" indication system, and replacement of any lift spoiler jack spindle that fails the functional test. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the British Aerospace service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 45 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $12,375, or $275 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution' of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39-AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: British Aerospace: Docket 93-NM-11-AD, Applicability: Model BAe 146 series airplanes equipped with a lift spoiler jack, part number P308-45-0002 or P308-45- 0102; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the \"LIFT SPOILER UNLOCKED\" indication system, accomplish the following: (a) At the next scheduled maintenance Inspection of the lift spoiler configuration warning microswitches, but no later than 15 months after the effective date of this AD, perform a functional test of the lift spoiler configuration warning microswitches in accordance with British Aerospace BAe 146 Inspection Service Bulletin S.B.27-137, dated November 17, 1992.

ACTION: Proposed rule; withdrawal. SUMMARY: This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed to modify the Presque Isle, ME Transition Area. Since issuing the NPRM, the FAA has conducted a re- evaluation of terminal airspace in the New England Region to update all control zones and transition areas, and will make the proposed modification part of another notice, therefore, this proposed rule is not required. Accordingly, the proposal is withdrawn. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles M. Taylor, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ANE-530.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Presque Isle, ME Transition Area was published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1992 (57 FR 11698). The proposed rule would have modified the Presque Isle, E Transition Area by increasing slightly the area north of Loring Air Force Base (AFB). Since issuing the proposed rule the FAA has conducted a re-evaluation of terminal airspace in the New England region to update all control zones and transition areas and keep those areas in conformity with the requirements of the United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). The FAA will incorporate modifications proposed for the Presque Isle, ME Transition Area into a new notice of proposed rulemaking to cover all36628 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules terminal airspace in the New England Region. Transition areas are published in \u00a7 71.181 of FAA Order 7400.7A dated November 2, 1992, and effective November 27, 1992, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Presque Isle, ME Transition Area is published in that Order. Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, does not preclude the agency from issuing another notice in the future, and does not commit the agency to any course of action in the future. Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and, therefore, is not covered by Executive Order 12291, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to amend the regulations which govern the nation's drawbridges. The proposed amendments would clarify the responsibilities of vessel operators requesting drawbridge openings and prohibit vessel operators from signalling for unnecessary drawbridge openings. This action is intended to betteraccommodate the needs of vehicular traffic and reduce the wear and tear on draw machinery while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 23, 1993. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G-LRA/3406) (CGD 91-059), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the above address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267-1477. The Executive Secretary maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry Tyssens, Alterations, Drawbridges, and Systems Branch (G- NBR-1), (202) 267-0376. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, identify this rulemaking (CGD 91-059) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each comment. The Coast Guard requests that all comments and attachmentsbe submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying and electronic filing. If not practical, a second copy of any bound materials is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rulemaking in view of the comments. The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council at the address under ADDRESSES. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register. Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. LarryTyssens, Project Manager, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Background and Purpose Currently, 33 CFR 117.11 specifies that no vessel owner or operator shall signal a drawbridge to open for any nonstructural vessel appurtenance which is not essential to navigation or which is easily lowered. This section does not address vessels that have no appurtenances and that can pass safely underneath the drawbridge in question in the closed position, or vessels which signal for a drawbridge opening with no intention of passing through the bridge. Under \u00a7117.5, drawtenders are required to open a bridge when a proper signal is given. Unnecessary drawbridge openings can cause vehicular delays and inordinate wear and tear on draw machinery. Therefore, it has been suggested that there is a need for a regulation requiring that vessel owners and operators refrain from requesting such unnecessary drawbridge openings. Also, it has been suggested that defining the terms used in the regulation would provide mariners with additional guidance concerning their responsibilities under the regulations when requesting the opening of a drawbridge. Discussion of Proposed Amendments The proposed amendments would revise \u00a7 117.11. The section heading would read \"Unnecessary opening of the draw\" and the revised section would prohibit an owner or operator from signalling for a drawbridge to open unless there is insufficient vertical clearance for the vessel to pass safely under the drawbridge in the closed position. The revised provision would also prohibit an owner or operator from signalling for a drawbridge to open for any purpose other than to pass through the drawbridge opening..In order to clarify vessel operators' responsibilities under \u00a7 117.11, a new \u00a7 117.4 entitled \"Definitions\" is proposed. That section would define the terms \"nonstructural,\" \"appurtenance,\" \"lowerable,\" and \"not essential to navigation.\" These are the key factors a vessel operator must consider in determining whether there is sufficient clearance to pass under a closed draw or whether signalling for the draw to open is appropriate. Examples would be provided in the definition of \"lowerable\" to provide guidance for determining whether an appurtenance would be considered \"lowerable\" either by manual or mechanical methods for purposes of passing through a drawbridge.36629 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules Drawbridge openings that are unnecessary to the safe passage of mariners can cause vehicular traffic delays and unnecessary wear and tear on draw machinery. These proposed revisions are intended to prevent such unnecessary openings while allowing for the reasonable needs of navigation. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under the \"Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures\" (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. This proposal is operational in nature and, if adopted, will result in no cost to the public. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \"Small entities\" include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as \"small business concerns\" under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This proposal requires no new equipment and imposes no additional expense on small businesses. Additionally, if the proposal is adopted, there will be less delay to vehicular traffic. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to regulate the nation's drawbridges across the navigable rivers and other waters of the U.S. has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Therefore, the Coast Guard does not expect this proposal, if adopted, to raiseany preemption issues with respect to state actions on the same subject matter. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation because it is a Bridge Administration Program action involving the promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend 33 CFR part 117 as follows: PART 117-DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 117 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. is added to read as follows: \u00a7117.4 Definitions. Certain terms used in this part are defined in this section. Appurtenance. The term\"appurtenance\" means an attachment or accessory extending beyond the hull or superstructure that is not an integral part of the vessel and is not needed for a vessel's piloting, propelling, controlling, or collision avoidance capabilities. Lowerable. The term \"lowerable\" means the nonstructural vessel appurtenance can be mechanically or manually lowered and raised again. The term \"lowerable\" also applies to a nonstructural vessel appurtenance which can be modified to make the item flexible, hinged, collapsible, or telescopic such that it can be mechanically or manually lowered and raised again. Failure to make the modification is considered equivalent to refusing to lower a lowerable nonstructural appurtenance that is not essential to navigation. Examples of appurtenances which are considered to be lowerable include, but are not limited to, fishing outriggers, radio antennae, television antennae, false stacks, and masts purely for ornamental purposes. Examples of appurtenances which are not considered to be lowerable include, but are not limitedto, radar antennae, flying bridges, sailboat masts, piledriver leads, spud frames on hydraulic dredges, drilling derricks' substructures and buildings, cranes on drilling or construction vessels, or other items of permanent and fixed equipment. Nonstructural. The term\"nonstructural\" means that the item is not rigidly fixed to the vessel and is thus susceptible to relocation or alternation. Not essential to navigation. The term\"not essential to navigation\" means the nonstructural vessel appurtenance does not adversely affect the vessel's piloting, propulsion, control, or collision avoidance capabilities when in the lowered position. 3. Section 117.11 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7117.11 Unnecessary opening of the draw. No vessel owner or operator shall- (a) Signal a drawbridge to open if the vertical clearance is sufficient to allow the vessel, after all lowerable nonstructural vessel appurtenances that are not essential to navigation have been lowered, to safely pass under the drawbridge in the closed position; or (b) Signal a drawbridge to open for any purpose other than to pass through the drawbridge opening.

I [ET Docket No. 93-198; FCC 93-328] Preparation for International Telecommunication Union World Radiocommunlcation Conferences AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; Notice of inquiry. SUMMARY: In December, 1992, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) underwent a major restructuring. At that time, it was decided that World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs, formerly WARCs) should be convened every two years. The first WRC (WRC-93) under the new structure will be held November 15-19, 1993, in Geneva, Switzerland. WRC-93 is expected to set agendas for the 1995 and36630 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules 1997 conferences, and will not address the merits of particular regulatory provisions in specific topic areas. The Commission's Notice of Inquiry solicits public comment regarding substantive issues that the Commission should consider advocating for placement on the agendas of the 1995, 1997 or future WRCs. DATES: Comments are due on July 19, 1993. Reply comments are due on July 29, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Damon C.

Summary of Notice of Inquiry 1. The ITU Council (Council) has directed WRC-93 to consider scheduling two specific issues for WRC- 95: (1) A review of the Radio Regulations based upon the report of the Voluntary Group of Experts (VGE) (addressing service definitions related to and organizational structure of the international Table of Frequency Allocations and approaches to simplifying the Radio Regulations generally); and (2) guidance on using spectrum allocated internationally to the mobile-satellite service. WRC-93 is also directed to schedule the remainder of the WR-95 agenda, and to make recommendations for a preliminary agenda for WRC-97. 2. To reach informed judgments about the desirability and feasibility of including various telecommunication issues on future WRC agendas, the NO solicits public comment. Beyond the two issues that the ITU Council directed WRC-93 to consider scheduling, supra, the NOI identifies the following topics as candidates for inclusion on'the agendas of future WRCs: (1) Broadcast- satellite service (sound); (2) wind profiler radars; (3) space services; and (4) high frequency broadcasting. Other matters, including resolutions andrecommendations from past conferences, also are likely to be considered at WRC-93. With the biennial scheduling of WRCs, it is hoped that issues may be scheduled for consideration systematically, providing for greater lead time for preparations for conferences. The urgency to include all topics on the next scheduled WRC should be reduced now that subsequent opportunities to consider subjects will occur every two years. Individual topics that might be considered at WRC-95 or WRC-97 are discussed below. It should be noted that the two major topics the Council directed WRC-95 to consider are likely to occupy a considerable amount of time. 3. Report of the Voluntary Group of Experts. The VGE work primarily concerns identifying ways to simplify the Table of Frequency Allocations, the related service definitions and the regulatory and procedural provisions in the international Radio Regulations. Following completion of its work, the VGE will issue a report (by the first quarter of 1994) making recommendations for simplifying the Radio Regulations. The VGE report will be forwarded to ITU member administrations for consideration at WRC-95. 4. Mobile-Satellite Services (MSS). There are several domestic proceedings that could result in new U.S. based MSS systems intended to operate globally. To facilitate the possible implementation of future U.S. MSS systems, it is important that U.S. conference delegations insure there is an appropriate MSS environment for U.S. systems, 5. Broadcast-Satellite Service (sound) (BSS (sound)). In GEN Docket No. 90- 357, the Commission has proposed to allocate the 2310-2360 MHz band for satellite digital audio radio service (satellite DARS), designated internationally as BSS (sound). The 2310-2360 MHz band is one of three different frequency bands allocated by WARC-92 for BSS (sound). Additionally, WARC-92 resolved to convene a planning conference for use of those bands before 1998. Until that conference, to reserve future planning options, only the upper 25 MHz of each of the three BSS (sound) bands can be used. The two opportunities to consider planning the BSS (sound) bands are the 1995 and 1997 WRCs. 6. Wind Profiler Radars. Wind profiler radar systems use radar signals to measure wind speed and direction, vertical wind velocity, intensity of turbulence and precipitation parameters. WARC-92 invited the CCIR to make appropriate technical recommendations regarding use offrequencies near 50, 400, and 1000 MHz for wind profiler radar operations. Consideration of appropriate frequency assignments for wind profilers was invited for the next competent WRC, which would be WRC-95. This matter is important to United States interests as the Commission has recently issued a NPRMto allocate spectrum for wind profilers. 7. Space Services. WARC-92 adopted RES712 that resolved that the next competent WRC considers certain matters concerning the space services. These matters are: (1) Worldwide primary allocations for the earth- exploration and space research services in the appropriate bands within the 8- 20 GHz range; (2) intersatellite service requirements near 23 GHz; (3) providing spectrum for space-based active earth sensors around the 35 GHz band; and (4) including certain CCIR-developed space science service coordination parameters in Appendix 28 of the Radio Regulations. 8. High Frequency (HF) Broadcasting. Since 1959, HF broadcast frequency usage has been coordinated worldwide by use of voluntary consultation procedures contained in Article 17 of the international Radio Regulations. In 1987, a HF Broadcasting Conference (HFBC-87) was held to consider a computer-based planning system to replace the notification and coordination procedures of Article 17. Difficulties arose in developing a computer-based planning system that could address the scope and flexibility of all administrations' requirements. The current notification and coordination procedures remain in force. At WARC-92, additional frequencies were allocated to the HF broadcast service. However, use of these frequencies is subject to planning procedures to be developed at a future conference. WARC-92 also instructed the IFRB to report on the continued development of a computer-based planning system to the next competent WARC. The U.S. will have to assess the urgency of considering a computer- based HF broadcasting planning system. Affecting a U.S. position on this issue is the fact that the current Article 17 procedures generally satisfy U.S. HF broadcasting needs. 9. Resolutions and Recommendations from Previous Conferences. As discussed previously, there are many unresolved resolutions and recommendations (RES/RECs) from previous telecommunication conferences. An example of this category is Res. 113 (WARC-92). Res. 113 deals with adjustments to the fixed service that have become necessary36631 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules because of recent changes in frequency allocations within the 1-3 GHz range. Such adjustments could bear directly on domestic proceedings, such as PCS. These RES/RECs will ultimately need to be brought to the agendas of competent WRCs. The primary issue is timing for consideration of a specific RES/REC in a way that best serves U.S. interests. Procedural Information 10. Authority for this Notice of Inquiry is contained in sections 4(i), 303(r), and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. sections 154(i), 303(r), and 403. Pursuant to \u00a7 1.1204(a)(4) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.1204(a)(4), no ex parte restrictions apply to this proceeding. 11. U.S. government conference preparations have begun and are being conducted by the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) and its Ad Hoc 208 interagency group. Ad Hoc 208 will be responsible for coordinating the preparatory activities of affected government agencies that use frequencies allocated for the government's telecommunications needs. The IRAC will make its conference recommendations to NTIA, which is responsible for developing Executive Branch telecommunications policies. NTIA's recommendations for U.S. policy and proposals will then be forwarded to the Department of State for coordination with the Commission's recommendations. Because the Commission participates in IRAC through a liaison representative, we expect the Commission's and NTIA's recommendations for U.S. proposals to be generally consistent. 12. The Commission's recommendations will be forwarded to the Department of State for coordination with NTIA's recommendations as discussed above. WRC-93 is scheduledfor November 11-15, 1993. Therefore, the Department of State would normally submit U.S. proposals by September 10, 1993. In view of the short period available for preparation and submission of U.S. proposals, the Commission is requesting comments within 21 days of the release of this Notice of Inquiry at the Commission's headquarters, and reply comments within 10 days thereafter. The dates are given below. 13. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1.415 and 1.149, interested parties may file comments on or before July 19, 1993, and reply comments on or before July 29, 1993. All relevant and timely comments will be considered by the Commission before taking further action in this proceeding. To file formally in this proceeding, participants must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments. If participants want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of their comments, an original and nine copies must be filed.

Discussion Section 314 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, provides that the rate of penalty per pound for a kind of tobacco that is subject to marketing quotas shall be seventy-five (75) percent of the average market price for such tobacco for the immediately preceding marketing year..For all kinds of tobacco subject to marketing quotas, except Puerto Rico (type 46) tobacco, The Agricultural Statistics Board, National Agricultural Statistical Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture determines and announces annually the average market prices for each type of tobacco. The penalty rates are determined on the basis of this information. The national marketing quota for Puerto Rico (type 46) tobacco for the immediately preceding marketing year was \"0\" pounds. There is no record of any such tobacco being marketed. Consequently, the penalty rate for the 1993-1994 marketing year cannot be determined based on seventy-five (75) percent of the average market price for the immediately preceding year. Therefore, the penalty rate for Puerto Rico (type 46) tobacco for the 1993- 1994 marketing year shall be the same as the penalty rate determined for the 1989-1990 marketing year, the last year in which marketing information is available. Since the determination of the 1993- 1994 marketing year rates of penalty reflect only mathematical computations which are required to be made in accordance with a statutory formula, it has been determined that no further public rulemaking is required. Determination Accordingly, it has been determined the 1993-1994 marketing year rates of penalty for kinds of tobacco subject to marketing quotas are as follows:RATE OF PENALTY [1993-1994 Marketing Year] Cents per Kinds of tobacco pound Flue-Cured .................................. 129 Burley ......................................... 136 Fire-Cured (Type 21) ..................

This notice also announces that the value of agricultural commodities and other foods provided to States during the past school year met the level of assistance authorized under the National School Lunch Act. Thus, there will be no shortfall cash payments to States for the NSLP for the 1993 school year. The annually programmed level of assistance was met in food donations by June 30, 1993.

(See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.) This notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to Office of Management and Budget review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. National Average Minimum Value of Donated Foods for the Period July 1, 1993 through June30, 1994 This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and 17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Section 6(e)(1)(A) of the Act establishes the national average value of donated food assistance to be given to States for each lunch served in NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. Pursuant to section 6(e)(1)(B), this amount is subject to annual adjustments as of July I of each year to reflect changes in. the Price Index for Fca Used in Schools and Institutions. Section 17(h)(1) of the Act provides that the same value of assistance in donated foods for school lunches shall also be established for lunches and suppers36635 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 9, 1993 / Notices served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Notice is hereby given that the national average minimum value of donated foods, or cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFR part 210) and per lunch and supper under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) shall be 14.00 cents for the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994. The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed on the basis of five major food components in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oil). Each component is assigned a proportional value using the appropriate relative weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food assistance is adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a three- month simple average value of this Price Index for March, April and May. The three-month average of the Price Index increased by 1.55 percent from 121.34 for March, April and May of 1992 to 123.29 for the same three months in 1993. When computed on the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent, the resulting national average for the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994 will be 14.00 cents per meal. This is the same as the rate in effect for the past school year. Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods equal in value to the sum of the national average value of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national average payment established under section 4 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). Such schools are eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for processing and handling expenses related to the use of such foods. Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1760(d)(7)) as \"schools that do not participate in the school lunch program under this Act, but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.\" For the 1994 school year, commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated food assistance valued at 30.50 cents for each lunch served. This amount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announced in this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average payment factor for school year 1994. The section 4 factor for commodity schools does not include thetwo cents per lunch increase for schools where 60 percent of the lunches were served in the second preceding year free or at reduced prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Cash in Lieu Payments-Value of Donated Commodities for School Year 1993 Section 6(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulations governing cash in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretary of Agriculture by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agricultural commodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during that school year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250), these foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimated value is less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized under section 6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July I of that school year to pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the difference between the value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorized assistance for each State. During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average value of donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 14.00 cents. In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodity assistance was $566,282,209 for school year 1993. The Secretary has determined that at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by June 30, 1993 to meet the mandated level of assistance. Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments will be made for the school year ending June 30, 1993.

Eadie, Chief, Policy and Program Development Branch, Child Nutrition Division, FNS, USDA, Alexandria, Virginia 22302, (703) 305- 2620. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.553, No. 10.555 and No. 10.556 and are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.) This Notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to OMB review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. Background Special Milk Program for Children Pursuant to section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1772), the Department announces the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. Wor the period July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1994, the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program is 11.00 cents. This reflects no change over the current reimbursement rate because the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231) from May 1992 to May 1993 (from a level of 120.5 in May 1992 to 120.6 in May1993) did not change significantly enough to trigger a change in the reimbursement rate. As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which elect to serve milk free to eligible children continue to receive the average cost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased during the claim period divided by the total number of purchased half-pints) for each half-pint served to an eligible child. National. School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs Pursuant to section 11 of the National School Lunch Act, (42 U.S.C. 1759a), and section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, (42 U.S.C. 1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the National Average Payment Factors and to the maximum Federal reimbursement rates for meals served to children participating in the National School Lunch Program. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. The changes in the national average payment rates for schools and residential child care institutions for the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994 reflect a 1.8 percent increase in the Price Index during the 12-month period May 1992 to May 1993 (from a level of 140.4 in May 1992 to 142.9 in May 1993). Lunch Payment Factors Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments to States to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 National Average Payment Factors for lunches served under the National School Lunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served by school food authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served in the school lunch program during the second preceding school year were served free or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunches served by school food authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were served free or at a reduced price. To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National School Lunch Act provides special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providing free and reduced price lunches. The section 11 National Average Payment Factor for eachreduced price lunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch. As authorized under sections 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1757, 1759a), maximum reimbursement rates for each type of lunch are prescribed by the Department in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursement of Federal funds to school food authorities. Breakfast Payment Factors Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 establishes National Average Payment Factors for free, reduced price and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Program and additional payments for schools determined to be in \"severe need\" because they serve a high percentage of needy children. Revised Payments The following specific section 4 and section 11 National Average Payment Factors and maximum reimbursement rates are in effect through June 30, 1994. Due to a higher cost of living, the average payments and maximum reimbursements for Alaska and Hawaii are higher than those for all other States. The District of Columbia, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, the Federated State of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshalls, and the Republic of Palau use the figures specified for the contiguous States.

ACTION: Notice of exemption from appeal. SUMMARY: This Is notification that timber salvage harvest and reforestation activities to recover and rehabilitate natural resources from recent insect epidemics on the Wren project area, Idaho City Ranger District, Boise National Forest, are exempt from appeal in accordance with 36 CFR 217.4(a)(11). DATES: Effective July 8,1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Terry Padilla, Idaho City Ranger District, Boise National Forest, P.O. Box 129, Idaho City ID 83631. Telephone: 208-392-6681. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Several years of drought in southwest Idaho have reduced soil moisture and weakened conifer trees. Consequently,Douglas-fir bark beetle populations have dramatically increased and reached epidemic levels on the Boise National Forest. It is estimated that more than 400,000 trees larger than 12 inches in diameter have died on the Forest as a result of insect damage since 1986. As part of the effort to recover and rehabilitate natural resources damaged by the insect epidemic, Idaho City Ranger District personnel have developed a proposal to harvest dead and dying timber, and reforest damaged areas. The Forest Service has completed the Wren Environmental Assessment. Issues have been identified, alternatives have been developed, and an analysis of the effects of implementing timber salvage and other recovery activities is complete. The analysis area for the Wren Salvage is located in the Wren and Beaver Creek drainages of the North Fork Boise River, and Browns Creek drainage of the Middle Fork Boise River. The Forest will salvage trees dead or dying from the bark beetles epidemic on 500 acres and recover approximately 2.0 million board feet, using helicopter yarding (80 percent) and tractor/jammer yarding (20 percent). The Douglas-fir beetle infestation has created several open areas of dead and dying trees. Salvage of these stands could result in \"salvage openings,\" resembling clearcuts, in the project area. A total of 100 acres of salvage openings would be created. These openings would range up to 5 to 10 acres in size. These acres would be rehabilitated by planting with ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, to increase the site's timber productivity, resilience and diversity of forest stands. Natural regeneration will be used to reforest small areas (less than 5 acres in size). No new road construction would occur. Fourteen helicopter landings would be used; 5 are existing and 9 new landings would be built. Management direction for the Middle Fork Boise River, Rabbit Creek/North Fork Boise River, and Crooked-Bear Management Areas is established in the Boise National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan). The Forest Plan provides for the removal of salvage timber from lands within the project area. In addition, the Forest Plan prescribes standards to protect soil, water, wildlife, visual, and other on-site resources. The proposed action for the Wren Salvage project is consistent with standards and guidelines, objectives, and direction contained in the Forest Plan. The project is not within areas considered for wilderness in the Forest Plan, nor within areas recommended for36639 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices wilderness in the recent legislative proposal entitled \"Idaho Wilderness, Sustainable Forests and Communities Act of 1993\". Forest Pest Management Specialists and District Foresters have analyzed the insect situation and have found no economical or practical means to control the current insect epidemic. Although salvage harvesting and reforestation will not control the epidemic, these activities would: (1) Recover valuable timber that would otherwise deteriorate, and (2) reforest those areas that have been left without tree cover as a result of the insect- caused mortality. Through the timber salvage operations, breeding insects can be removed in the logs and Knutson- Vandenburg (K-V) funds can be generated for use to restore forest resources that have been damaged by the insect epidemic. The Forest Supervisor has determined through preliminary scoping and environmental analysis that there is justification to expedite this project. The decision for the Wren project may be implemented after publication of this notice in the Federal Register and after the decision document has been signed by the responsible official. If the project is delayed because of an appeal (delays of up to 150 days are possible), it is likely that much of the salvage harvest could not be implemented during the 1993 normal operating season. This would result in a loss of volume and value of the timber due to deterioration. The total estimated value of the merchantable dead, dying and unhealthy timber, based on current bid premiums (6/93) is $850,000. Of this, approximately $215,000 would be 'returned to counties from 25 percent fund receipts. Delays resulting from appeals could cause the loss of this value and potentially make the salvage sale unattractive to timber purchasers. This would jeopardize the objectives of the recovery and rehabilitation project. Pursuant to 36 CFR 217.4(a)(11), it is my decision to exempt the Wren Salvage Project, Idaho City Ranger District, Boise National Forest, from appeal. The environmental assessment discloses the effects of the proposed action on the environment and addresses issues resulting from the proposal. Dated: June 30, 1993. Robert C. Joslin, Deputy Regional Forester, Intermountain Region, USDA Service Tenmile Creek Watershed, Whatcom County, WA AGENCY: Soil Conservation Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Regulations (7 CFR part 650); the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared for the Tenmile Creek Watershed, Whatcom County, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lynn A. Brown, State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, Rock Pointe Tower West 316 Boone Avenue, suite 450, Spokane, Washington 99201, telephone (509) 353-2337. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Lynn A. Brown, State* Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project. The project purposes are control and prevention of nonpoint pollution problems and improving salmon spawning and rearing habitat in the Tenmile Creek Watershed. The planned works of improvement include the construction of 36 animal waste storage facilities and appurtenances, 11.5 miles of stream corridor rehabilitation, and accelerated technical assistance for land treatment. The Notice of a Finding or No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Frank R. Easter, Assistant State Conservationist (Programs). No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register. (This activity is listed In the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under NO.10.904, Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials) Dated: June 25, 1993.

FINAL DETERMINATIONS: The Department determines that imports of uranium from Ukraine and Tajikistan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 735 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Because respondents failed to provide adequate information in a timely manner, we have based our LTFV calculations on the best information otherwise available (BIA). ,he estimated margin is shown in the Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice. Case History Since the publication of our preliminary determinations in the Federal Register on June 3, 1992, (57 FR 23380), the following events have occurred. Pursuant to a request made by V/O Techsnabexport (Tenex), Nuexco Trading Corporation (Nuexco), Global Nuclear Services and Supply (GNSS), and Energy Fuels Nuclear (EFN) (collectively referred to herein as Tenex), the Department postponed the final determinations for these investigations until October 16, 1992 (57 FR 30946, July 13, 1992). On July 15, 1992, the Department received an untimely response from Ukraine to our questionnaire. Thisvm IIIIII31%40 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices response stated that no uranium has been shipped from Ukraine to the United States since December 1, 1991, and before that date Ukraine was not an independent country. Therefore, it did not have responsibility for its exports. On September 16, 1992, the Department initialed a proposed suspension agreement with the Governments of Ukraine and Tajikistan. On October 7, 1992, we received comments regarding the proposed suspension agreement from Ukraine and Tajikistan, petitioners, and the U.S. Department of Energy. On October 15, 1992, we received a letter from petitioners in which they conditionally waived their right to comment on a proposed agreement which might be initialed by Tajikistan. On September 21, 1992, we received case briefs from petitioners, Tenex, the Yankee Group, Ukraine, and Tajikistan. We received rebuttal briefs from these parties on September 28, 1992. On September 25, 1992, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) sustained the Department's decision to continue these investigations against Ukraine and Tajikistan, formerly constituent republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). See, Techsnabexport, Ltd. et al. v. United States, 802 F. Supp. 469 (CIT 1992). On October 13, 1992, Homestake Mining Company withdrew as a petitioner in these investigations. On October 16, 1992, the Governments of the United States and the Governments of Ukraine and Tajikistan signed agreements suspendingthese investigations. On April 19, 1993, pursuant to a request by the Government of Ukraine (GOU), the Department published a notice in the Federal Register terminating the suspension agreement and resuming the investigation with respect to Ukraine effective April 12, 1993 (58 FR 21144). On May 19, 1993, pursuant to a request by the Government of Tajikistan (GOT), the Department published a notice in the Federal Register terminating the suspension agreement and resuming the investigation with respect to Tajikistan effective April 26, 1993 (58 FR 29197). We stated in both of those notices that we would only use information already submitted in the investigations. On May 25, 1993, the GOU and GOT submitted letters requesting that the Department postpone the final determinations in their respective investigations by 60 days, in accordance with section 353.20(b) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR \u00a7 353.20(b)). On May 26, 1993, petitioners objected to these requests onthe grounds that the Department had compelling reasons to deny them. On June 4, 1993, the Department determined that no additional time was needed for any parties to review the preliminary determinations nor was any additional time needed for the Department to reach its final determinations and, therefore, found compelling reasons to deny the requests for postponement. Scope of the Investigation We have determined that the merchandise covered by these investigations constitutes one class or kind of merchandise (see DOC Position to Comment 3, below). We have further determined that highly enriched uranium (HEU) is included in the scope of these investigations. For the Department's rationale regarding this issue, see Memorandum to Alan M. Dunn from Francis J. Sailer dated October 16, 1992, and DOC Position to Comment 4, below. The above- referenced memorandum and all other memoranda cited in this notice can be found in the public file in the Central Records Unit, Room B099 of the Main Commerce Building. Since the preliminary determinations, the Department has clarified the scope of these investigations for the U.S. Customs Service. \"Milling\" or\"conversion\" performed in a third country does not confer origin for purposes of these investigations. Milling consists of processing uranium ore into uranium concentrate. Conversion consists of transforming uranium concentrate into natural uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Since milling or conversion does not confer origin, uranium ore or concentrate of Ukrainian or Tajik origin that is subsequently milled and/or converted in a third country will be considered of Ukrainian or Tajik origin, respectively. The Department continues to regard enrichment of uranium as conferring The merchandise covered by these investigations includes natural uranium - in the form of uranium ores and concentrates; natural uranium metal and natural uranium compounds; alloys, dispersions (including cermets), ceramic products and mixtures containing natural uranium or natural uranium compounds; uranium enriched in U235 and its compounds; alloys, dispersions (including cermets), ceramic products, and mixtures containing uranium enriched in t23 or compounds of uranium enriched in U23. Both low enriched uranium (LEU) and HEU are included within the scope of these investigations. LEU is uranium enrichedin U235 to a level of up to 20 percent, while HEU is uranium enriched in U235 to a level of 20 percent or more. The uranium subject to these investigations is provided for Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these proceedings is dispositive. Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is June I through November 30, 1991. Best Information Available We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of BIA is appropriate in these investigations. In deciding whether to use BIA, section 776(c) provides that the Department may take into account whether the respondent provided the information requested in a timely manner and in the form required. As stated in our preliminary determinations, Tenex, the sole exporter of the subject merchandise during the POI, submitted certain information with respect to U.S. price. However, the Department did not receive adequate and timely factors of production information, despite extensive efforts by the Department to obtain such information. We eventually received a partial response from Tenex with regard to factors of production information that was unusable for many reasons. First, the information provided in the response was severely deficient on its face in that it did not provide the data requested by the Department in its questionnaire. The data provided was primarily cost data, not factors of production data. Second, Tenex is not a producer of the subject merchandise. It is merely an exporter and, as such, does not have first-hand knowledge of the production enterprises. Verification of second-hand knowledge would be a futile endeavor. Third, at the time of our preliminary determinations, the response was not certified by officials at the production enterprises. Although the Department did receive an untimely certification (two months after the information was filed), it was from an official of only one of several production enterprises in question. Since the preliminary determinations, the Department received a response from Ukraine. This response did not provide the information sought by the36641 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices Department and was submitted well after the Department's deadline. The incomplete and untimely nature of these responses requires the Department to use BIA. BIA is based on information submitted in the petition and detailed in our initiation notice. Limited modifications to this information were made, as appropriate, in response to the comments submitted by interested parties and two other parties from which the Department solicited information (see United States Price, Foreign Market Value, and Interested Parties Comments sections, below, and Memorandum from Linda K. Eads and Lawrence P. Sullivan to Marie Parker and Susan H. Kuhbach dated May 27, 1992). Tenex has argued that it should not be held responsible for the lack of response from the production enterprises and, therefore, it should not be penalized for the inaction of those entities. However, in a nonmarket economy (NME) case, the Department presumes central control of all production and exporting facilities (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Tungsten Ore Concentrates from the People's Republic of China (Tungsten), 56 FR 47738 (September 20, 1991)). Thus, the Department holds each country's central government responsible for providing an adequate response to all sections of the Department's questionnaire. With respect to Ukraine and Tajikistan, the Department requires a response which provides complete and accurate data on U.S. sales and factors of production in order to consider any response for a determination. Tenex's response represents only a small part of the information required by the Department to perform an LTFV analysis, and is, therefore, materially deficient. Fair Value Comparisons To determine whether sales of uranium from Ukraine and Tjikistan to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States prices (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the United States Price and Foreign Market Value sections of this notice. As stated above, the margin is based entirely on BIA. The Department's practice is to base BIA on a simple average of the margins based on petition data, as opposed to the highest margin based on petition data, when we determine that respondents have attempted to cooperate with the Department's investigations (see, e.g., Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel Pipe From Taiwan, 57 FR 17892(April 28, 1992)). We continue to believe that Tenex attempted to cooperate in these proceedings because it supplied the Department with USP data and attempted to provide FMV data. Therefore, we are basing the final margin on an average of the margins for uranium concentrate and enriched uranium derived from the petition. United States Price Petitioners' calculation of USP is based on an estimated weighted average f.o.b. import price taken from U.S. Bureau of Census statistics on imports of natural and enriched uranium from the former USSR during the period January 1990 through August 1991. Foreign Market Value Petitioners alleged, and the Department determined, that the former USSR was an NME country during the POI within the meaning of section 773(c) of the Act (see Memorandum from David Mueller to Carole Showers dated March 24, 1992). In accordance with section 771(18)(C) of the Act, any determination that a foreign country is an NME shall remain in effect until revoked. This determination covers a geographic area, each part of which assumes the previous NME character in the event of dissolution. cf Techsnabexport, 802 F. Supp. at 472 (\"[In order to fully effectuate the antidumping laws, imports from successor countries may bear the duties calculated based on the imports from the predecessor nations.\") Therefore, Ukraine and Tajikistan will be treated as NMEs until the Department reverses its determination. In these investigations, no information has been presented which would permit the Department to reconsider the NME status of Ukraine or Tajikistan. Accordingly, petitioners calculated FMV on the basis of constructed value (CV), using the factors of production methodology specified in section 773(c) of the Act. Petitioners calculated separate CVs for mined and enriched uranium. We have followed the methodology used in the initiation of these investigations (56 FR 63711, 63712, December 5, 1991), as modified in the preliminary determinations, except in the following instances: (1) For mined uranium, we adjusted the Namibian labor value for a holiday bonus which was incorrectly excluded, and (2) for enriched uranium, we calculated the CV based on the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (BNFL) 1991 financial statement because the 1991 statement covers a period nearly concurrent with calendar year 1990. In the preliminarydeterminations, the Department stated its intention to express, where possible. all factors and values in 1990 terms, as BIA, in order to ensure consistency. Interested Party Comments All written comments submitted by -the interested parties in these investigations which have not been previously addressed in this notice are addressed below, The comments by petitioners, Tenex, and the Yankee Group were submitted in the context of all 12 investigations involving uranium from the newly independent states of the former USSR (NIS). Hence, while reference is made to the NIS or to certain states of the NIS, we are only concerned here with Ukraine and Tajikistan. Comment 1 Tenex asserts that the Department has improperly transformed its single investigation of uranium imports from the USSR into separate investigations of such imports from each of the NIS. Specifically, Tenex asserts the following: (1) The International Trade Commission's (ITC) preliminary injury determination with respect to uranium imports from the USSR does not support the Department's preliminary , determinations or its order to suspend liquidation of entries of such imports from the NIS; (2) the Department issued its preliminary determinations without properly initiating investigations with respect to uranium imports from the NIS; (3) the record contains no factual information sustaining investigations of or supporting determinations of LTFV sales of uranium imports from any of the six uranium-producing NIS; and (4) the Department has failed to make a separate fair value comparison for each NIS. Each of these, according to Tenex, results in a violation of the antidumping law and is legally invalid. Ukraine and Tajikistan argue that these investigations are unlawful and should be terminated. Additionally, they argue that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) provides that NME determinations must be made on a country-specific basis. Nowhere in the statute are \"geographic area\" or \"geopolitical boundaries\" discussed. Petitioners claim to have demonstrated in various submissions to the Department and the CIT that antidumping investigations processed against unfairly traded merchandise, not the \"countries\" in which the merchandise is produced or from which it is exported. They argue that the statutory mandate that imports of unfairly traded merchandise be investigated and, if appropriate,36642 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices antidumping duties imposed, does not disappear because of political changes in the territory in which the merchandise is produced or exported. The Department's determination not to terminate its investigations, and the CIT's affirmation of that determination in Techsnabexport, were proper. DOC Position On September 25, 1992, the CIT confirmed that the Department had the legal authority to continue these investigations against the NIS of the former USSR, including Ukraine and Tajikistan. The basis for the Department's decision is described below. First, there is no requirement in the antidumping law that an ongoing investigation be rescinded when the country named in the petition ceases to exist. This is not to say that there are no geographical aspects to an antidumping order. Indeed, Commerce and the ITC make determinations regarding LTFV sales and injury concerning merchandise produced within certain geopolitical boundaries. When an order is issued, merchandise produced within such boundaries is subject to the order unless expressly excluded from it. However, Congress did not consider the possibility of the dissolution of a country during an antidumping duty investigation. Therefore, it was the Department's task to determine what Congress would have intended had it considered such a situation. The effect of terminating a case, based on the dissolution of the country named in the petition, would be to create a gap in the coverage of the antidumping law. The newly emerging states would be able to dump with impunity until sufficient information developed for the petitioners to file new petitions. Because the purpose of the antidumping duty law is to provide the U.S. domestic industry relief from injuriously dumped merchandise, the Congress could not have intended for the law to be interpreted to allow the dissolution of a certain country to create a gap in the law's coverage which would effectively prevent the U.S. domestic industry from obtaining relief for a certain period of time. Comment 2 Ukraine and Tajikistan assert that the Department has ignored the procedural requirements of the statute for conducting an investigation (see, e.g., 19 U.S.C. 1673b(a), (b), and (c)), because the ITC's preliminary determination only addressed imports from the USSR. The individual countries were not provided the opportunity to presentevidence or argue to the ITC that: (1) Their data should not be cumulated with the data from the other republics; (2) their imports were nonexistent or negligible; or, (3) there was no evidence of injury to the domestic industry by reason of imports from that particular country. Lacking a valid preliminary injury determination by the ITC, the Department may not suspend liquidation. Petitioners argue that the ITC's preliminary injury determination is sufficient to permit the Department to issue preliminary and final affirmative determinations as to LTFV sales of uranium from the NIS of the former USSR. Petitioners assert that the respondents' arguments were rejected by the ITC and raised unsuccessfully before the CIT. They state that political changes in an exporting territory do not render the ITC's preliminary determination null and void. DOC Position Respondents' challenge to the preliminary determination ispremature and without legal merit. The ITC's preliminary injury determination was issued on December 23, 1991, prior to recognition by the United States of the independent republics. The ITC specifically stated in its preliminary determination that for \"[plurposes of the investigation, the USSR includes each and every Republic that was a member of the USSR on November 8,,1991.\" Respondents do not dispute that uranium was produced within their borders both prior to and after November 8, 1991, nor do they contend that there was any deficiency in the injury determination at the time it was issued. Accordingly, it is clear that imports of uranium coming from the geographic area now comprised of the NIS were considered in the ITC's preliminary determination. However, like the Department's antidumping duty investigation, the ITC's injury determination focuses upon imported merchandise, not upon the country from which the merchandise is exported. Accordingly, for the same reasons discussed above with regard to the validity of the Department's antidumping duty determination, the ITC's preliminary injury determination remains valid. The continuing validity of the reliminary determination is evidenced y the ITC's recent preliminary determination in Ferrosilicon from Argentina, Kazakhstan, the People's Republic of China, Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela, Inv. Nos. 303-TA-23, 731- In Ferrosilicon, Russia,Ukraine and Kazakhstan argued that imports to the United States from those regions prior to the dissolution of the USSR could not be considered by the ITC in reaching its injury determination. In rejecting this argument, the ITC stated that \"[ilf the Commission were to accept respondents' argument that it cannot even consider imports from these regions prior to the time they became countries, that might prevent an industry otherwise entitled to relief from receiving any protection from unfairly traded imports from the same factories that are allegedly continuing to export dumped ferrosilicon to the United States simply because the political status of these areas had changed. The occurrence of other events changing the legal status of a foreign producer during the period of investigation, such as a change in ownership of the facility or the imposition of an export quota by the country in question, would not preclude the Commission from considering the consequences of the product that had been exported to the United States prior to such an event.\" Finally, respondents' perceived error in the Department's preliminary determinations does not require the termination of the investigation. Any error in the preliminary determinations can be fully addressed in the final determinations. See NTN Bearing Corp. v. United States, __ CIT .757 F. Supp. 1425 (1991). Comment 3 Tenex and the Yankee Group contend that the Department should find three separate classes or kinds of merchandise. Tenex bases its statement on Department precedent and the 1983 CIT decision in Diversified Products Corp. v. United States, 6 CIT 155, 572 F. Supp. 883 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1983) (Diversified) which establishes certain criteria. Tenex alleges that the Department misapplied the Diversified criteria in the preliminary determinations when it found that there was only one class or kind of merchandise. In support of their arguments, both Tenex and the Yankee Group cite Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Cyan uric Acid and its Chlorinated Derivatives From Japan Used in the Swimming Pool Trade (Cyanuric Acid) 49 FR 7424, (February 29, 1984), where the Department found three separate classes or kinds of merchandise. The Yankee Group posits that each of the three products subject to the Cyanuric Acid investigation had different end uses even though two of the products were derivatives of the36643 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices third. The situation in uranium is analogous in that concentrates .no the raw material used to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6) and LEU. They also argue that the ultimate consumers and the ultimate use for all three products in Cyanuric Acid were the same. In this case, utilities are the ultimate customers and the ultimate use is fuel for their nuclear reactors. Similarly, the raw materials in both cases cannot perform the end uses that the derivatives are able to perform. Therefore, the logic in Cyanuric Acid can be extended to this case. With respect to physical characteristics, the Yankee Group argues that the Department's reasoning is flawed. Despite the fact that all three forms of uranium share a common fundamental attribute, the U235 isotope, they can still be determined to constitute separate classes or kinds of merchandise. The concentration levels of the U235 isotope vary greatly between uranium concentrates and UF6, on the one hand, and LEU, on the other hand. In Cyanuric Acid, all of the products shared the fundamental attribute of chlorine. The differences in the chlorine levels of the derivative products in Cyanuric Acid were less than the different concentration levels of U235. Further, the Yankee Group contends that petitioners' analysis concerning physical differences is inaccurate and misleading and should be rejected. The physical differences between the various forms of uranium are significant. Petitioners' emphasis on the common presence of the U235 isotope ignores the different chemical structures and physical properties between concentrate, UF6, and LEU. The Department found three classes or kinds of merchandise in Cyanuric Acid based on the fact \"that the chemical compositions of these products are distinct.\" Considering the different chemical compositions between the three forms of uranium, the Department should make a finding of three separate classes or kinds. With respect to the different uses for these products, the Yankee Group argues that the Department may only find a single class or kind of merchandise when the raw material has\"no other use than for\" producing the derivative product (see, e.g., 3.5\" Microdisks and Coated Media Theeof from Japan, 54 FR 6,433, 6,434 (February 10, 1989). In this case, concentrates and UF6 are the raw materials used in producing LEU which is used as a feedstock for light-water nuclear reactors. Concentrates are also used in the glass industry, specialty metals industry, the manufacture of fuelfor heavy-water reactors, plutonium production for nuclear weapons, and in producing uranium tetrafluoride. The Department should reconsider its decision and assign greater weight to the different uses for concentrates and UF6. With respect to end users, the Yankee Group asserts that uranium purchasers and their expectations differ greatly. Purchasers of uranium range from utility companies to brokers and traders to converters to enrichers to governmental entities. Purchaser expectations vary with the end use and costs associated with conversion and enrichment. Finally, with respect to channels of trade, the Yankee Group states that concentrates, UF6, and LEU are distributed, stored, and shipped differently. Therefore, they are sold in distinct channels of trade. Petitioners assert that the Department correctly determined in its preliminary determinations that all forms of uranium constitute one class or kind of merchandise. This decision, they contend, is supported by the application of the criteria set forth in Diversified and Kyowa Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. v. United States, 582 F. Supp. 887 (CIT 1984). The ultimate use, expectations of the ultimate purchasers, essential physical characteristics, and channels of trade are the same for all forms of uranium. Moreover, the similarity of the relative costs of the different forms requires a finding of one class or kind of merchandise. The ultimate use for all forms of uranium is as commercial nuclear fuel. This includes HEU previously committed to weapons programs whose only application today is as feed material to produce LEU and then commercial nuclear fuel. All forms of uranium are purchased with the expectation of its use as commercial fuel. Limited processing is required to produce LEU from HEU. All forms of uranium share the same essential physical attribute--the U235 isotope. Lastly, the channels of trade are the same for each form of uranium. Therefore, all forms of uranium are one class or kind of merchandise. DOC Position The Department disagrees with the Yankee Group and Tenex. Cyanuric Acid differs from the present situation in that the different cherical compositions of the three products in Cyanuric Acid resulted in three distinct end uses. While these uses were all related to the swimming pool trade, each of the derivatives of cyanuric acid could be used independently. Despite the different physical characteristics of uranium concentrates, UF6, and LEU.concentrates and UF6 have virtually no other use than as inputs in the production of LEU which in turn is used as feedstock in nuclear reactor fuel assemblies. The only physical characteristic of consequence is the concentration level of the U235 isotope. Consumers of concentrates and UF6 purchase these products only with a view to increasing the concentration level of the U235 isotope to obtain LEU. The ITC preliminarily determined that the subject merchandise constitutes one like product based on the ITC's semi- finished product analysis. Consistent with that concept, we find there to be a direct line of production from concentrates through the fuel assemblies, i.e., the concentrates and UF6 can be treated as semi-finished products, whereas the two derivatives of cyanuric acid are produced independent of one another. This is the critical difference between Cyanuric Acid and this case. The Yankee Group's analysis regarding the marginal uses of concentrates is misplaced. Every product has alternative uses or the potential for alternative uses. For purposes of a class or kind analysis, it is the Department's responsibility to determine not the number of alternative uses but rather the significance of any or all of those alternatives. According to the ITC preliminary determination, less than one percent of uranium concentrate consumption is used other than for the production of nuclear fuel. Therefore, while the Yankee Group may provide a list of several alternative uses of concentrates, the significance of these uses is minimal. It is proper, then, for the Department to analogize these cases with the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from the Federal Republic of Germany, 52 FR 28170 (July 28,1987), in which the Department found there to be one class or kind of merchandise based, inter alia, on the fact that unmachined crankshafts have no other use than for machining into finished crankshafts. In addition, as petitioners point out, the expectations of the ultimate purchaser (the electric utilities) are the same for all forms of uranium, i.e., for eventual production into nuclear fuel assemblies for use in nuclear reactors. Contrary to the assertions of the Yankee group, the channels of trade for all uranium products are the same. While traders and brokers participate in the market in addition to utilities, all uranium is mined and milled, then shipped to a conversion facility for conversion into UF6, then to an enrichment facility, then to a fuel36644 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 1 Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices fabricator, then to the ultimate customer-utilities. (For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Memorandum to Francis J. Sailer from Team, dated May 27, 1992.) For the Department's position with respect to HEU, see DOC Position to Comment 4, below. Comment 4 Petitioners argue that contrary to the Department's preliminary scope determination, HEU is within the scope of the investigations and is the same class or kind of merchandise as the other forms of uranium subject to these investigations. The petition unequivocally covers uranium in all of its forms and the Department's notice of initiation included all \"uranium enriched in U235 and its compounds.\" According to petitioners, any exclusion of HEU from these investigations will severely compromise the relief to which they are entitled under the statute. Petitioners hold that arguments proffered by Tenex on this issue are not persuasive and should be rejected. Specifically, unlike the case cited by Tenex, Smith Corona Corp. v. United States, 796 F. Supp. 1532 (CIT 1992), the petition included all forms of uranium, the Department initiated on all forms of uranium, and a respondent expressly stated that it understood that all forms of uranium were included in the scope. Even Smith Corona, however, would not preclude the Department from amending the scope of these investigations. The court did not state that the Department may not redefine the scope of an investigation after a preliminary determination. Petitioners also state that the comments of the Department of Energy (DOE) on this issue are factually and legally insupportable. Moreover, DOE's comments illustrate that HEU and other forms of uranium are physically similar and commercially interchangeable. Petitioners allege that the DOE failed to explain that It was engaged in negotiations to import HEU from the Russian Federation to be blended down for use in commercial reactors and that the DOE misled the Department by implying that military applications constituted the only significant use for HEU. Tenex agrees with the Department's preliminary determination that HEU is not within the scope of these investigations. Tenex disagrees with petitioners' claim that the Department included HEU in its initiation merely because HEU was not specifically excluded. Petitioners' subsequent efforts to include HEU within the scope of these investigations not only areuntimely, but reflect their determination to make the results of this determination as devastating as possible to the NIS, regardless how illegal, Illogical, and unfair such results would be. Tenex insists that petitioners not be allowed to amend the petition to include HEU within these investigations. Tenex also agrees with DOE's May 19, 1992, letter identifying natural uranium and LEU as a single class or kind of merchandise and HEU as a separate class or kind of merchandise. The radically different physical characteristics, end uses, expectations of the ultimate purchasers, channels of trade, and notably higher production costs make these products distinct from one another. While HEU is capable of sustaining a nuclear reaction of a magnitude that renders it uniquely capable of being used in nuclear weapons, a distinctly military application, LEU can only sustain reactions in light-water commercial nuclear reactors. Tenex argues that HEU has uses that are unique to that product. HEU is typically used as a weapons grade nuclear fuel, a use which is not shared by any of the other uranium products. Although HEU can be blended down to produce LEU, its primary use is almost exclusively as a weapons-grade nuclear fuel. HEU and LEU have radically different physical characteristics, i.e., differing concentrations of the U25 isotope. HEU and LEU differ radically in cost as well. HEU costs nearly eight times as much. These differences, in addition to their different ultimate uses, compel a finding that HEU and LEU are separate classes or kinds of merchandise. The Yankee Group argues that LEU and HEU are the same class or kind of merchandise, and should be excluded from these investigations. As confirmed by the recent agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation to import HEU and blend it down to LEU for use in nuclear reactors, the end use, expectations, and distribution channels of both LEU and HEU are the same. Since the Department has treated HEU and LEU interchangeably and excluded HEU from its investigation, LEU should also be excluded. DOC Position The Department agrees with petitioners. Because the uses of HEU have changed only recently and because HEU was not expressly excluded from the petition, neither the petition nor the ITC and Department determinations previously rendered provide a definitive answer as to whether HEU is within thescope of these investigations. Therefore, application of the Diversified criteria is necessary. As explained in greater detail in Memorandum to Alan M. Dunn from Francis J. Sailer dated October 16,1992, the general physical characteristics, ultimate use and expectations of the -ultimate purchaser indicate that HEU should be considered as part of the same class or kind of merchandise as LEU, UFe, and concentrate. Comment 5 Tenex argues that imports of uranium have not been massive and that the Department has no basis to ignore the data submitted by Tenex in making its critical circumstances determinations. Moreover, in considering this issue, the Department has not analyzed imports on a country-by-country basis nor has it provided a sufficient basis to depart from its normal comparison months. The Department also has no basis for finding \"knowledge of dumping\" because a margin based on imports of uranium from the USSR bears no legal relationship to the imports of uranium from the NIS. Therefore, the Department cannot reasonably conclude either that imports have been massive or that knowledge of dumping exists. Petitioners reject as meritless Tenex's arguments regarding critical circumstances. Petitioners assert that the Department properly used official U.S. Government import statistics rather than the information proffered by Tenex. It would have been inconsistent and inequitable for the Department to accept unverified critical circumstances data from the same respondent that refused to submit a United States price database in proper form. Additionally, petitioners support the Department's application of the knowledge \"test\" that it uses in other NME cases. Margins of the magnitude in these proceedings are sufficient to constitute notice of dumping to an importer even under the most restricted knowledge test. Therefore, the Department's critical circumstances findings should be affirmed in the final determinations. DOC Position As explained above, we determined that we could not use Tenex's response for purposes of these investigations, including for critical circumstances purposes. In light of the absence of timely and adequate responses regarding exports to the United States, we used the margin from the petition and public import statistics maintained by the Department concerning imports from the USSR as BIA. (No pubic information regarding NIS state-specific imports to the United States during the36645 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices relevant time periods is available.) This analysis resulted in the finding of massive imports and a knowledge of dumping, based on the Department's regulations and established practice. Additionally, the Department was justified in the comparison periods used to determine whether imports have been massive. The subject merchandise is transported by ship from the NIS to the United States, a journey of 17 days to over one month according to data submitted by petitioners. Therefore, any subject merchandise shipped on or after the filing date of te petition (November 8, 1991) would almost certainly enter the United States after December 1. Likewise, any shipments leaving the NIS before that date would enter the United States before December 1. Therefore, we determined it appropriate to use for comparison the periods December 1991 through March 1992 and August through November 1991. Comment 6 Tenex, citing Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Fresh Cut Flowers from Colombia, 52 FR 6842, 6844 (March 5, 1987), states that the period of investigation is not representative of, and is irrelevant to, prospective imports of uranium from the NIS because the USSR was in existence during the POI. DOC Position The POI in these investigations was selected according to section 353.42(b) of our regulations. While a different period may be chosen to reflect special circumstances, it would be neither correct nor possible to move the POI to post-date the initiation. First, to do so would allow respondents to change their behavior to avoid a finding of dumping. Second, as an administrative matter, it is necessary to pick a historic period so that all terms of the sales being investigated can be reported and analyzed. Comment 7 Tenex states that even assuming the NIS are NMEs, the Department should have calculated FMVs using the export price exception set forth in section 773(c)(2) of the Act. Tenex stresses that since factors of production information is unavailable, the Department must therefore calculate FMV using the e .or prices.Petitioners reject Tenex's argument that the statute suggests that the lack of respondents' factors data alone warrants use of third-country prices. Such an interpretation, petitioners state, would effectively allow respondents, self- servingly, to choose the method theDepartment would use to calculate FMVs by deciding whether to submit a factors response to the Department's questionnaire. DOC Position We disagree with Tenex. As stated above, we received no timely and complete factors information from Ukraine or Tajikistan. This type of data is necessary in order to calculate FMV using the factors of production methodology,.which is preferred under the statute. The export price exception generally should be used only when the. Department lacks information to value the NME producer's factors of production in a comparable market economy which is a significant producer of the subject merchandise (see Tungsten at 47739). Thus, the alternative FMV methodology provided by section 773(c)(2) of the Act is for the Department to use only when we are unable to obtain valuation information, not factors information which is solely within the power of respondents to provide and which, in these investigations, respondents did not provide. If we were to accept Tenex's interpretation, we would effectively be allowing respondents to choose the method for calculating FMV simply by their decision of whether or not to submit a factors response. We do not believe that this is the purpose of the alternative provided by section 773(c)(2). Comment 8 Petitioners state that the Department was incorrect in computing the preliminary margin as a simple average of the margins for two \"such or similar\" categories of merchandise. In petitioners' view, Tenex has been absolutely uncooperative in the investigations. If, however, the Department continues to base its final determination on an average of the margins, rather than take the highest margin calculated, it must calculate a single weighted-average margin based on imports of the subject merchandise during the POI. Tenex asserts that the Department has correctly recognized that respondents have tried in good faith to cooperate with the Department's efforts to obtain factual information and, thus, should find respondents to be cooperative and apply a non-prejudicial BIA. Additionally, petitioners' suggestion to weight-average the margins calculated for natural uranium and for enriched uranium is inappropriate because it relies upon the selective use of Tenex's data.The Yankee Group asserts that the Department's calculation methodology is flawed and results in an overstated margin. The Department failed to calculate a potential uncollected dumping duty, as is usual in a dumping case, and instead calculated.a simple average of the percentage dumping margins for each product. The Yankee Group asserts that,.at the very least, the Department should sum the FMVs for each product, subtract the sum of the U.S. prices, and divide the result by the U.S. prices. DOC Position Petitioners and the Yankee Group argue explicitly or implicitly for weighting two BIA margins, rather than taking a simple average. While there are numerous ways in which these two numbers could be combined, the Department has stated that it will not fine-tune its BIA methodology (see DOC Position to Comment 9, below). In this case, we have simply followed Department precedent which directs the Department to use a simple average for BIA when the respondent has attempted to cooperate. Therefore, we have continued to take a simple average. Comment 9 Tenex states that, as determined in N.A.R., S.P.A. v. U.S., 741 F. Supp. 936, 942 (CIT 1990) and reaffirmed in Midland Export Ltd. v. U.S.A., Slip Op. 92-53 (CIT 1992), the Department's choice of BIA must be supported by\"substantial evidence on the record.\" Tenex asserts that, although the Department did not obtain complete and verifiable questionnaire responses from any of the NIS governments, the Department should not rely solely upon petitioners' data. Such exclusivity, argues Tenex, defies the inherent principle of substantial evidence on the record. Tenex, citing from the Department's Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Metal from the PRC, 56 FR 18570 (April 23, 1991) (Silicon Metal), asserts that the public information it submitted should be included within the realm of what is considered substantial evidence because there is no basis to ignore publicly available data in the record. Tenex also argues that, just as in the CIT decision, Holmes Products Corp., and Esteem Industries, Ltd. v. U.S., Slip Op. 92-118 (CIT 1992), it, like Esteem, should be considered a complying party. Therefore, the information it submitted on May 8, 1992, should be considered in the calculation of FMV based on BIA. Petitioners state that the Department should continue to refuse to consider Tenex's submissions on the appropriate36646 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 Y Notices basis for BIA, as well as that portion of Tenex's case brief which again presents the information Tenex deems \"best.\" They contend that the Department's selection of BIA in past determinations reflects an unwillingness to entertain substantive comments and information on BIA from non-complying respondents. In response to Tenex's citing of Silicon Metal, petitioners state that the Department entertained a very limited comment from importers concerning the accuracy of one surrogate cost used as BIA. The importers did not submit wholesale factual information to be used as BIA. Here, Tenex seeks improperly to provide comprehensive factual information for use as BIA. Petitioners argue that neither the statute, Silicon Metal, nor any administrative or judicial precedent permits use of Tenex's information. Specifically, they assert, citing Pistachio Group of the Assn. of Food Industries, Inc. v. United States, 671 F. Supp. 31, 40 (1987), that the courts have emphasized that the BIA rule should be applied in such a way that respondents not be allowed to \"control the results of the investigation by providing partial information or by delaying or otherwise hindering the investigation.\" They also cite the following from The Timken Companyv. United States, 788 F. Supp. 1216 (CIT 1992), quoting Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States, 710 F. Supp. 341, 346 (1989), affd 899 F.2d 1185 (1990): \"'Once Commerce has exercised its discretion to use the BIA rule against a respondent, it is for Commerce, not the respondent to determine what is the best information.\"' Therefore, Tenex should not be allowed to select what will constitute BIA. The Yankee Group contends that the Department imposed an unreasonably high barrier to the acceptance of outside information concerning BIA. By only considering proposals which demonstrated an inaccuracy or aberration on the part of the Department's initiation calculations, the Department excluded relevant information. The Department has an obligation to exercise its BIA discretion reasonably (see Timken Co. v. United States, 673 F. Supp. 495, 501 (1987)). The Yankee Group contends that the information it submitted should be given greater weight than afforded to it by the Department at the preliminary determinations. DOC Position The central purpose of the BIA rule is to induce respondents, in the absence of any subpoena power vested in theagency, to provide Commerce with timely, complete, and accurate factual information, so that the Agency can determine current margins as accurately as possible within the time limits established by the Act. (See Rhone Poulenc v. United States, 899 F.2d 1185, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 1990.) Accordingly, in selecting a BIA rate, the Department must draw an inference that is adverse to the noncomplying respondent. Otherwise, respondents\"would be able to control the amount of antidumping duties by selectively providing the Department with information.\" See Olympic Adhesives v. United States, 899 F.2d 1565, 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Accepting comments from non- complying respondents that lower the BIA rate conflicts with the purpose of the BIA rule by reducing their incentive to respond to the questionnaire. Thus, the Department accepts only very limited comments to correct gross errors in the petition which it would plainly be inequitable to allow to escape scrutiny. A reasonable degree of inaccuracy in the resulting number is acceptable (in fact, virtually unavoidable) because the Department only employs BIA where the respondents have frustrated the Department's efforts to calculate accurate margins by failing to furnish the necessary information. In this circumstance, the BIA rule gives the requirement of an adverse inference priority over the preference for accuracy. BIA margins are supported by substantial evidence because the statutory requirement that they be based on substantial evidence must be balanced with the requirements of the BIA rule itself, as explained above. Requiring BIA margins to withstand the same level of scrutiny for accuracy as margins based on information in complying questionnaire responses effectively would read the BIA provision out of the statute. Thus, the Department's approach correctly reconciles the competing objectives of the BIA rule and the substantial evidence standard of review. Consistent with these principles, forgurposes of this final determination, we ave examined all of the comments submitted by interested parties and others with respect to the selection of BIA. We have accepted from Tenex only comments on clerical errors and other gross errors clearly derivable from public information. Conversely, we have rejected all comments from Tenex based on information within its control, which should have been included in a questionnaire response, and allcomments constituting attempts to modify the BIA rate in Tenex's favor. In examining the adjustments suggested by the non-respondent parties, we applied a similar standard as that used in the preliminary determinations. That is, we did not attempt to \"fine-tune\" the BIA. We only considered adopting a proposed change to the methodology in instances where our initiation methodology was shown to be plainly inaccurate or where a particular figure used in our calculations was demonstrated to be an aberration. Comment 10 Petitioners argue that the Department should use certain respondent-provided data as BIA for United States price so as. to achieve an LTFV analysis which is as accurate as possible. There is no basis in the statute, the Department's regulations, or past practice to conclude that the Department is precluded from using any respondent-provided data as BIA. Citing Timken Co. v. United States, 11 CIT 786, 673 F. Supp. 495 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1987), petitioners claim that the CIT has recognized the propriety of using certain respondent data as BIA. In addition, petitioners contend the Department should use the actual product and tails assay values that respondents provided as BIA to calculate more accurate factors of production for the imported meichandise. Tenex asserts that the Department should deny petitioners' request that it use Tenex's U.S. price data and enriched uranium product (EUP) product and tails assay information as BIA in the final determination. Petitioners have constantly argued that the Department should reject Tenex's questionnaire response and their . proposed adjustments to petitioners' FMV estimates (which would improve the Department's LTFV margin calculations). DOC Position We disagree with petitioners that the accuracy of the LTFV analysis would be enhanced through selective use of Tenex's response data. The Department did not verify any of the information therein because the Department considers Tenex's response as inadequate and deficient. Accordingly, the Department has not selectively employed data submitted by Tenex. Comment 11 Tenex states that the Department's factors of production analysis is fundamentally flawed since the Department failed to properly determine36647 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices appropriate surrogate countries for each of the NIS under investigation. Tenex states that the surrogate countries chosen during the initiation were chosen specifically for the USSR and not for the separate NIS under investigation. Moreover, since all of the NIS are not at the same level of economic development, a single catch- all surrogate is not appropriate. Tenex also comments that a separate FMV and U.S. price for each uranium-producing NIS should be calculated rather than a single margin for all countries. Tenex also states that Namibia was incorrectly used to value labor for mining and milling. Tenex accuses the Department of \"shopping around\" for the highest-cost surrogate because the value was not taken from the petition or the supplement and defied the Department's standard practice of using as few surrogates as possible. Tenex also argues that Namibia is an inappropriate surrogate for the former USSR in that the USSR is far more technically advanced than Namibia. Tenex asserts that while the Gross National Product (GNP) per capita is similar, the purchasing power parity (PPP) is not. Agricultural labor is extensive in Namibia and not in the former USSR. Namibia is sparsely populated while the former USSR is not. Tenex, therefore, concludes that Portugal is more comparable to the former USSR than Namibia for valuing labor mining and milling. Petitioners assert that because the POI encompasses a period in which the USSR existed, the Department's determination to use surrogates at a\"comparable level of economic development\" was proper. The group of surrogates selected by the Department satisfies the economic comparability criteria and, therefore, is appropriate. Furthermore, no information has been presented which warrants reconsideration of the surrogate selection because the surrogates proposed by various respondents and other parties do not satisfy the statutory criteria governing surrogate selection. Petitioners also contend that they attempted to obtain Namibian data for all factors. However, because of the limitation on reliable public data for mining factors costs, it was unavoidable that multiple surrogates would be used. They allege that the Namibian data is preferable to Portuguese labor data because the Portuguese data is outdated, and is not uranium-specific. The Namibian data, which is recent and uranium-specific, is the best information available.DOC Position We disagree with respondents. When the Department determined it proper to continue this case against Ukraine and Tajikistan, it deemed it appropriate to continue to apply the surrogates chosen for the USSR to Ukraine and Tajikistan (see Memorandum to Carole Showers from David Mueller dated March 24, 1992). With respect to choosing Namibia as the preferred surrogate for mining factors of production, consistent with 19 CFR 353.52(b), the Department followed its traditional analysis by considering the macroeconomic criteria of per capita GNP, the distribution of labor within the economy, and the rate of economic growth of significant producers of comparable merchandise (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Refined Antimony Trioxide from the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 6801, (February 28, 1992)). The PPP data provided by Tenex does not persuade the Department to deviate from its established practice. Based on the criteria considered by the Department, and on the fact that Namibia is a significant producer of comparable merchandise, we have determined that this country is the proper surrogate. In those instances where values were unavailable from Namibia, we have employed Portuguese values. Portugal was included in the list of comparable countries and, hence, use of Portuguese data is appropriate where data from the preferred surrogate was not available. Comment 12 Tenex argues that the mines used by petitioners to calculate Canadian U308 factors of production were incorrect because they were not the mines in operation'during the POI. This, Tenex argues, necessarily affected various calculated factors. In addition, Tenex states that operating cost estimates are incorrect and unsupported. Tenex further asserts that Canadian mining labor was incorrectly adjusted in order to account for differences in labor productivity. Petitioners' use of East German and Czechoslovak experience to adjust for conditions in the USSR cannot be supported because the geological peculiarities of those countries' mines make them more labor- intensive than Canadian or Soviet mines. Petitioners state that Tenex fails to acknowledge that the Department's responsibility is to identify the best information available for establishing what respondents' factors for producing U308were during the POI given theproducers' refusal to provide timely responses. Petitioners suggest that respondents would have provided actual factors data were the actual data more favorable. Petitioners reject the contention of Tenex that the Department should use 1991 Canadian mine data. Petitioners selected 1990 Canadian data because, in 'addition to being the more complete and accurate data available, it included eastern Canadian mines which are more representative of uranium mines in the NIS republics. Finally, petitioners state that, lacking usable data on the relative use of each mining method and \"geological peculiarities\" in the former USSR, the Department's adjustment of Canadian labor usage is well-supported by substantial information on the record of these investigations. Because Tenex has failed to provide this data to the Department, the Department must seek the best information available which is the East European mine data, in conjunction with the Canadian data. Ignoring this data because Tenex contends it differs in some way from what would have been demonstrated if actual dat a had been provided would be improper and would reward noncompliance. DOC Position Respondents failed to provide the data concerning labor productivity requested in the Department's questionnaire and have also failed to prove that the information provided in the petition regarding labor productivity is a clerical error or a gross error clearly derivable from public information. Therefore, consistent with the Department's BIA policy stated in DOC Position to Comment 9, above, the Department rejects Tenex's proposed adjustment. Furthermore, as stated above in the Foreign Market Value section, the Department determined it appropriate to express all figures in 1990 terms, where possible, and the petitioners provided information regarding the mines in operation during 1990. Therefore, Tenex's argument to use data from the mines in operation during the POI is without merit. Comment 13 Petitioners argue that certain modifications need to be made to the quantification and valuation of the factors or production for uranium mining. The Department should triple the adjustment for the Canadian energy factor because mining facilities in the NIS consume significantly more energy than their Western counterparts. Although such information was36648 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices requested of and not provided by respondents, it can be derived indirectly from respondents' data and public information. Petitioners also claim that the Department's rejection of the adjustment to the Canadian energy factor in the preliminary determinations was erroneous because all activities at the Priargunsky mine are related to, and for the support of, uranium production. Petitioners also provide additional public information from a May 29, 1992, article in The Energy Daily, not available at the time of the Department's preliminary determinations, which substantiates that the unadjusted Canadian factor understates energy consumption in uranium mining facilities in the former USSR. Tenex states that the Department was correct in rejecting the energy adjustment. Petitioner's attempt to justify the energy adjustment based on electricity use at the Priargrunsky facility is uncertified, uncorroborated, and not specific to the mining industry, let alone the uranium mining industry. DOC Position We disagree with petitioners' proposed adjustment to the former Soviet mining energy factor. The Department rejects this adjustment on the grounds that the supporting evidence provided was selectively taken from Tenex's response. See DOC Position to Comment 10, above. In addition, petitioners' publicly-available evidence pertaining to energy consumption in the former USSR is general and fails to demonstrate that the Department's methodology is inaccurate or aberrant. Comment 14 Petitioners argue that in its preliminary determinations, the Department failed to include the annual bonus paid to the Rossing mine employees in the cost per man year for uranium mining in Namibia. The 1990 Rossing report clearly states that the bonus is \"in addition to\" the stated monthly wage rate. Petitioners also argue that the Department should index the 1988 Namibian wage rate to 1990 using information specific to the Namibian uranium sector. Petitioners request that the Department calculate an index specific to the Namibian uranium sector by comparing Rossing's 1990 wage rates to 1988 wage rates for certain wage categories. DOC Position The Department agrees with petitioners regarding the holiday bonus pay in Namibia. After review of theinformation provided, it is clear that the holiday bonus check is provided over and above monthly pay. Therefore, we have adjusted the calculations accordingly. However, the Department disagrees with petitioners' argument concerning indexing of the Namibian labor wages. The methodology proposed by petitioners is based only on increases with respect to four out of thirteen wage categories and, in fact, yields a result very similar to the Department's. As stated above, the Department has made adjustments to the BIA methodology only in those instances where that methodology is shown to be plainly inaccurate or aberrant. We determine that the Department's reliance on the \"Home Prices Index\" is neither plainly inaccurate nor aberrant. Comment 15 Tenex states that for mining and milling, and for enrichment, Portugal was inappropriately used as the energy valuation surrogate. Portugal is not an appropriate choice because 1) Portugal seeks self-sufficiency in electricity and, therefore, does not seek the cheapest possible sources, and 2) Portugal has the second highest dependence in imported oil in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. With respect to mining and milling, Canada should have been the surrogate for energy since Canada is more comparable to the former USSR than Portugal in terms of energy supply conditions. For enrichment, Tenex argues that the United Kingdom is the appropriate surrogate because it was the surrogate in the petitioner's factors of production estimates. Petitioners rebut Tenex's contention that Portugal is an inappropriate surrogate because it is not a \"significant energy producer\" by stating that there is no requirement in the statute or regulations that the selected surrogate country be a significant producer of the inputs required to produce comparable merchandise. Furthermore, despite the Department's willingness to disregard a surrogate's costs if those costs are aberrant for that surrogate country, there is no indication that Portugal's energy costs are distorted for the period or that these costs are not an appropriate indicator or energy costs in a country which is at a comparable level of economic development to the former USSR. DOC Position We disagree with Tenex. As stated above in DOC Position to Comment 11, the Department selects surrogate countries based on macroeconomicscriteria. Different surrogate countries are not chosen to value each separate factor. Comment 16 Tenex states that BNFL's financial statements cover other operations in addition to commercial enrichment. In addition, only one of the three commercial plants identified actually operated during the POI: E22. However, the petitioners included costs from 1990 and plants E21 and E23 in calculating the EUP constructed value. Therefore, the public data provided by Tenex, pertaining to the E22 plant, is the only appropriate basis for the Department's FMV calculation for enrichment. Petitioners reject Tenex's arguments regarding the information used as BIA for enriched uranium. First, although the data includes the E21 plant which is now closed, the E21 plant was operational during the entire period covered by the fiscal year 1990 and fiscal year 1991 reports. With respect to E23, Tenex has provided no information to show that the financial statements reflect construction costs. Therefore, the data is not distorted. Moreover, there is no requirement that the BIA factors data be specifically from the POT, nor that the BIA factors be for facilities that were operational during the PO. Additionally, petitioners state that Tenex offers no information to substantiate its allegation that the Urenco annual report includes military production. According to petitioners, the Treaty of Almelo precludes Urenco from performing uranium enrichment services for military purposes. They also state that the annual report itself demonstrates that only Urenco (UK) commercial production, and not BNFL military production, is encompassed by the report. DOC Position Again, as discussed in the Foreign Market Value section, above, we have used, as BIA, 1990 information to the extent possible. Plant E21 operated in 1990 and, therefore, is properly included in the Department's calculations. The Department agrees with petitioners in rejecting Tenex's argument regarding the E23 plant. It is unclear whether and to what extent the financial reports reflect the costs of construction of E23. Therefore, we conclude no basis exists to adjust for Tenex's allegations. Finally, the Department thoroughly examined BNFL's financial statements and it is unclear whether they contain data relating to the submarine fuels facilities. Even Tenex recognizes this when stating that data pertaining to this facility is\"apparently\" consolidated in the BNFL36649 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices annual reports. Therefore, Tenex has not shown that the methodology used in the preliminary determinations is inaccurate or aberrant. Comment 17 Tenex argues that if the Department does not use POI data, it should use the BNFL 1991 annual report data rather than the BNFL 1990 annual report. The 1991 annual report better coresponds to the 1990 data used for other factors than does data from the fiscal year 1990 BNFL annual report. Petitioners agree that the 1991 annual report should be used. DOC Position We agree that the fiscal year 1991 BNFL report better suits the Department's objective of using consistent 1990 data for BIA and have adjusted our calculations accordingly. Comment 18 Depreciation The Yankee Group argues that the Department should correct BNFL's depreciation and related financing costs to reflect the actual periods listed in BNFL's financial statement. They assert that the Department failed to account for disparities between the depreciation terms of 13-30 years for the buildings and ancillary plant, and 10-15 years for the centrifuge equipment listed in BNFL's 1991 financial statement. The Yankee Group asserts that the Department should correct these adjustments for its final determinations. Financing Tenex states that the actual interest expense for former Soviet enrichment plants is minimal or zero since these plant's sunken costs were incurred for military enrichment, However, should the Department decide to use the BNFL annual report to calculate Soviet finance charges, it should not base finance charges on BNFL's gross interest payable, but should use BNFL's net interest payable, which nets out interest revenue. Petitioners assert that actual finance charges of Urenco (UK) are based on the gross interest payable and, using the net interest payable, would understate the actual financing costs associated with these plants. DOC Position The Department disagrees with Tenex concerning its argument about the zero financing charges in the USSR. This is an issue more properly resolved through responding to the Department's questionnaire and subjecting that response to verification rather thanthrough a submission concerning the most appropriate BIA to apply. We do, however, agree with Tenex regarding the use of net interest payable rather ,than gross interest payable. BNFL's balance sheet contains only short-term interest-revenue-generating assets. Therefore, net interest payable reflects BNFL's financing costs related to production. Tenex has demonstrated that petitioners' use of gross interest payable is a gross error clearly derivable from public data. Hence, we have adjusted the calculations accordingly. Comment 19 Tenex states that petitioners' cost of capital for enrichment inappropriately reflects high interest costs in Portugal. Although Tenex argues that finance changes should equal zero in the FMV calculation, it would agree to use the DOE's cost of capital, since the former USSR operated more similarly to the United States than to Portugal in this respect, given the government funding in the United States and the USSR. Moreover, Tenex argues that petitioners' Portuguese interest rate adjustment in no way resembles the cost of capital in the former USSR. Costs of capital are related to a country's state of technological development and inflation, both of which suggest that Portugal has a higher cost of capital than the former USSR. Therefore, the Department should alternatively value interest costs in a country with enrichment capability such as the UK. Finally, if the Department uses the UK data (adjusted to reflect Portuguese costs or not), it should use more current data applicable to the POI. Petitioners state that Tenex has not argued that Portugal is an unsuitable surrogate but rather, that Portugal's interest rates are too high. Tenex's attempt to pick and choose among surrogates and values to find the most favorable valuations is without support and is impermissible. Moreover, as demonstrated in a May 7, 1992, letter, no support can be found on the record to support the contention that all former Soviet facilities have been fully amortized and, hence, that interest costs should be zero. DOC Position We disagree with Tenex. Similar to our position on energy costs, we do not select surrogate countries based on their similarity to the NME respect to individual inputs. They are selected on the basis of macroeconomic criteria. Moreover, we have not updated the information to 1991. In initiating these investigations,. we determined that 1990data were sufficiently currant. (See DOC Position to Comment 9, above.) Comment 20 Tenex states that petitioners' enrichment labor usage is overstated due to labor used in non-commercial enrichment activities. For example, petitioners' estimated usage of 450 employees to produce 900,000 separative work upits (SWU) inflates the reality of the situation since the number of workers typically required to produce 1.25 million SWU in the Netherlands is 208 while only between 180 and 200 are required in the United States to produce 1.5 million SWU. Petitioners contend that Tenex's comparisons of the UK labor factor with that of a different plant in the Netherlands and with projections for an unbuilt plant in the U.S. are irrelevant. Such comparisons neither suggest that the UK factors are unrepresentative of former Soviet factors, nor that the UK factors are inaccurate. DOC Position We agree with petitioners. Tenex's arguments rely on projections and speculation concerning a not-yet- complete enrichment facility in the United States and an enrichment facility outside of the Department's preferred surrogate for factors. Therefore, Tenex has failed to show that the enrichment labor factor used in the petition is a clerical or gross error. Comment 21 Tenex argues that there is no indication that overfeed costs reported in Urenco's financial statements were all related to commercial production. Tenex contends that it has proven that overfeed is uneconomical given the conditions assumed by the Department. In addition, Urenco's 1991 annual report indicates that the overfeed costs were negative. Petitioners note that their factors of production analysis, based on fiscal year 1991 data, incorporates the negative feed cost reported by Urenco. Just as the cost of the producer-supplied feed must be incorporated in a cost of production calculation when overfeeding occurs, so must \"negative\" feed cost be included. DOC Position We agree with petitioners. As we have used the 1991 annual report, feed costs are negative. Hence, Tenex's concerns. regarding the uneconomical nature of overfeeding are irrelevant. Comment 22 Tenex states that the Department's EUP factors of production fail to36650 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices account for the advanced centrifuge technology employed at enrichment plants in the former USSR. Although petitioners argue that the supposedly advanced Urenco centrifuge technology makes the Urenco plants more productive than Soviet plants, which in turn leads to higher depreciation and finance charges for Soviet enrichment, their claims are unsupported, absurd, and have been rejected by the Department in its preliminary FMV calculation. Actually, the Soviet technology enjoys technological and productivity advantages over Urenco centrifuges, suggesting that depreciation and finance charges should be reduced, not increased, from those estimated for the Urenco plant. The Yankee Group argues that the Department should reject petitioners' claim that capital and depreciation costs are 3.5 times higher than Urenco's because the smaller former Soviet centrifuges produce less SWU per machine. Petitioners failed to consider that the former USSR's smaller, lower- tech centrifuges cost considerably less per unit than Urenco's larger centrifuges. Petitioners continue to argue that the Department should adjust UK production factors to reflect known technology differences with facilities producing EUP in the former USSR. Moreover, petitioners reject Tenex's adjustment as speculative. Further, Tenex should not be given the benefit of certain critical assumptions given the failure of respondents to provide the actual data. DOC Position The Department continues to reject petitioners' upward adjustment to enrichment costs as speculation. We also reject Tenex's proposed adjustment. Potential economies of scale experienced by or technology differences at former Soviet enrichment facilities are not an appropriate adjustment for the Department to consider in a BIA situation; rather, it is more properly addressed by responding to the Department's questionnaire and allowing verification to occur. Comment 23 The Yankee Group asserts that the Department should give greater weight to the visit of its knowledgeable representatives to the former Soviet enrichment plant. The information concerning the former Soviet enrichment plant is directly relevant given that this plant is the only one that produced LEU which was exported to the United States.Petitioners argue that the information provided by the Yankee Group is inadequate and cannot be construed as BIA because it relies on an impermissible level of speculation and concerns only one former Soviet facility. DOC Position We disagree with the Yankee Group and reject the data contained in its affidavit. The information gleaned by Yankee Group representatives during their visit to the Ekaterinburg enrichment facility is more appropriately submitted by the respondents to the Department in the form of a questionnaire response, not 'through an affidavit of a third party. Comment 24 The Yankee Group argues, based on public information on the record, that petitioners have overstated the SWU cost at Urenco's UK facilities with their estimate of $166.37 per SWU. BNFL's financial statements indicate that the company had a nine percent profit on sales in 1990. Based on this figure and the fact that BNFL's primary activity is uranium enrichment, the Yankee Group argues that BNFL sold enriched uranium at prices which yielded a profit. The Yankee Group cites a 1984 statement by an official at Urenco's UK facility that Urenco could offer long- term SWU contracts at prices \"around $100 SWU.\" Prices have not changed significantly since that time. Petitioners estimated Urenco's cost to be $167 per SWU, thus implying that if Urenco were selling enrichment at $100 per SWU, it must have incurred huge losses. The Yankee Group states that BNFL's financial statements demonstrate that the company's costs are less than $100 per SWU, since it is making a profit at that price. Thus, the Yankee Group asserts that the Department should reject petitioners' constructed cost as it is inconsistent with other information on the record of these investigations. DOC Position We disagree with the Yankee Group. Their conclusion rests on information dating back to 1984, while petitioners' CV is derived from the 1991 fiscal year. Therefore, we are not convinced that the petition calculations are aberrant. Comment 25 Tenex states that its failure to provide complete and verifiable responses was due, in large part, to legitimate national security concerns. Tenex insists that there is no basis in law or logic for the Department to require producers or exporters in one country to supplyhighly sensitive data, critical to the national security of the NIS, relating to production in another country. To do so would violate all notions of sovereignty. Likewise, Tenex states that it cannot be held responsible for the failure to provide data on the production facilities in Ukraine and Tajikistan. It did not, nor does it now, have access to complete and verifiable data concerning factors of production in the former.USSR uranium industry. Tenex cites GATT Article XXI as the national prerogative to refuse disclosure of such information which they consider contrary to their essential security interests. In Final Determination of Sales at less Than Fair Value: Industrial Nitrocellulose from France (Industrial Nitrocellulose from France), 48 FR 11971 (March 22, 1983), and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial Nitrocellulose from Yugoslavia (Industrial Nitrocellulose From Yugoslavia), 55 FR 34946 (August 27, 1990), the Department identified GATT Article XXI as grounds for declining disclosure. Tenex also states that in Chevron Standard Ltd. v. U.S. 563 F. Supp. 1381 (1983), the CIT ruled that the Department cannot penalize one respondent for failing to compel another respondent, over which it has no control, to provide information requested by the Department. Further, Tenex, states that given the dramatic changes in recent months, its failure to file timely responses to the Department's requests is understandable and excusable. In fact, only one NIS has responded to the Department's questionnaire, illustrating the difficulty the NIS have had, and continue to have, in complying with the Department's numerous requests for information. Based on the above, it would be inconsistent with the antidumping law and precedent to use BIA to calculate punitive margins in this case. Petitioners state that the Department should continue to reject all respondents' comments and information concerning use of BIA in the final determination. Specifically, petitioners request that the Department reject as BIA publicly available information submitted by Tenex because no legitimate national security concerns have been raised in these proceedings and because the NIS refused to submit information within their possession or control. They argue that none of the NIS explained in a timely manner that national security concerns led to their failure to submit questionnaire responses and that these republics, not Tenex, were the appropriate party to raise such concerns. Petitioners claim that the cases cited by Tenex (i.e.,36651 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices Industrial Nitrocellulose from France and Industrial Nitrocellulose From Yugoslavia) make clear that a secondary respondent such as Tenex may not interpose, in the broadest possible manner, national security concerns. Petitioners also object to Tenex's statements that it should not be penalized for the failure of the republics to respond to the Department's questionnaire because such information is beyond its control. Tenex's arguments would reward recalcitrant republics by permitting it to supply BIA in lieu of information that properly should have been submitted by the republics. DOC Position We disagree with Tenex. In Industrial Nitrocellulose from Yugoslavia, the respondent submitted timely and complete responses to the Department's requests for information. The issue of national security involved the verification of data, not the submission of data. In these proceedings, however, we did not receive timely and complete data from Ukraine and Tajikistan. Therefore, Industrial Nitrocellulose from Yugoslavia is not relevant to these investigations. This case can also be distinguished from Industrial Nitrocellulose from France in that the French Ministry of Economics and Finance responded to the Department's requests for information with claims of national security. Tenex is not the appropriate entity to be making claims of national security. Any claims involving national security in these investigations must be properly submitted by the GOU and the GOT. In this instance, Tenex's representations of national security concerns are not sufficient, especially since the production information it failed to submit is not within its domain. Rather, the production enterprises, through their overseeing ministries in Ukraine and Tajikistan, are the only parties that can appropriately claim concerns of national security. Finally, Ukraine and Tajikistan are not signatories to the GATT. Therefore, the United States has no obligations under GAT with respect to Ukraine and Tajikistan. Critical Circumstances Petitioners allege that \"critical circumstances\" exist with respect to imports of uranium from the former USSR. Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist when we determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect the following: (1] There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of theclass or kind of merchandise which is subject to investigation, or that the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandise at less than its fair value; and (2) There have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period. To determine whether imports have been massive over a relatively short period, we based our analysis on official statistics of the Department, as BIA, for equal periods immediately preceding and following the filing of the petition. The time period we used for comparison purposes begins in December 1991, the first complete month after the petition was filed (November 8, 1991). Based on available statistics, and in accordance with our regulations (19 CFR 353.16(g)), we determine it appropriate to use for comparison the period December 1991 through March 1992. (See, DOG Position to Comment 5 above.) We compared the quantity of imports during the comparison period to the imports during the immediately preceding period (the \"base period\") of comparable duration (i.e, August through November 1991]. Un er 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), unless the imports in the comparison period have increased by at least 15 percent over the imports during the base period, we will not consider the imports \"massive.\" Our analysis indicates that shipments from the former USSR have increased by considerably more than 15 percent. Since this shows evidence of massive imports over a relatively short period of time, we need to consider whether there is a history of dumping or whether there is reason to believe or suspect that importers of this product knew or should have known that it was being sold at less than fair value. We examined recent antidumping cases and found that there are currently no findings of dumping in the United States or elsewhere on the subject merchandise by Ukraine or Tajikistan. We then examined the magnitude of the dumping margins in these investigations. It is our standard practice to impute knowledge of dumping under section 735(a){3)(A{ii) of the Act, when the estimated margins are of such a magnitude that the importer should have realized that dumping existed with regard to the subject merchandise. Normally, in purchase price sales, we consider estimated margins of 25 percent or greater to be sufficient, and in exporter's sales price sales, margins of 15 percent or greater to be sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. See, e.g. FinalDetermination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: High-Tenacity Rayon Filament Yarn from Germany (57 FR 21770, May 22, 1992). Using these criteria, we have found that the final margins in these investigations are sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3) are met and we determine that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of uranium from Ukraine and Tajikistan. Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue suspending liquidation of all unliquidated entries of uranium from Ukraine and Tajikistan, as defined in the Scope of Investigations section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after March 5, 1992 (90 days prior to the date of publication of our preliminary determinations) through October 16, 1992 (the signing of the suspension agreement and on or after April 12, 1993 (for Ukraine) and April 26, 1993 (for Tajikistan). The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or bond equal to 129.29 percent ad valorem, the estimated weighted- average amount by which the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price, for all manufacturers, producers and exporters in Ukraine and Tajikistan of uranium. ITC Notification In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. The ITC will now determine within 45 days whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry. If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury, does not exist with respect to uranium, these proceedings will be terminated and all securities will be refunded or cancelled. If the ITC determines that such injury does exist, the Department will issue an antidumping duty order directing Customs officials to assess antidumping duties on all imports of uranium from Ukraine and Tajikistan for the periods discussed above in the Suspension of Liquidation section of this notice. This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.35(d).

ACTION: Notice of an application for Modification to Scientific Research Permit No. 818 (P211C).Notice is hereby given that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has applied in due form for a Modification to Scientific Research Permit No. 818 to take listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531- 1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR Part 217-222). Permit No. 818 was issued on April 22, 1993 (58 FR 25811) as authorized by the ESA. It authorizes ODFW to take listed adult and juvenile Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) for scientific research purposes through December 31, 1996. ODFW is requesting authorization to capture and handle an additional 11,800 listed juvenile Snake'River spring/ summer chinook salmon, and tag with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags an additional 1,500 listed juvenile Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon, resulting in the indirect mortality of 103 of these fish. ODFW requests this take annually for the duration of the permit, through December 31, 1996.

ACTIONS: Issuance of Permit 859 (P521) to James R. Spotila, Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Drexel University; Issuance of a Second Modification to Permit 790 (P509) for Robert van Dam, Physiological Research Laboratory, University of California, San Diego; Issuance of an Extension to Permit 691 (P77#36) for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southwest Fisheries Center; Issuance of an Emergency Modification to Permit 817 (P45K) for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Issuance of an Amendment to Permit No. 826 (P770#64) for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northwest Fisheries Science Center. On February 5, 1993, notice was published (58 FR 7213) that an application had been filed by James R. Spotila, to take listed leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife (50 CFR parts 217-222), for the purposes of scientific research. Notice is hereby given that on June 24, 1993 as authorized by the provisions of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543), NMFS issued Permit Number 859 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. On September 2, 1992 (57 FR 41477), Robert van Dam, Physiological Research Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was issued Permit No. 790 under the authority of the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife (50 CFR Parts 217- 227), authorizing the Physiological Research Laboratory to take listed Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) for the purposes of scientific research. On May 13, 1993, (58 FR 29392) as authorized by the ESA, NMFS issued a Modification to Permit No. 790, extending the effective date of the Permit through December 31, 1993. On June 1, 1,993, (58 FR 31188) notice was given that the applicant applied for a second Modification to Permit 790. Notice is hereby given that on July 2, 1993, the Physiological Research Laboratory was issued a second Modification, authorizing an increase in the number of listed Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) to be captured, measured, tagged and photographed. The modification authorizes an increase in take from 40 to 80 turtles. However, at most, only 40 of those turtles may be sampled for stomach contents.36653 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices On October 31, 1989 (54 FR 47105), Southwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, was issued Permit No. 691 under the authority of the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR Parts 217-227), authorizing the Southwest Fisheries Center to take listed olive ridley turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) for the purposes of scientific research. Notice is hereby given that on June 29, 1993, the Southwest Fisheries Center was granted an extension to continue their research through December 31, 1994. On April 1, 1993 (58 FR 18205), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was issued Permit No. 817 under the authority of the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife (50 CFR Parts 217-227), authorizing the FWS to take juvenile listed Snake River fall and spring/ summer chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) for the purposes of scientific research. Notice is hereby given that on June 24, 1993 the FWS was issued an emergency Modification to increase the number of listed Snake River fall chinook salmon authorized to be tagged with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags, for the following reasons: (1) This year is a unique flow year, resulting in a great number of fish moving downstream in a given time period, and FWS should take advantage of the opportunity; (2) a new PIT tag detector has been installed at Lower Monumental Dam, making it possible to study longer migration patterns; (3) the consensus of the salmon research community is that more Snake River fall chinook salmon should be tagged to further study their migration. The modification increases the number of listed Snake River fall chinook authorized to be PIT tagged from 1,365 to 2,350, and increases the mortalities authorized as a result of this activity from 41 to 71. The modification is valid through December 31, 1993, or until superseded by changes made as a result of comments. On December 3, 1992, notice was published (57 FR 57157) that an application had been filed by the NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center (P770#64), to take listed Snake River sockeye salmon (0. nerka) and listed Snake River fall and spring/summer chinook salmon (0. tshawytscha) for the purposes of scientific research. On March 23, 1993 (58 FR 17383), NMFS was issued Permit No. 826 for the above taking subject to certain conditions set forth therein, and on April 6, 1993 (58 FR 19654), NMFS was issued a modification to Permit No. 826, as authorized under the ESA and theNMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217- 227). Notice is hereby given that on July 1, 1993 NMFS was issued an amendment to Permit No. 826, subject to the conditions set forth therein, to be valid for the duration of the permit. The amendment increases the number of juvenile sockeye salmon authorized to be collected during field research, of which a lower percent than originally estimated would be juvenile listed Snake River sockeye salmon. The permit authorizes the take of up to 68 juvenile sockeye salmon, of which 0.8 were estimated to be listed Snake River sockeye salmon. The take of 0.8 Snake River juvenile sockeye salmon was based on an estimated 1.25% of the outmigrant sockeye salmon at McNary Dam being of Snake River origin. However, current data indicates that, to date, only 0.16% of the sockeye salmon collected at McNary Dam are of Snake River origin, and some of these may be kokanee from Dworshak Reservoir. To cover additional planned sampling to obtain necessary data for recovery purposes, an additional 100 juvenile sockeye salmon need to be captured and handled.

SUMMARY: The Copyright Royalty Tribunal is establishing a procedural schedule for the 1990 cable royalty distribution proceeding. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 8, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda R. Bocchi, General Counsel, Copyright Royalty Tribunal, 1825 Connecticut Avenue NW., Suite 918, Washington, DC 20009. (202) 606-4400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 18, 1993, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"JSC\",) filed with the Copyright Royalty Tribunal a Motion to Compel the Production of the 1991 Nielsen diaries and a Motion to Establish the Procedural Schedule for the 1990 Cable Royalty Distribution Proceeding. By Notice, issued June 23, 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal invited the parties to file comments on the two Motions. Friday, June 25, 1993, was established as the due date for filing comments on the Motion to Establish a Procedural Schedule.' Tuesday, July 6, 1 By letter of June 24, 1993. the Tribunal granted Program Suppliers' request for a one day extension1993, was established as the due date for filing comments on the Motion to Compel the Production of the 1991 Nielsen diaries. Comments on JSC's procedural schedule Motion were received from Program Suppliers, National Association of Broadcasters, Public Broadcasting Service, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., and SESAC, Inc. With the exception of Program Suppliers, all the other commenting parties either supported JSC's proposed schedule or offered an alternative schedule. Program Suppliers maintained that JSC's motion was premature. They noted that at the outset of the proceeding it had been determined that the proceeding should be bifurcated, with stage one involving the Nielsen access issue. Program Suppliers further explained that the decision to bifurcate was based on the parties desire to avoid\"wasteful duplication and confusion.\" Program Suppliers also opposed JSC's proposed dates on the basis that the schedule would deprive the parties of sufficient time to conduct an adequate hearing. The Tribunal understands the need to resolve stage one of the proceeding before commencing the distribution stage. However, the Tribunal is also committed to ensuring that the proceeding is completed in an efficient manner. Therefore, although the Tribunal will establish a procedural schedule prior to determination of stage one, the schedule assumes that stage one will be completed prior to the date for filing direct cases. The parties are expected to cooperate with each other to assure that stage one is completed in the designated time period. Accordingly, the Tribunal adopts the following procedural schedule: End of stage one deposition period, including filing of any motions based on depositions-July 12, 1993 Comments on any motions based on depositions-July 15, 1993 2 Exchange of Direct Cases-August 16, 1993 Discovery Period-August 17- September 7 Phase I Evidentiary Hearing-September 8-27 3 (10 hearing days) Exchange of Phase I Rebuttal Cases- October 1, 1993 to file their comments on Monday, June 28 rather than Friday June 25. The one day extension also applied to all other parties wishing to file comments on the Motion. 2The Tribunal's decision on the stage one access issue will follow shortly after the comments are filed. 3The Tribunal will advise the parties shortly of the specific dates reserved for evidentiary hearings.Phase I Rebuttal Hearing-October 8, 1993 Dated: July 1, 1993.

ACTION: Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) issues this proposed Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on its proposal to consolidate certain nonnuclear component manufacturing. surveillance, and storage functions of the Nation's Nuclear Weapons Complex (Complex). This proposed finding is based on the DOE \"Nonnuclear Consolidation Environmental Assessment\" (EA), DOE/EA-0792, June 1993, which analyzes the proposed consolidation of these nonnuclear functions that DOE performs in the Complex. The DOE sites involved in the nonnuclear consolidation proposal are the Kansas City Plant (KCP) in Kansas City, Missouri; Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in Los Alamos, New Mexico; the Mound Plant (Mound) in Miamisburg, Ohio; the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge. Tennessee; the Pinellas Plant (Pinellas) in Largo. Florida; the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) in Golden, Colorado; Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico (SNL/NM) in Albuquerque, New Mexico; and the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina. DOE's proposed action is to consolidate certain nonnuclear manufacturing activities at KCP, relocate others to SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM, and close out the Complex missions at Mound and Pinellas, and Complex nonnuclear missions at RFP. The proposed action responds to Presidential initiatives, including the START II Treaty, to reduce the nations nuclear weapons stockpile, and is expected to achieve more efficient and effective management of nonnuclear functions within the Complex, while also decreasing the long-term operating costs of this aspect of the Complex. The proposed action is * part of DOE's larger proposal to reconfigure the entire Complex. The remainder of this reconfiguration proposal is being analyzed in the Nuclear Weapons ComplexReconfiguration Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). Based on the analyses in the EA, DOE believes that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. Therefore, DOE proposes to issue a Proposed FONSI pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and the DOE NEPA implementing regulations (10 CFR part 1021). This Proposed FONSI and the supporting EA are being made available for public review and comment for a period of 30 days following the date of this notice. DOE will consider comments received in making a final determination on whether to issue a FONSI or to incorporate the analysis of proposed consolidation of the nonnuclear component of the Complex into the Reconfiguration PEIS. INVITATION TO COMMENT: DOE invites the public, including states which host these DOE facilities and Indian tribes that might be affected by the proposed action, to comment on this proposed FONSI. Please direct any comments to Mr. Howard R. Canter at the address presented in the following section. In accordance with 40 CFR 1501.4(a)(2)(i) and 10 CFR 1021.322(d), DOE is making this proposed FONSI available for public review for 30 days. DOE has made the EA and related documents available to the public. Copies of the EA are available upon request at the address given below. DOE will also make public comments received on this proposed FONSI available to the public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 16, 1991, the then Secretary of Energy announced his decision to prepare an EA for the consolidation of nonnuclear functions of the Complex. The public notice regarding the Secretary's decision was published on January 27, 1992 (57 FR 3046). The nonnuclear consolidation proposal is based upon the DOE Nonnuclear Consolidation Plan (NCP), September 1991, as amended. The NCP also provided the basis for determining the consolidation alternatives analyzed in the EA. DOE determined that the proposal to consolidate nonnuclear facilities could be analyzed in an EA prior to completion of the Reconfiguration PEIS (see 40 CFR1506.1(c)) because (1) there are significant benefits for the nation from nonnuclear consolidation, i.e., cost savings and preservation of technical competence, whether the rest of the Complex is reconfigured or not, and (2) decisions regarding nonnuclear consolidation will neither affect nor be affected by decisions to be made following the completion of the Reconfiguration PEIS. A preapproval review copy of the EA was sent to affected states and Indian Tribes for comment in December 1992. Comments received during the review period were taken into account in preparing the final EA. Appendix G of the EA contains all comments received and DOE responses. As required by the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1993 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, DOE also prepared and submitted to Congress the Nonnuclear Reconfiguration Cost Effectiveness Report (CER) on January 15, 1993. Each of three independent consultants, appointed by Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary to review the CER and accompanying certifications, confirmed on May 25, 1993, that the proposed consolidation is cost effective and would not increase the technological, environmental, safety, or health risks associated with Departmental activities. Their review and conclusions did not result in any changes to the proposed nonnuclear consolidation proposal, and the Secretary made the decision to proceed with the Nonnuclear Consolidation process. If supported by the EA, a FONSI would allow DOE to accelerate the proposed consolidation of nonnuclear facilities in response to Presidential initiatives to reduce the Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Proposed Action DOE proposes to terminate the Complex missions at Mound and Pinellas, and Complex nonnuclear missions at RFP. The nonnuclear electrical and mechanical manufacturing functions would be consolidated at KCP. Existing research, development, and testing (RD&T) and prototype fabrication capabilities at LANL and SNL/NM would be augmented to provide a limited fabricating capability for future neutron generator work, high power detonators, beryllium technology, pit support functions, and other nonnuclear components now located at Mound, Pinellas, and RFP. These enhanced capabilities would be used to satisfy future weapons stockpile needs, if and when identified. Tritium-handlingfunctions now performed at Mound and Pinellas would be consolidated with tritium functions now located at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and LANL, respectively. The capabilities transferred to KCP, SRS, LANL and SNL/NM would, for the most part, be integrated into the existing plant facilities with appropriate plant modifications and renovations. The nonnuclear manufacturing workload would be downsized at all sites in response to Presidential initiatives, including START II, to reduce the nuclear weapons stockpile. The following specific actions are proposed: * Mission Closeouts--Complex missions at Mound and Pinellas and the Complex nonnuclear missions at RFP would be terminated, and associated nonnuclear facilities turned over to the DOE Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM) for cleanup and restoration. * Electrical and Mechanical-The nonnuclear electrical and mechanical capabilities now at Mound, Pinellas, and RFP would be consolidated at KCP within existing facilities. o Tritium-Handling-All tritium- handling capabilities now performed at Mound would be relocated to be with the tritium functions now performed at SRS. The neutron tube target loading for the current design of neutron generators, now performed at Pinellas, would be completed. Capability for future neutron tube target loading requirements would be provided within existing facilities at LANL. * Detonators-The existing RD&T and prototyping capability at LANL would be enhanced to provide a limited manufacturing capability for high power detonators, now done at Mound. (The existing RD&T technology base for low- power explosives components would be maintained at SNL/NM; the existing capabilities at Mound to manufacture these components would no longer be needed.) * Beryllium Technology and Pit Support-The existing technology base and prototyping capability at LANL would be enhanced to provide limited manufacturing capability for beryllium technology and pit support work now done at RFP. * Neutron Generators, Cap Assemblies, and Batteries-Manufacture of the current design of neutron generators at Pinellas would be completed. The existing technology base for neutron generators would be maintained at SNL/NM. Existing RD&T and prototyping capability at SNI/NM would be augmented to provide a limited manufacturing capability for future advanced design neutron36659 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8 1993 / Notices generators. Manufacturing capability for cap assemblies would be relocated from Pinellas to existing facilities at SNL/ NM. The technology base now at Pinellas for the manufacture of thermal batteries would be transferred to existing facilities at SNL/NM; manufacture of the batteries would continue to be performed by the private sector. The assembly of lithium ambient batteries from commercially acquired lithium cells would be transferred to KCP. e Special Products-The nuclear grade steels procurement and storage capability, safe secure trailer manufacturing capability, weapons trainer shop, and metrology services would be transferred from RFP to KCP. The calorimeter manufacturing capability would be relocated from Mound to existing facilities at LANL The milliwatt heat source surveillance activities would be relocated from Mound to SNLINM. Purpose and Need DOE has proposed to reconfigure the Complex to be smaller, less diverse, and less expensive to operate. The Complex must safely and reliably support whatever nuclear deterrent stockpile objectives are established in the future by the President and funded by Congress. The Nation's nuclear weapons manufacturing requirements are not as great as they were in the past, and maintaining a large manufacturing infrastructure is not a productive use of national resources. The purpose of nonmuclear consolidation is to manage better nonnuclear manufacturing activities within the Complex, and to decrease the long-term operating costs of the Complex. In addition, consolidation of the nonnuclear manufacturing activities would provide a means to maintain the specialized skill base needed to produce and test these components, as workload requirements decrease significantly. The nonnuclear products and services of the Complex are needed to design and manufacture nuclear weapons and test individual components. DOE needs to maintain a nonnuclear capability in order to be able to manufacture, test, and monitor nuclear weapons. Alternatives In addition to the proposed action, the EA analyzed three alternatives in which electrical and mechanical manufacturing activities would be consolidated at sites other than KCP. The three alternative consolidation sites for electrical and mechanical manufacturing activities were Mound, Pinellas, and RFP. For each of thesealternatives, the consolidation site for electrical and mechanical activities would retain all of its other nonnuclear manufacturing activities and receive additional electrical and mechanical activities from KCP and the other two mission closeout sites. The current normuclear manufacturing activities at KCP and the other two mission closeout sites would be terminated and remaining nonnuclear activities at these sites would be relocated to either SRS, LANL, or SNL/NM. The EA analyzed the option of locating beryllium technology and pit support work, now done at RFP, at the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee instead of at LANL Under the Y-12 option, the existing capability at Y-12 would be enhanced to accomplish this work. The proposed action does not include the Y-12 6ption. No Action Alternative The EA compared the impacts of the proposed action to those expected to occur if DOE did not consolidate these functions. Under this alternative, all sites included in the proposed action would retain their current weapons missions. Planned upgrades, renovations, repairs, end maintenance activities necessary to improve Complex compliance with all environment, safety, and health and environmental restoration standards would continue irrespective of future Complex configuration. DOE expects that under No Action many currnt.facilities would be placed in an essentially standby mode due to a major reduction in nuclear weapons manufacturing requirements, with correspondingly reduced environmental impacts. Considerations Common to All Alternatives All alternatives were based on the same projected workload, which is substantially lower than requirements of the recent past. Planned upgrades, renovations, repairs, and maintenance activities necessary to enable DOE compliance with all environment, safety, and health and environmental restoration standards would continue at Complex facilities irrespective of the configuration of the Complex. The nonnuclear consolidation proposal does not include components currently purchased from the private sector. Many nonnuclear weapons components are now manufactured and supplied by private companies. Private manufacture of certain components would continue under all alternatives. Where practical and cost effective, DOE may transfer manufacture of additional products to the private sector underexisting procurement procedures. However. with recent reductions in the stockpile level, component manufacturing activities may be returned to the government from the private sector because the workload does not make it cost effective for thee private suppliers to continue manufacturing such small quantities. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Based on the analysis of environmental impacts in the Nonnuclear Consolidation EA, DOE believes that the proposed action would not result in any significant environmental impacts. Implementing tlhe proposed action would involve changes and/or modifications to existing buildings at KCP, SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM. Relocated activities would be compatible with existing land use plans and policies. The peak construction workforce of fewer than 100 workers at each site would have negligible effects on area land use, housing, and social services. No significant impacts on ecological resources, geological resources, or soil are expected. Air quality and noise impacts from construction activities are expected to be negligible since most activities would occur within existing buildings. No new construction or activities associated with the proposed action would occur within identified base floodplains or wetlands that would require a floodplain/wetland assessment under 10 CFR 1022.12 (a). (The base floodplain is defined as the 100-year (1.0 percent) floodplain.) Currently, KCP is the only site potentially vulnerable to floods in the proposed consolidated nonnuclear complex. However, KCP will be protected from a 500-year flood event upon completion in December 1993 of a new levee. Construction of the levee is covered by an EA and FONSI prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental Assessment: Completion of Flood Protection Works, Bannister Road Federal Complex, Kansas City, Missouri (September 1990) The Department adopted this EA (DOE/ EA-0509] and issued a FONSI on September 18, 1991. No impacts are expected on archeological or historic sites on any of the sites proposed to receive relocated nonnuclear activities. Based on comments received from the EA pre-approval review process, there is no indication that the proposed action would have any adverse affects on any historic or archaeological resources at KCP, SRS, LANL, or SNIJNM. Durihg operation, minor increases in air emissions and noise are expected,36660 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 1 Notices but would not exceed applicable emissions standards and/or guidelines. Therefore, air quality and noise impacts would not be significant. Terminating the nonnuclear missions at Mound, Pinellas, and RFP would improve the local air quality near these sites, but not significantly. Increases in water usage would be less than I percent of current usage at KCP, SRS, and LANL, and less than 3 percent at SNL/NM. Adequate water supplies are available to accommodate the increase; therefore, no significant impacts on water resources are expected. Socioeconomic and community service impacts at KCP, SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM are not expected to be significant. The proposed action would create approximately 1,095 jobs (425 direct and 670 indirect) at KCP at peak operations. Total in-migration would be approximately 558 persons. At SRS, approximately 103 jobs (45 direct and 58 indirect) would be created. Total in- migration would be approximately 60 persons. At LANL, approximately 294 jobs (115 direct and 179 indirect) would be created. Total in-migration would be about 154 persons. At SNL/NM, approximately 940 jobs (385 direct and 555 indirect) would be created at peak operation. Total in-migration would be about 515 persons. The change in population during the time of peak operation would be less than 1 percent at all sites and the need for additional housing units would be negligible. Therefore, socioeconomic impacts are not significant. These in-migration estimates do not take into account such factors as rehiring preference for displaced workers that may result from the workforce restructuring plan developed for the site, as required by section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. Accordingly, these in-migration estimates represent the maximum expected at each site. Adverse economic consequences will occur at Mound, Pinellas, and RFP due to the termination of nonnuclear missions at these sites. At Mound, approximately 2,846 jobs (1,070 direct and 1,776 indirect) would be lost. This reduction in jobs would not increase the unemployment rate in the year 2000 beyond the projected baseline level of 5.6 percent. Earnings in the Mound region-of-influence (those areas in which approximately 90 percent of current DOE and contractor employees reside) would be reduced by about $93.1 million, with related decrease in the total personal income of $119.3 million. The CQty of Miamisburg would lose an estimated $0.8 million in income tax revenue in the year 2000 as a result ofthe loss of direct employment at Mound. This loss represents a 10 percent loss in total income tax revenue, a 9 percent loss in General Fund revenue, and a loss of less than 4 percent in total actual revenues. The less than I percent change in population after weapons mission termination would create an estimated 600 additional vacant housing units. The additional vacant housing units represent less than a I percent increase in the Mound region-of- influence. At Pinellas, approximately 3,038 jobs (1,050 direct and 1,988 indirect) would be lost. This reduction in jobs would not increase the unemployment rate in the year 2000 beyond the projected baseline level of 5.4 percent. Earnings in the Pinellas region.of-influence would be reduced by about $103.1 million, with a related decrease in the total personal income of $148.2 million. The less than I percent change in population after weapons mission termination would create an estimated 700 additional vacant housing units. The additional vacant housing units represent less than a 1 percent increase in the Pinellas region-of-influence. At RFP, approximately 1,917 jobs (750 direct and 1,167 indirect) would be lost. This reduction in jobs would not increase the unemployment rate in the year 2000 beyond the projected baseline level of 5.6 percent. Earnings in the RFP region-of-influence would be reduced by about $68.5 million, with a related decrease in the total personal income of $82.2 million. The less than 1 percent change in population after nonnuclear weapon mission termination would create an estimated 400 additional vacant housing units. The additional vacant housing units represent less than a I percent increase in the local RFP area. As a result of ongoing planning, DOE has revised the workforce estimates presented in the EA. Recently revised workforce figures for direct jobs are slightly different than the workforce number used in the EA analysis and therefore the estimates of indirect jobs would also be slightly different. Additional estimated direct jobs have been revised to 330 at KCP (a decrease of 95), 125 at LANL (an increase of 10), 390 at SNL (an increase of 5), and 50 at SRS (an increase of 5). The proposed fiscal year 1994 budget projects a reduction in expenditures at most DOE sites resulting in reduced employment. The reduction in workforce associated with the budget reductions is only estimated at this time. The current estimate of direct jobs lost at sites with mission closeouts is 1,020 at Mound (a decrease of 50), 800at Pinellas (a decrease of 250), and 715 at RFP (a decrease of 15). The estimated direct jobs reduction would also cause the estimated number of indirect jobs lost to be less than those used in the EA analysis. The revised workforce estimates do not affect any impact conclusions presented in the EA. Nonnuclear manufacturing activities associated with the proposed action would increase hazardous waste volumes by less than 7 percent and would not have significant impacts on waste management at KCP, SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM. Anticipated increases in waste volumes at these sites are well within the existing treatment, storage, and disposal capabilities. Effluents and emissions due to waste management activities attributed to the proposed action would be negligible. Under the proposed action sanitary/industrial wastewater volumes are projected to increase at all sites, but not significantly. At KCP, SRS, and LANL, the increase is less than I percent over the current rate at these sites; at SNI/ NM, the increase is less than 2 percent over the current rate. All sites have sufficient waste treatment, storage, and disposal capacity to handle the projected increases; therefore, no significant impacts are expected. At Mound, Pinellas, and RFP, nonnuclear production waste streams would be eliminated; however, this would not result in a significant impact. No significant adverse impacts to the health of the public or workers is expected from implementation or operation activities associated with the proposed action at any of the sites. Hazard Indexes of less than 1.0 were calculated for onsite and at the site boundary at KCP, SRS, LANL, and SNL/ NM. (The Hazard Index is a numerical indicator of the threshold between acceptable and unacceptable exposure levels of noncarcinogenic hazardous compounds. A Hazard Index value of 1.0 or less means that no adverse health effects are expected to occur.) The cancer risk to workers at KCP, SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM would be insignificant. The amount and types of chemicals associated with relocated activities would not add significantly to existing health conditions at these sites. Activities relocated to SNL/NM would result in annual cancer risks to workers of 6x10-6 due to the introduction of certain chemical solvents. The cancer risk to the public at SNL/NM was less than 10-6 annually. EPA accepts a two- level risk for carcinogens that depends upon the compound class and the hazard which it presents, so that risk levels of 10-5 and 10-6 are considered reasonable (55 FR 60848). Measures36661 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices such as substituting less toxic solvents or modifying production procedures would be implemented to minimize the cancer risk to workers at SNL/NM. No significant radiological health effects are expected at LANL, SNL/NM, or SRS as a result of the proposed action. The annual dose increment associated with the increase in tritium emissions at LANL and SNL/NM would be less than 0.1 mrem and 0.022 mrem effective dose equivalent, respectively. At SRS, the annual dose increment would be less than 0.001 mrem effective dose equivalent. These doses would result in an increased risk of less than 4.5x10- and 9.8x10-9 potential fatal cancers from 1 year of operation at LANL and SNL/NM, respectively, and 4.5x10-10 at SRS. The annual dose increment to workers at LANL, SNL/NM, and SRS would be less than 0.011 mrem. This dose would result in an incremental and cumulative increased risk of 4.9x10-9 and 1.3x10-7 potential fatal cancers, respectively, from I year of operation at these sites. The accident profiles at each site would not change as a result of the proposed action. The probability or consequences of potential accidents would not increase appreciably at any of the sites since relocated functions involve activities and chemicals that are currently being performed at consolidation sites. The proposed action would have no cumulative effects on the Complex, because the action represents a consolidation of existing activities and functions, rather than an initiation of new activities. In most instances, consolidation would reduce potential cumulative environmental impacts at all sites. Nonnuclear activities now located within aging facilities at donor sites would be transferred to sites with newly refurbished facilities. These facilities would be designed and constructed to incorporate DOE environment, safety, and health requirements on Complex reconfiguration and meet all applicable codes and standards. The facilities to which the nonnuclear activities would be transferred already contain virtually all of these operations, materials, and/or hazardous waste streams. Consolidation would also reduce the number of sites with activities generating these hazardous materials within the Complex. Environmental Impacts of Alternatives Environmental consequences discussed above at SRS, LANL, and SNL/NM under the proposed action would be the same or less under the Mound, Pinellas, and RFP alternatives and not significant. At the consolidationsites for each alternative (Mound, Pinellas, and RFP), substantial new construction would be required. If these alternatives were selected, additional site-specific NEPA documentation would be required. Proposed Determination Based on the information and analysis in the EA, DOE believes that the proposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of NEPA, and that incorporation into the Reconfiguration PEIS is not required. DOE will make its final determination on whether to issue a FONSI or to incorporate into the PEIS after the 30- day public review period. Issued in Washington, DC this 1st day of July, 1993. Peter N.

[FR Doc. 93-16158 Filed 7-7-93; 8:45 am] BILUNO CODE 450-01-M Bonneville Power Administration Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Coyote Springs Cogeneratlon Project AGENCY: Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), DOE. ACTION: Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) under section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321). SUMMARY: BPA intends to prepare an EIS on the transmission integration of Portland General Electric's (PGE) Coyote Springs Cogeneration Project, an electric power generating plant proposed in Morrow County near the City of Boardman, Oregon. PGE has asked BPA to provide transmission integration services over the Federal transmission grid to one or more points of delivery on PGE's transmission system in Oregon. The Coyote Springs Project would have two combined-cycle combustion turbines with a total electrical output of 494 megawatts (MW). The plant would also supply approximately 225,000 kilograms (500,000 pounds) of steam per hour to steam customers. A 2.4- kilometer (1.5-mile), 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission line and a new substation would be built to interconnect the plant with a nearby BPA transmission line. About 28 kilometers (18 miles) of natural gas pipeline spur would be built by Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT) from a point on their existing pipeline northeast of lone, Oregon, to the plant site. The proposed coganeration plant, transmission tap line, substation, and natural gas pipeline are parts of a single project. BPA has assumed the role of lead agency for the project EIS. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is a cooperating agency. The FERC will be preparing an EIS for PGT's second northwest expansion project which proposes 140 kilometers (90 miles) of new pipelines and compressor stationswithin Oregon. The pipeline to Coyote Springs will be evaluated separately by FERC in their EIS. BPA will summarize this information in the Coyote Springs EIS. A fact sheet that summarizes project specifics, potential benefits, environmental considerations and scheduled events is currently being prepared. Persons who wish to receive the fact sheet or other information on the proposed project should contact one of the information sources listed below. DATES: BPA has established a 30-day scoping period (beginning July 8, 1993) during which affected landowners, concerned citizens, special interest groups and local governments are invited to comment on the scope of the proposed EIS. Scoping will help BPA ensure that a full range of issues related to this proposal are addressed in the EIS, and also will identify significant or potentially significant impacts that may result from the proposed project. Comments on the proposed scope of the EIS are invited from all interested parties. Written comments should be sent to the address identified below. Comments may be made at an EIS scoping meeting to be held at Riverside High School in Boardman, Oregon, on July 29, 1993, from 7-10 p.m. The State of Oregon Energy Facility Siting Council (EFSC) is currently evaluating PGE's \"Application for a Site Certificate on the Coyote Springs Cogeneration Project.\" Oregon's site evaluation process, like NEPA, provides opportunity for public participation. BPA will coordinate its processes with those of the State of Oregon. The EIS scoping meeting will be jointly sponsored by BPA and EFSC. The meeting will provide information on the Coyote Springs Plant, the Pacific Gas Transmission Company's (PGT) natural gas pipeline, and BPA electrical facilities. The draft EIS (DEIS) will be circulated for public review and commenL BPA will provide a public comment period and public comment meetings for the DEIS. BPA will consider and respond to comments received on the DEIS in the final EIS (FEIS). ADDRESSES: BPA invites comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the DEIS. Send comment letters, requests to be placed on the project mailing list, and/or requests for more information to the Public Involvement Manager, P.O. Box 12999, Portland, Oregon 97212.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As identified'in Compliance part 1021). Appendix D to subpart D. \"Classes of Actions that Normally Require EISs,\" this proposed project falls within category D6, \"Integrating transmission facilities\" (i.e., transmission system additions for integrating major new sources of generation into a Power Marketing Administration's main grid). Proposed Action BPA proposes to amend its General Transmission Agreement with PGE to establish Coyote Springs as a point of interconnection for wheeling services. A 500-kV substation and 0.8-kilometer (0.5-mile) transmission loop line to the McNary-Slatt 500-kV line will connect the new Coyote Springs Cogeneration Project with BPA's transmission grid. BPA also would install microwave communication facilities to connect Coyote Springs with BPA's existing operations network. PGE proposes to build the Coyote Springs cogeneration plant on a site within the Port of Morrow Industrial Park. Associated facilities that would also be installed at the plant site include an electrical substation, oil storage tanks, water storage tanks, cooling towers, a workshop, a warehouse, and administrative offices. PGE also plans to build a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) 500-kV transmission line from the plant to the substation. When the project is complete, the integration of the Coyote Springs cogeneration plant into the BPA system would occur at the new substation. From this substation, power will be transmitted over the McNary-Slatt 500- kV line to one or more points of delivery. PGE will pay BPA for this service. All proposed facilities are located within the Port of Morrow Industrial Park near the City of Boardman, Oregon.36663 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices Alternatives Alternatives identified for evaluation in the EIS are: (1) The proposed section; and (2) no action (the consequences of not providing transfer services to PGE). Identification of Environmental Issues BPA plans to prepare an EIS addressing both PGE's Coyote Springs cogeneration plant and the associated transmission facilities. This decision is the result of two factors: (1) The Coyote Springs cogeneration plant depends on BPA's transmission grid to deliver electricity to PGE's customers; and (2) no other Federal or state agency is currently preparing an EIS on the Coyote Springs plant. NEPA aitd associated court rulings direct Federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of all connected actions even when such actions are proposed by others. In the absence of another EIS, BPA intends to scope its EIS so that the impacts of both transmission elements and the Coyote Springs cogenerations plant are addressed. Issues presently identified for consideration is the DEIS fall within two categories as follows: Coyote Springs cogeneration plant: (1) Air quality impacts; (2) noise impacts from plant operation; (3) aesthetic impacts; (4) socioeconomic impacts created by an influx of construction workers in a sparsely populated area; and (5) impacts to nearby wildlife areas. Transmission Facilities: (1) Removal of agricultural land from production at the substation site; (2) disruption of agricultural activities under the transmission line; (3) potential effects of transmission line tower construction in wetlands; (4) concern over possible health effects from-exposure to electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by high-voltage transmission lines, and what those effects might be; (5) aesthetic effects of a new transmission line and substation as viewed from Interstate Highway 84; and (6) potential impacts on cultural resources. These, together with any additional issues identified through the scoping process, will be examined in the EIS. Issued in Portland, Oregon on June 28. 1993. Randall W. Hardy, Administrator.

Northwest proposes to abandon, in part, existing natural gas metering facilities at the Ritzville Meter Station and to install upgraded replacement facilities at the station, located in Adams County, Washington. Northwest states that the facilities are required to better accommodate existing delivery, obligations to The Washington Water Power Company (Water Power). Northwest explains that the existing facilities are obsolete and inadequate. It is stated that, inter alia, the existing 4- inch positive displacement meter would be replaced by a 3-inch turbine meter, and the two existing 1-inch regulators would be replaced with two new 1-inch regulators with 35 percent trim. Northwest states that the changes would increase the maximum design delivery capacity from 1,033 MMBtu equivalent per day to about 1,868 MMBtu per day, at an outlet pressure of 150 psig. Northwest estimates that the total cost of the project would be approximately $48,335. Northwest advises that, since the upgrades are necessary to replace obsolete and inadequate equipment, it would not require a reimbursement from Water Power. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to \u00a7 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.

[FR Doc. 93-16046 No. CP93-520-O0] Texas Gas Transmission Corp.; Application July 1, 1993. Take notice that on June 28, 1993, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky 42302, filed in Docket No. CP93-520-000 an application, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of certain looping facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Texas Gas proposes to construct and operate 12.2 miles of 8-inch pipeline paralleling its existing 8-inch Ripley- Jackson system in Haywood andMadison Counties, Tennessee which would cost an estimated $3,210,000. Texas Gas indicates that there are two purposes which support the need for the construction of the additional facilities. First, it is stated that three of Texas Gas' existing customers served off the Ripley- Jackson system have requested increases in contract demand. Texas Gas states that Jackson Utility Division (Jackson) and City of Brownsville Utility Board (Brownsville) have requested increases of firm transportation service under Texas Gas' Rate Schedule ST of 3,500 million Btu per day and 700 million Btu per day, respectively. It is also stated that the City of Humboldt, Tennessee has requested an additional 495 million Btu per day of firm no-notice service under Texas Gas' proposed Rate Schedule SGT. Texas Gas notes that a portion of the proposed 8-inch loop is necessary for Texas Gas to accommodate these requested increases in firm transportation service. It is indicated that the transportation and no-notice services would be performed pursuant to \u00a7 284.223 of the Commission's Regulations. Second, Texas Gas states that the installation of the entire 12.2 miles of proposed pipeline would allow Texas Gas to complete the looping of the majority of its Ripley-Jackson system, providing dual line security for the cities of Humboldt and Jackson, Tennessee as well as several other small communities, all of which are served solely by Texas Gas. It is also indicated that the proposed looping would provide other operating efficiencies. It is indicatedthat during the winter months, the operation of the Ripley- Jackson system is very tedious and disrupts the operation of Texas Gas' main line system. Texas Gas states that, in order to maintain adequate pressure at the terminus of the Ripley-Jackson system, the main line system has to be operated so that maximum pressure is maintained at the beginning of the system which, it is indicated, is an inefficient operational mode for the main line. It is stated that an interrupt at the Covington, Tennessee compressor station causes serious inlet pressure problems into the Ripley-Jackson system. Texas Gas states that the completion of the proposed looping would minimize the inlet pressure problems during interrupts on the main line system durinq peak periods. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 22, 1993, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest In accordance with the36681 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be. taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate for the proposal is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Texas Gas to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretar.

The Association alleges that the licensee has violated Article 33 of its license, which requires the licensee to make every effort to draw down the water surface elevation level in the project reservoir to 0.0 gage (elevation \";79.53 U.S.C. and G.S. datum) byDecember 31 of each year.1 To support its claim that the licensee has disregarded the draw-down date, the Association provided lake level readings showing that the 0.0 gage elevation was exceeded in January of ten previous years.2 The Association contends that because the draw-down date is not being met, the lake is experiencing shoreline ice expansion damage. Any person may submit comments regarding this complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. The respondent, Wisconsin Valley Improvement Company, is required to file an answer to the complaint pursuant to Rules 206 and 213, 18 CFR 385.206 and 385.213. No replies to respondent's answer will be accepted. In determining the appropriate action to take, the Commission will consider all comments filed. Copies of the complaint are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Comments and the answer to the complaint are due on or before August 27, 1993.

ACTION: Notice of proposed adjustments to the firm power rate and transmission rate--Loveland Area Projects. SUMMARY: The Western Area Power Administration (Western) is proposing rate adjustments (Proposed Rates) for firm power service and transmission service for Loveland Area Projects (LAP). The power repayment studies and other analyses indicate that the Proposed Rates for firm power and transmission service are necessary to provide sufficient revenue to pay all annual costs (including Interest36682 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices expense], plus repayment of required investment within the allowable time period. The rate impacts are detailed in a rate brochure to be distributed to all interested parties. The first of the Proposed Rates is expected to become effective on February 1, 1994. The Proposed Rate for firm power composite rate increases the existing rate by 2.05 mills per kilowatthour (mills/kWh). The increase is implemented over a 2-year period. The composite rate for the first year (effective February 1, 1994) is 21.06 mills/kWh. This composite rate consists of an energy charge of 10.53 mills/kWh and a capacity charge of $2.70 per kilowatt-month ($/kW-month). The composite rate for the second year (effective October 1, 1994) is 22.11 mills/kWh. The second year compositerate consists of an energy charge of 11.05 mills/kWh and a capacity charge of $2.90/kW-month. The existing LAP firm power composite rate is 20.06 mills/kWh, comprised of an energy charge of 10.03 mills/kWh and a capacity charge of $2.58/kW-month. The Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), approved the existing firm power rate schedule on an interim basis on August 30, 1991, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) confirmed and approved the rate schedule on a final basis on January 28, 1992. This existing rate schedule was placed into effect on October 1, 1991. The Proposed Rates for transmission service increase the existing capacity rate by $.36/kW-month; or increase theexisting energy rate by .5 mills per kWh if the customer's rate is energy-based. The rates would become effective on February 1, 1994, the same date as the first increase in the firm power service rate. The Proposed Rates are $1.88/kW- month for capacity or 2.6 mills per kWh for energy. The existing transmission service rates are $1.52/kW-month for capacity or 2.1 mills per kwh. The Assistant Secretary, DOE, approved the existing transmission rate schedules for firm and nonfirm service on an interim basis on August 27, 1990. and FERC confirmed and approved the rate schedules on a final basis on April 29, 1991. These existing rate schedules were placed into effect on October 1, 1990.

At the meeting, the Panel will receive briefings from various parties on the background of the IEL Site and the work done to date. Based on these presentations and discussion at the meeting, the Panel will determine what other information is needed and how they will carry out their charge (as outlined below). Background The Agency's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) requested that the Science Advisory Board (SAB) form an ad hoc advisory panel to conduct a review of issues related to screening criteria and procedures for radioactive waste materials at a specific superfund site. The ad hoc EEL Advisory Panel was organized by the Science Advisory Board for the purpose of addressing this issue. The charge outlined below contains the wording of the request as agreed to by the SAB. To address the charge, the ad hoc Panel will review a specific site where sub-surface radioactive contamination may be present, the Industrial Excess Landfill (IEL) Superfund site in \" Uniontown, Ohio. Citizens residing near the EEL site are concerned that radioactive wastes had been illegally disposed at the site. Former EPA Administrator Reilly asked Clean Sites,, Incorporated to perform an independent evaluation of the Agency's management of the IEL site, with emphasis on the radiation sampling being conducted. Clean Sites' March 1992 report to the Administrator contained several recommendations, including one concerning the radiation sampling issue. With respect to radiation sampling, Clen Sites recommended that the Agency request that the Science Advisory Board (SAB) perform specific tasks to resolve data analysis issues at the EEL site. Although these issues arose from this one site, they are of concern to other Superfund sites at which radioactive contamination is suspected and could be used to develop generic guidelines for dealing with such sites. Past, present, and anticipated activitiesand data collected at this location will be used as source materials for the ad hoc Panel in its deliberations. Charge to the Panel In general, at hazardous waste sites where radioactive contamination is suspected, EPA first performs a screening round of sampling. If the screening round data indicate that there is a problem, the Agency performs more extensive investigations. If the screening round data indicate no contamination, further sampling is eliminated.,What kind of sampling and analytic protocol is adequate to determine the presence/ extent of soil and groundwater contamination at a site which may incorporate radioactive wastes? Specific questions forthe Panel include: a. For screening purposes, what types of temporal and spatial sampling and analyses are sufficient to test a hypothesis that radioactive contamination is present? b. What radiological parameters, e.g., gross alpha plus alpha spectrometry, gross beta, gamma spectrometry, tritium, and carbon-14, are sufficient to determine the possible existence/extent of potential sub-surface radiological contamination? Are the methods employed by EPA for analysis of radioactive contamination adequate and appropriate for analyses of samples from hazardous waste sites? c. There are generic guidelines for sampling and analytic methods and chain of custody protocols to ensure that cross contamination or tampering with samples does not occur when dealing with radioactive contaminants. If appropriate, these guidelines may be modified on a site-specific basis depending on the characteristics of the site in question. What modifications are scientifically justified while still assuring accurate, precise and valid data? d. What factors need to be considered in the development and application of data validation criteria for evaluation of radioactive contaminants at hazardous waste sites? e. The ad hoc Panel may address other issues as they deem appropriate.

SUMMARY: The Deputy Commissioner for Operations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denies Dr. Robert A. Fogari's request for a hearing and issues a final order permanently debarring Dr. Robert A. Fogari, 58 Twin Brooks Rd., Saddle River, NJ 07458,under section 306(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 335a(a)). The Deputy Commissioner bases this order on her finding that Dr. Fogari was convicted of Federal felonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 1505 for conduct relating to the development and approval, including the process for development and approval of a drug product; and relating to the regulation of a drug product under the act. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 8, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Megan L. Foster, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-366), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855,301- 295-8041. ADDRESSES: Application for termination debarment to the Management Branch (HFA-305), Food -and rm. 1-23, Rock*.rille, MD 20857. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Dr. Robert A. Fogari, a former clinical investigator who participated in experimental drug studies for nine different drug manufacturers, pled guilty and was sentenced on February 2, 1989, for, in addition to other offenses, two counts of submission of false documents, and one count of obstruction of justice, Federal felony offenses under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 1505. The basis for these convictions was Dr. Fogari's data falsifications and omissions in the written reports of the drug studies that he conducted. In a certified letter received by Dr. Robert A. Fogari on January 8, 1993, FDA offered Dr. Fogari an opportunity for a hearing on the agency's proposal to issue an order under section 306(a) of the act debarring Dr. Fogari from providing services in any capacity to a person that has an approved or pending drug product application. FDA based the proposal to debar on its finding that Dr. Fogari's conduct leading to his convictions under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 1505 related to the development and approval and the regulation of variousdrug products.The certified letter also informed Dr. Fogari that his request for a hearing could not rest upon mere allegations or denials but must present specific facts showing that there was a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing. The letter also noted that if it conclusively appeared from the face of the information and factual analyses in his request for a hearing that there was no genuine and substantial issue of fact36691 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices which precluded the order of debarment, FDA would enter summary judgment against him, making findings and conclusions, and denying his request for a hearing. In a letter dated January 26, 1993, Dr, Fogari responded to the certified letter by requesting a hearing. H1. Denial of Hearing In his request for a hearing, Dr. Fogari failed to present any arguments or information to show why he should not be debarred. Therefore, FDA finds that Dr. Fogari has failed to identifyany genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing. Accordingly, pursuant to 21 CFR 12.28, the agency denies Dr. Fogari's request for a hearing. I. Findings and Order Therefore, as Deputy Commissioner for Operations, under section 306(a) of the act, I find that Dr. Robert A.

ACTION: Notice of document availability. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan for Lipochaeta venosa and Isodendrion hosakae. This endangered plant species occurs in the South Kohala District of the Island of Hawaii. DATES: Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before September 7, 1993, to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting Pacific Islands Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 6307, 300 Ala Moana Boulevard, P.O. Box .50167, Honolulu, Hawaii 96850 (phone 808/541-2749).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Karen W. Rosa, Fish and Wildlife Biologist, at the above Honolulu address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's36693 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act as amended in 1988 requires that public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during the public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. Substantive technical comments will result in .changes to the plans. Substantive comments regarding recovery plan implementation may not necessarily result in changes to the recovery plans, but will be forwarded to appropriate Federal or other entities so that they can take these comments into account during the course of implementing recovery actions. Individualized responses to comments will not be provided. The species being considered in this recovery plan are Lipochaeta venosa and Isodendrion hosakae. These species are limited to six cinder cones located on the Parker Ranch in the South Kohala District on the island of Hawaii. Both species occur together on two cinder cones, and L hosakae and L. venosa occur separately at one and three other sites, respectively. The presence of these species on the steeply sloped cinder cones is interpreted as an indication that these steep cones are havens from grazing animals, not preferred habitats. It is inferred that their ranges once included, at the least, the lands between the cones where they are now extant, but there is no historical data to confirm this. Recovery efforts will focus on protection of all extant individuals from herbivores, fire and alien plant species, propagation of plants to augment existing populations, and expansion of both species to all six of the cinder cones where one or both now exist. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specifiedabove will be considered prior to approval of this plan.

ACl1ON: Notice. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Federal Aid is revising its policies and procedures for special projects funded by Federal Aid Administrative funds. The policy is being revised in response to criticisms that the existing policy does not include a systematic procedure to notify potential applicants of the availability of Federal Aid Administrative funds; that it is not being applied consistently and that it promotes unrealistic expectations among applicants who do apply. The revised policy is being implemented as a pilot for this year's grant cycle with the understanding that it will be finalized at a later date. Comments on the revised policy will be accepted during this grants cycle and until further notice. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking applications/ proposals under this revised policy for sport fish and wildlife restoration projects which will be awarded funding in fiscal year 1994. The requirements for submitting and selecting proposals are contained in this notice. Focus areas are not being included as part of the selection criteria for applications submitted in response to this notice for this year only. DATES: Applications/proposals must be received by July 22, 1993. ADDRESSES: Applications/proposals and comments must be submitted to: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Chief, Division of Federal Aid, MS 140, 1849 C Street NW., Washington, DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: ir. Columbus Brown. Chief, Division of Federal Aid. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; (703) 358-2156. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Significant revisions to the policyinclude providing for annual notification of the availability of funds through Notices in the Federal Register; and establishing and announcing in the Federal Register, focus areas which will be included as part of the selection criteria. Focus areas will be used to further promote and encourage efforts that address priority needs of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the States. The revised policy also clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the Division of Federal Aid's Washington and Regional Offices and establishes uniform requirements for all applicants. Dated: May 18, 1993. Richard N. Smith, Director. A. Purpose This statement establishes policies and procedures for selecting special projects funded with Federal Aid Administrative Funds. Special projects are activities that assist the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in administering Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration Programs and facilitate the efforts of the States in implementing these programs. B. Background The mission of the Federal Aid Program is to strengthen the ability of State and Territorial fish and wildlife agencies to meet effectively the consumptive and non-consumptive needs of the public for fish and wildlife resources. The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act authorize the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with the States and to use administrative funds for carrying out this mission. Federal Aid Administrative Funds are those funds deducted from amounts available under the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act. The statutory provisions related to administrative deductions are as follows: Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration (SFR)-Federal Aid Administrative Funds for sport fish restoration may not exceed 6 percent of the deposits in the Sport Fish Restoration Account of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund. These funds may be used for special projects for the \"conduct of necessary investigations, administration, and the execution of this Act and for the aiding in the formulation, adoption, or administration of any compact between two or more States for the conservation and management of migratory fishes in marine or fresh waters.\" (Section 4 of36694 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices the Act as amended by Pub. L. 98-369, 16 U.S.C. 777c) Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration (WR)-Federal Aid Administrative Funds for wildlife restoration may not exceed 8 percent of the excise tax receipts deposited in the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Fund. These funds may be used for the \"administration and execution of this Act and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act.\" (Section 4 of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 669c) After making administrative deductions as specified above, the remainder of the administrative funds will be apportioned to the States in accordance with the formulas contained in the Acts. The Service will strive to minimize administrative deductions in ofder to maximize apportionments to the States. C. Availability of Funds In fiscal year 1994, the amount of administrative funds estimated to be made available for special projects includes approximately $1,400,000 for sport fish restoration, and $1,600,000 for wildlife restoration. D. Interstate Compacts Interstate Compacts may also submit proposals for Federal Aid Administrative Funds.

Appendix B-Sample Proposal for the Use of Federal Aid Administrative Funds Submitted by Gwyllt Institute I. Title Economic Profiles, Data Analysis, and Survey Design for Sport Fishing. II. Background and Purpose In the Fall of 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) released the data tapes of the 1985 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife- Associated Recreation. In its current form the data tapes are not easy for the States to use. The Gwyllt Institute (Institute) proposes to produce State-specific reports on the retail sales, jobs, wages and salaries, years of employment, output, and tax receipts generated by sport fishing in each State. III. Scope of Work The Institute will provide each State with a specially designed software package for State-specific economic impact analysis. The differences between the results of the National Survey and State data collection efforts pertaining to the economic impact of sport fishing will be analyzed by the Institute. The results of this analysis will be used to make recommendations for the design of the 1990 Survey, as well as a standardized format for aconomic questions on State surveys.A. Description of Work/Objectives ' 1. The Grantee shall provide to each of the 50 States, Lotus 1-2-3 (or facsimile) spreadsheets that contain trade margins, location quotients, economic multipliers, and tax rates specific to each of the States. The Grantee shall provide a manual to accompany the spreadsheets that will contain detailed instructions on how to use and modify the spreadsheets to derive the economic impacts of sport fishing, hunting, and wildlife-associated recreation. 2. The Grantee shall download all data from the National Survey from the data tapes to State-specific diskettes. The fishing, hunting and wildlife- associated data shall be on separate diskettes. The diskettes must be accompanied by a software package that allows users to download the data from the diskettes to a Lotus 1-2-3 (or facsimile) spreadsheet. 3. The Grantee shall inform State Directors that workshops will be held by the Institute in each of the Regions of the Service to train State agency and Service personnel on how to use the spreadsheets to analyze the economic impact of fishing or other natural resource uses, using State data or Service data. These sessions will be held in conjunction with the Regional Federal Aid meetings or the Regional meetings of the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.

Expected Results of Benefits In 1985, 46.4 million anglers spent 976.6 million days and $28.1 billion pursuing their sport. It is anticipated that providing economic profiles for each State will allow State Commissioners of fish and gameagencies to argue effectively for the necessary dollars to manage the fishery resources from their respective State legislature. We conservatively estimate that an additional 5 percent of shared resources will be reallocated to recreational anglers. V. Resumes V1. Project Cost A.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrea C. Casson, Esq., Office of the36702 26703 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202- 205-3105. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority for the Commission's action is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in section 211.57 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 211.57). On February 18, 1992, the Commission issued its final determination in this investigation. The Commission found that there was a violation of section 337 in the unlicensed importation and sale of certain plastic encapsulated integrated circuits manufactured by a process that infringed certain claims of U.S. Letters Patent 4,043,027 (the '027 patent), owned by TI. The Commission issued a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders to five respondents, including Analog. The orders explicitly did not cover licensed products, and the limited exclusion order allowed for entry of products which the manufacturer or importer certified were covered by a license. The cease and desist orders contained quarterly reporting requirements. The Commission adopted the presiding administrative law judge's finding that Analog had obtained a limited license under the '027 patent when Analog acquired another company which had a cross-license agreement with TI. The Commission's remedial orders do not specify the dollar amount above which Analog's sales of the subject plastic encapsulated integrated circuits would exceed the scope of the license and therefore become subject to the exclusion and sales prohibition provisions of those orders. The Commission presumed that there were mechanisms in place for I'I to keep track of Analog's sales under the license agreement, and consequently for the parties to ascertain when the remedial orders become operative. On September 23, 1992, TI filed a Petition for Modification. In that petition, TI stated that there is no mechanism in place for TI and Analog to ascertain licensed sales, nd that, without a decision by the Commission as to the license ceiling and proper method for reporting licensed sales, the Commission's remedial orders cannot be implemented. TI requested that the Commission establish a license ceiling equal to the amount of sales of licensed plastic encapsulated circuits by the company acquired by Analog at the time of acquisition; impose a reporting requirement sufficient to enable TI todetermine when this ceiling, or whatever ceiling the Commission establishes, has been reached; and issue such further relief as the Commission deems just and proper. Pursuant to Commission interim rule 211.57 (19 CFR 211.57(b)). the Commission provisionally accepted TI's petition, published a notice in the Federal Register to that effect, and requested responses. The two parties, other than TI, that have an interest in the issues raised in the petition-Analog and the Commission's Office of Unfair Imports (OUII)-subsequently filed responses to the petition. Analog and OUR argued that, under the terms of the license agreement, Analog is licensed up to the dollar amount of annual sales of all licensed products by the acquired company at the time it was acquired by Analog. The Commission agreed with this interpretation of the agreement, and modified the reporting requirements of the cease and desist order issued to Analog in a manner that will enable the Commission to determine whether Analog is complying with the order in light of the Commission's interpretation of the license agreement. Accordingly, the Commission issued a modified cease and desist order that requires Analog to report information sufficient to establish whether its sales of covered plastic encapsulated integrated circuits exceed the license ceiling. To meet this goal, the modified order requires that Analog report its sales in dollars and its sales of all licensed products up to the license ceiling. Issued: July 2, 1993.

ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined to review an initial determination (ID) (Order No.16) issued on May 28, 1993, by the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) in the above-captioned investigation granting the motions of summary determination on the issue of jurisdiction filed by respondents Akashic Memories COrp. (\"Akashic\"), Micropolis Corp. (\"Micropolis\"), Hoya Electronics Corp. (\"Hoya\"), and Nashua Corp. (\"Nashua\"), and terminating the investigation with respect to those parties. The ID additicnally granted motions for partial summary determination on the issue of jurisdiction filed by respondents Seagate Technology, Inc. (\"Seagate\"), and Western Digital Corp. (\"Western Digital\"). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marc A. Bernstein, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202- 205-3087. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this investigation, which concerns allegations of section 337 violations in the importation, sale for importation, and sale after importation of sputtered carbon-coated computer disks (\"sputtered disks\") and products containing such disks, including disk drives, onMay 5, 1993. Complainant Aine alleges infringement of claims 23, 25, 26, and 29 of U.S. Letters Patent Re 32,464 (\"the '464 patent\"). Akashic filed a motion for summary determination on May 10, 1993. In its motion, Akashic represented that its activities with respect to sputtered disks are limited to manufacturing and selling such disks in the United States, and that the Commission has no jurisdiction under section 337 with respect to domestically-manufactured articles. The subsequent separate summary determination motions filed by Hoya and Nashua, which are also US. disk manufacturers, were essentially identical to Akashic's. Micropolis's summary determination motion was filed on May 14,1993. Micropolis asserted that the disks that it purchases for installation in-its disk drives are either manufactured in the United States or manufactured in Japan by a licensee of complainant Aine. Consequently, it argued that it is entitled to summary determination because its purchasing activities were either outside the jurisdiction of section 337, insofar as they concern domestically-manufactured disks, or non-infringing, insofar as they concern the disks manufactured by the licensee. The movants for partial summary determination, Seagate and Western Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices Digital, manufacture disks in the United States and disk drives overseas. They requested summary determination with respect to their U.S. disk manufacturing activities on the same basis as Akashic. They did not request summary determination with respect to the complaint's allegations that they purchase allegedly infringing foreign- manufactured sputtered disks that they incorporate into the disk drives that they manufacture in foreign countries an dimport into the United States. All of the summary determination and partial summary determinations were opposed by complainant Aine and the Commission investigative attorney (IA). In the ID, the ALJ grants each of the summary determination and partial summary determination motions. The ID further terminates the investigation with respect to Akashic, Micropolis, Hoya, and Nashua. Complainant Aine and the IA filed petitions for review of the ID. No agency comments were filed. Having reviewed the record in this investigation, including the ID, the Commission has determined to review the ID's legal conclusions that the Commission's jurisdiction under section 337 does not encompass ddmestically- manufactured articles and to reconsider the portions of the determination in Certain Erasable Programmable Read- Only Memories, Components Thereof, Products Containing Such Memories, and Processes for Making Such Memories, Inv. No. 337-TA-276, USITC Pub. 2196 (May 1989), on which the ID relied. In connection with this matter, the Commission is particularly interested in additional briefing on the following issues: 1. The proper construction of the term\"sale for importation\" used in section 337(a)(1)(B). Under what, if any, circumstances, can an export sale by a U.S. manufacturer of infringing articles be considered a \"sale for importation?\" If such an export sale can be considered a \"sale for importation,\" must it further be shown that the manufacturer has knowledge that each infringing article will subsequently be imported into the United States? Could a single export sale constitute a \"sale for importation?\" 2. Whether section 337 must or can be read to require any nexus between\"unfair activities\" such as patent infringement, on the one hand, and the acts proscribed by the statute- importation, sale within the United States after importation, and sale for importation-on the other. Assuming arguendo that section 337 cannot be read to forbid the Commission from exercising jurisdiction over infringing domestically-manufactured articles,does it also follow that it compels the Commission to exercise jurisdiction over all imports containing such articles? Is exercise of jurisdiction appropriate, for instance, if the infringing domestically-manufactured article is a component constituting a very small proportion of the total value of an imported assembled article? 3. Whether construing section 337 jurisdiction to extend to domestically- manufactured articles will have the practical effect of making the Commission a nationwide trial-level tribunal for resolution of domestically intellectual property disputes. Could the Commission assume such a role consistent with its Congressional mandate? Would assumption of such a role be proper when Congress to date has expressly created only one nationwide domestic intellectual property cout-the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, an appellate tribunal? Written Submissions The parties to the investigation are requested to file written submissions on the issues under review. The Commission additionally invites amici curiae to file submissions on these issues. Written submissions, must be filed by July 30, 1993, and reply submissions must be filed by August 9, 1993.

This study seeks to streamline access to the myriad of federally funded employment and training programs available in local communities. A literature review of major studies completed since 1988 that have attempted to describe and/or classify the status of one-stop service coordination and/or integration efforts underway in states and communities across the country involving employment, training and/or education programs will be part of the study. It will also include a telephone survey of administrators of major employment, training, education and human service programs in all states as appropriate and in selected local communities. Special emphasis will be given to identifying the types and uses of automated information systems which may have been designed to provide such services and to documenting new data applications similar to the one-stop concept. Byproducts of this survey will include (1) developing a uniform approach to defining and classifying such efforts based on common definitions, characteristics and criteria; and (2) identifying up to ten potential sites that most clearly exemplify these criteria. The survey includes items designed to solicit information on services provided, target populations, Federal, state and local programs involved, successful techniques used to achieve integration and barriers/impediments to integration.

This attached MOU is intended to formalize and define the manner in which the NRC will cooperate with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide data related to plant conditions during emergencies at commercial nuclear power plants in Massachusetts. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 25th day of June, 1993. For the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. James M. Taylor, Executive Director for Operations. Agreement Pertaining to the Emergency Response Data System Between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission L Authority The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting through Massachusetts36710 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices Emergency Management Agency, enter into this Agreement under the authority of Section 2741 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Massachusetts recognizes the Federal Government, primarily the NRC, as having the exclusive authority and responsibility to regulate the radiological and national security aspects of the construction and operation of nuclear production or utilization facilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted to States by the Clean Air Act. I1 Background A. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, authorize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to license and regulate, among other activities, the manufacture, construction, and operation of utilization facilities (nuclear power plants) in order to assure common defense and security and to protect the public health and safety. Under these statutes, the NRC is the responsible agency regulating nuclear power plant safety. B. NRC believes that its mission to protect the public health and safety can be served by a policy of cooperation with State governments and has formally adopted a policy statement on \"Cooperation with States at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants and Other Nuclear Production or Utilization Facilities\" (57 FR 6462, February 25, 1992). The policy statement provides that NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instruments of cooperation for certain programs when these programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. This agreement is intended to be consistent with, and implement the provisions of the NRC's policy statement C. NRC fulfills its statutory mandate to regulate nuclear power plant safety by, among other things, responding to emergencies at licensee's facilities and monitoring the status and adequacy of the licensee's responses to emergency situations. D. Massachusetts fulfills Its statutory mandate to provide for preparedness, response, mitigation, and recovery in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant through the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (\"MEMA\"), an agency created by Chapter 639 of the Acts of 1950, as amended. III. Scope A. This Agreement defines the way in which NRC and Massachusetts will cooperate in planning and maintaining the capability to transfer reactor plant data via the Emergency Response Date System during emergencies at nuclear power plants in and adjacent to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, specifically Pilgrim Station, Seabrook Station. and Vermont Yankee. B. It is understood by the NRC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that ERDS data will only be transmitted by a licensee during emergencies classified at the Alert level or above, during scheduled tests, or during exercises when available. C. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict or expand the statutory authorityof NRC, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or to affect or otherwise alter the terms of any agreement in effect under the authority of Section 274b of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; nor is anything in this Agreement intended to restrict or expand the authority of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on matters not within the scope of this Agreement. D. Nothing in this Agreement confers upon the Commonwealth of Massachusetts authority to (1) interpret or modify NRC regulations and NRC requirements imposed on the licensee; (2) take enforcement actions; (3) issue confirmatory letters; (4) amend, modify, or revoke a license issued by NRC; or (5) direct or recommend nuclear power plant employees to take or not to take any action. Authority for all such actions is reserved exclusively to the NRC. IV. NRC's General Responsibilities Under this agreement, NRC is responsible for maintaining the Emergency Response Data System (ERDS). ERDS is a system designed to receive, store, and retransmit data from in-plant data systems at nuclear power plants during emergencies. The NRC will provide user access to ERDS data to one user terminal for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during emergencies at nuclear power plants which have implemented an ERDS interface and for which any portion of the plant's 10 mile Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) lies within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The NRC agrees to provide unique software already available to NRC (not commercially available) that was developed under NRC contract for configuring an ERDS workstation. V. Massachusetts' General Responsibilities A. Massachusetts, acting through MEMA, will, in cooperation with the NRC, establish a capability to receive ERDS data. To this end, Massachusetts will provide the necessary computer hardware and commercially licensed software required for ERDS data transfer to users. B. Massachusetts agrees not to use ERDS to access data from nuclear power plants for which a portion of the 10 mile Emergency Planning Zone does not fall within its State boundary. C. For the purpose of minimizing the impact on plant operators, clarification of ERDS data will be pursued through the NRC and/or the utility provided technical liaison personnel. V1. Implementation Massachusetts and the NRC agree to work in concert to assure that the following communications and information exchange protocol regarding the NRC ERDS are followed. A. Massachusetts, through MEMA, and the NRC agree in good faith to make available to each other information within the intent and scope of this Agreement B. NRC and MEMA agree to meet as necessary to exchange information on matters of common concern pertinent to this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, such meetings will be held in the NRC Operations Center. The affected utilities will be keptinformed of pertinent information covered by this Agreement. C. To preclude the premature public release of sensitive information, NRC and Massachusetts will protect sensitive information to the extent permitted by the Federal Freedom of Information Act, the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66A, Fair Information Practices, and other applicable authority. D. NRC will conduct periodic tests of licensee ERDS data links. A copy of the test schedule will be provided to MEMA by the NRC. MEMA may test Its ability to access ERDS data during these scheduled tests, or may schedule independent tests of the State link with the NRC. E. NRC will provide access to ERDS for emergency exercises with reactor units capabld of transmitting exercise data to ERDS. for exercises in which the NRC is not participating, MEMA will coordinate with NRC in advance to ensure ERDS availability. NRC reserves the right to preempt ERDS use for any exercise in progress in the event of an actual event at any licensed nuclear power plant. VII. Contacts A. The principal senior management contacts for this Agreement will be the Director, Division of Operational Assessment, Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, and the Governor- appointed Director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. These individuals may designate appropriate staff representatives for the purpose of administering this Agreement. B. Identification of these contacts is not intended to restrict communication between NRC and MEMA staff members on technical and other day-to-day activities. VIII. Resolution of Disagreements A. If disagreements arise about matters within the scope of this Agreement, NRC and MEMA will work together to resolve these differences. B. Resolution of differences between MEMA and NRC staff over issues arising out of this Agreement will be the initial responsibility of the NRC Division of Operational Assessment management. C. Differences which cannot be resolved in accordance with Sections VIl.A and VMfI.B will be reviewed and resolved by the Director, Office of Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data. D. The NRC's General Counsel has the final authority to provide legal interpretation of the Commission's regulations, IX. Effective Date This Agreement will take effect after it has been signed by both parties. X. Duration A formal review, not less than I year after the effective date, will be performed by the NRC to evaluate implementation of the Agreement and resolve any problems identified. This Agreement will be subject to periodic reviews and may be amended or modified upon written agreement by both parties, and may be terminated upon 30 days written notice by either party..36711 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices XI.

In addition, Section 4 requires that the Nominating Committee notify the Secretary of the Exchange, on or before the second Monday in August, of the nominees for such offices and positions.7 Section 4 also requires that independent nominations for the office of Vice Chairman, members of the Board and members of the Nominating Committee be filed with the Secretary of the Exchange on or before the last Monday in August.8 The BSE proposes to amend Section 4 to require the Nominating Committee to hold at least one meeting in June for the purpose of electing its own Chairman.9 According to the BSE, the Nominating Committee routinely elects its Chairman in July, at the same time that it meets to suggest nominees for offices and positions to be filled at the annual election. The BSE also proposes to alter the timing for the submission of the nominees to the Secretary of the Exchange by the Nominating Committee or by independent nomination from the second Monday in August and the last Monday in August, respectively, to the second Monday in October and the last Monday in October. Finally, the BSE proposes to add Supplementary Material .10 to Article VI of the Constitution. The Supplementary Material would clarify Article VI, Section I by specifying that the terms of office would begin on January 1 of each year. In order to facilitate the proposed amendments to the Constitution regarding the change in the date of annual election, the BSE proposes to extend the terms of all Board and Nominating Committee members that are due to expire on September 30, 1993 until December 31, 1993, and the terms of all Board and Nominating Committee members that ' See Article VI. Annual Meeting-Annual Election. Meetings of Nominating Committee- Reports. Section 4 of the BSE Constitution. 0 Article VI, Section 4 provides that, on the written and signed petition of fifteen members of the Exchange. additional nominations may be made for the office of Vice Chairman, members of the Board, or members of the Nominating Committee to be elected at the annual election. *The Nominating Committee's authority to elect its own Chairman is set forth in Article VI. Annual Meeting-Annual Election. Nominating Committee, Section 2 of the BSE Constitution.are due to expire on September 30, 1994 until December 31, 1994.10 The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will provide for the review of the complete fiscal year picture which expires each September 30, as well as, provide additional time for Nominating Committee deliberations. The BSE states that the basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(3) because the proposed rule is designed to assure a fair representation of members in the selection of directors, the selection process, and the administrative affairs of the Exchange. HII. Discussion The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Sections 6(b)(1), (3) and (5) of the Act.11 Section 6(b)(1) requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(1) of the Act because the proposal is designed to enhance the governance process of the Exchange. The proposed rule change would change the date of the BSE's annual meeting and annual election from the last Monday in September to the last Monday of November. As noted above, the BSE's fiscal year expires on September 30 of each year. As a result of the proposal, BSE members will have the oportunity to review the BSE's overallfiscal year prior to the annual meeting and annual election. This, in turn, may result in increased management accountability to the membership and help to ensure that all IOThe BSE's Board is composed of its Chairman, Vice Chairman, and twenty others, ten of whom must be representatives from the securities industry and teon of whom must be representatives of the public. See Article H, Section 1, of the BSE Constitution. 1\"15 U.S.C. 78ffb)(1). (3) and (5) (1988).Exchange constituencies are adequately represented in its governance, The Commission also believes that the BSE proposal to change the date that the Vice Chairman and Board members commence their terms of office from the fiscal year to the calendar year is consistent with Section 6{b)(1) of the Act. This change is necessary to accommodate the BSE's proposal to change the date of the annual meeting and annual election. Moreover, the proposed rule change would give these elected officials the full month of December to prepare for their term of office, in contrast to the current rule which provides for a few days of transition between the annual election at the end of September and the commencement of elected officials' term of office on October 1. The Commission believes that giving the newly-elected Vice Chairman and Board members more time to prepare for their term of office will result in a more orderly transition in Exchange governance. The Commission believes that the. Exchange's proposal to require its- Nominating Committee to meet in June for the purpose of electing its own Chairman is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5) of the Act. This proposal would ensure that the Chairman of the Nominating Committee would hold office prior to the Nominating Committee deliberations, which would under the proposal, begin the next month in July. As a result, the proposal should provide the Nominating Committee with additional time at its July meeting to consider nominations for Vice Chairman, the Board, the composition of the Nominating Committee for the following year, and vacancies for unexpired terms. This should permit the Nominating Committee to focus, in its July deliberations, solely on eligible candidates for office and their qualifications. In this way, the proposal should work to ensure a fair representation of BSE members in the governance of the Exchange and protect investors and the public interest.12 Similarly, the Commission believes that the proposal to change the timing for notification to the Secretary of the Exchange of the nominees selected by the Nominating Committee or by independent nomination from the month of August to the month of October is consistent with sections 6 (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5) of the Act. Because the proposal would change the 12As noted above, the BSE's Board is composed of its Chairman, Vice Chairman and twenty others. ten of whom must be representatives of the securities industry and ten of whom must be representatives of the public.36713 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 129 I Thursday. July 8, 1993 / Notices date of the BSE's annual meeting and annual election to the last Monday in November. it is reasonable for the BSE to adjust the time period for submitting nominees to the Secretary of the Exchange to October. The extension of the time period should help to ensure the fair representation of BSE members in the governahce of the Exchange and protect investors and the public interest by giving the Nominating Committee, and members by independent nomination, a total of three months rather than the one month under current rules, to consider and nominate qualified candidates for Exchange offices and positions. The Commission believes the Exchange's addition of the Supplementary Material to Article VI of the BSE Constitution, which would clarify the commencement of terms of offices and positions of the Exchange and extend the existing terms of offices of the current Board and Nominating Committee members for three months, in 1993 and 1994, is necessary to effectuate the BSE's amendments to Article VI. The extension in terms of office is reasonable, and is a relatively minor and necessary change to effectuate the BSE's proposal to use calendar, rather than fiscal, years as the term of office. The Commission finds good cause for approving proposed Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 2 made a non-substantive change to the proposal by deleting language which would have allowed the Board to change the date or location of the BSE's annual meeting and annual election from time to time. The BSE's proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. I, relating to the annual meeting and annual election, was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received.13 Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 2. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street. NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission. and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the 11 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32197 (April 23.1993). 58 FR 26011 (April 29. 1993).Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld ftom the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section. 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington.

Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,2' that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-93-9) is approved.

June 29, 1993.. I. Introduction On February 12. 1993. the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (\"BSE\" or \"Exchange\") submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC\" or \"Commission\"), pursuant to sections 19(b)() and (d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Act\")' and Rules 19b-4 and 19d-1(c)(2) thereunder,2 a proposed rule change to establish a Smoking Policy to regulate where on the Exchange premises smoking may occur and to amend its Minor Rule Violation Plan (\"Plan\") 3 to provide for the 14 15 U.S.C. 786(b)(2) (1988). Is BSE's Plan for enforcing and reporting minor disciplinary rula violations was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438-4 (April 24. 1989) (File No. SR-BSE-88-2).imposition of summary fines for violation of the Smoking Policy.4 The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32104 (April 5. 1993), 58 FR 18433 (April 9. 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Background In 1984, the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19d-1 to allow self-regulatory organizations (\"SROs\") to submit, for Commission approval, plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations.5 Subsequently, the Commission approved a BSE proposal for a minor rule violation disciplinary system and for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations pursuant to Rule 19d- 1(c) under the Act.6 Accordingly, the BSE is relieved of the current reporting requirements of Section 19(d)(1) with respect to disciplinary action taken pursuant to the Exchange's Minor Rule Violation Plan (\"Plan\").7 The BSE's Plan, as embodied in Chapter XVIII, Section 4 of the BSE's Rules of the Board of Governors, provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2500, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or non-registered employee of a -member or member organization for a minor violation of certain specified Exchange rules.8 Alternatively. the Plan permits 4The BSE has requested approval under Rule 19d-1(c)(2), 17 CFR 240.19d-1(c)(2), to amend its Rule 19d-1 minor rule violation enforcement and reporting plan to include violations of its Smoking Policy. See letter from Karen A. Aluise, Staff Attorney. BSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson. Branch Chief, Commission, dated February 8, 1993. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1904). 49 FR 23838 (June a, 194). See hoc note 7 for a discussion of periodic reporting under a minor rule plan. ' See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438-1 (April 24, 1989) (File No. SR-BSE-88-2). 7 Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 19d-1. an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any \"final\" disciplinary action taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (cX2) of Rule 19d-1, any disciplinary action taken by the SRO for violation of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the plan shall not be considered \"final\" for purposes of Section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2500 and the sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies, By deeming unadjudicatad minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic (quarterly), as opposed to immediate. basis. s The \"List of'Exchange Rules and Fines Applicable thereto Purstnt to Section 4 of Chapter XVII\" (\"List\") is contained in Chapter XVII, Section 4 of the BSE's Rules of the Board of Governors.36714 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday,'July 8, 1993 / Notices any person to contest the Exchange's imposition of the fine through submission of a written answer, at which time the matter will become a disciplinary proceeding subject to Chapter XXX of the BSE's Rules of the Board of Governors and, where applicable, the reporting provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of Commission Rule 19d-1. Furthermore, the Exchange retains the option of bringing violations of rules included under Chapter XVIII, Section 4 to full disciplinary proceedings. In the Exchange's original proposal to adopt Chapter XVIII, Section 4, the BSE indicated that it periodically would amend the List of rules subject to the Plan. The Commission subsequently approved amendments to the List, adding BSE rules and policies that are appropriate for summary disciplinary proceedings.9 HI. The Proposal The BSE proposes to adopt a Smoking Policy and to amend its Plan to provide for the imposition of summary fines for violation of that policy. Specifically, the proposal would prohibit smoking in all areas of the Exchange that are not designated by the BSE's Market Performance Committee as a smoking area. The proposed policy would designate the BSE's current smoking areas as the large trading floor lounge, the hallways outside the restrooms and in private offices where the occupant permits smoking. Smoking also would be permitted in conference rooms where a meeting of greater than one hour's duration is in session, unless one of the meeting attendees objects. The policy would specify that the Exchange may redesignate areas as smoking or non- smoking as deemed necessary and appropriate by the authorized Exchange committees 10 and the Market Performance Committee, and with due notice to the members and staff.\" The 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29586 (August 20, 1991). 56 FR 42094 (August 26, 1991) ,(File No. SR-BSE-91-2). and 32155 (April 15, 1993), 58 FR 21492 (April 21, 1992) (File No. SR- BSE-92-3). 1\u00b0For example, in its rule filing, the Exchange states that the Floor Facilities Committee would review changes in designated smoking areas for trading floor areas and that the Rules Revision Committee would review changes in designated smoking areas for all other Exchange areas. Any changes in smoking areas would have to be ratified by the Market Performance Committee. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32104 (April 5. 1993). 58 FR 18433 (April 9, 1993) (File No. SR- BSE-93-03). I The BSE states that, in the event that the Exchange determines to redesignate an Exchange area as smoking or non-smoking, the BSE will provide at least 30 days notice to members and staff. The 30 day period would begin once the appropriate committees have reviewed andExchange states that the policy is a response to concerns regarding the effects of smoking on non-smokers in the work environment, and aims to balance these concerns while providing an area or areas for smokers. The Exchange also proposes to add the Smoking Policy to its Plan and to include a fine schedule for violations of the policy. The BSE proposes a fine of $100 for an initial offense, and a fine of $250 for subsequent violations of the Smoking Policy. The Exchange believes that this would provide a deterrent to smoking in the restricted areas, as well as enable the Exchange to enforce the_ policy with the least amount of disruption. The BSE states that the proposed Smoking Policy is consistent with the objectives of section 6(b)(1) of the Act, in that the policy is an administrative action by the Exchange to require its members to comply with its rules and policies, and will ensure the orderly conduct of business on the floor and in the administrative areas without interfering with the personal comfort and safety of the members and staff. The Exchange believes that the addition of the policy to the Plan will advance the objectives of section 6(b)(6) of the Act, in that its members and persons associated with its members will be appropriately disciplined for violations of rules and policies where the Exchange has determined that such violations are minor in nature. The Exchange also believes that the proposal is consistent with Sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1), in that the Plan provides for a fair disciplinary procedure for the imposition of sanctions. IV. Commission Findings The Commission finds that the BSE proposal to adopt the Smoking Policy is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of sections 6(b) (1) and (6) of the Act.12 The Commission believes that the proposal is a reasonable means by which the Exchange may ensure the orderly conduct of business on its floor and in its administrative areas. Because the proposal defines the scope of the prohibited conduct, provides notice to members and staff, and is tailored to serve a legitimate Exchange regulatory interest, the proposal establishes a fair approved the changes and notice has been published to all members, members' staff, and Exchange staff. See letter from Karen A. Aluise, Staff Attorney, BSE, to Diana Luka-Hopson, Branch Chief, Commission, dated April 15, 1993. 1215 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1) and (6).anid reasonable policy for the regulation of smoking on the BSE. The proposed policy should help to ensure a trading floor environment free of conduct that could interfere with trading activity. As a result, the proposal should enhance the members' ability to engage in transactions in securities and, thereby, protect investors and the public interest. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission also finds that the BSE proposal to amend its Plan is consistent with the Act. In adopting Rule 19d-1, the Commission noted that the Rule was an attempt to balance the informational needs of the Commission against the reporting burdens of the SROs.13 In promulgating paragraph (c) of the Rule, the Commission was attempting further to reduce those reporting burdens by permitting, where immediate reporting was unnecessary, quarterly reporting of minor rule violations. The Rule is intended to be limited to rules which relate to areas that can be adjudicated quickly and objectively. The Commission believes that the BSE's Smoking Policy meets this criterion and should be added to the List. In particular, the Commission believes that the BSE proposal regarding violation of the Smoking Policy is easily determined and amenable to quick, objective determinations of compliance. Efficient and equitable enforcement of the Policy should not entail the complicated factual and interpretive inquiries associated with more sophisticated exchange disciplinary actions. The Commission finds that the BSE proposal to add violations of the Smoking Policy to the Plan is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections 6(b) (1), (6) and (7), 6(d)(1) and 19(d).14 The proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violations of rules of the exchange. In this regard, the proposal will provide an efficient procedure for appropriate disciplining of members in those instances when a rule or policy violation is either technical and objective or minor in nature. Moreover, because the Plan provides procedural rights to the person fined and permits a disciplined person to request a full 13 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13726 (July 8. 1977), 42 FR 36411 (July 14, 1977). U.S.C. 78f(b)(1). (6) and (7), 78f(d)(1) and 78s(d) (1988).36715 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices hearing on the matter, the proposal provides a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members which is consistent with with the requirements of sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act. The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternate means by which to deter violations of the BSE Smoking Policy, thus furthering the purposes of section 6(b)(1) of the Act. An exchange's ability to enforce effectively compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. Inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan should not be interpreted to mean it is an unimportant rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation plan not only reduce reporting burdens of an SRO but also may make its disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting violations of these rules. In addition, because the BSE retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violations included on the List, such as for egregious or repeat violations, the Commission believes that adding the BSE Smoking Policy to the List will enhance, rather than reduce, the BSE's enforcement capabilities regarding this policy. Finally, the Commission believes that the inclusion of the BSEs Smoking Policy on the List will prove to be an effective alternate response to a violation when the initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding may be more costly and time-consuming in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act and Rule 19d-1(c)(2) under the Act,15 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-93--03) is approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation. pursuant to delegated authority.1a Margaret IL McFarland, Deputy Secretary.

Amendment No. 3 requested approval of the BSE's capital portion of the proposed rule change for a six month temporary basis, during which time the BSE will submit a proposed rule change to provide for an Early Warning Notification program when capital excess reaches 120% of required minimum capital.The proposed rule change, together with Amendment No. 1, was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32333 (May 19, 1993), 58 FR 30079 (May 25, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The BSE proposes to amend (1) Chapter XXII, Section 2 of the BSE Rules of the Board of Governors, concerning specialist net capital and equity requirements, and (2) the List of Exchange Rule and Policy Violations and Fines Applicable Thereto Pursuant to section 4 of chapter XVI. Chapter XXII, Section 2(c) of the BSE Rules of the Board of Governors currently provides, among other matters, that a member or member organization doing business on the floor of the Exchange, registered to do business as a specialist, who business may include floor brokerage for other professionals and who does not carry any customer accounts, shall at all times maintain a minimum net capital, as defined by Securities Exchange Act Rule 51c3-1,7 equal to the greater of either $35,000 or the value of 200 shares of each security marked-to-market, in which that specialist is the dealer at not less than the minimum margin of 25% of market value. In addition, section 2(c)(2) currently provides that specialists who do not have any public customers and who do not have an active trading account, shall be haircut6 10% on both long and short security positions prior to the required net capital computation. The BSE proposes to amend section 2(c) to increase the specialist net capital requirement from $35,000 to $100,000. The BSE also proposes to amend section 2(c)(2) to increase the haircut for net capital purposes to 15% on both long and short security positions.0 Chapter XXII, section 2(f) specifies minimum equity requirements for specialists conducting business on the Exchange floor.10 The BSE equity requirements currently require each specialist to maintain a liquidating equity in its account of not less than '17 CYR 250.15c3-1 (1992). 6A \"haircut\" is a reduction when computing net capital.9The BSE has requested approval of the capital provisions of its rule filing on a six month temporary basis. The BSE has indicated that. during the next six months, it would submit a proposed rule change to provide for an Early Warning Notification program when capital excess reaches 120% of required minimum capital. See supra note 6.0The term \"equity\". as used in the BSE proposal, means the excess of cash. readily marketable securities and amount due from registered clearing organizations over all liabilities.36716 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices $125,000 in cash or securities. Section 2(0(it) provides that if any any time a specialist's equity drops below $125,000, such specialist will be given an Early Warning Alert notice.\" Pursuant to section 2[f)(iii), if a specialist's equity drops below $110,000, such specialist is required to notify the Exchange as to the steps that are being taken to supply additional equity and is given five consecutive business days to increase its equity to $125,000. Pursuant to section 2(f)(iv), if a specialist is unable to increase the equity to $125,000 within five business days, or if at any time the specialist's equity drops below $100,000, all of the specialist's stocks will be assigned to another specialist for not more than 20 business days. Unless the equity is increased to $125,000 within the 20 business days, the stocks are subject to allocation to other specialists.12 The BSE proposes to amend section 2(f) to require specialists to maintain their equity funds with the Boston Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation (\"BSECC\") and to increase its specialist equity requirements in two phases. The first phase, beginning on July 1, 1993, would require each specialist to maintain liquidating equity for each specialist account of not less than $160,000 in cash or securities. The second phase, beginning on January 1, 1994, would require liquidating equity of $200,000. The BSE also proposes to amend its Early Warning Alert provisions for equity. The BSE proposal would limit to 60 business days the period during which a specialist may operate continuously under the Early Warning Alert Status, except in situations where the specialist is actively seeking additional financing and has requested additional time in writing from the BSE's General Counsel or, in his or her absence, a senior officer of the Exchange who will present such request for exception to the Market Performance Committee or in special circumstances, to the Executive Committee. The 11 This notice alerts the specialist of its equity position and its proximity to the maintenance requiremnt and contains a statement as to action that will be takm by the BSE if the maintenance requirement is violated. 12The BSE adopted its current minimum equity requirements in two phases, the first phase took effect on December 31, 1987 and the second phase took effect on June 30, 1988. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25044 (October 20, 1987). 52 FR 40009 (October 26, 1987) (order approving File No. SR-BSE-87-2). Section 2(f)(iv) permitted the BSE's Market Performance Committee to consider mitigating circumstances and/or market conditions in providing temporary relief or to ascertain altern tives that may be applied where a specialist was unable to maintain the requirements on December 31. 1987 and June 30. 1988.proposal would increase the Early Warning Alert thresholds in two phases. During the first phase, beginning July 1, 1993, the BSE proposal would provide that if at any time a specialist's equity drops below $160,000 (but above $140,000) such specialist would be given an Early Warning Alert notice by the Exchange alerting the specialist of its equity position and its proximity to the maintenance requirement, with a statement as to the action that will be taken if the maintenance requirement is violated. If a specialist's equity drops below $140,000, such specialist would be required to notify the Exchange as to the steps that are being taken to supply additional equity and the specialist will be given five business days to increase its equity to the minimum requirement of $160,000. If a specialist is unable to increase its equity to $160,000 within five business days, or if at any time the specialist's equity drops below $130,000, all of such specialist's stocks will be assigned to another specialist, under a caretaker arrangement for not more than 20 business days. Unless the liquidating equity is increased to $160,000 within the 20 business days, the stocks will be subject to allocation to other specialists. The BSE proposes to amend its Early Warning Alert requirements beginning on January 1. 1994 to coincide with the ihcrease in required liquidating equity to $200,000. During this second phase, the BSE rule would require that if at any time a specialist's equity drops below $200,000 (but above $175,000), the specialist will be given an Early Warning Alert notice. If the specialist's equity drops below $175,000, the specialist will be required to notify the Exchange as to the steps that are being taken to supply additional equity and the specialist will be given five business days to increase its equity to the minimum requirement of $200,000. If a specialist is unable to increase its equity to $200,000 within five business days. or if at any time the specialist's equity drops below $160,000, all of the specialist's stocks will be assigned to another specialist, under a caretaker arrangement for not more than twenty business days. Unless the liquidating equity is increased to $200,000 within twenty business days, the stocks will be subject to allocation to other specialists.3 13The BS9 proposal would permit its Market Performance Committee to consider mitigating circumstances and/or market conditions in providing temporary relief or to ascertain alternatives that inay be applied when a specialist is unable to maintain the increased requirements on July 1. 1993 or January 1. 1994.The BSE also proposes to amend section 2(g) to increase its additional equity requirements applicable to alternate specialist and/or trading accounts. Currently, each approved trading account or alternate specialist account is required to maintain at all times a liquidating equity in its account of not less than $25,000 above the current minimum equity requirement in cash or securities.14 The proposal would increase the additional equity requirement for alternate and/or trading accounts from $25,000-to $50,000 per specialist. The BSE proposes to adopt section 2(m) to provide that, in the event that a specialist drops below the additional equity requirement to carry an alternate and/or trading account, the specialist shall be notified in writing by the Exchange that the account is inactive. A specialist also would be able to request, in writing, inactive status on an alternate or trading account for any reason and without so stating. In either event, where an account has been inactivated, in order to reactivate the account, the specialist would 'have to make a written request to the Exchange and be approved by three floor members of the Market Performance Committee for interim approval subject to ratification by the full committee. Finally, the BSE proposes to amend its List of rules subject to its Plan. The proposed amendment would add Section 2(m), Trading in an Inactive Alternate and/or Trading Account, to the List. The proposal would inpose a $500 fine for an initial offense and a $1,000 fine for subsequent offenses of this proposed rule. The Exchange states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to revise the capital and equity requirements of the Exchange in anticipation of proposed amendments to Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1.15 The Exchange also believes that the addition of Trading in an Inactive Alternate and/ or Trading Account (Section 2(m)) to the List will enable the Exchange to enforce its equity requirements in a more efficient and effective manner. 1\" The additional equity requirement does not affect the BSE's early warning alert ranges. If the equity drops below this additional requirement. activity in the accounts must cease immediately until the additional equity requirement is met or the accounts are closed. \"3 17 CFR 240.15c3-1 (1992). In 1988. the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 15c3- t. The proposed amendments were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26402 (December 28, 1988). 54 FR 315 (January 5, 1989). As of July 1. 1993. the proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1 have not been adopted by the Commission.36717 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices The BSE states that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in that the capital and equity requirements of the Exchange are designed to protect investors and the public interest by ensuring that Exchange members doing business on the floor have adequate funds to cover losses that they might incur in the everyday transaction of business. The BSE states that the addition of section 2(m) to the List will advance the objectives of section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that its members and persons associated with its members will be appropriately disciplined for the violation of rules and policies where the Exchange has determined that such violation is minor in nature and is consistent with sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act because the Minor Rule Violation Plan provides a fair procedure for the imposition of sanctions. III. Discussion The BSE, through these amendments to its net capital and equity rules, is seeking to increase the financial responsibility of its specialists by: (1) Increasing minimum net capital requirements and increasing the haircuts in the net capital computation; (2) raising minimum equity requirements for specialists in two phases; (3) limiting to 60 business days, the period during which a specialist may operate under Early Warning Alert Status and revising the Early Warning Alert provisions; (4) increasing the additional equity requirement for alternate specialist and/or trading accounts; (5) requiring that equity funds be maintained with the BSECC; and (6) establishing inactive status for alternate specialist and trading accounts that fall below the additional equity requirements for such accounts. The Commission finds that the BSE's proposed amendments to its net capital and equity requirements for specialists are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements of sections 6(b)(5) and 11(b) of the Act.16 The Commission believes that the BSE's proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirement that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and, in general, to protect investors and the geublic interest. The Commission also lieves that the proposal is consistent with section 11(b) of the Act, and Rule 11b-1 thereunder,17 which allow 1 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) 17 1CFR 240.11b-1 (1992).securities exchanges to promulgate rules relating to specialists in order to maintain fair and orderly markets. The proposal is consistent with the rule lb-1(a)(2)(i) requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange which permit a member to register as a specialist and to act as a dealer include, among other things, adequate minimum capital requirements in view of the markets for securities on such exchange. The rules of the BSE, in addition to the rules set forth under the Act, impose certain obligations upon specialists, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.18 Specialists play a crucial role in providing stability, liquidity, and continuity to the trading of stocks on the Exchange. Generally, specialists are under an affirmative obligation to trade for their own accounts to minimize order imbalances and contribute to continuity and depth in their specialty stocks. 9 Conversely, pursuant to their negative obligations, specialists are precluded from trading for their own accounts unless such dealing is necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. To ensure that specialists fulfill these obligations, it is important that they maintain an adequate amount of capital and equity. The importance of specialists' net capital and equity as it relates to the quality of Exchange markets was highlighted during the October 1987 Market Break. In the Division of Market Regulation's (\"Division\") report on the 1987 Market Break, the Division reviewed, among other things, specialists' ability to maintain fair and orderly markets and minimum capital requirements imposed by the changes. In this respect, the Division stated its concern that the minimum capital requirements imposed by the exchanges on specialists did not reflect the actual capital needed to ensure the maintenance of fair and orderly markets in different types of securities.20 Accordingly, Division staff recommended a number of changes to the exchanges' capital rules. The Division believes that the BSE proposal is a positive step toward procuring stronger capital foundations for specialists on its floor. Specifically, the Commission believes that the BSE's 28 See generally Chapter XV of the BSE Rules of the Board of Governors. See also Rule Ilb-1 under the Act. 19See supra note 18.20 See Division of Market Regulation. The October 1987 Market Break. February 1988. at 4-66 to 4-67. See also Market Analysis of October 13 and 16, 1989. A Report by the Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, December 1990, at 4, 18 and 33.proposal to increase specialist net capital requirements to $100,000 and to increase specialist equity requirements to $160,000 and $200,000, in two phases, should help to ensure that BSE specialists have greater access to the capital necessary for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets in their registered securities. By assuring that specialists have capital sufficient to perform their market making responsibilities, the proposal should provide additional protection for the exchange, member organizations, and public investors. The Commission also believes that amending section 2(f) to require specialists to maintain their equity funds with the BSECC should ensure that the Exchange has immediate access to specialist equity funds. Furthermore, the Commission believes that this requirement is reasonable and will not be overly burdensome on BSE specialists.21 The Commission believes that the BSE's proposed revisions to its Early Warning Alert provisions and limitation to 60 business days for operating continuously under the Early Warning Alert Status should help to ensure compliance with the BSE's equity requirements by encouraging specialists to actively obtain additional financing in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, specialists unable to increase to the appropriate levels, during each respective phase of the proposal, an equity position that has fallen below $140,000 or $175,000 respectively, within five days, would under BSE rules, have their stocks reassigned for 20 days. Unless the minimum equity is met within those 20 days, the stocks would be subject to permanent reallocation to another specialist. Together, these requirements ensure that specialists will not be allowed to make markets in stocks indefinitely if they fall below the equity requirements. The Commission also believes that the BSE proposal to increase its specialist equity requirements in two phases (July 1, 1993 and January 1, 1994) should provide those specialist units not already meeting the requirements of the proposed rule change with an adequate and reasonable amount of time to come into compliance and that conformity with these standards will not be unduly burdensome on BSE specialist units. In this regard, the BSE stated that the vast majority of its specialist units are 21 According to the Exchange. as of June 29, 1993, all BSE specialists maintain their equity funds with the BSECC. Telephone conversation between Karen A. Aluse, Assistant Vice President, BSE, and Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, Commission, on June 29, 1993.36718 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices already in compliance with the requirements of the proposed rule.22 The Commission believes that the BSE proposal to increase the additional equity requirement for alternate specialist and/or trading accounts is designed to improve the financial integrity and liquidity of the BSE market place. Similarly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to establish an inactive status for alternate specialist and/or trading accounts that fall below the additional equity requirements for such accounts. This proposal should help to ensure compliance with the additional equity requirements and, as a result, should provide additional protection for the Exchange, member organizations, and public investors. The Commission also finds that the Exchange's proposal to add Trading in an Inactive Alternate and/or Trading Account (section 2(m)) to the Plan is consistent with sections 6(b)(1), (6) and (7), 6(d)(1) and 19(d).23 The proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violations of rules of.the exchange. In this regard, the proposal will provide an efficient procedure for appropriate disciplining of members in those instances when a rule violation is either technical and objective or minor in nature. Moreover, because the Plan provides procedural rights to the person fined and permits a disciplined person to request a full hearing on the matter, the proposal provides a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated with members which is consistent with sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of the Act. In 1984, the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of the Securities Exchange Act Rule 19d-1 to allow self-regulatory organizations (\"SROs\") to submit, for Commission approval, plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations.24 Subsequently, the Commission approved a BSE proposal for a minor rule violation disciplinary system and for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations pursuant to Rule 19d- 22According to the Exchange, as of June 23, 1993. all BSE specialists were aware of the proposed amendments and only one specialist was below the equity standards in the proposed rule. Telephone conversation between George W. Mann, Jr.. Senior Vice President and General Counsel, BSE, and Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney. Commission, on June 23. 1993. -315 U.S.C. 78ftb)(1). (6) and (7). 78f(d)(i) and 78s(d) (1988). 24See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984),49 FR 23838 (June 8, 1984).I(c) under the Act.23 Accordingly, the BSE is relieved of the current reporting requirements of section 19(d)(1) with respect to disciplinary action taken pursuant to the Exchange's Plan.2a In adopting Rule 19d-1, the Commission noted that the Rule was an attempt to balance the informational needs of the Commission against the reporting burdens of the SROs.27 In promulgating paragraph (c) of the Rule, the Commission was attempting further to reduce those reporting burdens by permitting, where immediate reporting was unnecessary, quarterly reporting of minor rule violations. The Rule is intended to be limited to rules which can be adjudicated quickly and objectively. The Commission believes that the rule violation that the BSE proposes to include in its Plan meets this criteria and should be added to the List. In particular, the Commission believes that the violation of Trading in an Inactive Alternate and/or Trading Account is easily determined and amenable to quick, objective determinations of compliance. Efficient and equitable enforcement of this violation should not entail the complicated factual and interpretative inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary actions. The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternative means by which to deter violations of Section 2(m), thus furthering the purposes of the Act. An exchange's ability to enforce effectively compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission and exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. Inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan should not be interpreted to mean that it is an unimportant rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation lan not only may reduce reporting burdens 28 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989). 54 FR 16438-I (April 24, 1989) (File No. SR-BSF-86-2). Z Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 19d-i. an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any \"final\" disciplinary action taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 19d-i. any disciplinary action taken by the SRO for violation of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the Plan shall not be considered \"final\" for purposes of section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies. By deeming unadjudicated minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic (quarterly), as opposed to immediate, basis. 27 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 13726 (July 8, 1977), 42 FR 36411 (July 14, 1977).of an SRO but also may make its disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting violations of these rules. In addition, because the BSE retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violations included on the List, such as for egregious or repeat violations, the Commission believes that adding section 2(m) will enhance, rather than reduce, the BSE's enforcement capabilities regarding this Rule. Finally, the Commission believes that the inclusion of Section 2(m) on the List will prove to be an effective alternate response to a violation when the initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding may be more costly and time-consuming in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. The Commission finds good cause for accelerated approval of Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of notice of filing thereof. The BSE's proposed rule change to increase its specialist net capital and equity requirements was published in the Federal Register for the full statutory period and no comments were received.28 Amendment No. 2 is a single modification to the proposal to reinstate section 2(i) to Chapter XXII of the BSE Rules of the Board of Governors, which the BSE previously proposed to delete from its Rules. Amendment No. 3 merely amends the portion of the BSE's proposal that increases specialist capital requirements to request approval on a six month temporary basis. The Commission finds that accelerated approval of Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 is necessary in order for the BSE to be able to effectuate its new net capital and equity requirements in a timely manner upon approval. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 2 and 3.

[FR 8:45 SR-CBOE- 93-20] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Firm Quotations and Retail Automatic Execution System June 30, 1993. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (\"CBOE\"), on April 21, 1993, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") the proposed rule change as described in Items I, H, and M below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 6.8, 8.51, and 24.15 to define and specify the circumstances in which an order is to be deemed a \"public customer order\" for purposes of determining whether the order will be afforded the benefits provided by the Exchange's firm quote rule and its rules 215 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) Retail Automatic Execution System (\"RAES\"). The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change CBOE Rule 8.51 generally requires the trading crowd at a post to sell (buy) at least 10 contracts at the offer (bid) which is displayed when a buy (sell) order reaches that trading station. The CBOE earlier submitted a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 8.51 to require members of the trading crowd in receipt of customer orders for more than 10 contracts either to satisfy the orders at the disseminated quote or to update the market quote.1 The CBOE states that the purpose of that proposal Is to limit the incidence of actual or apparent trade- throughs, thereby facilitating orderly trading in multiple listed options. The CBOE is concerned, however, that developments in the marketplace, including, but not limited to, the multiple trading of equity options, have made it more difficult for market-makers to honor their firm quotation obligations. The Exchange states that CBOE Rule 8.51 (the \"Firm Quote Rule\"), like the Exchange's RAES systems, is intended to provide certain protections to public customers in connection with the execution of small (ten lots or less) orders. The Exchange believes that market-makers must have sufficient time to adjust their quotes to reflect changes in the markets in the underlying securities, other options and markets, and other options series if they are to be expected to participate in RAES and to meet the requirements of the Firm Quote Rule. I See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32406 (June 3, 1993).In view of these considerations, the CBOE currently proposes to amend its Firm Quote Rule and RAES rules to define a \"public customer order\" and thereby better identify the persons whose orders are intended to be served by the provisions of those rules. Specifically, the CBOE is proposing to amend Rule 6.8(h) to define \"public customer order\" to specify that this term does not include any order that is for a\"professional trading account.\" The proposed amendment defines a professional trading account as either (1) an account of a registered broker- dealer pursuant to the Act, (2) an account of a person engaged in business or employed as a professional trader in securities, (3) an account of a person whose orders are computer-generated and automatically transmitted to the Exchange, (4) an account of a person who has been determined by the Exchange's Market Performance Committee (\"MPC\") to have engaged in a pattern of trading that has the effect of abusing the purposes of the Exchange's RAES systems,2 or an account with respect to which any of the foregoing persons exercises investment discretion. The proposal provides, however, that an account of an individual who is a registered representative or other employee of a broker-dealer but who is not referred to in clauses (1) through (4) would not be deemed to be a\"professional trading account.\" The CBOE also proposes to add a new Interpretation and Policy .01 to Exchange Rule 6.8 which provides that in evaluating whether a person has engaged in a pattern of trading that has the effect of abusing the Exchange's RAES systems, the MPC would deem concentrated or aggressive use of those systems by persons seeking to profit from the inability of market-makers to alter their posted quotes instantaneously to be such an abuse. Similarly, the new Interpretation and Policy further provides that since the RAES systems are designed for small orders, persons who place a number of small orders within a relatively short period of time would be deemed to have abused those systems. The proposal states, however, that these criteria are not exclusive, and the MPC would be authorized (subject to review pursuant to Chapter XIX of the CBOE Rules) to determine that other patterns of trading are an abuse of RAES after considering such factors as the frequency of transactions in an account; whether the account has direct access to electronic order entry, delivery, and 2 A decision of the MPC that an account is a\"professional trading account\" would be subject to review pursuant to Chapter XIX of the CBOE Rules.36720 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices execution systems of the Exchange; and whether participants in the account have access to non-public market information. The current proposal also amends Exchange Rules 8.51 and 24.15 to incorporate the definition of \"public customer order\" from Rule 6.8(h) in those rules. In addition, the CBOE proposes to modify its policies with respect to RAES operations in OEX options similarly to reflect this definition of \"public customer order.\" Additionally, the CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 8.51 to establish procedures that will assist it in conducting surveillance for violations of that Rule. Specifically, the proposal provides that only those public customer orders that are present in the trading crowd and which are clearly marked with the proper account origin code will be accorded preferential treatment under Rule 8.51.3 The proposal further provides that it is the responsibility of the member or associated person entering a public customer order to identify accurately the order's account origin on the order ticket prior to execution of the order. Moreover, the proposal requires that members seeking such preferential treatment for an order to confirm, at the request of any member of the trading crowd or at the request of the Exchange, that the order has in fact been submitted by a public customer. Finally, the proposal provides that persons violating Rule 8.51 may be subject to a fine pursuant to Exchange Rule 17.50, which is the CBOE's plan for minor rule violations.4 In addition, if a member or associated person fails to furnish the Exchange, upon request, with adequate verification of the account origin of an order for the customer-omnibus account of a non- member broker-dealer, all orders entered or executed on behalf of the account will be classified as a non- public customer order, and will not be entitled to the benefits of Rule 8.51, until the Exchange receives verification of the account origin. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change Is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that clarifying the applicability of the CBOE's Finn Quote Rule and RAES rules will facilitate transactions in securities, remove impediments to and 3The Exchange represents that it will distribute to the membership a circular describing the appropriate account origin code for public customer orders upon approval of this proposed rule change. ' The Exchange represents that it will file an amendment to Rule 17.50 to establish a schedule of fines for violations of Rule 8.51.perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and promote just and equitable principles of trade. Specifically, the CBOEbelieves that the proposed rule change represents an appropriate balancing of the objectives that are designed to be served by the Firm Quote Rule and are consistent with the policies that have been articulated by the Commission in its evaluation of similar issues in the context of the National Association of Securities Dealers' Small Order Execution System (\"SOES\"). The Exchange further believes that the current proposal is consistent with the requirements of, and the policies underlying, Commission Rule 11Ac-1. In support of this proposition, the Exchange cites the Commission's order approving the rules relating to SOES, in which the Commission noted that the policies underlying the Firm Quote Rule can be \"eviscerated\" by an automatic execution requirement if market-makers are not afforded some relief with respect to orders originating with \"professional traders.\" 3 In that order the Commission stated: The requirement that quotations be \"firm\" is an essential component of the- enhancement of market efficiency offered by quoted dissemination * * * Equally important Is the accuracy of the information disseminated. Toward this end, the Firm Quote Rule recognizes the legitimate purpose of allowing market makers \"sufficient time to update their quotations.\" The introduction of an automatic execution facility upsets this balance [between the need for time quotations and the need of market makers to have time to update their quotes. Automatic and instantaneous execution of trades deprives market makers of the legitimate and reasonable update period that the Firm Quote Rule is designed to permit.e Finally, the CBOE previously submitted to the Commission a proposed rule change (File No. SR- CBOE-92-03) that the Exchange believes addresses substantially the same subject matter as the current proposal. Since the provisions of that proposed rule change would effectively be superseded by the current proposal, the Exchange has determined to withdraw File No. SR-CBOE-92-03. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance 5 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32092 (April 1. 1993), 58 FR 18279, 18279 (April 8, 1993). 658 FR at 18280 quoting Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14415, 43 FR 4342, 4344 (February 1 1978).of the purposes of the Act. Only\"professional trading accounts\" would be affected by the proposed rule change and the CBOE believes that any incidental burden on such accounts is justified by the more than countervailing benefits to public customers and others that would result from the adoptions of these amendments. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (a) By order approve such proposed rule change, orI (b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

Description The proposed rule change implements a data transmission link with Euroclear Systems (\"Euroclear\"), a clearance and settlement system for internationally traded securities, located in Brussels, Belgium.e This link is established pursuant to ISCC Rule 40 which provides that ISCC may establish links with foreign financial institutions and may require members to enter into such agreements as ISCC deems necessary in order to use a link. The Euroclear link will provide ISCC members with the oppoitunity to have access to Euroclear's clearance and settlement services. ISCC members will transmit instructions to ISCC through a service bureau approved by ISCC.e After editing and formatting the instructions, ISCC will re-transmit the information to Euroclear'. ISCC will not guarantee the transactions, will have no obligation to settle any transaction in the ISCC member's account, and will not 0 Eurocleer was founded in 1968 by the Brussels office of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York (\"MGT'). The rights to the system were acquired in 1972 by the company now known as Euroclear Clearance System. Public Limited Company (\"ECS-PLC\"). Such rights are currently licensed by ECS-PLC to Euroclear Clearance System Socit6 Cooperative (the \"Co-op\"l. The services, accounts, and relationships of Euroclear are performed or maintained by the Euroclear Operations Centre (\"EOC\") of the Brussels office of MGT. pursuant to an operating agreement with the Co-op. EOC is located In and manages all its business from Brussels, Belgium. and the contractual relationship between it and Euroclear participants Is governed by Belgian law. The Co-op has no contractual relationship with participants as such. Participants are offered the opportunity of becoming members of the Co-op, but are not required to do so. The Board of Directors of the Co. op determines certain policy matters under the operating agreement with MGT. Because EOC is the entity that performs or maintains the services, accounts. and relationships of Euroclear, it is the entity that is regulated with respect to the system. As a bank branch operating in Brussels, it is regulated by the Belgian Banking Commission. As part of a U.S. bank, it is also regulated by the New York Banking Department and U.S. Federal Reserve System. Finally, it is authorized as a services company by the Securities Investment Board in London. EOC is not registered under the Act in any capacity. As of Autumn of 1992.

All members who wish to access this link will be required to enter into a supplemental Member's Agreement amendment (the \"Amendment\"). The Amendment will authorize ISCC to accept data from the service bureau on behalf of the member, and will limit the liability of ISCC for the errors or omissions of the service bureau.maintain a securities or cash account at Euroclear. Each participating ISCC member must be approved as a customer by Euroclear because payment obligations for use of the services, such as settlement amounts necessary to conduct the clearance and settlement of transactions, will remain an obligation between the member and Euroclear and will be processed without ISCC intermediation. ISCC is responsible to Euroclear only for payment of the Euclid 90 data transport fees that arise from Euroclear's transmission of data to ISCC, which fees will be passed through to participating ISCC members. The link procedures provide that the service bureau will submit to ISCC on the member's behalf, in a standard format known as Universal Trade Record (\"UTR\") via the service bureau's computer, instructions concerning the member's securities account at Euroclear including, but not limited to, instructions to receive or deliver securities against payment or for no value. Each member will have a unique identifier code which will be maintained by ISCC in a master file. ISCC will validate instructions received from a service bureau on behalf of members against the master file and the number of records transmitted by each member. Confirmations of accepted data will be transmitted to the service bureau. All pending file data will be edited for completeness and alpha/numeric accuracy. Rejected data will be written to a pending file for subsequent transmission to the service bureau. If the data passes the edit, ISCC will reformat the data into Euroclear formats and transmit the data to Euroclear via the General Electric Information Services Company's (\"GEISCO\") telecommunications network or another Euroclear approved transmission vehicle.7 Euroclear will confirm receipt to ISCC via their computer system.e ISCC will retain a copy of the number of records successfully transmitted. ISCC also has represented that it will capture all information transmitted through the link.' Euroclear will process the Instructions and make status codes of transactions available directly to ISCC 7 ISCC has a dedicated phone line to GEISCO and an alternate phone line available as a back-up system. 4 If there is an error in transmission, ISCC will attempt to remedy any transmission problem and retransmit the data.

Based on a reasonable sample of link transactions, ISCC will monitor members' link activity on a monthly basis for compliance with this limitation. If ISCC determines that information regarding DTC eligible securities has been transmitted through the link, it will notify the Commission.18 1 G-30 Report at 2.

On a monthly basis, ISCC will provide the Commission with information regarding the total quantity and value of deliver or receive against payment instructions submitted for settlement, by currency, by value date or settlement date through the link.'7 H. Discussion The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act, and, therefore, is approving the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 'a of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The link with Euroclear will permit ISCC members, using standardized input format, to obtain through ISCC foreign clearing, settlement, and custody services offered by Euroclear. Currently, broker-dealers who wish to use Euroclear's settlement system must transmit instructions both to its service bureau and directly to Euroclear. The ISCC link will reduce the time and expense of such activity, by allowing the member to transmit the information once to the service bureau for transmission to Euroclear, In addition, the link should reduce input errors, because data is input only once by the member and reviewed for errors by ISCC before transmission to Euroclear. The Commission believes that ISCC's processing of the Euroclear link transactions will provide a record- keeping benefit over the current system. ISCC will preserve transaction records in accordance with United States laws and Commission regulations and standards. This should result in more complete records, providing the Commission with a source of information about transactions settling outside the United States that involve U.S. broker-dealers. The data format used by members, the UTR, will conform to current United States and international standards for transmission of data relating to the Sibille, Staff Attorney, Commission (April 29, 1993). \"7 Telephone conversation between Karen Saperstein, General Counsel, ISCC, and Christine Sibille, Staff Attorney, Commission (May 6,1993). \"8 15 U.S.C. 78q-l(b)(3)(F) (1988).execution of international securities transactions. Participating members will therefore receive the benefits of being able to process and enter their trade data in a standard international format, eliminating the need to accommodate their back office systems to the Euroclear format. In addition, because the data elements of the UTR will conform to both United States and international standards, the Commission believes the Euroclear link will provide a further step in the standardization of international clearance of trades. l. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-ISCC--93-01) be, and lereby is, approved.

To this date the Commission has not received any comment lettors. For the reasons stated herein the Commission is accelerating approval of the proposed rule change. I. Background The Securities Enforcement Remedies rind Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 !'Penny Stock Reform Act\") was tnacted on October 15, 1990,, ith the intention of curbing pervasive fraud and manipulation in the penny stock market. In order to achieve this result the Penny Stock Reform Act, among other things, mandated that the NASD establish a toll-free telephone number to receive customer inquiries concerning the disciplinary history of its members and their associated persons.4 The NASD began its 800 number service on October 1, 1991.5 Through this service the NASD reports: (1) past and present employment history of NASD members, (2) all final disciplinary actions 6 taken by federal, state, or self-regulatory organizations which relate to securities or commodities transactions and (3) all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U-4. In July of 1992 the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance requested that the Government Accounting Office (\"GAO\") conduct a review of the rules, procedures, facilities, and oversight and enforcement activities with respect to the Penny Stock Reform Act. One of the 4 The legislative history of the Penny Stock Reform Act states that Congress expecu that \"the Commission, the state regulators, and registered securities associations will consult with one another to try and develop a common approach to this issue, one which fulfills the informnatonal needs of the customers and assures the maximum level of investor protection.\" HKR. Rep. No. 617, 2d Sess. (1990) (emphasis added). 5 The NASD presently has in place ith e0 Number Service plan which was approved by the Commission in April 1992. See Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 30629 (April 23, 1992), 57 FR 18535 (April 30, 1992) (approving File No. SR-NASD-91- 39). 0 The term disciplinary action as used by the NASD includes, but is not limited to, the information provided in response to questions 7 B. C. D. E. and F on Form BD and questions 22 C, D, E. F, and G on Form U-4.areas Congress specifically asked for a review of was the NASD's toll-free number.7 In response to the Congressional request, the GAO undertook a study of the implementation of the Penny Stock Reform Act. At the completion of its study, the GAO recommended, among other things, that there be improvements in the NASD's procedures for informing investors of broker-dealers' and their associated persons' disciplinary history and arbitration award history. Specifically, the GAO recommended that the NASD be required to \"provide public investors who request information via the NASD's toll-free service with information on final arbitration awards.\" 8 Both the Commission and the NASD concurred in this recommendation.9 Thereafter, the NASD filed the proposed rule change, which is being approved today, as described below. H. Description The proposed rule change will permit the NASD to release certain additional information contained in the Central Registration Depository (\"CRD\"} 10 system regarding the disciplinary history of its members and their associated persons in response to telephonic inquiries from the general public via its existing toll-free telephone listing service plan. The proposed rule change will allow the NASD to release information on all: (1) Pending formal disciplinary proceedings initiated by federal or state securities agencies and 7 See letter from Edward J. Merkey, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance to Charles A. Bowsher, Comptroller General of the United States dated July 17. 1992.

Fogel, GAO, dated November 27,1992, GAO Report at 65. 10Developed jointly by the North American Securities Administrators Association (\"NASAA\") and the NASD in 1981, the CRD, which the NASD operates, is an on-line data base which contains information pertaining to broker-dealers and their associated persons. Information contained in the CRD is provided by the NASD, SEC, some exchanges, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the National Futures Association, state securities commissions, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The CRD data base -includes about 5.500 broker-dealers and 420,000 active registered persons.self-regulatory organizations,1 as well as pending and final disciplinary actions taken by, foreign governments or foreign regulatory authorities; (2) criminal indictments or informations; (3) civil judgments; and (4) arbitration decisions in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers. The NASD will disclose final arbitration decisions involving only public customers that are reported on Form U-4 that are available through the NASD's existing arbitration data base. This data base captures all member and associated person arbitration decisions issued by the NASD arbitrators after May 10, 1989. On July 1, 1993, the NASD will make available arbitration decisions disclosed on Form U-4 and only those arbitration decisions from the data base that date back to August 6, 1990. On September 1, 1993, the NASD will add arbitration decisions from the data base that date back to May 10, 1989.12 Until then the public can seek that information by calling the NASD's office of Administrative Services at (301) 590-6708. The NASD procedures call for a copy of the information requested to be sent to the person requesting it and to the subject of the request, i.e. the member firm or an associated person. Each NASD member firm receives a monthly print-out with the number of requests that have been made concerning the firm and its associated persons, as well as the names of those associated persons on whom the requests have been made. In addition, each such associated person receives a report with all the information that has been sent out by the NASD to the requestor. The name and address of the requestor is redacted from these reports and is not revealed to either the member firm or its associated person. 1H. Discussion The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(i)13 and 15A(b)(6)14 of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) provides, in pertinent part, that the rules of a nationa securities association shall be designed to promote just and equitable principles SIn addition to the information disclosed on Forms BD or U-4, all pending NASD initiated disciplinary actions whether or not disclosed on Forms BD or U-4 also will be provided through the toll-free number. 22The NASD notified its membership, through Notice to Members 93-37 (June 1993), that all arbitration decisions will not be disclosed effective July 1, 1993, but that the disclosure of information will be phased in over time. In addition, the NASD's toll-free number operators will alert callers to this fact. 13U.S.C. 78o-3(i) (1988 & Supp. 1992). 14 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b](6) (1988).36724 Federal Register / Vol. 58, N6. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices of trade. Section 15A(i) mandates that the NASD (1) establish and maintain a toll-free telephone listing to receive inquiries regarding disciplinary actions involving its members and their associated persons, and (2) promptly respond to such inquiries in writing. The Commission believes the proposed rule change furthers the goals of this section of the Act inasmuch a the increased disclosure will enhance the access of members of the public to information that will help them to determine whether or not to conduct or continue to conduct business with an NASD member or any of the member's associated persons. The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves against fraud. Adding information on pending disciplinary actions and other matters to the NASD's toll-free number is a positive step in keeping with this policy of providing information to investors. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publication of notice of filing. The Commission finds that accelerated approval will allow the NASD to provide additional information in response to customer inquiries concerning broker-dealer firms and their associated persons which is not currently available. The additional information is already in the NASD's system and as noted above, the NASD is prepared to make this information available as of July 1, 1993. Providing this information furthers the legislative intent of developing a toll-free number \"which fulfills the informational needs of the customers and assures the maximum level of investor protection.\" To delay implemen:atioun of this rule would hinder attempts by the public to get full and accurate information about brokerage firms and their associated persons. The Commission does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden'on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change, SR-NASD-93-26 be, and hereby is approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)12). Margaret -L CODE 34-32570; File No. SR-NASD- 93-17] Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., Relating to Quotation Size Requirements for Market Makers in OTC Equity Securities July 1, 1993. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988), on March 24, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (\"NASD\") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\" or \"SEC\") a proposed rule change to revise the minimum size requirement applicable to market makers utilizing the OTC Bulletin Board Service (\"OTCBB\") or any comparable inter- dealer quotation system to quote firm markets in OTC Equity Securities. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on April 7, 1993.1 The Commission received no comment letters regarding the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposed rule change. I. Description of the Proposed Rule Change Currently, if an NASD member enters and displays a firm quotation in the OTCBB for a domestic OTC Equity Security,2 the bid or offer must be firm for at least one trading unit (typically 100 shares), regardless of the price of the shares quoted. The proposed rule change will replace the standard one- trading-unit requirement with a tiered structure of minimum size requirements that is based on the price of the bid or offer.3 Each registered market maker that publishes a firm bid or offer in a domestic OTC Equity Security will be required to honor its bid or offer for individual orders up to the size I See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32077 (March 31. 1993), 58 R 18126. 2The proposed rule change states that for purposes of this rule, the term \"OTC Equity Security\" means any equity security not classified as a \"designated security\" for purposes of Parts XII or KI of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws, or as an \"eligible security,\" for purposes of Schedule G to the NASD By-Laws. The term does not include restricted securities, as defined by Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933, or any securities designated in the PORTAL Market. The new size requirement will not apply to any foreign/ADR issue in which firm quotations are not permitted to be entered into the OTCBB.3Bids or offers for 0\u20ac to .50\u20ac must be firm for 5.000 shares. Bids or offers for .51\u20ac to $1.00 must be firm for 2,500 shares. Bids or offers for $1.01 to S10.00 must be firm for 500 shares. Bids or offers for $10.01 to $100 must be firm for 200 shares. Bids or offers for $100.01 to $200.00 must be firm for 100 shares. Bids or offers for $200.01 and above must be firm for 50 shares.prescribed for the particular price range.4 These requirements will apply to members' quotes on the OTCBB and any other inter-dealer quotation system that permits quotation updates on a real- time basis. The NASD intends to put the new size requirements into effect within 90 days after the date of the Commission's approval of the proposed rule change. Once the NASD completes necessary system enhancements, the OTCBB will be capable of displaying size for quotations, and will have a default feature to ensure display of the correct minimum size if a market maker neglects to enter that size while updating its quotes.5 Nevertheless, each market maker will be responsible for determining the minimum size requirement applicable to its bid or offer, and must honor the quote for the specified size.6 The NASD stated in the notice for the proposed rule change that based on input from market makers using the OTCBB, it has determined that the 100- share minimum is no longer appropriate for the vast majority of issues quoted in the OTCBB, especially the lower priced issues, The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will result in quotation size requirements that correspond more closely to the trading practices of market makers that actively use the OTCBB. II. Discussion The Commission believes that approval of this proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and, in particular with the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) states that an association of brokers and dealers, such as the NASD, may not be registered as a national securities association unless the Commission determines that \"the rules of the association are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, [and] to promote just and equitable principles of trade.\" Section 15A(b)(11) states that the association rules must \"include provisions 4 The proposed rule change does not require market makers to publish two-sided firm quotes for OTC Equity securities. Market makers may, therefore, continue to publish unpriced indications of interest, or one-sided quotations for such securities. 5 The NASD anticipates that the OTCBB will have size display capability nd the minimum size default feature by the end of the first half of 1994. 8 A table setting forth the tiered minimum size requirements will be reproduced in a newsframe accessible to OTCBB market makers on the workstations they use to enter and update their quotations.36725 Federal Register / Vol.. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices governing the form and content of quotations * * * [and] be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.\" The Commission believes that replacing the current one-trading-unit size requirement for firm quotes in OTC Equity Securities with size requirements that are based on bid or offer prices should provide investors with a more accurate picture of the actual size of execution available and the depth of the market in each security. Moreover, the proposed rule change should enhance the quality, liquidity, and depth of the OTCBB market and provide greater information to investors. Market makers currently are willing to execute trades in many of the OTC Equity Securities well in excess of the 100-share size that is currently required to be honored. The Commission has favored realistic display of size at least since the early 1980s.7 IH. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.

The amendments will require registration as a CAES market maker for those members registered in CQS for non-Rule 19c-3 securities and registration fs an ITS/CAES market maker and participation in the ITS/ CAES system by CQS market makers in Rule 19c-3 securities traded in the ITS linkage.3 The proposal also will require CQS market makers to input minimum sizes of 200 or 500 shares in their quotations (depending on trading characteristics of the securities), and will require CQS market makers to abide by excess spread parameters as established for the Nasdaq market in Part VI of Schedule D to the By-Laws. The NASD is also modifying the operation of CAES to permit market maker-to-market maker transactions through the system. The NASD is proposing the rule change to enhance the quality and liquidity of the third market and to improve opportunities for customers to receive automated executions of their orders through CAES. Additionally, the NASD believes that requiring market makers in ITS/CAES eligible securities to participate in the linkage will make ITS a more effective national market linkage, and will help eliminate confusion by exchange participants and others between linked and non-linked market makers. Participation in the ITS/CAES linkage will enhance the quality of the third market by making the quotations by third market makers in Rule 19c-3 exchange-listed stocks accessible to other exchange participants. Currently, the quotes of all Nasdaq market makers in exchange-listed securities are consolidated into a composite third market quote and disseminated to vendors and to the floors of competing exchanges on CQS. The quotes of Nasdaq market makers that are not ITS linked are included in the consolidated quote, but are not accessible through the facilities of ITS or ITS/CAES to other ITS participants or ITS market makers. ITS has its own display of quotations, available only to ITS participants, and this dual system of quotation information is sometimes confusing. When other market centers send ITS commitments to the NASD in response to non-ITS market maker qu9tes seen through CQS, the commitments expire 3 Rule 19c-3 under the Act precludes off-board trading restrictions from applying, with certain exceptions, to any reported security which was not traded on an exchange on April 26, 1979, or which was traded on an exchange on April 26, 1979. but which ceases to be traded on an exchange for any period of time thereafter.36726 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 1 Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices unexecuted and the other market centers may believe that the NASD market maker is backing away from its quotes. The NASD believes that it is desirable to remedy this confusion and to enhance the quality of the third market by providing access to all third market quotes through the ITS/CAES linkage. Additionally. the non-ITS market makers are not presently bound by the ITS Plan or operating procedures. The ITS Plan contains provisions regarding treatment of trade-through occurrences, block trades, pre-opening procedures, and resolution of obvious errors and intermarket disputes. Having some NASD market makers obliged to follow the Plan and others outside the scope of its application causes confusion and disparate regulatory treatment that will be cured by the instant rule proposal. The NASD is also proposing to require CQS market makers to input size in their quotations of 200 or 500 shares depending on trading characteristics of the securities, such as price, volume, and number of market makers in the security, and to impose excess spread parameters comparable to those in the Nasdaq market. The NASD believes that the benefits of adopting quality of market standards related to size of displayed quotations and excess spread parameters are invaluable to the development and maintenance of a quality marketplace for exchange-listed securities. Finally, the NASD is modifying the operation of CAES to permit market maker-to-market maker executions within the system. Currently the system is available only for agency orders, and the NASD believes that with mandatory participation in the system, it is appropriate for market makers to be able to access each other through the system, reducing reliance on telephone contact, es'pcially in times of market stress. The NASD analyzed the effects of the rule proposal on the market makers trading exchange-listed securities but not participating in ITS/CAES and believes that the costs to participants in joining the ITS/CAES link and the regulatory burdens incumbent on members to comply with the ITS Plan and rules thereunder are outweighed by the benefits to the market as a whole and to the continuing development of a national market system, as described in Section 11A of the Act. The NASD met with a number of non-linked market makers to discuss the proposal and has received indications that at least half of the market makers would participate in the linkage, and the more active market makers (those trading more than 50 securities) would most likelyparticipate. Accordingly, the NASD believes that the proposal is appropriate and the burdens on firms in complying with the proposal are outweighed by the positive impact on the market for listed tradin. ThegNASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with sections 11A(a)(1)(D), 11A(a)(2) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(D) of the Act states that the linking of all markets for qualified securities through communications and data processing facilities will foster efficiency, enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers and investors, facilitate the offsetting of investor's orders and contibute to best execution of such orders, and subsection (a)(2) thereunder directs the SEC to facilitate the establishment of a national market system for qualified securities. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal to require all CQS market makers to participate in CAES and ITS/ CAES will enhance the national market system for listed securities to the benefit of market participants and investors. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition As discussed above, the NASD believes that any burdens imposed by the proposed rule change are far outweighed by the benefits obtained from the changes. Accordingly, the NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others Comments were neither solicited nor received. IM1. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such longer period i)as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

McFarland, Deputy Secretary. 8:45 Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval on a Temporary Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Use of Letters of Credit To Collateralize Clearing Fund Contributions June 29, 1993, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Act\"),1 notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1993, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\"NSCC\") filed '15 U.S.C. 78s[b)(1) (1988).36727 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\") the proposed rule change (File No. SR- NSCC-93-5) as described below. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change through June 30, 1994. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change modifies the minimum cash Clearing Fund contribution for members that deposit letters of credit as part of their Clearing Fund contributions and limits the percentage of a member's required Clearing Fund contribution that may be collateralized with letters of credit.2 II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change The proposed rule change modifies the minimum cash contribution for NSCC clearing members that use letters of credit as part of their Clearing Fund contributions from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10% of their required Clearing Fund deposit up' to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the proposal provides that only 70% of a member's required deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit.3 The 2The proposed rule change originally was filed in October of 1989 and was approved temporarily through December 31, 1990. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27604 (January 31, 1990). 55 FR 4297 [File No. SR-NSCC-89-16. Subsequently, the Commission granted three extensions to the temporary approval to provide the Commission and NSCC sufficient time to review and to assess the use of letters of credit as Clearing Fund collateral. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 28727 (December 31, 1990), 56 FR 716 [File No. and 30883 (July 1, 1992), 57 FR 30521 (File No. SR-NSCC-92-051. 3 Prior to this rule filing, NSCC's rules contained no provision limitimg the percentage of a Clearing Member's required Dlearing Fund deposit that could be collateralized with letters of credit.rule change also makes certain nonsubstantive drafting changes, such as adding headings to the Clearing Fund formula section, for purposes of clarity. The effect of the proposed rule change should be to increase the liquidity of the Clearing Fund and to limit NSCC's exposure to risks associated with reliance on letters of credit. Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing, NSCC has filed Clearing Fund composition reports with the Commission. Since December 31, 1989, NSCC has observed the following changes in the composition of the Clearing Fund as a result of the new requirements: 1. Cash deposits have increased by approximately 175%; 2. Securities deposits have increased in value by approximately 120%;4 and 3. Letter of credit deposits have declined by approximately 51%.5 NSCC states that the proposal is consistent with its requirements under Section 17A of the Act because it enhances NSCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or under its control. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organizotion's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others No new written comments have been solicited or received.8 NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments it receives. 4 Securities eligible for deposit as Clearing Fund collateral include U.S. or municipal bands in the first or second rating of any nationally known statistical service. NSCC Rule 4, Section 1. 5 In October of 1989 when the Commission initially granted temporary approval of NSCC's proposal, letters of credit accounted for 76% of the total dollar value of required Clearing Fund deposits. By May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for less than 30%. During the period from June 1, 1992, to May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for an average of 30.49% of the total dollar value of required Clearing Fund deposits, and for no month during that period did the portion of letters of credit used for required Clearing Fund deposits rise above 34%. Letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President/Director of Legal & Associate General Counsel, NSCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June 10, 1993). e In a previous filing of this proposal, NSCC received a letter from Wedbush Morgan Securities, Inc. Wedbush opposed the proposal because it believed the proposal would increase its cost of posting collateral. Letter from Edward W. Wedbush, President. Wedbush Morgan Securities, Inc.. to David F. Hoyt. Assistant Secretary, NSCC (November 9, 1989).m. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that a clearing agency's rules be designed, among other things, to protect investors and the public interest.7 As discussed below, NSCC's proposal to limit the use of letters of credit to collateralize clearing fund obligations will make NSCC's clearing fid more liquid. A liquid clearing fund is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of a clearing agency, particularly in times of market stress when the risk of member default is greatest. Thus, the proposal is consistent with NSCC's requirements under the Act with regard to protecting the interests of investors and of the public. Although letters of credit are a useful means of funding clearing agency guarantee deposits, their unrestricted use may present risks to clearing agencies. Because letters of credit reflect the issuer's promise to pay funds upon presentation of stipulated documents by the holder (i.e., the clearing agency), a clearing agency holding letters of credit will be exposed to risk should the issuer default, become insolvent, or simply refuse to honor its promise to pay.8 Furthermore, because the issuer may defer honoring a payment request until the close of business on the third banking day following receipt of the required documents,9 the clearing agency either may have to await payment or may have to seek alternative short-term financing pending the issuer's payment. This waiting period could compromise a clearing agency's liquidity and thereby could hinder its ability to meet its payment obligations on a timely basis. Overreliance on letters of credit to collateralize clearing fund obligations was cited in the 1990 GAO Report on the national clearance and settlement system as a factor that is '15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F) (1988). 'This problem was discussed by the General Accounting Office (\"GAO\") in a report on clearance and settlement reform. The GAO noted: \"Letters of credit are considered less liquid than cash or cash equivalents because banks that issue letters of credit may choose not to honor them.\" GAO Report, Clearance and Settlement Reform: The Stock, Options, and Futures Markets are Still at Risk 33 (April 1990) (hereinafter GAO Report\"]. A bank's failure to honor a letter of credit, of course, could have dire consequences for its reputation and credit standing. 'For example, pursuant to New York's codification of Uniform Commercial Code (\"U.C.C.\" section 5-112(a)(1). a bank to which a demand has been made for payment under a letter of credit may, without breaching its duty under the letter of credit, defer payment until the third banking day after receipt of the required documents. N.Y. U.C.C. 5- 112(1)(a) (NY CLS 1993).36728 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices putting the markets at risk.1o The GAO noted proposals, however, including the one approved herein, that are designed to ameliorate the problem.11 As indicated above, since the proposal first received temporary approval, NSCC has experienced significant increases in the use of cash and eligible securities as required Clearing Fund deposits. Because cash and eligible securities are more liquid than letters of credit, the enhanced level of such deposits helps to ensure the liquidity of NSCC's Clearing Fund in the event of a major member insolvency, catastrophic loss, or major settlement loss. By reducing reliance on letters of credit and thereby increasing the liquidity of its Clearing Fund, NSCC's proposal should help it to fulfill its responsibilities under the Act to protect investors and the public. Therefore, the Commission is approving the proposal. NSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because accelerated approval of the proposal will keep effective NSCC's rules that help reduce the exposure of NSCC's Clearing Fund to the potential liquidity risks associated with using letters of credit to collateralize members' Clearing Fund obligations. Moreover, since it was first introduced in 1989, NSCC's proposal has been open for public comment and has elicited only one opposing comment. Thus, the Commission does not foresee that approval of the proposal will elicit further opposition. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

Osterman, Branch Chief, at (202) 272- 3016 (Office of Investment Company Regulation, Division of Investment Management). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. The Trust will consist of a series of unit investment trusts, each of which will be similar but separate and designated by a different series number (\"Trust Series\"). The objective of each Trust Series is to protect capital, and to provide income and/or capitol appreciation through investments in equity securities and zero coupon obligations. Each Trust Series will be registered under the 1940 Act, and under the Securities Act of 1933 by a registration statement on Form S-6. 2. Each Trust Series will be created pursuant to a trust agreement which will contain information specific to that Trust Series and which will incorporate by reference a master trust indenture between the Sponsor and a financial institution that is a bank within the meaning of section 2(a)(5) of the Act and that satisfies the criteria of section 26(a) of the Act (trust agreement and master trust indenture collectively, the \"Trust Agreement\"). 3. Each Trust Series will be sponsored by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will deposit zero coupon obligations and equity securities (collectively with the zero coupon obligations, \"Securities\") in the Trust Series at the price determined by an independent evaluator. The Sponsor expects to deposit in each Trust Series36729 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices substantially more than $100,000 aggregate value of Securities. All zero coupon obligations in any one Trust Series -will have essentially identical maturities, and the Sponsor will purchase all Securities from third parties. 4. Simultaneously with the deposit of Securities in a Trust Series, the Trustee will deliver to the Sponsor registered certificates for units (\"Units\") which will represent the entire ownership of the Trust Series (owners of such Units are hereinafter referred to as \"Unitholders\"). The Units in turn will be offered for sale to the public by the Sponsor following the effectiveness of the registration statement relating to the Trust Series, and clearance by the securities authorities of the various states. Applicants intend to offer each Trust Series to the Public initially at prices based on the closing sale prices of listed equity securities and the ask prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities selected for deposit in the Trust Series, plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained therein, plus a sales charge. 5. On the initial date of deposit of the Securities in a Trust Series, the Sponsor will establish a proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obigations and the equity securities in the Trust Series. This percentage relationship will be set forth in the prospectus and in each Trust Agreement. Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor may deposit additional Securities in the Trust Series, which additional deposit will maintain the proportionate relationship between the zero coupon obligations and the equity securities in the Trust Series. A deposit of additional Securities subsequent to the initial date of deposit may result in a potential corresponding increase in the number of Units outstanding. Such Units may be offered for sale to the public continuously by means of the prospectus. 6. Each Trust Series will consist of the Securities, accrued and undistributed income, dividends, and undistributed cash. The Trust will be structured so that, on the specified maturity date for each Trust Series, the initial Unitholders (investors who purchased Units on the first date they are offered for sale) will receive back at least the total amount of their original investment in the Trust Series, including the sales charge. To that end, the principal value of the maturing zero coupon obligations in each Trust Series will at least equal the original purchase price of the Units of the Trust Series 7. The Trust will redeem Units at prices based on the aggregate bid sideevaluation of the zero coupon obligations, the closing sale prices of listed equity securities, and the bid prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities. 8. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market for Units of each Trust Series. The secondary market will be based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations, the closing sale prices of listed equity securities, and the bid prices of over-the-counter traded equity securities, plus a sales charge. Such a secondary market will reduce the number of Units tendered to the Trustee for redemption and alleviate the need to sell portfolio securities to raise the cash necessary to meet such redemptions. In the event that the Sponsor does not maintain a secondary market, the Trust Agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct the Trustee to sell zero coupon obligations from any Trust Series until equity securities have been liquidated in order not to impair the protection provided by the zero coupon obligations, unless the Trustee is able to sell such zero coupon obligations and still maintain at least the original proportional relationship to Unit value, and that zero coupon obligations may not be sold to meet Trust expenses. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 14(a) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that no registered investment company shall make a public offering of its securities unless such company (a) has a net worth of at least $100,000 or (b) ensures to the satisfaction of the SEC and as a condition of registration of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933 that: (i) After the effective date of such registration statement such company will not issue any security or receive any proceeds of any subscription for any security until not more than 25 responsible persons have made firm agreement to purchase securities in an aggregate net amount which will give the company a net worth of at least $100,000; (ii) such amount will be paid into such company before subscriptions will be accepted from any persons in excess of 25; and (iii) arrangements will be made whereby any amount paid in, as well as any sales load, will be refunded to any subscriber on demand without any deduction in the event that the net proceeds received by the company do not result in the company having a net worth of at least $100,000 within 90 days after such registration statement becomes effective.2. Applicants contend that, because the Sponsor will deposit substantially more than $100,000 of Securities In each Trust Series, applicants will comply with section 14(a) of the Act. However, applicants acknowledge that the Commission has interpreted section 14(a) as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment. Under this interpretation, a Trust Series would not satisfy section 14(a) because of the Sponsor's intention to sell all the Units thereof. Applicants request an exemption to the extent that section 14(a) would require the Sponsor to take $100,000 worth of Units either for its own account or under an investment letter. 3. Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, which provides an exemption from section 14(a), except that the Trust will invest in equity securities, and hence will not restrict its portfolio investments to \"eligible trust securities.\" 4. Section 19(b) of the Act and rule 19b-1 thereunder provide that no registered investment company may distribute long-term capital gains more than once every twelve months. Applicants state that the provisions of section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 thereunder were designed to remove the temptation to realize capital gains on a frequent and regular basis, and to eliminate attempts by investment advisers to time distributions to be advantageous to shareholders. Applicants also contend that there was concern that investors would be confused by a failure to distinguish between regular distributions of capital gains and distributions of investment income. 5. Rule 19b-1(c), under certain circumstances, excepts a unit investment trust investing in \"eligible trust securities,\" as defined in rule 14a- 3(b) of the Act, from the requirements of rule 19b-1. Applicants assert that this exception recognizes that the danger of making manipulative capital gains distributions which are detrimental to Unitholders is largely eliminated for . unit investment trusts. For such trusts, the conditions under which capital gains are realized are beyond the Sponsor's control, and the capital gains are identified clearly. However, the exception provided by rule 19b-1(c) does not apply to the Trust because the Trust does not intend to invest in\"eligible trust securities.\" Applicants request an exemption from rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of equity securities to be distributed to36730 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices. Unitholders along with the Trust's regular distributions. 6. Applicants submit that the dangers which section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 are designed to prevent do not exist in the Trust. Any gains from the sale of equity securities would be triggered by the need to meet Trust expenses or by requests to redeem Units, events over which the Sponsor and Trust have no control. Applicants state that the Sponsor has control over the actual redemption of Units to the extent it makes a market in Units. However, applicants further state that the Sponsor has no incentive to redeem or to permit the redemption of Units in order to generate capital gains for the purpose section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 were designed to protect against. Aside from the facts that the Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market and that the current realization and distribution of gains is not an objective of the Trust, applicants assert that cash generated from the sale of equity securities will be used to pay expenses and to meet redemptions and will not generate distributions to Unitholders. Moreover, applicants contend that because principal distributions are indicated clearly in accompanying reports to Unitholders as a return of principal and are relatively small in comparison to normal distributions, there is a little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among distributions. Applicants also assert that any retention of capital gains until year-end would be to the detriment of Unitholders. 7. Applicants contend that the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act, and would be in the best interests of the Unitholders.I Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that, as a condition of the order, applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to\"eligible trust securities.\" For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

Pursuant to the authority placed in Heads of Departments by section 10(d) of Public Law 92-463, and vested in me by Treasury Department Order 101-05, I hereby determine that this meeting is concerned with information exempt from disclosure under subsection 552b(c)(9)(A) of title 5 of the United States Code, and that the public interest requires that such meetings be closed to the public. My reasons for this determination are as follows. The Treasury Department requires frank and full advice from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations. Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major segments of the financial community, which committees have36734 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices been utilized by the Department at meetings called by representatives of the Secretary. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee under Public Law 92-463. Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports of an advisory committee, premature disclosure ofthese reports would lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption covered by subsection 552b(c)(9)(A) of title 5 of the United States Code. The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance shall be responsible for maintaining records of debt management advisory committee meetings and for providing annualreports setting forth a summary of committee activities and such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of section 552b of title 5 of the United States Code.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice, applicable to transport category airplanes, proposes revised standards for determining the runway length that must be available for takeoff and landing. The current standards would be amended to: (1) Revise the method of accounting for pilot reaction time used in determining the runway length that must be available in the event of a rejected takeoff; (2) account for the effect of wet runways on takeoff performance; and (3) account for the reduced capability of worn brakes on takeoff and landing performance. This action is being taken to improve the current standards, reduce the impact of the standards on the competitiveness of new versus derivative airplanes without adversely affecting safety, and harmonize with proposed standards for the European Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR). The revised standards would not be applied retroactively to either airplanes currently in use or airplanes of existing approved designs that will be manufactured in the future.

Background Before a takeoff may be started with a turbine-powered transport category airplane. the operator must determinethat the length of the runway to be used, plus any \"stopway\" and \"clearway\" that may be available, is adequate to either safely continue the takeoff from a defined go/no-go decision point in the takeoff roll, or reject the takeoff from that point and bring the airplane to a complete stop. The go/no-go decision point occurs during the takeoff roll when the airplane reaches a speed known as the \"takeoff decision speed,\" or \"V1 speed.\" To assure that there is adequate runway to continue the takeoff from the go/no-go decision point, the runway plus any clearway at the end must be long enough for the airplane to first accelerate to the Vi speed and then to continue the takeoff to a height of 35 feet. even if a total loss of power from the most critical engine occurs just before reaching the V, speed. This distance for the airplane to reach a height of 35 feet following a total loss of power from the most critical engine is defined as the \"takeoff distance.\" To provide for a possible need to reject the takeoff, the runway plus any stopway area must also be long enough to accelerate the airplane to the V, speed and then bring the airplane to a complete stop. This distance to reject a takeoff is called the \"accelerate-stop\" distance. A \"balanced field length\" exists when V, is selected such that the accelerate-stop distance is equal to the takeoff distance. In general, the balanced field length is the minimum rnway length required for takeoff. The V speed selected for any takeoff depends on several variables, including the airplane's takeoff weight and configuration (flap setting), the runway length, the air temperature, and the runway surface elevation (airport altitude), etc. The takeoff performance and limitation charts in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) are developed in accordance with the FAA airworthiness standards in subpart B of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), part 25- \"Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes,\" using data gathered during comprehensive flight tests completed as a part of the FAA's approval of the airplane's type design. Part 25 of the FAR, subpart B, also prescribes the FAA airworthiness standards for determining the length of runway required for safe landing under various airplane and atmospheric conditions. Landing performance charts are also published in the AFM, to be used by the operator to determine whether a particular runway is long enough for landing. The general operating rules contained in parts 91.121, and 135 of the FAR require operators to plan takeoffs and36738 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993. / Proposed Rules landings using the appropriate performance and limitation charts published in the AFM. Part I of the FAR defines terms and explains abbreviations used in parts 25, 91, 121, and 135. This notice proposes amendments to several sections of parts 25, 91, 121, and 135 of the FAR that provide the methods for determining and applying the takeoff and landing performance standards for turbine-powered transport category airplanes. Also, this notice proposes to amend Part 1 to add a definition of the term \"takeoff decision speed\" and an explanation for the abbreviation \"VEF.\" This nomenclature is currently used in FAA airworthiness standards and operating rules, and is also commonly used in the aviation industry. It is fundamental to operational safety that the pilot should be able to either safely complete the takeoff or bring the airplane to a complete stop if a decision is made to reject the takeoff no later than the V, speed, even if power is lost from the most critical engine just before V1.This principle has been used as the basis for the takeoff performance standards required for the type certification of turbine-powered transport category airplanes since the issuance of Special Civil Air Regulation No. SR-422, effective August 27, 1957. The amendments proposed in this notice would not change that principle. Proposals are made, however, to change some aspects of implementing that principle by amendg the current part 25 airworthiness standards. These proposed amendments would provide a more rational (i.e., explicitly address the specific elements affecting the takeoff distance rather than applying more restrictive standards to all takeoffs) method of accounting for various operational aspects of takeoff and landing, and would affect the takeoff and landing runway lengths required by the Part 91, 121, and 135 operating rules. The takeoff performance standards of part 25 define how the takeoff performance and limitation contained in the AFM must be determined. The information provided in the AFM accounts for various operational factors affecting how long tre runway must be for airplanes to be operated in accordance with the principle stated in the above paragraph. The operator is not permitted to take off from a runway that Is shorter than the airplane requires for the given conditions. Since actual runway lengths are fixed, the operator, using the performance information contained in the AFM, may have to reduce the airplane's takeoff weight inorder to take off from a given runway. Reducing the takeoff weight shortens the distance required for takeoff. The more restrictive the airworthiness standards for takeoff runway length are, the more the takeoff weight may have to be reduced to be able to take off from a given runway. To reduce the airplane's takeoff weight, the operator must either reduce the amount of fuel to be carried, or reduce the number of passengers or amount of cargo to be transported. Since the amount of fuel to be carried is dictated primarily by the route being flown, sometimes the operator's only option is to reduce the number of passengers or amount of cargo to be transported. When the number of passengers or amount of cargo must be reduced for a given flight, the airplane operator can suffer a loss of revenue. Amendment 25-42, which became effective on March 1, 1978, revised the takeoff performance standards to make them more restrictive. Prior to Amendment 25-42, the accelerate-stop distance shown in the AFM accounted for variations in pilot reaction time by generally adding two seconds to the time required for pilots to take the actions necessary to stop the airplane during flight tests (e.g., reduce power, apply the brakes, and raise the spoilers). During this two second time delay, the airplane is assumed to be travelling at a constant speed. The revised standards of Amendment 25-42 require the accelerate-stop distance to include two seconds of continued acceleration beyond V, speed before the pilot takes action to begin stopping the airplane. This revision results in longer accelerate-stop distances being required for airplanes whose application for a type certificate was made after Amendment 25-42 became effective. Consequently, turbine- powered transport category airplanes that are currently being manufactured under a type certificate that was applied for prior to March 1, 1978, have a significant operational economic advantage over airplanes whose type certificate was applied for after that date. This competitive disparity resulting from applying different performance standards has created a compelling need to amend the takeoff performance standards of part 25 without adversely affecting safety. Amendment 25-42 was a broad brush approach, applying to all takeoffs, to increase the required accelerate-stop distance. This broad brush approach was taken because the takeoff performance standards do not explicitly account for many of the important operational factors that may affecttakeoff performance. For example, the standards do not currently distinguish - between dry and wet runways, nor are the effects of worn brakes taken into account. Wet runways and worn brakes would result in an airplane requiring a longer accelerate-stop distance than with new brakes on a dry runway. By proposing to account for wet runways and to base stopping performance on brakes that are completely worn, these amendments would provide additional accelerate-stop distance for the conditions where it Is specifically needed in operational service. Because wet runways and worn brakes would be accounted for in the proposed new standards, the FAA also proposes to replace the two seconds of continued acceleration beyond V with a distance equal to two seconds at constant Vi. The distance equal to two seconds at constant Vt, while shorter than that resulting from the continued acceleration beyond V required by Amendment 25-42, is a distance margin that must be added to the accelerate- stop distance demonstrated during flight testing for type certification. This distance margin, based on the V, speed and a time \"delay\" of two seconds- accounts for variability in the time it takes for pilots, in actual operations, to accomplish the procedures for stopping the airplane. Amendment 25-42 required the two seconds of time delay to be applied prior to the pilot taking any action to stop the airplane. This more restrictive approach causes the airplane to reach a higher speed during the accelerate-stop maneuver and results in a longer distance than the distance equal to two seconds at constant V, speed. Inserting the time delay before the pilot takes any action to stop the airplane, however, does not accurately reflect the procedures that pilots are trained to use in operational service. Also, V, is intended to be the speed by which the pilot has made the decision to reject the takeoff and has begun taking action to stop the airplane. The time it takes for the pilot to recognize the need for a rejected takeoff, which no longer exists once V, is reached, is considered separately within the airworthiness standards. Therefore, the proposed amendments more accurately reflect rejected takeoff procedures and the intended use of V, speed, and account for variability in the time it takes for pilots, in actual operations, to accomplish the procedures for stopping the airplane. The purpose of the proposed amendments to the takeoff performance standards of parts 25, 91, 121, and 135 is to more rationally reflect the36739 Federal Register I VoL 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules operational factors involved and thus reduce the impact of the standards on the competitiveness of new versus derivative airplanes. The amendments proposed would require more restrictive standards to be met for takeoffs from wet runways than for takeoffs from dry runways. In addition, the accelerate- ,stop distance, which must be provided as an AFM takeoff limitation, would be based on worn brakes rather than new brakes. Lastly, the airplane would be assumed to maintain a constant velocity for the two second time delay after reaching V, speed (instead of accelerating). Overall, the amended standards would be more rational and less restrictive than the existing standards, even though they would remain slightly more restrictive than the standards that existed before Amendment 25-42 became effective. This notice also proposes to amend the landing distance determination standards of part 25 to account for the diminished stopping capability of having brakes that are worn within the brake wear limits allowed without overhauling the brakes. This proposal is made to be consistent with the proposed requirements that worn brakes be taken into account when determining the accelerate-stop distance for establishing takeoff performance limitations. Because airplanes generally require more distance to take off than to land, and a landing will be followed by a subsequent takeoff, this proposed landing distance rule change is not expected to cause the allowable landing weight to limit the number of passengers or amount of cargo that can be carried. International Harmonization of Airworthiness Standards For more than ten years, the FAA has been cooperating with the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) of Europe to promote harmonization between the FAR, particularly the airworthiness standards, and the European Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR). The aircraft certification authorities of 19 European countries are members of JAA. An annual meeting is held between FAA senior managemnt officials and senior management officials of the JAA member authorities to identify technical subject areas where cooperation Is needed to promote greater harmonization between the FAR of the United States and the European JAR. A large portion of these meetings have been open to the public. A comprehensive study of this activity was completed by Professor George A. Bermann. Columbia University School of Law, in May 1991 as a ConferenceConsultant to the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS). A copy of Professor Bermann's final report to ACUS. titled: \"Regulatory Cooperation with Counterpart Agencies Abroadi The FAA's Aircraft Certification Experience,\" dated May 1991, is included in the docket. Based on Professor Bermann's report, ACUS has confirmed the administrative appropriateness of this effort and has indicated strong support for this activity in their Recommendation 91-1, titled \"Federal Agency Cooperation with Foreign Government Regulators,\" adopted June 13, 1991. At the annual FAA/JAA meeting in June 1989, the FAA and JAA discussed the competitive disparity caused by the differences between the takeoff performance standards applied to airplanes that met the later standards of Amendment 25-42, as compared with airplanes that were only required to meet the takeoff performance standards that preceded Amendment 25-42. Even though the airplane types were originally type certificated at different times, thus allowing the use of different amendments, both groups of airplanes are continuing In production and both are competing for sales and for use over some common routes. Airplanes whose designs were type certificated to the standards introduced by Amendment 25-42 could be penalized in terms of the number of passengers or amount of cargo they can carry over a common route, even though the airplane's takeoff performance might be better from a safety perspective than a competing airplane design that was not required to meet the later standards. Currently, the only transport category airplane types that have been required to meet the later standards of Amendment 25-42 were designed and manufactured outside the U.S. (mostly In Europe). These airplanes are competing for sales against airplanes that were designed and manufactured in the U.S. that were not required to meet the standards of Amendment 25-42. This situation has led to claims by a major European manufacturer of transport category airplanes that this disparity in the airworthiness standards has created an unfair international trade situation affecting the competitivenes of their airplane types of a later design. At the June 1990 annual meeting, the FAA and JAA agreed to jointly review the current takeoff performance standards and their applicability with respect to airplaes currently in use and airplanes produced in the future under existing approved designs. The goal was to reduce the inequities described above without adversely affecting safety. The study consisted of two parts: first, thecurrent takeoff performance standards were reviewed to determine if they were too restrictive: and second, the merits of making the resulting standards apply retroactively were considered for both airplanes currently in use and airplanes produced in the future under existing aproved designs. The FAA and JAA aso agreed to initiate substantively the same rulemaking within their respective systems to harmonize the takeoff performance standards of the FAR and the1eAA has concluded that the takeoff performance standards of pert 25 can be made more rational, and thus less restrictive overall, without adversely affecting safety and proposes to amend the standards accordingly by this notice. However, with the safety benefits and economic impact information available at this time, the FAA cannot support a recommendation to make the standards proposed by this notice retroactive to either aiplanes currently in use or future production airplanes of designs that have already been type certificated. If additional information to support making these proposed standards retroactive becomes available at a later date, the FAA will review such information and determine if further rulemaking is appropriate. In March 1992, the JAA issued its Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) 25 B, D, G-244: \"Accelerate-Stop Distances and Related Performance Matters\" to change the takeoff performance standards of JAR 25. The amendments proposed in this notice are substantively the same as the amendments proposed by the JAA NPA for the JAR. The JAA NPA is included in the docket for this rulemaking. On November 30,1987, the FAA published NPRM 87-13 (52 FR 45578) proposing to amend parts 25, 121, and 135 of the FAR by adding new standards for transport category airplanes to increase the safety of takeoffs from wet and contaminated runways. After further study of rejected takeoff safety, the FAA began drafting a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM 87-13A), revising NPRM 87-13. During internal coordination, a draft copy of SNPRM 87-13A was obtained by persons outside the Federal government Based on that copy, Delta Air Lines and the Air Transport Association of America (ATA) claimed, in letters dated December 27,1991, and December 10, 1991, respectively, that the FAA underestimated the cost of compliance with the proposed rulemaking. This claim was repeated in a similar letter dated June 5, 1992 from the law firm of Galland, Kharasch, Morse & Gerfinkle. P.C, on behalf of36740 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules American Trans Air, Inc., American International Airways, Air Canada. and Cathay Pacific Airway. The assertions made in the three letters reiterated cost estimates include in a cost study presented to the FAA by the ATA in May, 1991. The earlier estimates were reviewed at that time and determined by the FAA to contain significant flaws. Nevertheless, the FAA again reviewed the ory analysis in light of Presi ent Bush's January 28, 1992, memorandum on \"Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation\" and the three letters mentioned above. As a result of this review and due to the increasing emphasis placed on harmonizing certification standards with the JAA, the FAA has determined that this revised NPRM is necessary. By a separate notice to be published simultaneously with this NPRM, the FAA is withdrawing the original NPRM 87-13. The three letters referenced above have been added to the docket for this rulemaking. This NPRM also will give the public a chance to comment on the subject of those ex parte communications. Discussion of the Proposals The FAA proposes the following rule changes: L Replace the two seconds of continued acceleration beyond V, (mandated by Amendment 25-42) with a distance margin equal to two seconds at V, speed; 2. Require that the runway surface condition (dry or wet) be taken into account when determining the runway length that must be available for takeoff; and 3. Require that worn brakes be taken into account when determining the capability of the brakes to absorb energy and provide a stopping force for takeoff and landing. Proposal 1. The FAA proposes to amend the method of determining the accelerate-stop distance prescribed in \u00a7 25.109 by replacing the two seconds of continued acceleration after reaching V1 with a distance equal to two seconds at V, speed. This proposal would reduce the accelerate-stop distance that must be available for a rejected takeoff because the airplane would be assumed to begin stopping from a lower speed (V,. rather than the speed reached after two seconds of acceleration beyond VI). This proposal replaces the most costly and controversial aspect of Amendment 25-42 with a requirement that closely represents the pre-Amendment 25-42 criteria of S 25.109, as applied to the certification of recent U.S.- manufactured airplanes.Proposal 2. The FAA proposes to amend S 25.105 to require that airplane takeoff performance data be based on wet, in addition to dry, runways. Section 25.1587(b) would be amended to require that performance information for wet runways be included in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). (The AFM contains, along with other information, all of the performance information computed under the provisions of part 25.) Sections 91.605, 121.189, and 135.379 of the operating rules would be amended to require that wet runways be taken into account when determining the runway length that must be available for takeoff, if wet runway performance information exists in the AFM. Thus, this rule would apply only to airplanes whose application for type certification occurs after the rule becomes effective. Section 25.109 would be revised to provide the details of how the acolerate-stop distance would be calculated for a wet runway. This proposal contains a rational approach that includes consideration of the major variables affecting the stopping performance on a wet runway. This approach to determining the wet runway rejected takeoff performance would include: (1) Taking into account the reduced braking force due to the wet surface; (2) permitting performance credit for using available reverse thrust as an additional stopping force; and (3) permitting a lower minimum airplane height over the end of the runway after takeoff. This approach would reduce the risk of overruns during rejected takeoffs on wet runways while retaining safety margins for continued takeoffs similar to those required for dry runways. The reduced braking force available Is the most significant variable affecting the stopping performance on a wet runway. Section 25.109 would be revisedto specify that the wet runway braking force is proposed to be one-half the dry runway braking force, unless the applicant demonstrates a higher wet runway braking force. This braking force level would apply regardless of whether the dry runway braking force Is limited by the torque capability of the brake, which Is the friction force generated within the brake, or the friction capability of the runway surface. Although it can be argued that the torque capability of a brake is independent of the runway surface condition, the proposed use of this simple relationship between wet and dry runway braking capability depends on using the same relationship throughout the braking phase. Data published in Engineering Science Data Unit (ESDU) 71026,entitled \"Frictional and Retarding Forces on Aircraft Types--Part I: Estimation of Braking Force,\" shows that the relationship between wet and dry braking coefficient varies significantly with speed. At high speeds, the wet runway braking coefficient Is typically less than one-half the dry runway braking coefficient. At low speeds, the wet runway braking coefficient is typically more than one- half the dry runway braking coefficient. Used over the entire speed range for the stopping portion of a rejected takeoff, however, the wet runway braking coefficient can justifiably be approximated as one-he the dry braking coefficient. The ESDU report is included in the docket. Section 25.109 would also be revised to permit the use of available reverse thrust when determining the accelerate- stop distance for a wet runway. \"Available\" reverse thrust is interpreted as meaning the thrust from engines with thrust reversers that are operating during the stopping portion of the rejected takeoff. Allowance for reverse thrust has been included in this proposal because the most significant variable that affects the stopping performance on a wet runway, reduced braking friction, has been accounted for as part of the rational approach to wet runway rejected takeoff. On dry runways, the current practice of not permitting credit for reverse thrust when calculating the accelerate- stop distance would be made explicit. Permitting accelerate-stop performance calculations for dry runways to be based on the use of reverse thrust would reduce the level of safety that currently exists by allowing operations at increased takeoff weights. Service experience, as indicated by the rejected takeoff accident record, does not support such a reduction in the level of safety. Although reverse thrust should and probably would be used during most rejected takeoffs, the FAA believes that the additional safety provided by not accounting for reverse thrust in calculating the accelerate-stop distance on a dry runway is necessary to offset other variables that can significantly affect the dry runway accelerate-stop performance determined under the current standards. For wet runways, credit for reverse thrust would be permitted because taking into account the reduced braking force available on the wet surface, as proposed in this notice, greatly outweighs and more than adequately addresses the effects of these other variables. Examples of variables than can significantly affect the dry runway accelerate-stop performance include: runway surfaces that provide36741 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules poorer friction characteristics than the runway used during flight tests to determine stopping performance, worn tires, dragging brakes, brakes whose stopping capability is reduced because of heat retained from previous braking, etc. Section 25.113 would be revised to allow the distance required for a continued takeoff from a wet runway to include taking off and climbing to a height of 15 feet, rather than the 35 feet required on a dry runway. This lower\"screen height\" (which is the height of an imaginary screen that the airplane would just clear with the wings in a level attitude when taking off or landing) would reduce the balanced field length V, speed, thereby reducing the number of high-speed rejected takeoffs on wet runways. The FAA considers lowering the screen height to be an acceptable method of reducing the risk of overruns on wet runways because of the similarity to current rules when operating from dry runways that have a clearway. The minimum height permitted over the end of the runway for current dry runway takeoffs may be 13 to 17 feet, depending on the airplane, when a clearway is present. In addition, a 15-foot minimum screen height and vertical obstacle clearance distance has been allowed for many years by the British Civil Aviation Authority for wet runway operations without any problems being reported. The combination of a clearway with the proposed 15-foot screen height for wet runways could result in a minimum height over the end of the runway of near zero (i.e., liftoff very near the end of the runway), if clearway credit were to be permitted for wet runways in the same manner that it is currently permitted for dry runways. The FAA considers this situation to be unacceptable. The possible presence of standing water or other types of precipitation (e.g., slush or snow) and numerous operational factors (e.g., late or slow rotation to liftoff attitude) emphasize the need to provide more of a safety margin than would be present if liftoff were permitted so near the end of the runway. Therefore, \u00a7 25.113 would not permit the combination of clearway credit and a 15-foot screen height. Section 25.113 would be clarified, however, to ensure that for wet runways the presence of a clearway does not result in the anomaly of requiring longer runway lengths than if there were no clearway. In addition to the reduced screen height for wet runways, the minimum vertical distance required between the takeoff flight path defined in \u00a7 25.115 and obstacles (e.g., trees, hills,buildings, etc.) would be reduced by a corresponding amount. To accomplish this, \u00a7 25.115 would be revised to state that the takeoff flight path shall be considered to begin at a height of 35 feet at the end of the takeoff distance. This revised definition of the takeoff flight path would apply equally to dry and wet runways, even through the height at the end of the takeoff distance (i.e., screen height) for wet runways is proposed to be only 15 feet. The effect of this proposal is to permit the flight path information currently contained in the AFM for dry runways to also be used for wet runways. Because of the reduced screen height, at a given point in the flight path the height of an airplane taking off from a wet runway will be approximately 20 feet lower than the height of that airplane taking off from a dry runway. Therefore, using the flight path information currently in the AFM will reduce the airplane's actual height over obstacles by approximately 20 feet when that airplane takes off from a wet runway. Under the current regulations, the airplane's flight path must be higher than any obstacles by a combination of an increment of height and an increment of gradient (i.e., the slope of the flight path). This proposal reduces the height increment by approximately 20 feet, but the gradient increment is not changed. As the distance from the end of the takeoff distance increases, the gradient Increment provides an increasingly greater portion of the total height difference between the airplane and the obstacle. Therefore, the effect of reducing the height increment over obstacles by 20 feet diminishes as the distance from the end of the takeoff distance increases. Proposal 3 The FAA proposes to amend \u00a7 25.101(i) to require that accelerate-stop and landing distances must be determined with all the airplane brakes at the fully worn limit of their allowable wear range. Section 25.735 would be revised to require that the brake energy capacity rating must be determined with each brake at the fully worn limit of the allowable wear range. In addition, \u00a7 25.735 would be amended to add a requirement for a flight test demonstration of the maximum kinetic energy rejected takeoff with not more than 10 percent of the allowable brake wear range remaining. Manufacturers or operators of previously certificated airplanes may elect to comply with these proposed later amendments by a change to the type design, and thus the benefits of the revision to the time delay criteria of \u00a7 25.109 would be available to relieve the economic burden imposed byAmendment 25-42. The more rational accounting for reduced stopping capability on wet runways during rejected takeoff and for the reduced capability of worn brakes would also be included in such a recertification. It is expected that, for airplanes whose certification basis includes Amendment 25-42, applicants will elect to comply with this proposal because it will be economically beneficial for them to do SO. Miscellaneous. Additionally, it is proposed that one new definition and one new abbreviation be added to Part I of the FAR, Definitions and Abbreviations. As a result of their special investigation of rejected takeoff accidents, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that the FAA clearly define the term \"takeoff decision speed\" (V) in part 1. This recommendation is contained in the Special Investigative Report, \"Runway Overruns Following High Speed Rejected Takeoffs,\" published on February 27, 1990. A copy of this report is included in the docket. The FAA concurs with the NTSB recommendation and proposes adding a definition of takeoff decision speed to \u00a7 1.1 in order to remove apparent confusion over the meaning of this term. The proposed definition would make it clear that the decision to reject the takeoff, indicated by the pilot activating the first deceleration device, must be made by V for the airplane to be stoppedwithin the accelerate-stop distance. The abbreviation VmE is used in several places within part 25. The FAA proposes to amend \u00a7 1.2 to define Vet as the speed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail during takeoff. Regulatory Evaluation Summary This section summarizes the full regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA that provides more detailed estimates of the economic consequences of this regulatory action. This summary and the full evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs to the private sector, consumers, Federal, State and local governments, as well as anticipated benefits. Executive Order 12291, dated February 17, 1981, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations only if potential benefits to society for each regulatory change outweigh potential costs. The order also requires the preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis of all \"major\" rules, except those responding to emergency situations or other narrowly defined36742 Federal Register / VoL 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules exigencies. A \"major\" rule is one that is likely to result in an annual eiled on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in consumer costs. or a significant adverse effect on competition. The FAA has determined that this proposed rule is not \"major' as defined in the executive order; therefore, a full regulatory analysis, which includes the identification and evaluation of cost- reducing alternatives to this rule, has not been prepared. Instead, the agency has prepared a more concise document termed a regulatory evaluation that analyzes only this rule without identifying alternatives. In addition to a summary of the draft regulatory evaluation, this section also contains the initial regulatory flexibility determination required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and an International Trade Impact Assessment. If more detailed economic information is desired, the reader may refer to the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket. Economic Evaluation The FAA has determined that the potential benefit of these proposals would exceed the expected costs. The proposal would change the conditions that must be considered in the calculation of accelerate-stop distancesby replacing the provision for two seconds of continued acceleration beyond V, with a provision for two seconds at constant V1.Certification substantiation, manual revisions, and airport analysis revision costs would only be incurred by those manufactures who choose to recertify their airplanes and by the operators who choose to take advantage of the reduced requirement These costs are estimated to total $185,235 per airplane model, but it is unlikely that a manufacturer or operator would elect to incur those costs unless it resulted in a net reduction when reduced operating costs are considered. The immediate potential benefit of this provision would be gained by the operators of the existing airplane models that were certificated under the Amendment 25-42 standards. asuming that the manufacturers of these airplanes would voluntarily elect to recertificate under the proposed rule. The two large airplane models (above 75.000 lbs. maximum takeoff weight) that were subject to Amendment 25-42 in 1991 performed an estimated 114,300 takeoffs during the year. Using this basis, an average of 57,150 takeoffs per model per year can be expected. It is estimated that the additional 150 foot field length requirement that would be removed under this proposal would affect 0.69 percent or 394 departures permodel. The weight reductions that would be averted by avoiding these field length limited incidents are valued at $495 per occurrence. Accordingly, the potential annual benefit of this provision for an existing airplane model that was certificated under Amendment 25-42 standards is valued at $195,030 at current operation levels (394 affected departures times $495 per departure). The potential benefit for future airplane models that would otherwise be certificated to the existing standards cannot be predicted. To the extent that such models would be affected in the absence of this proposed provision, It is estimated that a benefit rate of $341,550 per 100,000 departures would be realized (100,000 departures, times 0.69% of departures affected, times $495 per affected departure). No incremental certification costs would be attributed to this provision for newly certificated airplane models. The proposal also includes provisions for newly certificated airplane models that would require accountability for:. (1) Worn brake assemblies in the determination of stopping performance, and (2) wet runway conditions in the calculation of necessary takeoff distance. The expected costs of these provisions are summarized below. Percent of do. Cost per af- Cost per Average cost Provislon paflures af- fected 726 36,300 .36 It should be noted that this evaluation only quantifies the proposal's impact on takeoffs. It is possible that the proposed rule could induce a field-length-limited landing situation, but lch en occurrence would be eo infrequent that the relative costs and benefits would be negligible. It should also be emphasized that the above cost and incidence rates for the worn brake provision wouldgenerally be limited to airplanes with steel brakes that are certificated in the future. Wear is considered to have a negligible effect on the braking force of carbon brakes, and the trend in brake design for future transport category airplanes is toward carbon brakes. The poiential benefit of the worn brake and wet runway pevision is a reduction In the risk iaccidents that might otherwise occur by not considering the reduced brking performance of worn brakes and the reduced braking that exists on wetrunways in determining the field length necessary for a ade takeoff. The average economic valuation of recent rejected takeoff accidents incurred by U.S. operators is $17.8 million per accident. The expected incremental cost of the worn brake provision would be recovered If the added field length afforded by the provision averted one such accident over an exposure period of 9.2 million departures. The wet runway proposal would prove to be cost beneficial by itself If one accident were prevented during an exposure of 49 million departures. The FAA has determined that the potential benefit of these proposals would exceed the expected costs. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entitles are notunnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis If a rule has a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number of small entities. FAA Order 2100.14A. Regultory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, establishes threshold cost values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA review requirements In FAA rulemaking actions. The economic costs of any weight reductions that would be necessitated by this proposal would be Incurred by the operators of transport category airplanes. The FAA size threshold for this category is the ownership of nine airplanes. The annualized cost threshold for the determination of what constitutes a significant impact on small36743 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules entity airplane operators varies by category: (1J $112,600 for scheduled carriers whose airplanes have seating capacities greater than sixty, and (2) $63,000 for all other scheduled operators. FAA calculations project that the annualized economic impact of this proposed rule would be less than the threshold values. Accordingly, it is determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Trade Impact Assessment -The proposed changes would collectively place U.S. and foreign transport airplanes on a more equitable basis regarding their marketability. The standardization of certification criteria between the FAA and the Joint Aviation Authorities of Europe, and the equalization of safety levels for pre- and post-Amendment 25-42 airplanes would eliminate the slight comparative disadvantage experienced by certain foreign airplanes. The proposal regarding the two-second margin would allow European-produced airplanes certificated under Amendment 25-42 to become slightly more competitive against current production U.S. airplanes that were not certificated under Amendment 25-42 (all current production aircraft) by marginally expanding their takeoff envelope. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it Is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient - federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Condusion Because this proposal is intended to enhance the net safety of transport airplane operations and is not expected to result in a substantial economic cost, the FAA has determined that this is not a major regulation as defined in Executive Order 12291. Because this is an issue on which there is substantial public interest both in the United States and Europe, the FAA has determined that this proposal is significant as defined in Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). Additionally, based on the economic assumptions discussed previously, the FAA certifies, under the criteria of theRegulatory Flexibility Act, that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. An initial regulatory evaluation of the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to establish limits on allowable costs incurred by a provider of services that may be paid under the Medicare program, based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services. Under this authority, we have maintained limits on home health agency (HHA) per-visit costs since 1979. The limits may be applied to direct or indirect overall costs or to the costs incurred for specific items or services furnished by the provider. This statutory provision is implemented in the regulations at 42 CFR 413.30. Additional statutory provisions, specifically governing the limits applicable to HHAs, are contained at section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Act. On November 5. 1990, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA '90), Public Law 101-508, was enacted. Section 4207(d)(1) of OBRA '9o amended section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act to require that in establishing the HHA schedule of limits we are to use the current hospital wage index. However, to lessen the effect on individual HHAs that would have been caused by changing from the 1982 hospital wage data to the 1988 hospital wage data, section 4207(d)(3) of OBRA '90 provided for a 2-year transition eriod during which we would use a lend of 1982 and 1988 hospital wage data, based on hospital wages and wage- related costs, in calculating the wage index for HHAs. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991, and before June 30, 1992, the applicable wage indices consisted of a blend of 67 percent of the area wage index using 1982 hospital wage survey data and 33 percent of the area wageindex using 1988 hospital wage survey data. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1992, and beore June 30, 1993, the blend was based on 33 percent of the 1982 hospital wage survey data and 67 percent of the 1988 hospital wage survey data. On July 1, 1992, we published a schedule of HHA cost limits in the Federal Register (57 FR 29410) based on the latter blend. This notice sets forth cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1993. As required by section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act, we are using the current hospital wage index, that is, the hospital wage index effective for hospital discharges on or after October 1, 1992 (Federal fiscal year (FY) 1993), which is based on 1988 wage survey data (See September 1, 1992 Federal Register, 57 FR 39746). As also Srovided in the statute, in applying the ospital wage index to HHAs, no adjustments are to be made to accouni for rural counties that have been deemed urban counties under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. In addition, no adjustments are to be made for any reclassifications resulting from decisions of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act. H. Application of Cost Limits on a Budget-Neutral Basis Section 4207(d)(2) of OBRA '90 requires that, in updating the wage index, aggregate payments to HHAs will remain the same as they would have been if the wage index had not been updated. Therefore, overall payments to HHAs are not affected by the changes in the wage index values. In order to ensure budget neutrality, an adjustment must be made to the payments that would otherwise be made to HHAs for the period beginning July 1, 1993. We determine the amount of the budget neutrality adjustment by first computing the amount of program savings that would have resulted from the cost limits effective July 1, 1993, if a hospital wage index based on 1982 wage data were used. Then, program savings were computed using the current wage index (based on 1988 wage data). The use of the current wage index resulted in higher savings, and therefore, lower program payments. To ensure that aggregate payments to HHAs are not affected by changes to the wage index, we determined that it is necessary to apply a budget neutrality adjustment factor of 1.027 to the labor- related portion of the cost limits. That is, an increase of 2.7 percent to the labor-related portion of the limits results in the same program savings as would have been realized had we used a36748 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices hospital wage index based on 1982 wage data to calculate the limits. (See the example in section VLA below regarding the adjustment of cost limits by the wage index and the budget neutrality factor.) We note that, for this notice, we are continuing to use a wage index based on 1982 wage data as our basis of comparison in determining budget neutrality. Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ifi) of the Act specifies the use of the applicable hospital wage index for establishing the cost limits for HHAs. Since the passage of OBRA '90, the applicable hospital wage indices that we have used to establish the HHA cost limits have been indices based on 1982 and 1988 hospital wage data. (In accordance with section 4207(d)(3) of OBRA '90, the wage indices that have applied to HHAs were calculated based on blends of the 1982 and 1988 hospital wage data and now based on 1988 data entirely.) We have not used the blended wage index as the basis of comparison in determining the budget neutrality adjustment because the blended index was artificially derived from the 1982 and 1988 wage data. The transition (blended) wage index was for the benefit of the home health agencies, so those agencies whose payments were adversely effected by the change to the wage index based on 1988 wage data could make a gradual adjustment to the full implementation of the wage index values. Because the blended wage index was only a temporary transitional measure from the index based on 1982 wage data to the index based on 1988 wage data, and because the index based on 1982 wage data was the basic underlying value, we believe that it is appropriate to calculate the budget neutrality adjustment by comparing the index based on 1982 wage data with the index base# on 1988 wage data. Beginning in FY 1994, however, section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that the hospital wage index be updated annually. Therefore, in setting future ' HHA limits, our basis of comparison for the budget neutrality adjustment will be the current hospital wage index and the hospital wage index used in the previous HHA notice. Accordingly, we anticipate that in next year's HHA notice, the budget neutrality factor will reflect a comparison of the FY 1994 hospital wage index (based on 1990 survey data) with the FT 1993 wage index (based on 1988 survey data). As discussed above, the wage index applicable to HHAs is different from the hospital wage index because the HHA wage index does not reflect geographic reclassifications of hospitals.m. Update of Limits The methodology used to develop the schedule of limits set forth in this notice is the same as that used in setting the limits effective July 1, 1992. As discussed in the July 1, 1992 notice (57 FR 29411), we will continue to use the latest settled cost report data to develop the HHA cost limits. The cost limits have been updated to reflect the expected cost increases occurring between the cost reporting periods for the data contained in the data base and December 31,1993, the midpoint of the first cost reporting period to which the limits apply. A. Data Used To develop the schedule of limits effective July 1, 1992, we extracted actual cost per-visit data from settled Medicare cost reports for periods ending on or after October 31, 1987, and before October 1, 1988. We then adjusted the data using the latest available market basket indexes to reflect expected cost increases occurring between the cost reporting periods contained in our data base and December 31, 1992. In this notice, we have updated the limits by using the data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1989. and before May 31, 1991, as adjusted by the most recent market basket factors, to reflect expected cost increases occurring between the cost reporting periods contained in the data base and December 31, 1993, the midpoint of the first cost reporting period to which these July 1, 1993 limits apply. Even though these are the most recent data available at this time, we recognize that the provisions of section 1891(a)(3) of the Act, which require changes in home health aide training and certification effective July 1, 1989, will result in some HHAs incurring costs that will not be reflected in the cost limits. It is not possible for us to estimate the overall impact, if any, this provision will have on an HHA's total costs. However, if the additional home health training and certification requirements result in an HHA's costs exceeding the cost limits, the HHA may present documentation justifying payment of additional amounts in excess of the cost limits, as we indicated in our June 30, 1989 notice concerning HHA cost limits (54 FR 27742), under the exceptions process outlined in \u00a7 413.30. When HCFA updates the HHA cost limits in the future, using a later data base that Includes the costs of home health training and certification requirements, an add-on will no longer be needed because the updated limitswould include those costs in the basic cost limits. In addition, we also are aware that HHAs will be incurring additional costs due to the universal precaution requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). OSHA published a final rule in the Federal Register on December 6,1991 (56 FR 64004) that set forth a standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C 655) to eliminate. or minimize, occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The rule includes requirements relating to employee vaccinations against bloodborne diseases, staff training on universal precautions, and the use of protective equipment (gloves, aprons, masks, etc.). While the limits set forth in this notice use the most recent cost report data available, we recognize that the OSHA standards, which were effective March 6, 1992, will result in some HHAs incurring costs that are not reflected in the cost limits. In the July 1, 1992 notice (as corrected at 57 FR 43004 (September 17, 1992)) we provided an add-on to the HHA cost limits of $.16 per visit for those HHAs that incurred costs associated with the additional requirements of the OSHA regulation. The add-on was necessary because the data base used to calculate the HHA cost limit did not reflect the costs associated with the new OSHA requirements. In this notice, we will continue to provide an add-on to the cost limits to account for the additional costs HHAs will incur due to the universal precaution requirements. Based upon our review of the OSHA regulation. OSHA data, and additional information obtained from OSHA staff. we have determined that for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1993. HHAs will incur average costs of $18 per visit in meeting the OSHA requirements. We determined this amount by inflating $.16 (the per- visit add-on for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1992) by the HHA market basket index described in this notice. Thus, we are providing for an add-on to the HHA cost limits of $.18 per visit for those HHAs that incur costs associated with the additional requirements of the OSHA regulation. if, as a result of the additional OSHA requirements, an HHA's costs still exceed the cost limits after the add-on. the HHA may apply for an exception to the cost limits under the exceptions process outlined in \u00a7 413.30. This situation could be recognized as an \"extraordinary circumstance\" as defined at \u00a7 413.30(f)(2). We will grant an exception to the extent that the costs.36749 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices in excess of the limit, are reasonable; incurred in the implementation of the additional requirements; separately identified by the HHA; and verified by the intermediary. As with home health training and certification requirements, we anticipate that using a later data base that includes the costs of complying with the OSHA standards eventually will preclude the need for an add-on. B. Wage Index The wage index is used to adjust the labor-related portion of the limits, and the administrative and general (A&G) add-on, to reflect aiffering wage levels among areas. In setting this schedule of limits, we used the HCFA FY 1993 hospital wage index that was developed based on 1988 hospital salary data. Each HHA's labor market area is determined based on the definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). We note that on December 28, 1992, OMB announced in OMB bulletin 93-05 the revised statistical definitions for metropolitan areas based on the results of the 1990 census. The revised definitions were effective on December 31, 1992. However, as noted above, section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Act requires that we use the current hospital wage index (that is, the FY 1993 hospital wage index, which was published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1992 (57 FR 39746)) to establish the HHA cost limits. Therefore, this schedule of limits reflects the MSA definitions that are in effect under the hospital prospective payment system. We now plan to implement OMB's revised MSA definitions based on the 1990 census data in the schedule of HHA cost limits that is to take effecton July 1, 1994. We are continuing to incorporate exceptions to the MSA classification system for certain New England counties that were identified in the July 1, 1992 notice. These exceptions have been recognized in setting hospital cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on and after July 1, 1979 (45 FR 41218), and were authorized under section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21). Section 601(g) of Public Law 98-21 requires that any hospital in New England that was classified as being in an urban area under the classification system in effect in 1979 will be considered urban for the purposes of the hospital prospective payment system. This provision is intended to ensureequitable treatment under the hospital prospective payent system. Under this authority, the foll owing counties have been deemed to be urban areas for purposes of payment under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system: * Litchfield County, CT in the Hartford, CT MSA. o York County, ME and Sagadahoc County, ME in the Portland, ME MSA. e Merrimack County, NH in the Boston-Brockton-Nashua, MA-NH MSA. o Newport County, RI in the Providence-Fall River-Warwick, RI MSA. We are continuing to grant these urban exceptions for the purpose of applying the HCFA hospital wage index to the HHA cost limits. These exceptions result in the same New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA) definitions for hospitals, SNFs, and HHAs. In New England, MSAs are defined on town boundaries rather than on county lines. NECMAs are defined on county lines but exclude parts of the four counties cited above that would be considered urban under the MSA definition. Under this notice, those four counties are urban under either definition, NECMA or MSA. We note that HCFA is considering a proposal from the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) to establish hospital-specific wage index values that would not rely on the use of MSAs and NECMAs. A full description of the ProPAC proposal is set forth in the hospital prospective payment system (PPS) proposed rule for FY 1994 (See May 26, 1993 Federal Register, 58 FR 30222.) It is unclear what the impact of ProPAC's proposal would be for the establishment of HHA cost limits. However, we have indicated in the prospective payment system proposed rule that under no circumstances would we propose to implement this change before FY 1995; therefore, it has no effect on this notice. IV. Provisions of the HHA Schedule of Limits The schedule of limits set faith below was calculated using 112 percent of the mean per-visit costs of free-standing HHAs and is adjusted by the latest estimates in the market basket index. The schedule of limits effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1993 is based on the latest settled cost data available and provides for the following: e A classification system based on whether an HHA is located within anMSA, a NECMA, or a non-MSA area. (See Tables Ula and HIb in section VIII, below, for the listing of MSAs, NECMAs, and rural areas.) e The use of a single schedule of limits for hospital-based and free- standing agencies. This single limit is based on the cost experience of free- standing agencies. For each hospital- based discipline, we are providing for an add-on adjustment to the free- standing HHA limit (which is equal to 11.4 percent of the mean cost for the MSA hospital-based group and 12.5 percent for the non-MSA hospital-based group) to account for the hiher administrative and general (A&G) costs resulting from Medicare cost allocation requirements, as explained in section VI.C below. The labor-related portion of the add-on, adjusted by the appropriate wage index, plus the nonlabor portion, is added to each free-standing limit to determine the per discipline limits for hospital-based agencies. We are currently evaluating the utility of differential payments to home health agencies. * The use of the following market basket index, which was developed from the price of goods and services purchased by HHAs to account for the impact of changing wage and price levels on HHA costs. The limit values contained in this schedule reflect the latest available actual and projected rates of inflation in HHA expenses. The categories used were identified through an analysis of 1976 Medicare cost reports and other available home health industry surveys. The categories of expenses are weighted according to the estimated proportion of HHA costs attributable to each category. The categories used in the market basket contained in this schedule have not changed from those used for the July 1, 1992 schedule. However, the relative cost shares used change over time because of differences in the rate of increase in the various price variables. Categories with higher rates of price increases receive higher weights and categories with lower rates of price increases receive lower weights. In developing the relative weights used in the market basket index contained in this schedule, we obtained historical and projected rates of increase in the resource prices for each category. The price variables source of the forecast for calendar years 1989 through 1995 is identified in the third column of the following Home Health Agency Input Price Index chart.36750 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices HOME HEALTH AGENCY INPUT PRICE INDEX: COST CATEGORIES, RELATIVE IMPORTANCE, FORECASTERS, AND PRICE VARIABLES USED Relative I ForecasterCost categories p of2 percent Price variables used1994 (1986-1995) Wages and Salaries 68.6 DRI-CFS Average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory private hospital workers (SIC 806).

The wage index is used to adjust the labor-related portion of the limits and the A&G add-on to reflect differing wage levels among the areas (MSA or NECMA and non-MSA) in which HHAs are located, The employee wage portion of the market basket index (68.6 percent) and the employee benefits portion (7.6 percent), plus a factor representing a proportionate share of contract services (5.6 percent), are used to determine the labor component (81.8 percent) of all HHA per-visit costs used to set the limits. Separate treatment of the labor- related and nonlabor components of per-visit costs. The separate components of costs are calculated by obtaining actual HHA cost data for each agency for cost periods ending on or after June 30. 1989 and before May 31, 1991, and increasing those data by the actual and projected increases in the HHA market basket index. We then separate each HHA's per-visit costs into labor and nonlabor portions, and divide the labor portion by the wage index value for the agency's location to control for the effect of geographic variations in prevailing wage levels. Separate means arecomputed for the labor and nonlabor components of per-visit costs. For each comparison group, the resulting amounts are shown in Table I of section VII, below. * The application of a cost-of living adjustment to the nonlabor portion of the limit for HHAs located in Alaska, Hawaii. Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. e Limits that are determined for the per-visit cost of each type of home ealth service: skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech pathology, occupation therapy, medical social services, and home health aide. Application of the limits in the aggregate after the HHA's actual costs are adjusted. An HHA's actual costs are adjusted for individual items of cost that are found to be excessive under Medicare principles of provider payment and for costs that are not included in the limitation amount. The limits are applied in the aggregate to the costs remaining after these adjustments are made. Payment is limited to the lower of the actual costs or the cost limits. V. Methodology for Determining Cost- per-Visit Limits A. Data For this notice, the cost-per-visit limit values were determined by extracting settled actual cost-per-visit data fromMedicare cost reports for periods ending on or after June 30, 1989, and before May 31, 1991. We then adjusted the data using the latest available market basket factors to reflect expected cost increases occurring between the cost reporting periods contained in our data base and December 31, 1993, the midpoint of the first cost reporting period to which these limits apply. The following annual percentage increases were used to compute the per-visit costs: Calendar year PercentIncrease 1990 ...................... 15.3 1991 ............................................. 15.7 1992 .............................................. 2 4.1 1993 .............................................. 2 4.8 1994 .............................................. 2 5.1 1995 .............................................. 2 5.3 I Fnal rate of Increase. 2Forecasted Increases. The projected rate of Increase In the market basket Index will be adjusted to the actual Inflation rate If the actual rate of Increase differs from the estimated rate by more than 3110 of one percentage point. We will notify the Medicare Intermediaries of the actual rate of Increase and advise them to adjust each HHA's cost limit. B. Standardization for Wage Levels After adjustment by the market basket index, we divided each HHA's per-visit costs into labor and nonlabor portions. The labor portion of costs (81.8 percent36751 n Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices as determined by the market basket) represents the 76.2 percent employee wage and benefit factor plus the 5.6 percent contract services factor from the market basket. We then divided the labor portion of per-visit costs by the wage index applicable to the HHA's location to arrive at an adjusted labor cost. C. Adjustment for \"Outliers\" We transformed all per-visit cost data into their natural logarithms and grouped them by type of service and MSA, NECMA, or non-MSA location, in order to determine the mean cost and standard deviation for each group. We then eliminated all \"outlier\" costs, retaining only those per-visit costs within two standard deviations of the mean in each service. D. Basic Service Limit A basic service limit equal to 112 percent of the mean labor and nonlabor portions of the per-visit costs of free- standing HHAs was calculated for each type of service. (See Table I in section VII.) VI. Computing the Adjusted Limit 3. Adjustment of Cost Limits by Wage Index To arrive at the adjusted limit, which is to be applied to each service furnished by an HHA, the HHA's intermediary first determines the adjusted labor-related component by multiplying the labor-related component of the limit by the appropriate wage index. (See example below and Tables la and [1b in section VIII.) The sum of the nonlabor component plus the labor-related component is the adjusted limit applicable to an HHA.

Computation of Revised Lim Occupational Therapy Adjusted per-visit limit .... Adjustment factor from Table IV ......................... Revised per-visit limit In this example, the revised I per-visit limit for occupational applicable to this HHA for the reporting period beginning Jan 1994, is $94.39 per visit. If an HHA uses a cost reporti that is not 12 months in durati special calculation of the adjus factor must be made. This resu the fact that projections are con the midpoint of the cost report period. For cost reporting peric than 12 months in duration, th calculation must be made for U midpoint of the specific cost re period. In such cases, the inter for the HHA must obtain this adjustment factor from HCFA.~ar ag period 1993, each V that year in1 ha~anaC. Adjustment for Hospital-Based Agencies If an HHA participates in the Medicare program as part of a hospital and is required to file Form HCFA-2552 (hospital cost report), and qualifies as hospital-based in accordance with the requirements specified in the schedule of limits published June 5, 1980 (45 FR 38014), the HHA is entitled, under section 1861(v)(1)(L)(ii) of the Act, to an adjustment of the per-visit limit to account for higher A&G costs resulting from the Medicare cost allocation requirements. The intermediary will compute the adjusted cost limit as described in the example following Table 11, section VII. pounded VII. Schedule of Limits id from The schedule of limits set forth below n the applies to cost reporting periods d to beginning on or after July 1, 1993 and at will before July 1, 1994.

The HHA costs that are subject to the $92.05 limits include the cost of medical supplies routinely furnished in xl.0254 conjunction with patient care. Durable medical equipment, orthotics, 94.39 prosthetics, and other medical supplies directly identifiable as services to an adjusted individual patient are excluded from the therapy per-visit costs and are paid without cost regard to this schedule of limits.

IX. Regulatory Impact Statement and Wage Flexbility Analysis Index 9 A. Executive Order 12291.9508 (1) Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires .8289 us to prepare and publish a regulatory .8371 Impact analysis for any final notice that .7992 meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for .7688 a \"major rule\"; that is, that will be likely .8438 to result in- .7384 * An annual effect on the economy of .8620 $100 million or more; 2.43168 A major increase in costs or prices (1) for consumers, individual industries, .7678 Federal, State or local government .7179 agencies, or geographic regions; or .7316 * Significant adverse effects on .7578 competition, employment, investment, .8977 productivity, innovation, or on the.7784 ability of United States-based 21.0000 enterprises to compete with foreign- .9597 based enterprises in domestic or export .8482 markets. .8459 As discussed below, we have .8423 determined that the implementation of classified the new HHA cost limits set forth in this final notice will have an impact of more than $100 million in FY 1994. Thus, consistent with the requirements of E.O. YEAR 12291, we are providing a regulatory impact analysis. We note, however, that section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act (as he adjust- amended by section 4207(d) of OBRA ent factor '90) requires that the Secretary establish Is new HHA cost limits on July 1, 1991, 1.0042 and annually thereafter, and also 1.0085 requires that we use the current hospital 1.0126 wage index to establish the limits. 1.0169 Section 4207(d) of OBRA '90 also 1.0211 requires that the wage index be applied 1.0254 on a budget neutral basis. Moreover, 1.0299 section 1861(v)(1)(L)(i) of the Act 1.0340 specifies that the cost limits are not to 1.0385 1.0430 exceed 112 percent of the mean per-visit 1.0475 costs of free-standing HHAs. Thus, short of developing an entirely different ad market approach to paying for HHA costs it for 1994 (which would require new legislation), there are no alternatives available for subject consideration other than implementing tes of the payment methodology and limits set forth in this notice. iblish a This notice sets forth HHA cost limits active on for cost reporting periods beginning on e other or after July 1, 1993. As required by iby that section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act, we 'tinue in are using the current hospital wage ,actor index to calculate the HHA cost limits, ce for that is, the hospital wage index effective 94 and for discharges on or after October 1, porting 1992, which is based on 1988 wage dule of survey data. The wage index is used to ed. For adjust the labor-related portion of the od limits, and the administrative and 75 will be general (A&G) add-on, to reflect d the differing wage levels among areas. AsFederal ReeJster / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices 36760 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices discussed in detail in section II of this notice, we are applying a budget neutrality adjustment factor of 1.027 to the labor-related portion of the limits to ensure that aggregate payments to HHAs are not affected by changes to the wage index. The methodology used to develop the schedule of limits set forth in this notice is the same as that used in setting the limits effective July 1, 1992. As required by section 1861(v)(L)(i) of the Act, we calculate the cost limits based based on the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per visits costs for free- standing home health agencies. As discussed in the July 1, 1992 notice (57 FR 29411), we will continue to use the latest settled cost report data to develop the HHA cost-per-visit limit values for each type of home health service: skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech pathology, occupational therapy, medical social services, and home health aide. Thus, for this notice, we have updated the cost-per-visit limits by using the data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1989, and before May 31, 1991. The data have been adjusted by the most recent market basket factors to reflect the expected cost increases occurring between the cost repotting periods for the data contained in the data base and December 31, 1993, the midpoint of the. first cost reporting period to which the limits apply. The intermediary determines the aggregate cost limit for each HHA by multiplying the number of Medicare visits for each type of service furnished by the HHA by the respective per-visit cost limit. Each HHA's aggregate limit cannot be determined prospectively, but depends on each HHA's Medicare visits for each type of service and actual costs for the cost reporting period subject to this notice. For this year's notice, the conversion from approximately 49 intermediaries to 9 regional intermediaries, coupled with the additional training of providers and intermediaries in the documenting, submittal, and review of cost reports, has resulted in tighter management controls over the cost reporting data than in past years and, we believe, more accurate data. The database used to calculate these limits consists of cost reporting data from 2600 freestanding HHAs, compared with 2389 freestanding HHAs used in calculating last year's limits. Based on this new, more extensive, and more accurate cost data, the cost-per-visit limits have increased for some services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, medical social services), but ave decreased for the two highestvolume service categories, skilled nursing care and home health aide. We have incorporated the changes to the wage index and the updated cost report data in calculating a new set of HHA cost limits. We estimate that the revised HHA cost limits implemented in this notice with public comment period will result in the following savings to the Medicare program: TABLE 1-HHA COST LIMITS (MEDICARE PROGRAM SAVINGS)1 Fiscal yr Savings (Inmillions) 1994 .......................................... 140 1995 ...................................... . 55 1 Figures are rounded to the nearest million. The savings associated with the new HHA cost limits represent the difference between projected aggregate Medicare HHA expenditures under the new limits and projected aggregate Medicare HHA expenditures using last year's limits udated by the market basket increase. These savings are not the result of any changes in payment or coverage policy. Rather, the estimated aggregate savings in FY 1994 expenditures are attributable to two factors: expected significant growth in overall Medicare HHA expenditures in FY 1994, combined with the use of more accurate cost data in developing the limits. (We note that these new cost. limits will also result in aggregate savings of $4 million during the last quarter of FY 1993. The estimated aggregate savings in FY 1993 expenditures are negligible because relatively few HHA cost reporting periods begin during this period.) Aggregate payments are not affected by changes to the wage index, since section 4207(d)(2) of OBRA '90 mandates that these changes be budget neutral. As discussed above, section 1861(v)(1){L)(iii) of the Act requires that we establish new HHA limits annually. Moreover, section 1861(v)(1)(L)(i) of the Act specifies that these limits be calculated based on the mean per-visit costs for free-standing HHAs, and we believe that we have an obligation to calculate these costs using the most accurate cost reporting data available. Thus, neither the implementation of the new limits nor the method by which we develop the limits is discretionary. It is important to recognize that the\"savings\" indicated in Table I represent an aggregate impact of only about I percent of the projected Medicare HHA expenditures of $13.6 billion in FY \"1994. As shown in Table 2 below, the proportional effect of the cost limits hasremained relatively constant in recent years. TABLE 2-PROPORTIONAL IMPACT OF UPDATED COST LIMITS ON MEDI- CARE HHA EXPENDITURES Cost reporting pe- Percentage Impact for rod effective cost reporting period 711/89-6/30/90 ...... 1.5 percent (savings). 7/11/90-6/30/91 ...... 0.76 percent (savings). 7/1/93-W/30/94 ...... 1.49 percent (savings). However, while the proportional impact of the annual update to the HHA cost limits has remained stable, the aggregate costs or savings associated with the revised limits have increased substantially, due to sustained large growth in HHA expenditures. For example, Medicare HHA expenditures have increased more than fourfold over the last 4 years (from $2.3 billion in FY 89 to a projected $10.7 billion in FY 93), and we project that this growth rate will continue at least through FY 94. Thus, smallchanges in the market basket factors used to adjust the limits now can result in significant spending shifts. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HHAs are treated as small entities. We are providing a voluntary regulatory flexibility analysis for this notice because of the large number of HHAs that will be affected, even though the overall impact of the notice is expected to be approximately 1 percent and we have no evidence that the economic Impact on most HHAs will be significant. Normally, a regulatory flexibility analysis requires the agency to discuss various alternatives to the provisions in a notice such as this. As discussed above, however, HCFA is merely implementing the provisions of section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act. Accordingly, no alternatives to the provisions in this notice with comment are available. We are unable to identify the effects of changes to the cost limits on individual HHAs. Both changes in the cost data and changes to the wage index contribute to changes in the cost limits for individual HHAs, although we cannot isolate the separate impact of these factors.36761 Federal Rogister / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices The model used for purposes of our analysis was based upon data from 4.199 home health agencies, of which 1,575 (38 percent) were at or over the cost limits. A breakdown of the home health agencies used in the model and the impact of the revised cost limits is as follows: Number Number of agen- Hospital-based ......... 1599 774 Again, we do not have sufficient data to predict exactly which HHAs will be most affected by this notice nor the magnitude of the impact upon individual HHAs. As noted above, each HHA's aggregate limit depends on the number of its Medicare visits for each type of service and its actual costs for the cost reporting period subject to this notice. Thus, whether or not a given HHA exceeds its cost limit is determined largely by the types and number of services it furnishes, and we are not able to make such a determination prospectively for individual HHAs. However, it is clear that individual HHAs will be affected to a greater or lesser degree depending upon the extent to which their total payment is derived from Medicare. C. Impact on Small Rural Hospitals Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (the RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside an MSA. We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final notice will not have a significanteconomic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. X. Other Required Information A. Waiver of Proposed Notice In adopting notices, such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the Federal Register with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. As we discussed in section III above, we have used the same methodology to develop the schedule of limits that was used in setting the limits published on July 1, 1992. The cost limits have been updated to reflect the cost increases occurring between the cost reporting periods for the data contained in the data base and December 31, 1993. In addition, as required under section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Act, we have updated the wage index, using the current hospital wage index, so that it is based entirely on 1988 data. Because the methodology used to develop this schedule of limits was previously published for public comment and because we are required by section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act to use the current hospital wage index, which is based on 1988 wage survey data, we believe that it would be impracticable and unnecessary to request public comment before implementation of these cost limits. To do so would be contrary to the public Interest. Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed notice. B. Waiver of 30-Day Delay in Effective Date We normally provide a delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, if adherence to this procedure would be impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, we may waive the delay in the effective date. Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act requires that the Secretary establish revised HHA cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1991 and annually thereafter. Also, as required by section1861(v)(1)(L)(iii) of the Act, we are using the current hospital wage index, that is, the hospital wage index for fiscal year 1993, which is based on 1988 wage survey data. If HHAs are to receive timely the benefits of the cost limits that are based on the updated wage index, it is necessary that these limits be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1993. Thus, we believe that a delay in the effective date of these cost limits would be contrary to the public interest. Therefore, we find good cause to waive the usual 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice with comment period. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This final notice does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it does not need to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). D. Public Comments Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a notice with comment period, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments concerning the Srovisions of this notice that we receive y the date and time specified in the \"DATES\" section of this notice, and, if changes are made in another notice, we will respond to these comments in that notice.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Federal Election Commission requests comments on proposed revisions to its regulations governing the compliance process under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (hereinafter \"the Act\" or \"FECA\"). The proposed changes would address issues that have arisen since these rules were last amended in 1980. They are intended to streamline and clarify several aspects of the compliance process. Please note that the draft rules which follow do not represent a final decision by the Commission on the issues presented in this rulemaking. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 24, 1993. The Commission will hold a public hearing on these proposed regulations at 10 a.m. on October 20, 1993, if requests to testify are received. Persons wishing to testify at the hearing must so indicate In their written comments. ADDRESSES: Comments must le in writing and should be sent to: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463. The hearing will be held in the Commission's ninth floor hearing room, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC. All comments received will be available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Records Office, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT, Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463, (202) 219-3690 or (800) 424-9530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is seeking public comments on proposed revisions to 11 CFR part 111 regarding the operation of the enforcement process, and on conforming amendments to 11 CFR 4.4, 5.4, 7.14 and 102.3. The proposed changes are intended to resolve several Issues which have arisen since these regulations were last revised pursuant to the 1979 Amendments to the Act. The major topics under consideration concern the requirements for filing and amending complaints, the policy regarding extensions of time, making findings against treasurers of political committees, the reporting of funds usedto pay civil penalties, oral enforcement hearings, and the handling of enforcement matters that result in civillitigation. n May 22, 1985, the Commission published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"ANPRM\") in the Federal Register (50 FR 21077) seeking public comments on four general issues that could be addressed in a revision of the regulations and also requesting suggestions for revisions concerning other aspects of Part 111. The four issues raised by the Advance Notice were: (1) Providing respondents with the legal and factual basis for Commission \"reason to believe\" findings in externally generated complaints; (2) requests for extensions of time; (3) naming committee treasurers as respondents; and (4) procedures for requesting a stay of a final determination on repayment of Federal funds pending a petition for review. The Commission received four comments in response to the ANPRM, which are discussed more fully below. The comments have been helpful to the Commission In formulating the draft rules which follow regarding the first three of these topics. Rules regarding stays of final repayment determinations were subsequently included in revisions to 11 CFR 9007.5 and 9038.5. See Explanation and Justification, 52 FR 20864 (une 3, 1987). The Commission is now seeking comments on both the proposed regulations which follow and on the compliance process, generally, including any issues not covered by the proposed regulations. A summary of the more significant proposed revisions follows. A. Computation of Time The attached draft of \u00a7 111.2(a) would add the Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. to the list of legal holidays. In addition, the computation of time provision would be revised to exclude Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays when a period of time prescribed by these regulations is less than eleven days, rather than the current seven days. See attached proposed 11 CFR 111.2(b). Both of these proposals would conform to revisions to Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. F.R.C.P. 6(a), as amended April 29, 1985. Section 111.2(c) currently adds an additional three days to time periods whenever documents are served by mail. This three day period does not include Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. New language would be added to this section to establish a presumption that the paper was received and service was accomplishedat the end of this time period. Please note, however, that the three day rule does not apply to situations where the time runs from the actual date of receipt of a document, such as the deadline for filing a brief under 11 CFR 111.16(c). Proposed paragraph (a) of 11 CFR 111.6 would change that time in which a respondent may file a response to a complaint from within 15 days of receiving the complaint to within 15 days from service of a copy of the complaint. Three days would be added if the complaint is served by mail under proposed \u00a7 111.2(c). The revisions to 11 CFR 111.2 would also clarify when a document is considered to be submitted to the Commission for purposes of time limits specified in 11 CFR part 111. New paragraph (d) would indicate that a document is considered to be submitted on the day it is actually received by the Commission. However, comments are sought on whether three extra days should be added to cover situations where respondents mail documents to the Commission. This would result in different time frames for documents that are mailed and those that are hand delivered, or sent by an overnight delivery service or by facsimile machine. B. Procedures for Filing and Amending Complaints and Notifying Respondents The Commission proposes several revisions to streamline and.clarify the procedures involved in filing complaints. First, new language would be included in \u00a7 111.3 (a) and (b) to more fully explain the ways in which compliance matters are initiated. These include referrals from other Federal and state agencies and sua sponte compliance matters. The revisions would clarify that an individual or political committee may notify the Commission in writing that he or she or the committee has committed a violation of the FECA. Comments are requested as to whether additional enforcement-related materials can and should be sent to candidates when their campaign committees are involved in compliance matters. Currently, candidates are sent courtesy copies of complaints and internally generated reason to believe findings. The question is whether to send them additional documents, such as the General Counsel's briefs, probable cause findings, proposed conciliation agreements and notices of authorization to file suit. The difficulty, however, is that the confidentiality provisions of the Act and the attorney/client privilege may not permit such disclosure when the candidate has not been named as a36764 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules respondent. The proposed rules which follow do not incorporate these proposals. The Commission is proposing to revise \u00a7 111.4(a) to provide that submitted complaints be originals, not photocopies or facsimiles. Originals are needed to ensure that the complaint is proprly signed and notarized, and is lible. In addition. S 111.4(b)(2) would specify that the jurat shall state that the complaint was both sworn and subscribed. These changes are intended to decrease the number of improperly filed complaints. A revision to \u00a7 111.4(d)(1) is proposed to encourage complainants to include, when possible, the addresses of respondents of facilitate initial complaint processing. Paragraph (d)(4) would also be revised to encourage complainants to submit originals, rather than copies, of documentation supportinq their allegations. In addition, a new paragraph (e) is proposed to set forth the Commission s policy of considering complaints based on news stories when sufficient facts are presented to satisfy the requirements of 11 CFR 111.4(d), regarding the basis for the complainant's charges. Such complaints must also comply with the notarization requirements of 11 CFR 111.4(b). One comment received in response to the ANPRM suggested that real corroborating evidence be submitted in addition to the article or that the article should set forth specific facts rather than general allegations, New \u00a7 111.4(e) is intended to address those concerns. The Commission also requests comments on the advisability of seeking clarification of a complaint or response prior to finding reason to believe, when clarification is needed. Please note that FEC Directive 6 sets forth the Commission's established procedures for Internally generating compliance matters on the basis of news articles. Comments are sought as to whether persons mentioned in news stories should be accorded an opportunity to respond to the allegations prior to the Commission's decision to find reason to believe. Currently, in these internally generated MURs, respondents do not have an opportunity to reply to the Commission regarding allegations made in the new articles until after the reason to believe finding is made. New \u00a7 111.4(1) would explain how a complainant may submit additional information after having filed a complaint. One comment on the ANPRM suggested that the rules should contain standards and procedures for determining whether the respondent is entitled to an additional opportunity torespond to new charges. Consequently, the Commission is now proposing that the nature of the additional information submitted should determine whether the Act's notification and response time provisions are triggered by the submission. If the additional information submitted by the complainant describes alleged violations of the FECA or Commission regulations which were not implicated by the original complaint, or if the additional information identifies individuals or entities not implicated by the original complaint, then the additional information would be treated as an amended complaint. Under the proposed rules, an amended complaint would have to comply with the requirements for filing original complaints (such as being sworn to and notarized) and would be subject to the provisions regarding initial complaint processing, notification, and the opportunity to demonstrate that no action should be taken on that complaint-generated matter. On the other hand, if the additional information submitted by the complainant relates solely to the statutes or regulations implicated by the original complaint and to the persons or entities who, according to the original complaint, were alleged to have committed such violations, the additional information would be treated as supplemental information. Under the proposed rules, a submission of supplemental information is treated as new evidence, and need not conform to the requirements of 11 CFR 111.4 (a), (b) or (d) regarding the number of copies filed, notarization, and the inclusion of information regarding the complainant and the respondent which is already provided in the original complaint. Nor would supplemental information be subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 111.5 and 111.6 regarding initial complaint processing, timing of notification, and the opportunity to demonstrate that no action should be taken. Thus, complainants would be able to provide the Commission with supplemental information after having filed the original complaint, but the submission would not trigger the initial complaint notification process again and the supplemental information would not be sent to the respondents. The Commission seeks comments on the appropriateness of this procedure. Proposed new S 111.4(g) covers situations where the Commission must resolve similar, but separate, enforcement matters that would individually consume substantial time and resources. The proposed new language would explicitly allow theconsolidation or severance of compliance matters which involve: (1) The same respondents; (2) substantially the same issues; (3) common questions of law or fact; or (4) other factors which would warrant a determination by the Commission that such matters should be joined or severed, such as the avoidance of unnecessary costs or delays of time. The Commission also seeks comments on a proposed change that would delete the requirement to notify those named in an Improper complaint filed with the Commission. See proposed 11 CFR 111.5(b). The resources currently devoted to notifications of improper complaints are significant, especially considering that many improper complaints are never corrected and resubmitted. The legislative history of the 1979 Amendments to the FECA suggests that such notifications are not required. HR. Rep. No. 96-422, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 20 (1979). The Commission is considering however, providing copies of improper complaints to the respondents upon request. Finally, the Commission notes that if a complaint does not mention a particular person, that person may not named as a respondent initially, and will not receive a copy of the complaint. If that person Is subs ently named as an internally-generated respondent, comments are sought as to whether the person should be sent a copy of the complaint at that point. C. The Reason To Believe Finding; Notification; Reconsideration The Commission proposes moving a sentence from \u00a7 111.8(b) to \u00a7 111.9(a) to provide that all Commission reason to believe notifications will include the legal basis and the alleged facts which support the Commission's action. This revision would reflect changes in Commission procedure. Previously, a copy of the factual and legal analysis was only included in notifications sent in internally generated matters, as required by the Act. Proposed \u00a7 111.9(a) would reflect that factual and legal analyses are now sent to respondents in complaint-generated matters as well. The change in this procedure was discussed in the ANPRM and supported by several commenters. It is intended to provide all respondents with a clearer understanding of the factual and legal basis for the Commission's action, and should help respondents to respond directly to the alleged violations at issue. Another change in \u00a7 111.8(a) would clarify that reason to believe determinations may be made after consideration of a Commissioner'sI I I36765 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed .Rules motion to find reason to believe or no reason to believe. The current language only mentions Commission determinations made after reviewing the General Counsel's recommendation in internally-generated matters. Similar language would also be included in\u00a7 111.9(a). Proposed new \u00a7 111.9(b) would provide that the Commission will not entertain a respondent's request for reconsideration or rescission of a reason to believe determination, except in cases where a incurable procedural defect has occurred. Examples of incurable procedural defects include situations where the respondent was never served, or where reason to believe was found against the wrong person who happened to have the same name as the person named in the complaint. This proposal would help to insure that the compliance process moves in an efficient and timely manner. The Commission wants to make clear, however, that a refusal to entertain other requests for reconsideration or rescission does not deny respondents the opportunity to demonstrate that they did not commit the alleged violations. Respondents would continue to have opportunities throughout the compliance process to demonstrate that they did not commit the alleged violations. For example, respondents have an opportunity to reply to the charges made in the complaint. If the matter is internally generated, ordinarily there are also opportunities to respond to the concerns raised prior to the reason to believe determination. If the Commission finds reason to believe, but takes no further action, comments are sought as to whether to incorporate into the rules the current practice of permitting respondents to place a statement on the public record. Respondents may also have the opportunity to refute the charges during the investigation and in their probable cause briefs. Thus, requests for reconsideration or rescission would only duplicate the arguments to be presented to the Commission during and after the investigation. D. Investigation In general, the Commission may conduct an investigation in any case in which it finds reason to believe that a violation of the Act or regulations has occurred or is about to occur. Proposed changes to 11 CFR 111.10(a) would clarify that the Commission need not conduct further inquiries when information which is contained in the Commission's records or which was already made available by the respondent makes additional inquiryunwarranted. This proposed addition would promote a more efficient use of the Commission's time and resources under such circumstances. Further, it would reduce the burden which an additional inquiry would place on respondents. Please note that under both the current and the proposed versions of \u00a7 111.7(b), the General Counsel may recommend and the Commission may approve the dismissal of a complaint at any point before or after finding reason to believe, when warranted by the facts and circumstances of the case. Proposed amendments to 11 CFR 111.9(a) and 111.10(a) would also reflect that, in an appropriate case, the Commission may send a respondent a letter of admonishment, or may exercise its prosecutorial discretion by taking no further action after making, a reason to believe finding. Similarly, new language at 11 CFR 111.17(a) would indicate that after a probable cause to believe finding in an appropriate case, the Commission may send admonishment letters to respondents which warn against specific activities which constitute violations of the FECA or Commission regulations. New language in \u00a7 111.10(b) would let respondents know that investigations may begin immediately after the Commission makes a reason to believe finding. This is intended to further the timely resolution of compliance matters. E. Subpoenas and Depositions The Commission is proposing several amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 111.12 through 111.15 to address difficulties that it has experienced while conducting investigations to alleged FECA violations. For example, questions have arisen as to who may be present during a deposition. Consequently, language would be added to 11 CFR 111.12(b) stating that no person other than the witness and his or her counsel, the stenographic reporter, and members of the Commission staff shall be present or represented when a deposition is taken during the course of a Commission investigation. This proposed addition is based on the well established principle that the Constitutional rights of those being investigated by an agency do not include the right to confront witnesses or the right to be notified when the agency uses subpoenas to gather evidence adverse to the target of the investigation. E.g., S.E.C. v. O'Brien, 467 U.S. 735, 742 (1984); Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420 (1960). However, advance arrangements could continue to be made to accommodate those uncommon situations where the deponent needs theassistance of an interpreter or a personal attendant for medical reasons. The Commission has also had some difficulties with service of documents in compliance matters where political committees have failed to note changes in their addresses and their treasurers or assistant treasurers on their Statements of Organization, as required by 11 CFR 102.2(a)(2). The Commission is proposing to add a new paragraph (e) to section 111.13 to provide that service shall be accomplished by mailing a copy to the address of the political committee, or the treasurer or the assistant treasurer, as listed in the last Statement of Organization, or as listed in the most recent report, or by hand delivering a copy to the treasurer or assistant treasurer. Also, please note that the attached rules which follow would provide for service by first class mail. The Commission is also considering adding language to expressly permit payment of witness fees and mileage for more than one day. when necessary. See proposed 11 CFR 111.13(a). This would be consistent with fee payments in court cases under 28 U.S.C. 1821. The draft rules which follow would amend \u00a7 111.15 to clarify that it applies to orders, well as subpoenas. The Commission also is proposing the inclusion of a now section 111.15(b) to clearly indicate that, before challenging a Commission subpoena or order through the courts, respondents must exhaust their administrative remedies by filing a timely motion to quash or modify under this section. Any objection to a subpoena or order which is not presented in a timely motion to quash or modify would be waived for all purposes under this proposed rule. F. Referrals to the Attorney General The Commission is considering adding new \u00a7 111.19 to set out the procedures used if the Commission refers a knowing and willful violation of the campaign finance laws to the Attorney General of the United States. See, 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(5)(C)). The draft regulation would indicate that these referrals can only be made after the Commission finds probable cause to believe the respondent knowingly and willfully violated the Act. In such cases, the Department of Justice decides whether to initiate a criminal action. The proposed rules would indicate that a referral to the Attorney General will suspend the timer periods for attempting to reach coficiliation agreement(s) with the respondent(s). If the Justice Department declines to pursue the criminal prosecution, or if the FEC determines that it is appropriate36766 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules to continue to pursue the enforcement action, the FEC will so inform the respondent(s) and will reactivate the time periods for conciliation efforts. G. Civil and Criminal Penalties Several questions have been raised regarding funds used by candidates and political committees to pay civil or criminal penalties pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(5), 437g(a)(6) and 437g(d). At this time, the Commission does not intend to change its current practice by limiting the sources from which respondents may obtain funds to pay civil penalties. However, candidates and political committees cannot deposit prohibited or excessive amounts in their campaign depositories (or in the legal and accounting compliance fund in the case of a publicly funded campaign committee). Consequently, the Commission is proposing that when the funds used to pay civil penalties come from prohibited sources or would be excessive, these amounts shall be reported as memo entries in accordance with 11 CFR part 104, regardless of amount. Thus, they should be listed on memo schedules for other receipts and disbursements. This new rule would also govern situations where candidates use permissible, nonexcessive receipts expressly and exclusively to pay civil penalties. In that case, the amounts should be deposited and reported in the same way as they would report other receipts and disbursements. This proposed rule would have no effect on respondents who do not have regular reporting obligations, such as individuals and corporations. Please note that this provision would be designated as new S 111.20, and that current 6\u00a7 111.19 through 111.23 would be renumbered \u00a7\u00a7111.21 through 111.25, respectively. H. Civil Suit Several changes are proposed in the regulations explaining the procedures governing civil suits arising out of enforcement matters. First, new language would be included in renumbered \u00a7 111.21 to reflect that the General Counsel may recommend and the Commission may authorize suit for violation of a conciliation agreement. This may happen, for example. when the respondents fail to pay a civil penalty. When both the political committee and its treasurer are parties to the conciliation agreement, and both have agreed to pay the civil penalty, the Commission may proceed against either or both parties. For example, if a committee is unable to pay a civil penalty, the suit may be brought againstthe treasurer who signed the conciliation agreement. In such cases. respondents should also be aware that the FECA authorizes an additional civil penalty. 2 U.S.C. 437g(a) (5) end (6). Comments are sought on this policy. New language is also included to ensure that both complainants and respondents are routinely notified when the Commission authorizes suit. Similarly, S 111.21(b) would indicate that complainants and respondents will be notified of the resolution of the litigation. As explained below, the notification of the final disposition of the court case will trigger the public disclosure of the appropriate portions of the enforcement and litigation files. The Commission is also considering adding a sentence to 11 CFR 111.21(b) to notify respondents whenever a complainant brings suit under 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8) challenging a Commission decision to dismiss a complaint. The new language would also provide notification to respondents as to the final disposition of the section 437g(a)(8) suit. As discussed below, the enforcement matter resulting from the complaint will have been made public no later than 30 days after the complainant is notified of the dismissal of the complaint, which is prior to the filing of the section 437g(a)(8) suit. I. Termination of Enforcement Matters and Public Disclosure of Commission Action The Commission is considering amending renumbered \u00a7 111.22 to clarify several aspects of its procedures for closing enforcement files and making the results of its investigations public. First, revised language would be included in 11 CFR 111.22(a) to more clearly explain that the Commission's vote to close an enforcement file will trigger the process for making the enforcement matter public. Please note that in situations where the Commission has been unable to successfully resolve the enforcement matter, and therefore must bring civil suit, it does not vote to close the enforcement matter prior to the litigation. The enforcement files would usually remain confidential until the end of the litigation. Of course, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing discovery would remain applicable in such cases. In contrast, in situations where a complainant files suite under 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8) challenging the Commission's decision to dismiss a complaint, the Commission may have already made the enforcemnent matter public before the litigation commences. In compliance matters involving multiple respondents, proposed\u00a7 111.22(a) would specify that in general no action taken by the Commission will be made public prior to closing the enforcement file and terminating all enforcement proceedings with regard to every respondent in such matters. This policy is necessitated by the confidentiality requirement of section 437g(a)(12)(A) of the FECA. However, new language in S 111.4(g) would allow for severing part of the compliance matter and terminating proceedings relating to some respondents when appropriate. This proposal would not ange the current internal procedures which can result in the closing of enforcement matters and their placement on the public record before all respondents have received notifications of these actions. The Commission seeks comment on this practice, and in particular whether it would be appropriate, as an alternative, to provide that public release will not take place before three days have elapsed after the mailing of the notification letters. Similarly, the Commission is proposing adding language to \u00a7 111.22(b) to provide that, in general, a conciliation agreement will only be made public following the termination of all proceedings with regard to every respondent in that matter. However, if part of the compliance matter is severed, conciliation agreements for some respondents could be made public before others. This proposal seeks to strike a balance between the duties imposed by the confidentiality provision of the Act and 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)4)(B)(ii), which requires that conciliaffon agreements which have been finalized be made public. It preserves that balance by requiring that an executed conciliation agreement be made public as soon as possible following the termination of all proceedings with regard to every respondent in that matter. In addition, conforming amendments to the Freedom of Information and public disclosure regulations at 11 CFR 4.4(a) (3) and (12), and 11 CFR 5.4(a) (3) and (4) are also included in the proposed amendments which follow. The Commission also seeks comments on language that would define the date of dismissal of a complaint by the Commission as being the date on which the Commission votes to close an enforcement file with respect to all respondents. This date is significant because it triggers the 60 day time period for filing suit under 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8). The date of the Commission's vote to dismiss was the date relied upon in a recent Court of Appeals decision. See, Spannaus v.36767 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules Federal Election Commission, No. 92- 5191, slip op. at 2 (D.C. Cir. April 20, 1993). In Spannaus, the Court of Appeals rejected a previous lower court decision which had concluded that for purposes of 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8), the date of dismissal of a complaint was the date the complaint actually received notification of the Commission's decision to dismiss the complaint. See, Common Cause v. Federal Election Commission. 630 F. Supp. 508,512 (D.D.C. 1985), see also, Antosh v. Federal Election Commission, 613 F. Supp. 729 (D.D.C. 1985). The rules which follow incorporate the date of the Commission's vote to dismiss since the court in Spannaus concluded that it is undisputed that this is the date of dismissal. Proposed new paragraph (c) of \u00a7 111.22 would clarify that nothing in this section will preclude the Commission from making public information developed In the course of an investigation to support its position in any litigation. This proposed rule would be particularly relevant to subpoena enforcement actions or civil proceedings following the unsuccessful resolution of a matter after an investigation. Finally, new \u00a7 111.22(d) would explain that in cases where the Commission brings civil suit, it will make the nonexempt portions of both the enforcement files and the litigation files public no later than thirty days after notifying the complainant and the respondents of the final disposition of the court case. The final disposition may consist of a court decision tht is not appealed by either party, or tat is not reviewed by a higher court. This approach would be consistent with the time frames employed for enforcement matters that do not result in litigation. J. Confidentiality; Waiver The Commission's current confidentiality regulations could be interpreted to preclude the disclosure of the fact that a complaint has been filed, as well as the substance of the complaint. However, such an interpretation may go beyond the provisions of section 437g(a)(12) of the Act and has also presented some difficulties for the Commission and potential respondents. On occasion, persons have publicly announced the filing of a complaint with the Commission against another person or entity without actually ever filing one. Consequently, the Commission's policy. has been to either confirm or deny that a specific person filed a complaint against another specific person or entity. In a number of enforcement matters, theCommission has not construed the FECA to prohibit complainants from giving copies of complaints to the news media or otherwise publicizing them after the complaints have been filed with the FEC. E.g., MURS 3168, 3169, & 3170, and MURs cited therein. The Commission is now proposing to revise renumbered 11 CFR 111.23 to specifically permit the Commission to maintain a public file containing copies of property-filed complaints submitted to the FEC. Comments are requested as to whether such a file should also include the written responses of the persons alleged to have committed the violations. A conforming amendment to 11 CFR 7.14(a) is also included in the draft rules which follow. This change would not affect the confidentiality of notifications and investigations or the prohibition on ex parte communications concerning enforcement matters. The new language would be consistent with the legislative history of the statutory confidentiality provision, which has existed in a form substantially similar to its present one since the 1974 Amendments to the FECA. In 1979, Congress considered and ultimately rejected including in section 437g(a)(12) a specific prohibition on making public \"[any complaint filed under this section\" without the written consent of \"the person who is the subject of (1979) (passed by the House on Sept. 10, 1979); see, also, 125 Cong. Rec. 36751 (Dec. 18, 1979) (Senate passed amendment in the nature of a substitute omitting the House language); 125 Cong. Rec. 37194 (Dec. 20, 1979) (House passed Senate amendment). In \u00a7 111.23(b), the Commission is proposing that the language be revised to more accurately reflect the procedure under which information covered by the confidentiality provisions of the Act will be made public by the Commission. As the amendment indicates, the respondent would first waive the privilege of confidentiality, and then the Commission would approve the release of the information, upon receiving a written request. Comments are sought on whether \u00a7 111.23(b) should be revised to prohibit respondents from discussing conciliation efforts. Alternatively, the regulations could treat a discussion by the respondent as a waiver of confidentiality, which would permit the Commission to discuss the conciliation process. The Commission is also proposing the inclusion of a new sentence in 11 CFR 111.23(c) to permit the Commission to reveal information to the complainant concerning the procedural status of anongoing enforcement matter If the efficient conduct of Commission business would be assisted by revealing the information to the complainant. This proposal would require the complainant to sign an agreement not to disclose any of the information revealed by the Commission before the enforcement matter is made public. Such an agreement would contain an acknowledgment that public disclosure by the complainant of the information provided would be a violation of the confidentiality requirements of the FECA. This proposed addition is intended to reduce the necessity for complainants to file suit against the Commission under 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8)(A) to find out what actions have been taken in response to their complaints. There may be a number of different reasons why Commission action on the complaint has not been made public within the 120 day period described in 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8)(A), such as complex legal and factual issues, or problems in eliciting compliance with Commission subpoenas. Although the Commission is not required to conclude its actions within this period, the current regulations do not permit the Commission to make the complainant aware of those reasons. Therefore, the complainant must bring suit against the Commission simply to find out what actions have occurred. In several cases, the Commission has disclosed this information to the complainant under Court ordered seal. E.g., Common Cause v. Federal Election Commission, 83 F.R.D. 410 (D.D.C. 1979). The District Court in Common Cause concluded that disclosure to the complainant during the course of judicial proceedings is consistent with the confidentiality provisions of 2 U.S.C. 437g because judicial proceedings do not constitute the type of publicity of concern to Congress. Id. at 412 (Citing H.R. Rep. No. 94-1057, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 50 (1976)). Under the draft amendment to \u00a7 111.23(c), the Commission would have the discretion to reveal to the complainant information deemed necessary to make the complainant aware of the status of the compliance matter, thereby eliminating the need to file a section 437g(a)(8) suit. The complainant would be required to sign a nondisclosure agreement before any information is revealed. Thus, sufficient safeguards would be built into the new procedure to ensure that enforcement matters are not made public within the meaning of 2 U.S.C. 437g. Revealing this information to the complainant, who is already aware of the nature of the36768 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules allegations in the complaint, is appropriate given the complainant's status as \"an integral part of the Act's enforcement scheme.\" Common Cause. at 412. The Commission is also proposing the inclusion of new \u00a7 111.23(d) to permit respondents to waive their privileges of confidentiality in compliance matters by filing written statements with the Commission. Please note that partial waivers of confidentiality are not contemplated. Following a respondent's waiver of his or her privilege of confidentiality, the Commission would consider a written request by any person for the release of information relating to the compliance matter in which the waiving respondent is a party. Underthis proposed rule, however, written requests would not be granted as a matter of course, and only to the extent they do not conflict with the Freedom of Information Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act and all relevant privileges. The proposed new language would also clarify that the only information to be released upon request is information relating solely to the respondent who has waived confidentiality. The Commission would not release information regarding other respondents who have not waived confidentiality. K. Representation by Counsel; Notification Comments are requested on several possible changes to renumbered 11 CFR 111.25 regarding representation by counsel and Commission communications with the designated counsel. First, the Commission is proposed new language explicitly stating that the Commission will not communicate with any person purporting to be counsel for a respondent until a written designation is filed. Similarly, the Commission will continue to contact only the designated counsel until notified in writing that the designated counsel no longer represents the respondent. These measures are needed to maintain the confidentiality of enforcement matters, as required by the FECA. New language would also be added to \u00a7 111.25 to explain the procedures for situations where counsel withdraws or the designation of counsel is withdrawn, and a different counsel begins to represent the respondent. The withdrawal does not in itself invalidate statements, actions and offers made by that counsel. After the withdrawal, the Commission will communicate only with the respondent until it receives another properly executed designation of counsel. A related question concernsthe appropriateness of a respondent's designated representative signing the conciliation agreement. New language in \u00a7 111.18(b) would indicate that this practice is acceptable. - The Commission also proposes that the provisions of S 111.25 be revised to address situations where witnesses, as well as respondents, wish to be represented in MURs. Given the confidentiality requirements of the FECA, witnesses who are represented by counsel must submit signed designations of counsel. Thereafter, the Commission would only communicate with the witness through the designated counsel, unless such direct contact is authorized in writing by the witness. Given that witnesses often do retain counsel, the Commission is proposing this addition to clarify that the same procedures apply to witnesses as apply to respondents. These rules do not require anyone to obtain counsel at any point in the enforcement process. The proposals would not change the Commission's current practice of accepting a blanket designation of counsel from a publicly- funded committee, which covers all compliance matters in which the committee may be a respondent. Finally, please note that the provision on representation applies only to enforcement matters. Written designations are not needed when counsel handles an advisory opinion request, a Commission audit, or a request for public funding. L. Extensions of Time; Untimely Filing The Commission is proposing the inclusion of new 11 CFR 111.26 to explain the current procedures and policies regarding requests for extensions of time in compliance matters and to ensure that materials are received in a more timely manner. The ANPRM proposed including rules covering extensions. Three commenters supported putting policies on extensions of time in the regulations, although they did not fully support the Commission's current enforcement deadlines and extension policies. The draft provisions which follow reflect the Commission's present policies regarding extensions of time. New \u00a7 111.26(a) would provide that whenever a person has a right or is required to take action within a period of time prescribed by 11 CFR part III or by notice given thereunder, that person may apply to the Commission for an extension of time within which to exercise such right or take such action. Proposed paragraph (b) would set forth the requirements for all requests for extensions of time under 11 CFR part111. First, such requests must be made in writing. Second, the request must state specifically the amount of additional time sought and the reason(s) such an extension is necessary. Third, a request must be filed with the Commission no later than five days prior to the date on which the right at issue will take effect or the required action is due. Given the need to resolve enforcement matters in a timely manner, the Commission hopes to avoid situations in which persons wait until the deadline before requesting an extension of time, thereby delaying the compliance process unnecessarily. The five day period is intended to provide sufficient time so that if a request is denied, the original deadline remains viable and the compliance process is not disrupted or delayed by the request. Nevertheless, comments are requested as to whether it would be preferable to require the request to be made seven or ten days before the due date. Comments are also sought on whether a five day period is adequate for requesting an extension of time to reply to a complaint. In some cases, a significant part of the fifteen day period for responding to a complaint may have elapsed before the respondent retains counsel, and counsel has had an opportunity to become familiar with the matter. The only proposed exception to the five day rule would be in the case of a motion to quash or modify a subpoena or order, pursuant to 11 CFR 111.15. In that case, draft \u00a7 111.26(b) would require that a request for an extension shall be filed with the Commission no later than three days after receipt of the subpoena or order. A shorter time period is proposed for requesting an extension of time to file a motion to quash or modify a subpoena or order because an earlier request for an extension may be impracticable. However, comments are requested on whether a longer period, possible ten days, should be permitted for filing motions to quash or modify subpoenas or orders. Please note as well, that a request to extend the deadline for complying with a subpoena or order would not affect the time for filing a motion to quash the subpoena or order. New \u00a7 111.26(c) would provide that requests for extensions of time under 11 CFR part 111 will not be routinely granted. Further, to insure that extensions of time are not requested frivolously, this proposed rule would state that requests for extensions of time will not be granted unless such requests are founded on good cause. The burden would be upon the requester to set forth36769 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules the reasons why there is good cause to grant an extension. Draft 11 CFR 111.26(d) would specify that the length of time of any extension granted under this proposed section is to be determined by the Commission or the General Counsel. This provision would also clarify that if granted, extensions may be for a shorter length of time then that sought by the person making the request. depending on the requester's reasons. Paragraph (e) of proposed S 111.26 would provide that simply filing a request for an extension of time does not automatically stay any previously' established due date. Any extension of time which is granted would run from the previous due date, not from the date on which the extension is granted. Finally, paragraph () would provide that absent extraordinary circumstances, respondents' briefs will not be considered by the Commission if they are received after the established deadline. M. Liability of Treasurers and Candidates The Commission is proposing the inclusion of new section 111.26 in the compliance regulations to clarify its policy regarding the naming of treasurers and candidates when the Commission makes reason to believe or probable cause to believe findings against political committees. Section 111.27 would set forth policies regarding the liability of current and former treasurers and candidates in their official and individual capacities. It is intended to inform prospective treasurers from the outset of the legal responsibilities which accompany that position. Under some circumstances, these provisions may result in a current treasurer being hold ersonally liable for actions taken before he or she became treasurer. Accordingly, comments are sought as to who specifically should be liable for previous violations (i.e. the present treasurer, the treasurer at the time of the violation, or the candidate) in those infrequent situations where the committee is unable to raise sufficient funds to pay a civil penalty. This is an area that was raised in the ANPRM and addressed by one commenter. Proposed paragraph (a) of S 111.27 would state that, in any compliance matter in which the Commission finds reason to believe or probable cause to believe a political committee committed a violation, the current treasurer will be named in the findings, whether or not the alleged violations occurred during the tenure of the current treasurer. In general, the current treasurer will be named only in his or her officialcapacity as treasurer of the political committee. However, the draft rules also recognize that it is appropriate to make additional findings when a treasurer had personal knowledge of. or was actively involved in. the actions which resulted in the violations. The draft rules would also set forth the Commission's current policy of not finding reason to believe or probable cause to believe a candidate committed a violation unless it appears that the candidate had personal knowledge of, or active involvement in. the actions which resulted in the alleged violations. Proposed paragraph (b) would provide that the Commission, at any point in a compliance matter, will substitute the now treasurer of a political committee upon the death or resignation of the treasurer originally named. Similarly, the Commission may substitute another individual who is acting as treasurer but who has not officially assumed the role of treasurer. This substitution should avoid interruption of the compliance process. However, it would not relieve the political committee of the obligation to le an amended Statement of Organization. Please note that when a new treasurer is substituted, the conciliation agreement may indicate that the new treasurer was not treasurer at the time of the violation and is not charged with personal wrongdoing. In addition, comments are sought on whether it would be preferable to make findings against candidates, former treasurers, or other persons responsible for establishing the political committee in situations where the violations occurred before the current treasurer took office. One basis for pursuing candidates is found in the 1979 amendments to the FECA, which indicate that candidates are agents of their campaign committees for purposes of receiving contributions and loans, and making disbursements. 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(2). In addition, at times the Commission has encountered difficulties in locating previous treasurers. Paragraph (c) of draft 11 CFR 111.27 would address liability for actions taken in a treasurer's official and Individual capacities. It would set forth the circumstances under which the Commission may find reason to believe or probable cause to believe that a treasurer or candidate violated the FECA or Commission regulations. The Commission may make findings against the treasurer for actions taken in his or her official capacity when the FECA or Commission regulations impose a specific responsibility on the treasurer of a committee. Examples Includefailure to timely file reports with the Commission, and failure to retain required documents. In such situations, courts have held political committees and their treasurers jointly and severally liable. See, FEC v. John A. Dramesi for Congress Committee and Russell E. Paul, as treasurer, No. 85-4039 (D.N.J. Sept. 5. 1990); FEC v. Gus Savage for Congress '82 Committee and Thomas 1. Savage, Treasurer. 606 F. Supp. 541. 547 (N.D. Ill. 1985). Under joint and several liability, both the political committee and the treasurer are liable for the full amount of any civil penalty imposed by the court, but between them they need only pay the amount of the civil penalty once. As a practical matter, the question of treasurer liability generally does not arise in the enforcement process when the committee is solvent and willing to pay the civil penalty. Proposed paragraph (c) would also address the issue of the liability of a treasurer after that person no longer is treasurer. Under this proposed rule, in an appropriate case, the Commission may find reason to believe or probable cause to believe that the previous treasurer violated the Act or Commission regulations despite the fact that he or she is no longer treasurer at the time the Commission makes the findings. This would be limited to situations where the previous treasurer had personal knowledge of, or was actively involved in, actions which resulted In FECA violations. These provisions do not relieve the new treasurer from liability for actions which took place while the new treasurer served as treasurer of the committee. N. Termination of Political Committee Status Comments are sought on possible conforming amendments to 11 CFR 102.3(a), which incorporate the Commission's policies on termination of a political committee's registration and reporting obligations. The draft rules continue the current procedures whereby political committees may either indicate their intention to terminate on a regularly scheduled report or they may file a written statement at any time containing the necessary information. New language would be added to clarify that a political committee's reporting obligations end upon notification that the Commission has accepted its termination report. This is generally a routine administrative act. However, the draft rules would also list situations which preclude termination, including. while the political committee is involved in an enforcement matter, FEC....77. .. 036770 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules audit, or litigation with the Commission, and when it has not yet satisfied all requirements of a signed conciliation agreement. 0. Additional Issues The Commission also requests comments on the compliance process generally, and on several issues for which draft language has not been included in the proposed rules which follow. First, the Commission is considering whether oral hearings should be held in enforcement matters. The possibility of conducting oral enforcement hearings presents a number of questions, beginning with when they should be held. The alternatives are to hold them whenever a respondent or respondent's counsel requests one, or whenever one or more Commissioners would find it helpful. Another option is to hold hearings only for certain types of matters, such as those involving allegations of knowing and willful violations, or MURs involving violations exceeding a given amount, or MURs that reach a certain stage, or only for enforcement matters that involve complex legal or factual issues. 'Another consideration is who would have the opportunity to testify. It could be limited to counsel for respondents, or extended to include the respondents themselves, whether or not they are represented by counsel. If a respondent or a respondent's counsel does not want to appear at a hearing, would it ever be appropriate for the Commission to compel them to attend or testify? Should other respondents and their attorneys also be permitted to be present during the hearing? If so, should they have the opportunity to testify and perhaps to cross-examine the person testifying at the hearing? In addition, should complainants have the opportunity to request an oral hearing either when they first file a complaint or when the Commission dismisses their complaints? The answers to these questions may depend upon the point in the enforcement process when oral hearings would be held. The options are to hold hearings either during the investigation, or after the probable cause briefs have been filed, or at various times throughout the enforcement process, including for example hearings on motions to quash or modify subpoenas. Hearings held during the course of an investigation would permit the Commissioners and the General Counsel to ask factual questions of the attorney and/or the respondent pertinent to the investigation. However, procedures would be needed to spell out whether objections could be raised on the basisof relevancy, scope, the Fifth Amendment, attorney-client privilege or other grounds, and how any such objections would be resolved. Another consideration is whether enforcement hearings could replace some depositions, or whether they should be postponed until after all necessary depositions have been conducted. An alternative is to restrict enforcement hearings to the probable * cause stage, so the respondents may present orally the arguments made in their briefs. Under this approach, the hearing would be modeled after an appellate argument. Another question is whether the matter would need to be re- briefed if significant new evidence is elicited in response to questioning. An important consideration is the topics to be addressed during enforcement hearings. This could include questions of law, interpretations of the FECA and Congrssionalintent, and the application of the FECA to the facts at hand. Alternatively. \" enforcement hearings could also serve to resolve questions of fact, including the credibility of witnesses. Comments are sought on whether it would be of value to address other topics at enforcement hearings, such as the terms of the conciliation agreement, the amount of a civil penalty, or the inclusion of an admissions clause. Comment is also sought on the procedures that would need to be established for holding a hearing. For example, if a request for a hearing is received, the General Counsel could make a recommendation on whether to have a hearing. Once the Commission votes on holding the hearing, the requester couldbe informedof the decision. If the request is granted, a hearing date and time would then be scheduled. Another question is whether a court reporter would be needed to prepare a transcript. If so, cost considerations might require those who have requested the hearing to pay the costs of hiring a court reporter and preparing the transcript. There are several options regarding how many Commissioners would normally be present at an enforcement hearing. It could either be the whole Commission, or a panel of less than the whole Commission, or only those Commissioners who believe they may find the hearing helpful. A quorum may not be needed if no action is taken at that point. A broader concern is that oral enforcement hearings at any stage may necessitate increasing the resources the Commission devotes to enforcement. Hearings may also increase the respondent's expenses and undulyprolong the enforcement process, at least for some cases. Comments are requested on ways to reduce the amount of resources needed, and ways to avoid procedural delays. The Commission also seeks comments\" on precluding complainants from refiling the same compliant with the FEC after it has been dismissed. Please note that thisapproach would not bar complainants from filing new complaints which present new evidence against the respondents. Comments are also sought on whether to treat a complainant's failure to bring an issue to the Commission's attention in a complaint, or in an amendment to a complaint, as a waiver of the complainant's right to raise the issue in a suit objecting to the Commissions dismissal, pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8). Such a rule may lessen the number of suits filed against the Commission by providing complainants opportunities to resolve matters within the framework of the compliance process. This approach would also be consistent with previous judicial decisions. In re Federal Election Campaign Act Litigation, 474 F. Supp. 1044 (D.D.C. 1979); Stern v. FEC, C.A. No. 89-0089, slip op. at 10 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 1989) (Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear allegations of violations which involved facts complainant had not originally raised to the FEC) affd on other grounds. 921 F.2d 296 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The Commission is also considering whether the compliance rules should state which documents in a compliance matter would constitute the administrative record. For example, the administrative record would include documents and evidence such as the complaint, the response to the complaint, the General Counsel's and respondents' briefs, and the certifications of Commission votes. On the other hand, the Commission has never considered the administrative record to include documents in the files of individual Commissioners, or documents in FEC employees' files which were never forwarded to the Commissioners or placed in the official file. It would also not be appropriate to include in the administrative record transcripts or tapes of Commission discussions of compliance matters. Although these materials are sometimes made available under the Freedom of Information and Government in the Sunshine Acts, they may not provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for the Commission's decisions in compliance matters. The Commission welcomes comments regarding which36771 Federal Register / VoL 58. No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Proposed Rules documents should be considered part of the administrative record. Another possible topic for inclusion in the compliance rules in 11 CFR Part 111 is the issuance of statements of reasons setting forth an explanation for the Commission's dismissal of a complisnt. Comments are requested as to whether it would be helpful to include a general statement explaining when statements of reasons are issued. They are prepared when the Commission does not approve by the requisite four votes a General Counsel's recommendation to go forward, and as a result part or all of a complaint is dismissed. See Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 831 F.2d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1987); Common Cause v. Federal Election Commission, 676 F. Supp. 286 (D.D.C. 1984). In these situations, the reasons for the dismissal of the entire complaint, or a particular respondent or allegation, cannot be found in the General Counsel's report. Comments are also sought on whether the regulations should specify the circumstances in which investigatory materials may be provided to respondents to assist them In preparing their briefs at the probable cause stage. For example, such language could indicate that investigatory materials relied upon in the General Counsel's brief will be provided, upon request, if this would be In the interest of furthering the investigation, such as where there is an issue of credibility. Please note that the Commission is not required to release these investigatory materials to the subject of the investigation under S.E.C. v. O'Brien, 467 U.S, 735 (1984). Questions have also been raised as to when the Commission will accept enforcement-related documents transmitted by facsimile machine. The Commission cannot accept faxed complaints or conciliation agreements because an original signature is required. However. comments are sought on the feasibility and desirability of accepting facsimiles of responses to complaints, designations of counsel. requests for extensions of time, motions to quash or modify subpoenas, other investigatory documents, and respondents' briefs. The drawbacks of accepting facsimiles are that they are more difficult to read, and they may not always be transmitted correctly and completely. Thus, a hard copy backup would be required. The Commission welcomes comments on the proposed revisions to the compliance regulations and the issues presented in this Notice.Certification of No Effect Pursuant to S US.C. 6o5(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act] The attached proposed rules will not. if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Together with the statute authorizing the program and applicable regulations governing the program, includijg the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), the notice contains all the information, application forms, regulations, and instructions needed to apply for a cooperative agreement under this competition. AGENCY: The National Institute for Literacy. ACTI : The National Institute for Literacy invites applications for a new award for Fiscal Year 1993 to support the establishment of a National Center for Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities. DEFMnONS: For purposes of this announcement the following definitionsapply:\"Adult Literacy System\" All public and private programs and organizations providing or seeking to provide adult literacy or basic skills instruction, including local educational agencies, agencies responsible for corrections education, programs supported by the Job Training Partnership Act, welfare agencies, labor organizations, businesses, volunteer groups, and community-based organizations. (As stated in the National Literacy Act of 1991.) \"Literacy\" An individual's ability to read, write, and speak in English, and compute and solve problems at levels of proficiency necessary to function on the job and in society, to achieve one's goals and develop one's knowledge and potential. (Act, 1991) \"Screening\" A process for recognizing learning disabilities through series of questionnaires or relevant tests. \"Remediation\" The process of helping adults with learning disabilities achieve literacy skills. Remediation is not used here in the sense of \"cure,\" since there is no known cure for learning disabilities. There are techniques and approaches to learning that reportedly enable persons with learning disabilities to obtain and maintain information, or to contain and control the impact of the disabilities. However, remediation in this document means using the right tools and techniques to assist adults with learning disabilities in obtaining literacy skills. \"Remediation\" also means accommodation, as the term Isused in the Americans with Disabilities Act-that Is, steps taken to enable the participation of persons with disabilities in program and employment opportunities that could otherwise be denied to them solely based on their disability. PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: The National Institute for Literacy proposes to establish a National Center for Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities to assure that awareness of learning disabilities becomes an integral part of policy and program planning for adult teracy efforts. The National Institute for Literacy expects to work in a close collaborative relationship with the Center to further the understanding that learning disabilities have a direct impact on all efforts to achieve Goal 5 of the National Education Goals and to assure that adults with learning disabilities can \"develop the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\" This announcement outlines a 5-year cooperative agreement with an initial award for up to 3 years with an option for 2 additional years, subject to program authorization and availability of appropriations. A non-competing proposal will be required to exercise the option foryears 4 and 5. The award will be to develop and operate a Center for Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities. The overall goal of NIFL is to maximize the effectiveness of local literacy services nationwide. The Center will further this goal by helping NIFL enhance the capacity of all literacy service providers to identify and teach adults with learning disabilities. This announcement responds to a Congressional request that the NIFL establish a center to \"develop a battery of tests for the diagnosis of learning disabilities In adults and intervention strategies to address these disabilities.\" The NIFL has decided that the intent of Congress would be best served through a Center that focuses on: (1) Enhancing awareness among literacy practitioners, policymakers, researchers, and adult learners about the nature of learning disabilities and their impact on the provision of literacy services. (2) Building the capacity of literacy practitioners to serve adults with learning disabilities through training and technical assistance in current best practices for screening and remediation. (3) Producing and refining knowledge of what works best under what conditions for what types of learner through use of broad field-based research on effective practices forassessing and serving adults with learning disabilities. (4) Eliminating duplication of effort by using or creating iages and partnerships among programs and agencies with concern for adult literacy and learning disabilities. The Director is particularly interested in applicants who develop a five year strategic plan for collaborating with the NIFL to produce the following results for the adult literacy system, including programs supportedby the Departments of Education, Labor and Health and Human Services: 1. A universal understanding about learning disabilities and their implications for literacy instruction; 2. A \"tool kit\" for litercy practitioners that includes a variety of simple, inexpensive, validated intake screening devices and tested instructional approaches for identifying and teaching adults with learning disabilities; 3. A knowledge base about what literacy practices work with what populations of adults with which learning disabilities under what circumstances and in what settings, and a mechanism for continually updating that knowledge; 4. Institutionalized capacity in all states, primarily through State Literacy Resource Centers, to train literacy practitioners in- a. Identifying and teaching adults with learning disabilities, and b. Conducting field-based research and development to clarify the different learning styles and teaching methodologies for adults with various specific learning disabilities. The Center will function in close collaboration with the NIFL and, to the extent possible, will accomplish its objectives through the use of existing NIFL systems for communication, information collection and dissemination, training and technical assistance, and other mutually agreed- upon functions. For a fuller discussion of the National Institute for Literacy and issues related to the creation of the Center, see SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. PLAN OF OPERATION: The applicant must develop a five-year plan that addresses, for each year, NIFL's goals for the Center, as set forth below. This plan should not exceed fifteen (15) single- spaced pages, or thirty (30) double- spaced pages. The plan may be amplified by material in attachments and appendices, but the body should stand alone to give a complete picture of the Center. Proposals which exceed 15 single-spaced pages or 30 double- spaced pages will not be reviewed.36782 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices In addressing the goals, the plan must demonstrate how the applicant will: a Work collaboratively with the NIFL: * Work with the state iteracy resource centers, especially in the areas of Information dissemination, training. and technical assistance; & Address all goals set forth below in an integrated way; 9 Use or create linkages and partnerships that provide for the involvement of State and local literacy- related agencies, especially those supported by ED, DOL. and HHS, in all stages of planning and implementation; and * Assure input from interested public and private organizations and consumer groups in the area of literacy end learning disabilities, especially universities and other institutions that have done related work.

APPUCABLE REGULATIONS: The National Institute for Literacy is subject to the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Under the APA, as now podified in Title 5 of the United States Code, section 553, matters relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts are not subject to the rulemaking requirement of that section. The National Institute for Literacy Is now in the initial stages of establishing a new program recently authorized by Congress and must obligate funds under this authority by September 30, 1993. The National Institute for Literacy considered waiving this exemption to rulemaking requirements but determined that there was too little time to propose rules and offer applicants a reasonable amount of time to prepare applications for the award announced in this notice. Therefore, the National Institute for Literacy has adopted the following rules for the conduct of this competition and the resulting award. The following regulations of the Department of Education apply: 34 CFR part 74, Administration of Grants to Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Nonprofit Organizations. The following provisions of 34 Definitions. 34 CFR part 80, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments. 34 CFR part 82, New restrictions on Lobbying. 34 CFR part 85, Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace (Grants). The selection criteria used for this competition are set out in this Notice. While the criteria are patterned on those used generally by the Department of Education, they have been adapted by the National Institute for Literacy to meet the needs of this program. While the National Institute for Literacy is associated with the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services, the policies and procedures regarding rulemaking and administration of grants are not adopted by the National Institute for Literacy except as expressly stated in this Notice.

Background National Institute for Literacy: In 1990 the President and the Nation's Governors adopted National Education goals that included an ambitious agenda for adult literacy and life-long learning. Goal Five states that: By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. To further the goal of improving literacy in the United States, the Congress passed Public Law 102-73, the National Literacy Act of 1991, which is the first piece of national legislation to focus exclusively on literacy. The overall intent of the Act, as stated, is: To enhance the literacy and basic skills of adults, to ensure that all adults in the United States acquire the basic skills necessary to function effectively and achieve the greatest possible opportunity in their work and in their lives and to strengthen and coordinate adult literacy programs. In designing the Act, among the primary concerns shared by the Congress and literacy stockholders was the fragmentation and lack of coordination among the many efforts in the field. To address these concerns, the Act created the National Institute for Literacy to: (A) Provide a national focal point for research, technical assistance and research dissemination, policy analysis and program evaluation in the area of literacy; and (B) Facilitate a pooling of ideas and expertise across fragmented programs and research efforts. The Act also provided for State Literacy Resource Centers funded through the Governors' offices to provide support to all local literacy programs and to act as reciprocal links with the NIFL in a national support system for literacy. The NIFL will serve as the hub of this national effort to build literacy programs and delivery systems that work for adults in need. To achieve its goals the NIFL has established the following priorities: Building awareness and strengthening coordination for literacy at the national level. The NIFL will work with the White House, Congress, and key federal agencies to integrate literacy into the national agenda for achieving key domestic and economic goals. Building literacy capacity at the State level. The NIFL will assist State efforts to build integrated adult learning systems that can meet the needs of all adults, primarily through its links withSLRCs. The NIFL will focus especially on helping SLRCs to provide training, information dissemination, and program coordination for local literacy practitioners. Creating a national research agenda for literacy. The Institute will assess the extent of our collective knowledge about how adults learn and how best to serve them, and will develop a collaborative research effort to extend that knowledge. Establishing an information and telecommunications system for literacy. The NIFL will create an information and electronic communications system that permits it to carry out its other goals and to become the national resource on the knowledge base in literacy. 11. Magnitude of the Issue In creating the National Literacy Act of 1991, Congress demonstrated its concern about the high costs that accrue to the nation as a whole when so many people are unable to achieve their full potential because of limited literacy skills. The Literacy Act estimates that 30 million adults may fit into this category and that the estimated costs to the nation are upwards of $250 billion per year. There is a growing awareness that many Americans with literacy problems may in fact have learning disabilities which are causing or intensifying their literacy problems. As is the case with literacy needs, learning disabilities are \"invisible,\" and developing a universally acceptable definition has been a difficult and controversial process. In 1987, the Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities offered the following definition: Learning disabilities is a generic term that refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning, or mathematical abilities or of social skills. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concurrently with other handicapping conditions (e.g., sensory impairment, mental retardation, social and emotional disturbance), with socioenvironmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient or inappropriate instruction, psychologic factors), and especially attention deficit disorder, all of which may cause learning problems, a learning disability is not the direct result of those conditions or influences. While we do not know what ercentage of adults with literacy needs ave learning disabilities, there is widespread agreement that the number of adult literacy students with learning disabilities is substantial and that the36787 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices provision of literacy services is seriously affected by this overlap. Strong indications of the connection between literacy problems and leaming disabilities can be found in the data of many related fields. Current State of Knowledge: Then is widespread agreement about the need for simple, inexpensive, validated screening devices to identify learning disabilities in adults. At present literacy practitioners generally have two choices in types of screening tests, each with serious drawbacks. 1. Models that are expensive and time-consuming, which limits their utility for most literacy providers and their clients.. 2. Small-scale, untested models that are not accepted as valid by many institutions and programs. With regard to instructional models, there is also widespread agreement about the need to know more about what works with which populations. Some of the potential difficulties in identifying best practices for adults with learning disabilities are suggested by past research on similar programs for children. In its 1993 request for applications for the development of remediation programs for children with learning disabilities, the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NKDI of the Department of Health and Human Services makes statements that are likely to hold true for adults as well: \"Review of the literature related to * * learning disabilities suggest that no single treatment/intervention approach or method is likely to yieldclinically significant, long-term therapeutic gains in heterogeneous groups of LD children. Likewise, even in homogeneous groups* * * members differ significantly in their development of requisite skills * * *. This suggests that not all children fail to develop oral and written language skills for the same reasons and, as such, will not respond equally well to the same treatment or multi-modality approach. Unfortunately, to date, there exists scant scientific support for the use of particular treatment/interventions or combinations of treatment with different types of oral or written languagediailities.\" Some of the reasons identified by NICHD for the lack of valid information about remediation for learning disabilities include-- (1) Faulty definition of learning disabilities, (2) Lack of isolation of learning disabilities vis a vis other factors, (3) Poorly described and defined treatment models, and faulty explanation of treatment model development, (4) Short duration of both service delivery and tracking of impact, (5) Failure to account for impact of other interventions, including medical interventions, and (6) Failure to evaluate differences in retention rates for those who were maintained in specialized training and those who transferred to a more generalized educational setting. However, faulty research-or the lack of research altogether-does not speak to the quality of the treatment. There aremodels currently in use for screening and remediation of learning disabilities that can be described as \"best practices.\" These provide a point of departure for beginning the effort to help literacy practitioners incorporate the treatment of learning disabilities into service delivery. , Instructions for Estimated Public Reporting Burden.

ACTION: Disposition of comments to final rule. SUMMARY: On July 6. 1989, the Federal Administration (FAA) issued a final rule providing for the issuance of Security Directives and Information Circulars as means of disseminating information concerning threats against civil aviation (54 FR 28982; July 10, 1989). The final rule was effective on July 10, 1989; however, the FAA invited public comments on the final rule until August 9, 1989: Although the FAA has determined that there is no need for any amendment to the final rule as originally issued, thi document responds to the comments submitted by the public. ADDRESSES: The complete docket for the final rule on Security Directives and Information Circulars may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Chief Counsel (AGC-10), Rules Docket, room 915-G, 800 Independence Avenue SW..

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 3, 1989, the Department of Transportation announced civil aviation security initiatives designed to protect passengers and crewmembers traveling on U.S. air carriers. Among these initiatives was a commitment to establish a mandatory Security Directive system. The initiatives were necessary because of the dramatic increase in international terrorism since 1971, the year the FAA's Civil Aviation Security Program was established. In December of 1988, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) Flight 103 was destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie,Scotland. illustrating the vulnerability of civil aviation to terrorist acts. When the FAA learns, through its analysis of classified and unclassified information, of critical threats apinst civil aviation, it is crucial that the information and any appropriate countermeasures be disseminated as soon as possible to air carrier security personnel. For this reason, the FAA decided that a system that would significantly improve the, capability to disseminate critical threat information quickly and, when necessary, etablish mandatory security countermeasures, was needed. On July 6, 1989, the FAA issued a final rule that established a system for the issuance of Security Directives and Information Circulars (54 FR 28982; July 10, 1989). Prior to the issuance of this rule, notification ofthreats against civil aviation was made through Security Bulletins that discussed both general security concerns and specific threats. Air carriers were not required to acknowledge receipt of Security Bulletins or to comply with the countermeasures recommended in them. The rule provides that Security Directives will be used to notify U.S. air carriers of specific credible threats against civil' aviation and will set forth mandatory countermeasures to be implemented by the carriers. The rule requires air carriers to acknowledge receipt of Security Directives and to notify the FAA of how they have implemented the FAA-prescribed countermeasures. It is the FAA's policy to ensure that all specific, credible threats against any aircraft are completely resolved before that aircraft is permitted to take off. The rule rovides that Information Circulars will *used to notify air carriers of general security concerns for which the FAA will not prescribe mandatory countermeasures. In addition, the rule prohibits the release of information contained in both Security Directives and Information Circulars without the prior written authorization of the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security. (Since promulgation of the final rule, the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, Public Law 101-804, November 16, 1990, (the Act) created the new position of Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security reporting directly to the Administrator with responsibilities for all security functions within the FAA including implementation and enforcement ofthe Rule on Security Directives and Information Circulars. In a separate rulemaking action, the FAA intends to revise the nomenclature throughout 14CFR part 108 to reflect this change. For the sake of clarity, this notice uses the title Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security.) In order to protect immediately passengers and crewmembers traveling in air transportation from a possible rapid increase in criminal acts against civil aviation, the FAA determined that good cause existed to adopt the final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment and to make the rule effective upon publication in the Federal Register. In accordance with the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), the FAA invited the public to comment on the final rule after it was published in the Federal Register. Eight comments were received. No comments were received objecting to the concept of disseminating threat information; one comment approves of the rule as written and seven suggest modifications. On August 4, 1989, shortly after the final rule was issued, the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (the Commission) was established to \"review and evaluate policy operations in connection with aviation security, with particular reference to the destruction * * * of Pan American World Airways Flight 103\" (Executive Order 12686). The Commission released its report on May 15, 1990, and made recommendations pertaining to the gathering and dissemination of threat information. The recommendations are as follows: 9 The intelligence and law enforcement communities, and those that receive information collected or analyzed by those communities, should review their procedures to reduce to the minimum the number of persons with access to information on civil aviation threats. e The U.S. Government should, as a matter of course and'policy, consciously consider the question of notification and carefully review the factors outlined. The Department of State, and Department of Justice, in close cooperation with the Department of Transportation, should establish a process and a mechanism by which clearly identifiable officials will consider when and how to provide notification to the traveling public. With respect to the Commission's first recommendation, the FAA concludes that its final rule is consistent with the Commission's statement. The rule limits distribution of Security Directives and Information Circulars to prescribed personnel and those with an operational need to know. The rule also prohibits disclosure of any information contained Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations in Security Directives and Information Circulars without prior written authorization of the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security. The FAA supports the need to review procedures for disseminating threat information and to work closely with other entities who collect, receive, or analyze that information, to establish clear and consistent distribution policies that will further reduce the number of persons with access to it. Regarding the Commission's second recommendation, the FAA's position remains that there should be no routine public notification of threats, and that threat information should be handled by aviation security professionals who have the ability to analyze the threat and either counter it or order the cancellation of the flight. Moreover, the Act establishes criteria, authority, and responsibility for notification of threats to civil aviation. The Department of Transportation and FAA will work closely with the Departments of State and Justice and the entire intelligence community to consider the advisability of public notification in specific circumstances. The issue of public notification, as raised by the public comments, is also addressed below under \"Discussion of Comments.\" In October 1989, after the issuance of the final rule and the close of the comment period, the FAA chartered the Aviation Security Advisory Committee (ASAC), to be chaired by the FAA's Assistant Administrator for Aviation Security and to serve as an advisory body and develop recommendations on methods, equipment, and procedures to improve civil aviation security. The FAA will consider any recommendations involving threat analysis and dissemination that may result from the work of the ASAC and will consider further rulemaking action if appropriate. The FAA has already received for consideration the ASAC's recommendations addressing the security response to bomb threats. The recommendations addressed standardized criteria for evaluating threats, dissemination and analysis of information, air carrier and airport security training programs, and demarcating areas of responsibilities and authority. Discussion of Comments Airport Operators, Ground Security Coordinators, and In-Flight Security- Coordinators Should Be Given Copies of Security Directives and Information Circulars Two commenters believe that it is essential that Security Directives andInformation Circulars be distributed to airport operators as well as air carriers. The Airports Commission for the City and County of San Francisco (Airports Commission) states that, pursuant to FAR Part 107-Airport Security, airport operators are responsible for overall airport security and, therefore, must receive timely, accurate security warnings to ensure effective, coordinated responses to threats against civil aviation. The City of Houston's Aviation Department says that there are three primary parties involved with the safety of the flying public--airlines, airport operators, and the FAA-and that as a part of that triumvirate, airport operators must be included in the information link. Security Directives and Information Circulars should be disseminated on a need-to-know basis, and the FAA agrees that it is important to include airport operators in the dissemination of threat information when threats are made that affect airport operations. It is the FAA's policy to ensure that Security Directives and Information Circulars are distributed to airport operators when appropriate for effective, coordinated responses. The final rule, however, was directed at U.S. air carriers because the threat to domestic airports is relatively low, and in most instances, the threats addressed by Security Directives or Information Circulars will not affect U.S. airports. The FAA is currently reviewing and updating FAR Part 107- Airport Security, and will evaluate further the need for a special system for security alerts to airports in the context of that rulemaking. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) states that, at a minimum, the ground security coordinator and the in- flight security coordinator (pilot-in- command) should be notified of every Security Directive and Information Circular. ALPA states that this would help pilots and crewmembers to be especially vigilant for the duration of the threat. Flight Engineers' International Association (FEIA) expresses a similar opinion by stating that the flightcrew has a definite operational need to know and must be advised as soon as possible of the issuance of a Security Directive. Again, as noted in the response to airport operators, the FAA concludes that all persons with an operational need to know (including crewmembers) should be notified in circumstances in which they are directly and immediately affected by a particular threat. The final rule requires that each Security Directive be distributed to personnel specified in the Security Directive and to other personnel that anair carrier determines have an operational need to know. This is essential to ensure that all personnel with an operational involvement in security-related situations are informed of current threat information. The final rule does not preclude airport operators, in-flight security coordinators, or ground security coordinators from being informed of the issuance of Security Directives. The FAA's analysis of the disseminations of past Security Directives (and their predecessor, Security Bulletins) suggests that in almost all instances at those airports assessed as potentially affected by a security threat, personnel likely to have an operational need to know and who would be provided with Security Directives information under the rule include: airport operators, in-flight security coordinators, and ground security coordinators. Indeed, some of these categories of personnel have been listed in Security Directives issued since the final rule was promulgated in 1989. Because the final rule was designed to cover many contingencies, the FAA determined that it was not feasible to list every category of personnel for which dissemination would be appropriate in every possible threat situation. Instead, the final rule requires certificate holders to distribute Security Directives to those persons that are specified by the FAA and to those persons determined by the carrier to have an operational need to know the information. The FAA Should Allow Public Access to Threat Information Senator Alfonse D'Amato comments that although Security Directives will contain some sensitive information that should be protected, he does not agree that specific credible threats should be withheld from the public. Senator D'Amato adds that members of the public deserve to be put in a position where they can protect themselves. The FAA is acutely sensitive to the importance of this issue and has implemented procedures to effect the public notification requirements of Section 109 of the Act. The adopted procedures provide for consideration of several factors prior to issuing a threat notification: specificity of the threat, credibility of intelligence, ability to counter the threat, protection of intelligence sources, impact of cancellation of flight vs. public notification, and ability of passengers and crew to reduce their risks as a result of notification. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (Reporters Committee) urges the FAA to amend the final rule to36803 3804 Federal Register / VoL 58s No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rnles and Regulatin provide for routine, FAA dissemination of specific threat information and does not believe that the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or section 316(dl ,) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, provides for the blanket withholding of threat , information from the public. The Reporters Committee also states that, even though it recognizes that security systems depend in part on the ability of officials to keep specific surveillance techniques secret, it does not believe that disclosure of threats would compromise passenger safety in any way, and that refusal to disclose threats precludes public oversight of airline and airport security and impairs journalistic comment on pvemrnment activities. Furthermore. the Reporten Committee believes-the FAA should amend the rule to requipe that air carriers disclose immediately'any information that does- not direly threaten security. The FAA realizes that public dissemination of threats to aviation security is a sensitive and controversial - issue. Consistnt with the adopted rule on Security Directives and Information Circulars and with the adopted rule governing flight and cabin crew notification &Wdeliaes (56 FR 278w, June 17, 19811, the cuarent system of evaluating and esponding to threats to civil aviation is founded oa the principle that it is best for intelWgence experts to evaluate threat information before disemination to personnel directly responsible for aeling with those threats. The air carrier's security experts, generally in consultation with the FAA and other government entities, evalnate thmt nformation against specific FAA-establihnod criteria to (The terms \"s ific\" and \"crediblW' are not iWtrdendent and are commosly applied by intelligence experts to threat infonmation involving a well defined target and which has been authenticated.) Excluding those threats which am judged to be gromdless or not requiring the application of specific countermeasures is a practical approach, given the hundreds of bogus thmets received annually. Eliminating bogus threats is also critical to ensure that real theats awe perceived as serious,. not diluted in impact by a multiplicity of false alarma. The FAA's view is this limited distribution of threat information helps enase that genuine threats ae handled as thoroughly and e itiously as possiml. sod on its expertise and expeulenc in aviation security matters and a consultaimn with, the Office of-the Secretary efTransperad and otegovernment agencies, the FAA has determined that protecting the confidential sources of threat information, and thereby ensuring the free flow of this critical information to the agency, ultimately increases the security of crewmembers and the traveling public. The decision whether to disclose any thrst information contained in a Security Directive or Information Circular is properly pert of the FAA's overall aviation, security responsibility. Toward that end the FAA is continuing existing control procedures, consistent with Section 100 of the Act,. to minimize the number of agency personnel having access te intelligence infomation en threat. to civil aviation. Under appropriate-c'r stances, the Department of Transportation issues information on specific domestic threats to the public. The State Depertmart issues travel advisories to American citizens. These advisovies are asu d for a variety of reasons, including gneal information on the level of the threat of terrorism; however, the State Department's policy is that the goesa1 public is advised of particular thieets ony when they are spacifc. credible, an cannot be coumtesed.. Because existing mechanisms within the U.S government and procedures of other agencies provide fer disclosure of threat information in appropaecircumstances,. the FAA has zut revised the rule. The FAA's sc i this regard Is consistent with the notification guidance in section 1o of t- Act and the requirement to review woring agreements between the intailigemas community and the FAA in section 111 of the Act. The Reporters Committee urges FAA to revise its FOLA proedures regarding disclosure of Security Directives and Inrormation Circulars and suggests-that theFAA revise its FOIA procedures so that tii Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security is not the final arbiter regarding the release of a Security Directive or Information Circular. The Reporten Committee suggests that the FAA create a \"FOIA unit\" that would make such decisions, presumably only for Security Directives and Information Circulors, but not for other FAA documents subject to FOIA. The final rule contemplates that air carrio and the FAA will receive requests for threat information contained in Security Directives and Information Circulors. The rub quite properly leaves any decision to relee threat information under establied procedures in the hends of thebest equipped to asses. to impet ofreleasing such information. The FAA does not agree with the Reporters Committee's suggest-ion that there be a \"FOIA unit.\" Even if the FAA had such a unit, Its members would not necessarily be aware of related sensitive aviation security information needed to make a properly informed decision on th. release of a particular document. The Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security is best equipped to make these decisions. In addition, the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security is charged by statute wilkr determining what information, if any, can be released based on an inforamed assessment that disclosure of such Information weuld not be detrimental t& the safety of persons traveling in air transportation, The decision of the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security is subject to the concurrence of the Office of the Chief Counsel, and may be appealed to the Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs. A decision to uphol. the denial of the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security is subject to the additional concurrence of the General Counsel Office of the. Secretary, Department ofTransportation. These procedures. fully comply with the FAA's oliigations under the Freedom of Information Act and ensure the protection of sensitive information that might endanger aviation security. Thus, the FAA has not revised the final rule. to provide for routine disclosue, of threat information by the FAA or to provide amended FOI procedure. specific to Security Directives and Information Circulars. The FAA Should Consult With Air CarriersBefore Issuing Security Directives and' There Should Be Some Post-Issuance Mechanism To Review Appropriateness of Countermeasures The Air Transport Association of America (ATA) states that consultations with air carriers before the issuance of Security Directives is necessary in order for the FAA to develop the most effective and efficient mandatory countermeasures. It is the policy of the FAA to consult with air carriers when time allows; however, this policy will be carried out on a case-by-case basis. The rule allows the FAA flexibility to address the adequacy of U.S. air carriers' responses to the countermeasures prescribed in Security Directives. The rule states that carriers shall notify the. FAA of how they have implemented 'the countermeasures, and that carriers unable to implement the countermeasures shall submit proposed alternatve measuremto the Assistent Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Rules and Regulations Administrator for Civil Aviation Security for approval. The ATA further states that the FAA and the air carriers need to be able to review the countermeasures after implementation In order to avoid future problems. The FAA understands that there will be occasions when it will be appropriate to assess situations in retrospect in order to make adjustments when responding to those types of situations in the future, and the FAA does not prohibit air carriers frm contacting the FAA to discuss the appropriateness of countermeasures after threats have passed. Security Directives Should Have Automatic Expiration Dates With Provisions for Extension, if Required' The ATA also states that threats typically are not of infinite duration and that Security Directives should carry automatic expiration dates. The ATA then states that if a threat were likely to persist beyond the expiration date of a Security Directive or an Information Circular, the FAA could extend its effectiveness. The FAA does not agree that Security Directives should have automatic expiration dates in all cases because the nature of each threat determines the necessary duration. In many instances, however, it is appropriate to issue time- limited Security Directives. The FAA periodically evaluates all Security Directives, regardless of whether theycarry expiration dates, to determine if they should be rescinded or remain in effect. In the case of ongoing threats, the FAA may choose to amend an air carrier's approved security program. The Rule Should State That the U.S. Government Shall Be Responsible for Coordinating Countermeasures With Foreign Governments The ATA states that the U.S. government, not the air carriers, should be responsible for consultation and coordination with foreign governments with respect to countermeasures. The FAA agrees and the final rule does not burden air carriers with the responsibility of consulting with foreign governments regarding any threats or countermeasures. Since the rule was issued, the FAA has implemented section 104 of the Act, establishing a security liaison officer position for each airport outside the U.S. as determined by the Administrator. The Civil Aviation Security Liaison Officer (CASLO) is responsible for serving as the liaison between the Assistant Administrator for Civil Aviation Security and foreign authorities including foreign governments and airport authorities. The FAA Should Establish and Publicize Its Enforcement Policy for Responding to Alleged Leaks of Security-Sensitive Information The ATA states that the FAA should publicize its enforcement policyregarding the unauthorized disclosure of security-sensitive information so that penalties for failure to comply with the regulation are clearly understood. Unauthorized disclosure of security information would significantly threaten the safety of crewmembers and '.the traveling public and could hamper the effectiveness of the aviation security program. Thus, the FAA regards unauthorized disclosure in violation of the regulation as a serious violation that would warrant enforcement action similar to other safety and security violations committed by individuals and air carriers. Conclusion The FAA has determined, after carefully considering the comments submitted in response to the final rule, that no further rulemaking action is necessary at this time. Amendment No. 108-6 remains in effect as prescribed by the July 6, 1989, final rule. Issued in Washington. DC, on June 30, 1993. Bruce R. Butterworth.

ACTION: Notice of funding availability for FY 1993 and procedures for allocating funds and approving housing agency applications. SUMMARY: The purpose of the Rental Voucher and the Rental Certificate Programs is to assist eligible families to pay the rent for decent, safe, and sanitary housing. This notice states the funding allocation available for award of \"fair share\" rental vouchers and rental certificates. The notice identifies the amount of housing assistance budget authority available for each allocation area and HUD Field Office jurisdiction during Fiscal Year 1993. This notice also: (1) Invites Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), herein referred to as housing agencies (HAs), to submit applications for housins assistance funds: (2) Provides instructions to HAs governing the submission of applications; and (3) Describes procedures for rating, ranking, and approving HA applications. DATES: Applications for all funding under this NOFA must be receivedin the HUD Field Office/Indian Programs Office by 3 p.m. local time (i.e., time at the office where the application is submitted) on August 23, 1993. ADDRESSES: The basic application, Form HUD-52515, may be obtained from, and completed applications are to be submitted to, the appropriate HUD Field Office/Indian Programs Office for the jurisdiction in which the applicant is located (see Section 1H, Application Processing, of the NOFA). (Attachment I is the Application form.) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gerald J.

Hearing- or speech-impaired individuals may call HUD's TDD (These telephone numbers are not toll- free.)SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501- 3520), and have been assigned OMB control number 2577-0169. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority The regulations governing the Rental Certificate and the Rental Voucher Programs are published at 24 CFR part 882 and 887, respectively. The regulations for allocating housing assistance budget authority under section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are published at 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. B. Allocation Amounts (1) Housing needs formula. In this fiscal year. approximately $1.077 billion of budget authority for the rental voucher and rental certificate programs is available for fair share formula allocation. This funding will add additional units for HA rental voucher and rental certificate programs. Of this amount, approximately $482 million is for rental vouchers and approximately $545 million is for rental certificates and the balance of $50 million is for the Headquarters Reserve which will not be allocated by formula. This budget authority is being allocated to HUD Field Offices and allocation areas under this NOFA. using the housing needs factors established in accordance with 24 CFR 791,402. For purposes of this NOFA. the Department is using the metropolitan area designations that were in effect prior to December 31, 1992, since detailed census data tabulations for the new metropolitan area designations are not available, yet. (2) Metropolitan/Non-Metropolitan mix. Separate housing needs factors were developed for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan allocation areas within each Field Office jurisdiction. On a nationwide basis, approximately 90 percent of the Fiscal Year 1993 \"fair share\" budget authority for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program is designated for metropolitan areas. The metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority available for use in metropolitan areas and the non- metropolitan housing needs foctors were applied to the housing assistance budgetauthority available for use in non- metropolitan areas. The allocation areas were established to ensure sufficient competition among HAs (including State and regional or multi-county HAs) operating housing programs within the HUD-established allocation areas. (3) Program type. This notice announces the fair share allocation of housing assistance budget authority (See Attachment 6) for the Rental Voucher Program and for the Rental Certificate Program to each Field Office for designated allocation areas, based on the housing needs factors. The allocation of housing assistance budget authority to each allocation area, however, is a total for both programs. The allocations have been structured to give Field Offices flexibility in approving HA applications for the rental voucher program or the rental certificate program. It is not necessary that each allocation area within a Field Office jurisdiction be provided both rental vouchers and rental certificates. This notice also provides, for each allocation area, an estimate of the total number of rental vouchers and rental certificates that could be funded from the housing assistance available in the allocation area. These estimates are based on the average fair market rents for two- bedroom units in the Field Office's jurisdiction. The actual number of units assisted will vary from these estimates in the actual bedroom size mix that is funded in a Fiven area. (4) Potential additional funding. If additional rental voucher or rental certificate funding becomes available for incremental use during Fiscal Year 1993. the Department plans to distribute any additional funding to Field Offices using the same percentage distribution as reflected in Attachment 6 to this NOFA. Any additional funding will be used under the competitive requirements of this NOFA to fund HA applications which were approvable but not funded, or approved and funded at less than 100 percent of the requested amount. C. Family Self-Sufficiency Program Section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 was amended by section 106 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and now requires that all PHAs receiving additional rental vouchers or certificates in FY 1993 must establish a family self-sufficiency (FSS) program. For IHAs, section 106(j) made participation in the FSS program optional for FY 1993 and all future fiscal years. The program guidelines for the FSS program were published in the Federal Register on September 30, 1991I [36808 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices (56 FR 49592). The regulations for the FSS program were published on May 27. 1993. Unless specifically excepted by HUD, any rental voucher or rental certificate funding reserved in FY 93 (except funding for renewals or amendments) will be used to establish the minimum size of a PHA's FSS program. If a PHA received an incentive award for the FSS program in response to the NOFA published in the Federal Register on September 30, 1991 (56 FR 49612) and amended on January 3.1992 (57 FR 312). the number of new units received in FY 93 will be added to the incentive awards received in FY 92 and this number will be the minimum size of the PHA's FSS program. D. HA Eligibility All HAs are invited by this notice to submit applications for the incremental funding for the Rental Voucher Program (24 CFR part 887) and the Rental Certificate Program (24 CFR part 882).

The application may include an explanation of how the application meets, or will meet, the selection criteria listed in this NOFA. B. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors (1) Selection Criterion 1: HA Administrative Capability (45 points). (a) Description: Overall HA administrative ability in the Rental Voucher. Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, as evidenced by factors such as leasing rates and correct administration of housing quality standards (HQS), portability of rental vouchers and rental certificates, compliance with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program requirements, assistance payment computation, and rent reasonableness requirements is either excellent or good. For purposes of this NOFA. an HA administering a Rental Voucher. Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program will not be rated on the administration of its Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the Field Office/Indian Programs Office will rate HA administration of the Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA Is not administering a Rental Voucher. Rental Certificate. Moderate Rehabilitation.Public Housing or Indian Housing Program, the Field Office/Indian Programs Office will assess the administrative capability of the HA based on such factors as experience of staff, support of the HA by the local government, and the HA's administrative experience with non- HUD housing programs. (b) Rating: 21-45 points. Field Office/ Indian Programs Office rates overall HA administration of the Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs (or Public/ Indian Housing or other housing programs) as excellent; there are no serious outstanding management review, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review, or Inspector General audit findings (unless Office of Inspector General recommendation has been appealed by Field Office, Indian Programs Office or Regional Office); the HA is complying with the portability requirements under the rental voucher and rental certificate programs; not more than 15 percent of te units inspected by the Field Office/ Indian Programs Office during the last management review failed to meet housing quality standards (HQS) or the Field Office Is aware of actions taken by the HA to improve its inspection procedures; and the leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates (or occupancy rate for public/Indian housing units) under Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) for one year or more was at least 95 percent as of September 30, 1992. unless Field Office/Indian Programs Office documents that September 30, 1992. report was not reflective of HA performance; 1-20 points. Field Office/Indian Programs Office rates overall HA administration of the Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs (or Public/ Indian Housing or other housing programs) as good; any management review, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review, or Inspector General audit findings are being satisfactorily addressed; the Field Office is aware of some problems with HA administration of portability (e.g.. not responding to billing promptly); not more than 25 percent of the units inspected by the Field Office/Indian Programs Office during the last management review failed to meet HQS or the Field Office is aware of actions taken by the HA to improve its inspection procedures; and the leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates (or occupancy rate for Public/Indian Housing units) under ACC for one year or more was at least85 percent as of September 30, 1992, unless the Field Office/Indian Programs Office documents that the September 30. 1992. report is not reflective of HA performance. 0 points. If neither of the above statements apply, assign 0 points. (c) Field (Mflce/Indian Programs Office Assessments: In assigning points for administrative capability for a State or regional HA application, the Field Office/Indian Programs Office shall determine the HA's leasing rate separately for metropolitan areas and for non-metropolitan areas and use the proportionately weighted applicable rate to score points for administrative capability. If the metropolitan areas portion is much larger than the non- metropolitan areas proportion, more weight must be given to metropolitan areas. If the non-metropolitan areas portion is much larger than the metropolitan areas portion, more weight must be given to non-metropolitan areas. (2) Selection Criterion 2: Underfunding of Housing Needs (35 points). (a) Description: The degree to which the housing needs of the area specified In the HA's application from which the HA draws families to assist (primary area) have previously been underfunded, relative to the needs of other localities within the allocation area, taking into account such factors as the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income renter households eligible for such assistance. The Field Office will. wherever practicable, consider needs being metby all Federally assisted rental housing programs, including the FmHA Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, but will, as a minimum, consider assistance provided under the Rental Voucher Program, the Rental Certificate Program, other Section 8 Programs, and the Public or Indian Housing Program. : In accordance with Notice PIH 91-45 (HUD), the Field Office will notify FmHA of applications it receives and ask that FmHA provide advisory comments concerning the market for additional assisted housing or the possible impact the proposed units may ave on FmHA projects. Applications for which FmHA has provided comments expressing concerns about market need or the continued stability of existing FmHA projects, with which HUD agrees, will receive zero points for this criteria. (b) Rating and Assessment: The Field Office will evaluate whether housing needs in the primary area specified in the application have been underfunded36809 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices with respect to assisted housing provided to other communities in the allocation area, and will assign one of three point-values, as follows: 35 points. Housing needs in the area(s) specified in the application have been severely underfunded. 17 points. Housing needs in the area(s) specified in the application have been moderately underfunded. 0 points. Housing needs in the area(s) specified in the application have received a proportionate share of funding or housing needs have been overfunded. (3) Selection Criterion 3: Local Initiatives (10 points). (a) Description. The application must describe the extent to which HAs demonstrate locally initiated efforts in support of their Rental Voucher and Rental Certificate Programs or comparable tenant-based rental assistance programs. Evaluation of a locality's contribution is measured competitively by the extent to which a ity is able to provide services or cash contributions or demonstrate its intention to provide this kind of support in the future, as compared to services or contributions provided by other localities of like program size. (b) Rating: The Field Office/Indian Program Office will assign one of three point-values, as follows: 10 points: The State or locality provides significant local support (e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 5 points: The State or locality provides minimal local support (e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 0 points: The State or locality does not provide support to the HA's Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. C. Unacceptable Applications (1) After the 14-calendar day technical deficiency correction period (refer to Section IV, Corrections to Deficient Applications, of this NOFA), the Field Office/Indian Programs Office will disapprove HA applications that it determines are not acceptable for processing (refer to Section m(F). Checklist of Technical Requirements, of this NOFA). The Field Office/Indian Programs Office notification of rejection letter must state the basis for the decision. (2) Applications that fall into any of the following categorle will not be processed: (a) The Department of Justice has brought a civil rights suit against the applicant HA, and the suit is pending.(b) There are outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights statutes. Executive Orders, or regulations, as a result of formal administrative proceedings, or the Secretary has issued a charge against the applicant under the Fair Housing Act, unless the applicant Is operating under a conciliation or compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of noncompliance. (c).HUYD has denied application processing under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3), and the HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57). (d) The HA has serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings, or Field Office/Indian Programs Office management review findings for one or more of its Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, or, in the case of an HA that is not currently administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, for its Public Housing Program or Indian Housing (e) e leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates under ACC for at least one year is less than 75 percent, or, in the case of an HA not currently administering a Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, the leasing rate for all units available for occupancy 'in the Public or Indian Housing Program is less than 75 percent. (For a State or regional HA, the Field Office/Indian Programs Office shall determine the HA's leasing rate separately for metropolitan and non-netropolitan areas, and shall use the applicable rate in determining whether to accept the application under this p a1ph.) (f) The HA is involved In tigation and HUD determines that the litigation may seriously impede the ability of the HA to administer an additional increment of rental vouchers or rental certificates. (g) The HA is not in compliance with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular No. A-128 and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 44; or OMB Circular No. A-133, as applicable. D, Local Government Comments Section 213 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 requires that HUD independently determine that there Is a need for the housing assistance requested in applications, and solicit and considercomments relevant to this determination from the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government. The Field Office/Indian Programs Office will obtain section 213 comments from the unit of general local government in accordance with 24 CFR part 791, subpart C, Applications for Housing Assistance in Areas Without Housing Assistance Plans. Comments submitted by the unit of general local government must be considered before an application can be approved. For purposes of expediting the application process, the HA should encourage the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government to submit a letter with the HA application commenting on the HA application in accordance with section 213. Since HUD cannot approve an application until the 30-day comment period is closed, the section 213 letter should not only comment on the application, but also state that HUD may consider the letter to be the final comments and that no additional comments will be forthcoming from the local unit of government. E. Funding Applications (1) Maximum Funding Allowed. The Field Office/Indian Programs Office may not approve funding for an HA under this NOFA for more than the greater of 10 percent of the HA rental vouchers and rental certificates under reservation or 50 units. (2) Minimum Funding Allowed. The Field Office/Indian Programs Office may not approve funding for an HA under this NOFA for less than 25 units, unless: (a) The HA requests fewer then 25 units; or (b) The residual budget authority in using the rank order funding process after funding higher ranked applications is insufficient to fund at least 25 units; or (c) The total budget authority available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units. (3) Funding Procedure. The Field Office must develop a procedure for approval of applications (including applications rated by the Indian Programs Office) for each allocation area in rank order until all the housing assistance budget authority is used. Where a Field Office funds applications according to rank order for each allocation area, only to find it has some number ofunits left, but not enough to fund the next fundable application in its entirety or for the minimum of 25 units, that application can be funded to the extent of the number of units available. The Field Office may elect to approve 100 percent of the units requested in all36810 Federal Register I Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Notices applications that score above a Field Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum number of units allowed. The Field Office may elect to approve less than 100 percent of the units requested in all applications for each allocation area that score above a Field Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum number of units allowed. If applications are to be funded at less than 100 percent of the units requested in the applications, the Field Office must either (i) approve the same percentage of the number of units requested in each application or (ii) divide approvable applications into two categories, for example, those scoring over 40 points, and those scoring 40 points or less. If the Field Office elects to divide applications into two categories, the Field Office may choose to approve a different percentage for applications in each of the two ranking categories so that a higher percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in the higher category and a lower percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in the lower category. The Field Office must approve the same percentage of each application within each of the two ranking categories unless there are insufficient funds to approve the minimum 25 units. If the Field Office is unable to fund all the applications for the minimum funding allowed in either of the two categories, the Field Office must reduce the applicable percentage factor in the category in order to fund all applications for the minimum 25 units (unless the HA requested less than 25 units or the total budget authority available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units). If an HA applies for a specific program (i.e., rental vouchers or rental certificates) and funding for the specified program is not available in the metropolitan area or non-metropolitanallocation area, the Field Office will award the available form of assistance, even though not specifically requested by the applicant. The Field Office must promptly notify the applicable Indian Programs Office for each allocation area as to the status of any application from IHAs and, if applicable, the amount of budget authority to be made available for IHA applications that were rated high enough to receive funding. F. Reallocations of Funds Each Field Office must make every reasonable effort to use all available funds. It may be necessary, however, to reallocate funds from one Field Office to another when the funds are not likely tobe used in the Field Office to which they were initially assigned. In such cases, the following procedures shall be followed: (1) Reallocations within the Same State. If the allocation of funds to a Field Office cannot be awarded within the Field Office jurisdiction during Fiscal Year 1993, the Regional Office must reallocate those funds to another Field Office within the same State where they can be used during Fiscal Year 1993. (2) Reallocation Between States. If a Regional Office cannot use funds within the same State, the Regional Office may request Headquarters approval to reallocate funds to another State within the jurisdiction of the Regional Office. A request for Headquarters approval of a reallocation between States must explain the reasons that funds cannot be used in the original State, the amount being withdrawn from the original State, the program type, the Metropolitan/non- metropolitan mix, and the amount to be reallocated subsequently to each State. These requests must be submitted to Headquarters (ATIENTION: Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian Housing) for approval. (3) Reallocations Between Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan Areas. The Regional Office must follow the original fund assignments for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas when it reallocates unused budget authority. If there are not enough approvable applications for the designated metropolitan or non- metropolitan budget authority, the Regional Office may switch the budget authority between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the same State, provided that an offsetting switch can be made in another State within the same Region. If an offsetting switch cannot be made and the metropolitan or non-metropolitan amounts require changes to the regional fund assignments, the Regional Office must obtain the approval of the Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian Housing, before switching budget authority between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area. G. Notification of Funds Awarded (1) After the Field Offices have reviewed, rated, and ranked applications, and the Field Offices and Offices of Indian Programs have approved the applications, Regional Offices must submit to Headquarters a list of all approved applications, listed by Field Office. The Regional Office application approval list is due inHeadquarters (Attention: Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and Indian Housing) on the tenth working day following the date set by Headquarters for completion of application ranking and selections. (2) The Regional Offices must provide the following information for each application approved: (a) the nine and address of the HA; (b) The project number, and the number of rental vouchers and the number of rental certificates, as applicable, approved for the HA; and (c) The amount of contract authority and budget authority, stated separately for rental vouchers and rental certificates. H. Administrative Fees (1) The administrative fees for Incremental units in the Fiscal Year 1993 appropriations are specified as follows: (a) FY 1993 Incremental (Fees Provided by FY 1993 FY Opt-outs/Public Housing Demolition (Replacements and Relocation) Section 23 Conversions: Rental Rental car- vouchers (c) of Rental Vouchers and Rental Rental cer- preparation, submission of requisitions, and approving year-end operating statements, HAs should use the August 3. 1990, Housing Notice (H-9O-53), Administrative Fee Requirements for the Housing Voucher and Certificate Programs, to determine the blended rate for all rental voucher or rental certificate increments for a given HA.36811 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 /'Notices L Headquarters Reserve The Department is retaining in a Headquarters Reserve approximately $50 million of the $1.077 billion of budget authority available for allocation by formula for rental vouchers and rental certificates. Funds in the Headquarters Reserve will not be allocated by formula because these funds will be used in connection with natural disasters, litigation, desegregation, and other housing emergencies, consistent with 24 CFR 791.407. Headquarters will notify HAs when they are eligible to receive assistance from the Headquarters Reserve and may invite the HAs to submit applications. J. Other Allocations In addition to the budget authority for \"fair share\" rental vouchers and rental certificates, $7.565 billion of additional budget authority (including carryover budget authority) is available for allocation in Fiscal Year 1993 involving up to six cities with populations over 400,000, in metropolitan areas of over 1,500,000 population. HUD will conduct a national competition for Section 8 funding. The criteria will be published in a NOFA. (Approximately 1,856 units and $67.7 million in budget authority.) (9) Family Unification Demonstration-National Competition. Headquarters will allocate funding to assist families with children for whom the lack of adequate shelter is a primary factor which would result in theimminent placement of the family's child, or children, in out-of-home care or delay in the discharge of the child, or children, to the family from out-of-home care. HUD will conduct a national competition for Section 8 funding. The criteria will be published in a NOFA. (Approximately 2,244 units and $73 million in budget authority.) (10) Homeless Persons with Disabilities. Headquarters will allocate funding to Field Offices to provide Section 8 rental vouchers, in conjunction with supportive services from other Federal, State, or local sources, to homeless persons with disabilities.

Headquarters will allocate funding to provide Section 8 rental certificates based on a Congressional mandate for a multi- cultural tenant empowerment and homeownership project to be located in the District of Columbia. (Approximately 205 units and $20 million in budget authority.) (13) Disaster Funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Headquarters allocated funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for rental vouchers to the Department to assist very low- income families who were rendered homeless as a result of Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki. (Approximately 2,459 units and $32 million in budget authority.) III. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements A.

Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (TDDIVoice). (This Is not a toll-fre number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains. F. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the \"Byrd Amendment\") and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds forlobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. G. Section 112 of the Reform Act Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b). Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts-those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Departmentand those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or If they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. Section 13 was-implemented by final rule published in the Federal Register on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Any questions about the rule should be forwarded to the Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (TDDNoice) (this is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office. Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437c, 1437.

July 8, 1993 Title 3- Proclamation 6579 of Muly 4, 1993 The President To Implement an Accelerated Tariff Schedule of Duty Elimi- natioi and To Modify Rules d Origin Under the United Stas.Canada Free-Trade Agreement By the President of the United States of America A P rolamation 1. On Jamary 2, 19W, the President entered into the United States-Canada Free-Trade. Agreement (\"the Agraement!'). The Agreement and certain letters exchanged between the Governments of Canada and the United States were approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementatioo Act of 1988 (\"Implementation Act\"), Public Law 100-449. The Agreement entered into force on January 1, 1989. 2. Section 201(b} of the Imprementatfon Act grants the President, subject to the consultation and lay-over requirements of section 103(a) of the Imple- mentation Act, the authority to proclaim such modifications as to which the United States and Canada may agree regarding the staging of any duty treatment set forth in Annexes 401.2 and 401.7 to the Agreement as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Canada provided for by the Agreement. 3. Consistent with Article 401(5) of the Agreement, I, through my duly empowered representative, on June 30, 1993, entered into, an agreement with the Government of Canade providing an accelerated schedule of duty elimination fbr specific goods of Annex 4Nf1.2 to the Agreement. The consulta-tfean aiy-over requirements of sectitb 103(a) of the Implementation Act with respect to suic schedule have been complied with. 4. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the Implementation Act, I have determined that the modifications heceinafter pclaimed to existing duties on goods omiginatimg in the territory ed Canada an necessary or appropriate to maintain the general levet of reciptoca and xmttally advantageous concessions with respect to Canada provided fhr by the Agreement and to carry out the agreement with Canada providingan, accelerated schedule of duty elimination for specific goods of Annex 401.2 to the Agreement. 5. Section 202(d)(1) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President 'lo proclaim, as. a part of the Haimontzed Commodity Description and Coding System. implemented by the Uniwd States as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the Umted States (\"HTS\"I, the rules of origin set forth in. Annex 301.2 of the Agreement. Section 2021d(2.) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim. subject to the consultation and lay-over require- menu of' section TOaY of the Implementation Act, such modifications toth. rules' as may from time to time be agreed to by the United States and Canada. I have decided, pursuant to an agreement entered into on June 3V, 193', between the Unfted States and Canada, that certain modifica- tions in the Agreement's rules of origin for particular goods of the HTS should be proclaimed as a part of the HTS. The consultation and lay- over requirements of section 103 of the Implementation Act with respect to such modifications have been complied with. 36840 Federal Register / Vol. 58, No. 129 / Thursday, July 8, 1993 / Presidential Documents 6. Section 201(a) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications to or continuance of existing duties, such con- tinuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out Article 401 of the Agreement and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada set forth in Annexes 401.2 and 401.7 to the Agreement. 7. Proclamation 6515 of December 16, 1992, among other actions, provided for the continuation of previously proclaimed staged duty reductions on Canadian goods in the HTS provisions modified in Annex I to Proclamation 6515. An error was made concerning the staged reductions for HTS sub- heading 4421.90.95. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary and appro- priate to correct this error. 8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, and sections 201 and 202 of the Implementation Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to provide for an accelerated schedule of duty elimination for specific goods of Annex 401.2 to the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and to modify the rules of origin for certain goods under the Agreement, the tariff treatment provided for in the HTS for certain goods originating in the territory of Canada and general note 3(c)(vii) to the HTS are modified as provided in sections A and B of the Annex to this proclama- tion. (2) In order to correct the continued staged duty reductions on Canadian goods provided for in HTS subheading 4421.90.95, the HTS is modified as set forth in section C of the Annex to this proclamation. (3) In order to implement accelerated elimination of the rate of duty otherwise applicable under section 466 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to the equipments, or any part thereof, including boats, originating in the territory of Canada and the expenses of repairs made in the territory of Canada upon U.S.-documented vessels (other than civil aircraft, as defined in general note 3(c)(iv) of the HTS)), such equipments, parts (including boats), and expenses of repairs shall be subject to duty at a rate of free, effective with respect to any U.S.-documented vessel arriving in any port of the United States on or after the date specified in a notice by the United States Trade Representative and published in the Federal Register. (4) Any provisions of previous proclamations inconsistent with the provi- sions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. (5) The modifications made by paragraph (1) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in sections A and B of the Annex to this proclamation. (6) The modifications made by paragraph (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in section C of the Annex to this proclamation.
