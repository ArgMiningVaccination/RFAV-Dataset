Here, we analyzedgene expression in mammalian stem cells and cellsat various stages of differentiation. We nd that,conserved across species, stem cells express a sub-set of genes previously classied as interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs) but that expression is intrinsic, as stem cells are refractory to interferon.This intrinsic ISG expression varies in a cell-type-specic manner, and many ISGs decrease upondifferentiation, at which time cells become IFNresponsive, allowing induction of a broad spectrumof ISGs by IFN signaling. Importantly, we show thatintrinsically expressed ISGs protect stem cells against viral infection. We demonstrate the in vivo importance of intrinsic ISG expression for protectingstem cells and their differentiation potential duringviral infection. These ndings have intriguing implica-tions for understanding stem cell biology and theevolution of pathogen resistance. INTRODUCTION Over four decades ago, researchers made a curious observation that pluripotent, but not differentiated teratocarcinoma cellswere resistant to murine polyomavirus infection ( Swartzendruber and Lehman, 1975 ). Since then, others have made similar obser- vations with a diverse array of viruses and tissue stem cells, sug-gesting that resistance to viral infection is a general property of pluri-/multipotent cells ( Belzile et al., 2014; Gonczo \u00a8l et et al., 1999; Villa et al., 2016; Weichold et al., 1998;Wolf and Goff, 2009 ). Myxoma virus, for example, a therapeutic oncolytic poxvirus, infects differentiated human monocytes,B cells, and natural killer cells but does not infect the hematopoi- etic stem cells (HSCs) from which those cells derive ( Villa et al., 2016 ). Still, the mechanism by which these progenitor cells resist viral infection remains unexplained. In most cells, interferon (IFN) response is a major rst line of defense against viral infection. Viral infection triggers production of IFNs, which then bind to ubiquitously expressed receptors on nearby cells and induce a powerful transcriptional programcomprising hundreds of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)(Schneider et al., 2014 ). Unlike most cells, however, pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryonic carcinoma cells do not produce type I IFN in response to viral infection or treat-ment with poly(I:C) ( Burke et al., 1978 ), and they respond weakly to exogenous IFN ( Hong and Carmichael, 2013 ). This suggests that pluripotent cells do not rely on canonical IFN signaling forantiviral protection. Consistent with this, it was recently reported that mouse ESCs (mESCs) use an IFN-independent RNA interference-basedmechanism for antiviral defense Maillard et al., 2013 ). Neverthe- less, a protein-based defense via ISGs may still be important. We were previously intrigued to nd that two classic ISGs (IFITM1and IFI30) are highly expressed in human ESCs (hESCs), their expression progressively decreases hESC into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) ( Wu et al., 2012 ). This suggests that ISG expression may relate to pluripotency. In this study, we used a variety of viruses and stem cells of different lineages and differentiation potential to better dene the role that these intrinsically expressed ISGs play in defendingpluri-/multipotent cells from viral infection. We found that like hESCs, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), germ layer cells, and tissue stem cells all intrinsically express canonical ISGs.Importantly, different types of stem cells display distinct ISG sig-natures and many of these ISGs decrease as cells terminally differentiate. Further, by knocking out several of these ISGs, we show that intrinsically expressed ISGs are indeed importantfor protecting stem cells from viral infection. Finally, we used a chimeric mouse model to demonstrate the importance of pro- tecting human stem cells from viral infection. Without the Cell172, 423-438, January 25, 2018 \u00aa2017 Elsevier Inc. 423expression of critical ISGs, stem cells are susceptible to infection and fail to regenerate tissues after viral challenge. RESULTSIntrinsic Expression of ISGs in Pluripotent and Multipotent Human Stem CellsWe rst sought to more thoroughly dene how pluripotency cor- relates with resistance to viral infection. do chal- lenged pluripotent hESC, multipotent endoderm cells, diverse panel of viruses, including positive-strand RNA viruses from the flavivirus family including dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus(ZIKV), as well as several negative-strand RNA viruses includingvesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and respiratory virus (RSV). We found that while differ- entiated HLCs were highly permissive to infection, multipotentendoderm cells were only partially permissive, and pluripotent hESCs were highly resistant ( Figure S1 A). Of the viruses we tested, it is well known that DENV and VSV have broad tissue tropism ( Anderson, 2003; Finkelshtein et al., 2013 ), suggesting that their entry might depend on ubiquitously expressed factors. Their inability to infect pluripotent and earlyprogenitor cells therefore suggests these cell types may express antiviral factors. To test this, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptome analyses on two ESC and two iPSClines. We found an overlapping set of ISGs that was highly ex-pressed by all lines ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1B). This is consistent with a previous study showing that IFITM1 is highly expressed by hESC ( Grow et al., 2015 ). Western high baseline expression in the stem cells, similar to the levels achieved in HLCs after IFN- bstimulation ( Figure 1 C). APOBEC3G ,MX1/2 , OAS1-3 ,RSAD2 , of the IFIT family were not expressed ( Figure 1 B). Nevertheless, representatives of these unexpressed ISGs were readily induced in HLCs by IFN- b (Figure 1 C). These results raised the possibility that expression of a subset of ISGs is an intrinsic property of ESC/iPSCs. It is also possible,however, that a component of the stem cell medium (mTeSR1) directly induced ISGs and/or that ESC/iPSCs do in fact produce and respond to IFN leading to ISG expression. We tested thesepossibilities by culturing HLCs in the conditioned mTeSR1 but found that select ISGs were not induced ( Figure 1 D). Moreover, even in the presence of effective concentrations of IFN-neutral-izing antibody, ISG expression was stable ( Figure S1 C). These results indicate that ISG expression is not due to IFN expression and are consistent with a previous study showing that IFNresponse is severely attenuated in ESC/iPSCs multipotent endoderm cells also largely resistant to viral infection ( Figure S1 A). This suggested that they too might express ISGs. In order to measure ISG expression in each of the three multipotent germ layers, we differentiated hESCs into endoderm (END), ectoderm (ECT) ( D). Using RNA-seq, we found that like hESCs, all three germ layers showed high expressionof many ISGs ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Many of the highly expressed ISGs such as BST2 ,DDX3X ,EIF3L , and IFITM family members showed comparable protein levels across the three germ layers and the parental ESCs. Other ISGs, however, showedgerm-layer-specic expression patterns. SERPINB9 ,CCL2 , were highly in END; SAT1 and TIMP1 were expressed in MES; and UBE2L6 and TXNIP were expressed in ECT ( Figures 1 F-1H). Overall, we found that different germ layers have distinct ISG signatures, and, like ESCs, each cell type highly expresses only a subfraction of the known ISGs. Distinct ISG Expression Patterns in Different Tissue Stem CellsWe next examined expression of ISGs in tissue stem cells. We began by differentiating hESCs into three types of tissue stem cells derived from the three germ layers: pancreatic stem cells(PSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and neural stem cells (NSCs) ( Figure 2 A). Additional markers were conrmed by qRT-PCR ( Figure S2 A), and multipotency was conrmed by their ability to further terminally differentiate ( Figure S2 B). We then performed RNA-seq to assess gene expression in the three tissue stem cells. We found that each tissue stem cell typeexpressed a number of ISGs at high levels, and their expressionpattern differed from those of the germ layers and ESCs ( Figures 2B-2E, S2C, and S2D). levels of IDO1 ,SLC16A1 , and BST2 than tissue stem cells. Like- wise, several ISGs including CDKN1A andCOMMD3 were highly expressed in tissue stem cells but not in ESCs. Further, between tissue stem cell type, each had a distinguishable ISG signature.CD74 ,SERPING1 , and FZD5 , ex- pressed in PSCs, whereas SERPINE1 andCCL2 were highly ex- pressed in MSCs. To conrm these observations in vivo , we extended our ana- lyses to primary tissue stem cells. We isolated HSCs from four different sources: bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), um- bilical cord blood (CB), and fetal liver (FL). We found that primaryHSCs expressed numerous ISGs at high levels and their ISG sig- natures were consistent across donors, but varied among different tissue sites ( Figures 2 F, 2G, and S2E). Analyses of a published dataset for MSCs isolated from placenta (PL) and BM yielded similar observations ( Roson-Burgo et al., 2014 )(Fig- ure S2 F). Again, intercellular comparison suggested diverging ISG patterns between primary HSCs MSCs ( Fig- ures 2 H and what we observed in hESC-derived stem cells. ISG Expression Changes during Terminal Differentiation of hESCsDifferentiation of hESCs into HLCs is accompanied by a pro-gressive loss of antiviral resistance ( Figure S1 A). This raised the possibility that decreased antiviral resistance during dif- ferentiation may associate with changes in ISG expressionpatterns. To test this, we differentiated hESCs toward different tissue types and monitored ISG expression during stages of differentiation. We began by differentiating hESCs toward pancreatic b-like cells (Im- b). Through the process, we conrmed differentiation 424 Cell172, 423-438, January 25, 2018Figure 1.

We conrmed the expression changes of these ISGs by western blot and qRT-PCR ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Due to dramatic differences in gene expression patterns betweencells during differentiation, for qRT-PCR, expression levelswere normalized to a panel of housekeeping genes ( Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013 ), all of which were stably expressed ( Fig- ure S3 C). Interestingly, we also found that cells at each stage also displayed high expression of a subgroup of ISGs ( Fig- ure S3 J). We next performed an analogous set of experiments by differentiating hESCs into HLCs and obtained similar results(Figures S4 A-S4E). b-like cell and HLC are within the endoderm lineage. We next tested whether a similar dynamic pattern ofISG expression occurs when hESCs are differentiated into theother two lineages\u2014mesoderm and ectoderm. Indeed, we found that many ISGs highly expressed in hESCs decreased along the mesoderm lineage when hESCs were differentiated into eithermyobroblasts into neuron-likecells (NEU) ( Figures 3 H-3J and S3G-S3I). Similarly, cells at each differentiation stage also displayed high expression of a subgroup of ISGs ( Figures S3 K-S3L). ISGs Expression Changes during Development of Human Tissue Stem Cells In Vivo To exclude the possibility that the changes observed in ISG expression were an artifact of cell-culture manipulations, we extended our analysis to primary cells isolated from hu-man FL. The FL is enriched in both HSCs and their derivatives including cells from morphologically distinct and successive develop-mental stages: and erythroblasts(Ortho). isolated these cell populations using our recentlydescribed method ( Hu et al., 2013 ) and further conrmed their identity using RNA-seq and Giemsa staining ( Figures 4 A and 4B). As expected, that HSC-specic transcription fac-tors, including GFI1 ,SPI1 ,GATA4 , were highly of erythrocyte-specic markers GYPA ,SLC4A1 , and HBG1 progressively increased during dif- ferentiation to the Ortho stage ( Figure 4 C). Similar to in vitro observations, expression of ISGs displayed dynamic changes: many ISGs were highly expressed in HSCsin vivo , but not in further differentiated cells; some remained sta- ble across differentiation, while very few were expressed at rela- tively higher levels at later stages ( Figure 4 D). For example, most of the ISGs highly expressed in HSCs, , and CCL2 , were expressed at lower levels in Pro cells, as further conrmed by western blot and qRT-PCR ( Figures 4 E and 4F). In contrast to ISGs, housekeeping gene expression was sta-ble in all six cell populations (data not shown). These results agree with our ndings in cell culture and show that stem cellsmaintain high expression levels a subgroup of ISGs in vivo and that these genes display changing expression patterns as the stem cells differentiate. Conserved ISG Expression in Stem Cells across Species We then investigated whether ISG expression in stem cells is conserved across species. To test this, we analyzed publishedtranscriptomic data obtained from mESC lines derived from different mouse strains ( Klattenhoff et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Wamstad et al., 2012 ) for expression levels of a set of known mouse ISGs ( Table S2 ). Like subset of ISGs at high levels ( Figure S5 B). Similar intrinsic expression of ISGs was also observed in iPSCs of chimpanzee ( Marchetto et al., 2013 )(Figure S5 A). Interest- ingly, while many of the ISGs highly expressed in hESCs differed from those highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells from mouse and chimpanzee, some ISGs such as BST2 ,MOV10 , and members of the IFITM family were highly expressed in ESCs from all three species ( Figure S5 C). Also, like hESCs, many ISGs highly expressed in mESCs appear to decreaseupon terminal differentiation ( Wamstad et al., 2012 )(Figures S5D and S5E). These data suggest that intrinsic ISG expression is a conserved property of mammalian stem cells. The elevated expression of distinct ISG subsets in each stem cell lineage rather than the full ISG repertoire suggests distinct transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. To understand the differ- ential regulation of ISGs in stem cells and during differentiation,we then analyzed published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from differentiation of mESCs ( Wamstad et al., 2012 ). We found that, in mESCs, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac modications (associated with active promoters and/or enhancers) were enriched at the promoters and/or enhancers of highly expressed ISGs (e.g., IFITM3 also made from hESCs ( Figure S5 H). During terminal differentiation, dynamic changes these epigenetic modications correlated with ISGexpression ( Figure S5 F). These analyses suggest that chromatin modications may be involved in the differential regulation of ISGs. Antiviral Activity of ISGs in Undifferentiated Human ESCsWe next tested whether ISGs expressed in ESCs confer resis- tance to viral infection. For this, we chose to knock out IFITM genes because these ISGs have well-known antiviral activity(Bailey et al., 2014 ) and were highly expressed in most of the stem cells we analyzed. The IFITM gene family includes, among others, IFITM1 , IFITM2 , and IFITM3 , all of which share high sequence homology. As a result, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that targeted the IFITM3 locus yielded KO23and KO123, respectively ( Figure 5 A). Loss of these genes did not alter the expression of pluripotent markers nor did it affect cell growth rates. Most importantly, the IFITM KO hESCs retained the capacity to differentiate into the three germ layers ( Figures S6 A-S6C). These results are consistent with Cell172, 423-438, January 25, 2018 427(legend on next page) 428 Cell172, 423-438, January 25, 2018observations made in Itm KO mice, which are viable and devel- opmentally normal ( Lange et al., 2008 ). To determine whether these ISGs were critical for ESC resis- tance to viral infection, we exposed wild-type (WT) KO hESC clones to DENV. Unlike WT hESCs, we found that both the double and triple IFITM KO clones were now highly permissive to DENV infection ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Next, to address concerns of off-target effects, we reconstituted theIFITM KO clones with IFITM3 and found that this protein alone was sufcient to restore partial resistance to DENV infection (Figure 5 B). We then extended these observations to a panel of human viral pathogens. We analyzed four respiratory viruses (influenza A virus [IAV] strains A/WSN/33 [WSN] and A/swine/Texas/98[SW98], RSV, additional flaviviruses (YFV, West Nile virus [WNV], and ZIKV), and (NDV). Again, except for hPIV3 ( Fig- ure S6 D), we found that the IFITM KO hESCs were strikingly more permissive to viral infection than WT cells ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Of the viruses tested, the flaviviruses were the most affected. WT ESCs were almost completely resistant to infectionby DENV, WNV, and YFV, and to a lesser extent by ZIKV. On the other hand, 65%-85% of the IFITM triple KO cells labeled posi- tive for viral antigens ( Figure 5 D). We further conrmed these re- sults in a second hESC line, using IFITM proteins expression ( Figures S6E-S6G). Together, these results provide proof of principle that ISGs expressed in pluripotent stem cells can indeed be functionally antiviral. Antiviral Activity of ISGs in Primary and hESC-Derived Multipotent Tissue Stem Cells We then extended our analyses to tissue stem cells, analyzing the effects of ISGs on viral infection in NSCs. As seen for hESCs,marker expression, cell growth rates, and the capacity to differ- entiate into neuronal cells were not affected by the loss of IFITM genes ( Figures S6 H and S6I). We then challenged WT and IFITM KO NSCs Figure 5 E). ZIKV is also neuro- tropic\u2014it has been linked to microcephaly and serious neurolog- ical complications, and it was recently demonstrated to infectNSCs ( Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016 ). Again, triple IFITM KO NSCs were signicantly more susceptible to ZIKV infection. We made similar observations when we infected WT andIFITM KO NSCs with YFV-17D, a live-attenuated vaccine strain, which in rare cases can cause encephalitis ( McMahon et al., 2007 )(Figure 5 E).In addition to the flaviviruses, we tested several neuroinvasive viruses, VSV, where both dou- ble and triple IFITM KO were more susceptible to infection, for VSV and VEEV, only the triple IFITM KO cells showed increased susceptibility ( Figures 5 F and S6J). This suggests that VSV and VEEV are most sensitive to inhibition by IFITM1, with IFITM2 and IFITM3 having less antiviral activity. Next, we developed a co-culture system comprising NSCs and neurons to more dramatically visualize the antiviral capac- ity of ISGs in tissue stem cells. We established this co-culturesystem by culturing hESC-derived NSCs under conditions where NSCs give to additional NSCs\u2014through self- renewal\u2014and to differentiated neurons ( Figure 5 G). Using this system, we generated WT-derived and IFITM KO-derived co- cultures and then infected them with WNV. In the WT co-cul- tures, infection occurred primarily in differentiated neuronalcells, where approximately 50% of the neuronal cells were in-fected, while less than 1% of the WT NSCs were infected. However, infection of the IFITM KO co-cultures was dramati- cally different. While KO neuronal cells were similarly suscepti-ble to infection as WT cells, the IFITM KO NSCs were now highly susceptible to WNV infection, with /C2470% becoming in- fected ( Figure 5 H). This suggests that IFITM proteins are criti- cally important for protecting NSCs from infection with WNV. Similar results were obtained when cultures were infected with YFV-17D ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Finally, we extended this analysis to primary human tissue stem cells. Silencing p21/CDKN1A , one of the most highly ex- pressed ISGs in MSCs, specically increased their susceptibilityto chikungunya 5 I-5J), which mainly tar- gets MSC-derived tissue (e.g., muscles and joints) in both hu- mans and mice ( Couderc et al., 2008 ). Infection by YFV or ZIKV in MSCs was not affected by p21/CDKN1A silencing, whereas of IFITM3 in MSCs increased their siveness ( Figure 5 J). However, neither p21/CDKN1A norIFITM3 was critical for the self-renewal and terminal differentiation ofMSCs ( Figures S6 K and 5L), a virus that infects a variety of differentiated he- matopoietic cells, including macrophages and megakaryocytes(Theolopoulos et al., 1976 ). Interestingly, in co-culture experi- ments with HSCs and their differentiated progeny, signicantly more differentiated erythroid cells (Pro, E-Baso, and L-Baso)were infected by DENV than HSCs ( Figures 5 M and 5N). permissiveness between HSCs and , since knockdown of this in enhanced DENV infection of the HSCs ( Figure 5 O).

To understand how these differences affect the antiviral state of the cells, we monitored DENV infection in hESCs and hESC- derived HLCs, with and without IFN pre-stimulation, in bothWT and IFITM KO cells. Consistent with our previous results, WT ESCs were completely resistant to DENV infection, while IFITM KO ESCs were highly permissive, irrespective of whether they had been pre-treated with IFN ( Figure 6 A). As seen previ- ously, HLCs were highly permissive to DENV infection. In HLCs, pre-treatment with IFN- bstrongly inhibited the infection in both WT and IFITM KO cells, likely through induction of ISGs such as MX1 ,IFITM3 (in WT cells), and others ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Thus, in the absence of IFITM proteins, induction of other ISGs (e.g., IFI6) can provide protection against DENV ( Figure 6 C). The failure of IFN pre-treatment to reduce DENV infection in theIFITM KO ESCs is not likely due to an inability of IFN- bto induce IFITM proteins, but rather a general lack of response to IFN, as we did not observe robust induction of any ISG in these cells(Figures 6 A and 6B). We also compared antiviral protection of IFN in FL-derived pri- mary HSCs and three erythroid D). Without pre-treatment with IFN- b, differen- tiated progeny were more permissive to DENV infection, compared to HSCs from which they derive. Pre-treatment withIFN-b, however, strongly inhibited the infection in the three differ- entiation intermediates, but not in HSCs ( Figure 6 E). Again, dif- ferential protection is likely due to different responses to IFN- b stimulation, as demonstrated by strong induction of ISGs suchasMX1 ,IFITM3 and others in the three progeny, but not in HSCs. This was further supported by the nding that induction of other ISGs, than in differentiated progeny following IFN-btreatment ( Figure 6 F). Taken together, these results demonstrated the existence of two distinct, cell-stage-specic antiviral mechanisms. Stem cells, including ESCs and various tissue stem cells, show an attenuated IFN response but instead constitutively maintainelevated levels of select ISGs to function as prophylactic media-tors of an antiviral protection. In contrast, terminally differenti- ated cells respond to IFN, leading to ISG induction and broad viral resistance. ISGs Protect Stem Cells from Viral Infection during DevelopmentFinally, to further validate our ndings in a physiological context, we tested whether ISGs could protect primary stem cells from viral infections and preserve their differentiation potentialex vivo and in vivo . To this end, we used shRNAs to knock down IFITM genes in human FL-derived primary HSCs ( Figures 7A and 7B). We then exposed control (CTRL) and IFITM knock- down (KD) primary HSCs to IAV or DENV and tested their ability to form colonies and to differentiate into erythrocytes or macro- phages. We found that, with pre-exposure to virus, KD HSCs produced fewer colonies and fewer differentiated erythrocytesand macrophages to CTRL HSCs ( and in these assays ( S7 next CTRL and KD HSCs into immunodecient mice to test these re- sults could be recapitulated in vivo . Similar to the ex vivo results described above, we found that both CTRL and KD HSCs differ-entiated with could reconstitute hematopoietic cells in PB ( Figure 7 E). Further, pre- exposure to IAV severely reduced the ability of KD HSCs to yieldhematopoietic cells in the periphery, whereas CTRL HSCs wereminimally affected. This difference was not due to reconstitution kinetics in KD HSCs, since reconstitution re- mained as late at 12 weeks post-transplantation ( Fig- ure 7 F). We also observed fewer human CD45 +cells (mainly B cells and myeloid cells, Figure S7 F) in the femoral BM transplanted with KD HSCs pre-exposed to IAV ( Figure 7 G). To further probe the basis of these defects, we analyzed both human (CD34+/CD38-) and mouse (Sca-1+/c-KIT+) HSC popula- tions in the BM of recipient mice ( Figure S7 G). All groups had a similar overall frequency of mouse HSCs ( Figure S7 H); however, there were fewer human mice transplanted with KD HSCs pre-exposed to IAV ( Figure 7 H). that the de- fects in hematopoietic cell reconstitution we observed in PBwere likely due to a reduction in the number of human HSCs in BM. Together these results show that, by protecting stem cells from viral infection, ISGs can facilitate hematopoietic repopula-tion by HSCs. DISCUSSIONOur study demonstrates, rather surprisingly, that mammalian stem cells intrinsically express a subset of ISGs at high levels,which differ by stem cell type. We show that several of these ISGs protect stem cells from viral infection, and that knocking out the IFITM family ISGs renders stem cells susceptible to infec- tion by a variety of viruses. In this study, we focused attention on ISGs given their known roles in innate antiviral immunity. As discussed below, we believe there is strong biological justication for protecting stem cellsfrom the deleterious effects of pathogen infection. However, it is highly likely that other genes, not designated as ISGs and yet to be discovered, also confer intrinsic pathogen resistance Figure 4.

Why Should Stem Cells Be Intrinsically Protected? As the operational units for growth and regeneration, stem cellsare essential for tissue maintenance and repair ( Weissman, 2000 ). To carry out their functions, they must communicate with their surroundings and be protected from damage andloss. Their ability to communicate with their surroundings and respond to extracellular cues is facilitated by their microenviron-ments\u2014stem cell niches\u2014which are often in close proximity to the blood supply ( Doetsch et al., 1999; Kiel et al., 2005 ). Some stem cells even circulate in PB ( Kuznetsov et al., 2001; Saiura et al., 2001 ). But access to the blood comes with increased risks of exposure to pathogens. Several recent ndings highlight the fact that stem cells are often at risk of viral infection. In vivo studies, for example, have Figure 5.

Similarly, recent studies showed that ZIKV infects human (Tang et al., 2016 ) and mouse NSCs ( Li et al., 2016 ).Loss of stem cells from viral infection can have severe conse- quences. For example, infection of early human embryos byrubella virus can destroy a fetus in utero or cause severe congen- ital defects ( Naeye and Blanc, 1965 ). HIV or CMV infection of Figure 7.

Our transplantation ex- periments showed that removing the intrinsic protection ofHSCs by IFITM KD prior to exposure to IAV can severely diminish hematopoiesis in vivo . Why Do Stem Cells Exhibit Intrinsic ISG Expression Rather Than IFN Inducible Expression? Given that stem cells are rare yet critical for tissue maintenanceand repair, they may express ISGs intrinsically to preempt viralinfection. If so, this may explain why many types of stem cells specically express ISGs such as CDKN1A and members of IFITM family that act on early steps of viral life cycle and block viruses before they can establish infection ( Schoggins et al., 2011 ). We found that through constitutive ISG expression hESCs maintain a persistent and efcient antiviral status, renderingthem highly resistant to infection by a panel of viruses. Such anti- viral potency is even stronger than that induced by IFN stimula- tion in differentiated cells. However, while this may explain why stem cells intrinsically express ISGs, it does not explain why they are refractory to IFN and fail to induce the full spectrum of ISGs when IFN is pre-sent. There are several reasons why stem cells may need to berefractory to IFN. For one, IFN has well-known anti-proliferative activity mediated by a subset of ISGs, which would be incompat- ible with a stem cell's role in self-renewal, tissue regeneration,and repair ( Borden et al., 1982 ). Of note, we did not detect expression of ISGs such as IFIT1 ,CH25H , or members of the OAS family, which have well-known anti-proliferative activity (de Veer et al., 2001 ), in any of the stem cell ISG signatures tested. Further, we found that IFN had strong anti-proliferative effects on differentiated hematopoietic cells, but not on HSCs(data not shown). This resistance to IFN-mediated anti-prolifera-tive responses could be important for maintaining a functional stem cell niche during both acute and chronic infection. IFN treatment can also sensitize cells to apoptosis upon sub- sequent viral infection. It could be deleterious for these pro- apoptotic genes to be expressed in stem cells. In line with this speculation, none of the stem cells we analyzed highly ex-pressed ISGs with known pro-apoptotic activity (e.g., ISG12 , TRAIL , and TNFSF10 )(de Veer et al., 2001 ). Finally, IFN has been shown to stimulate differentiation ( Hert- zog et al., 1994 ), suggesting that stem cells may dampen their IFN response to maintain pluri-/multipotency. A recent study showed that under normal physiological conditions, a low levelof IFN stimulates very low differentiation dormant HSCs HSC dif- ferentiation during chronic infection could lead to impaired stem cell function. Disruption of such ne-tuning has been implicatedin the pathophysiology of BM suppression in patients with infec- tions such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS ( Castella et al., 1985; Singh et al., 2001 ). Why Is ISG Expression Inducible Rather Than Intrinsic in Terminally Differentiated Cells?Innate immune signaling pathways can be dismantled by vi- ruses. There are numerous examples of viral proteins thatdegrade, inhibit, or sequester different components of the IFN can determine the species and tissue tropism of viruses and the outcome of infection ( Douam et al., 2015 ). Constitutive expression of the full spectrum of antiviral ISGs in differentiated cells, which often reside at the portals of pathogen encounters, would subject this important multi-pronged host defense system to constant pathogen surveillanceand the possible selection of resistant, disease-causing variants. In the context of an infection, a mix of intrinsic and inducible innate antiviral defenses could have multiple benets. First, thepathogen detection and innate response capabilities of differen- tiated cells is not uniform. Heterogeneity of transcriptional re- sponses has been observed during inducible IFN stimulationand ascribed to stochastic variation in what otherwise appear to be identical differentiated cells ( Shalek et al., 2014 ). Such vari- ation may be contributed by a relatively small fraction of virus-susceptible cells that initiate the response and eventuallydisseminate an alarm signal through the population via paracrine responses to IFN. These ''sentinels'' could be important for the host to sense and respond to initial viral infection. InducibleISG expression in the majority of differentiated cells would allow the host to unleash the full spectrum of ISGs to dampen local vi- rus infection and spread. We found that, in the IFITM KO HLCs, IFN was still able to exert an efcient antiviral state against DENV infection. This protection occurs through induction of other ISGs that have redundant and/or complementary anti-DENV activityto that of the IFITMs . Unlike in stem cells, a low level of direct virus-induced killing of initially infected cells or in cell primed by IFN should be tolerable in differentiated cells provided thatstem cells are protected and capable of replenishing thiscompartment. Interestingly, during ex vivo differentiation of hESCs, we found that cells at terminal stage also displayed relatively high expres-sion of some ISGs. However, this high ISG expression phenotype was signicantly less pronounced during in vivo dif- ferentiation of HSCs. Recently, some studies have shown highexpression of certain ISGs in terminally differentiated primary cells ( Allen et al., 2017; Laguette et al., 2011 ). For example, we found that hESC-derived macrophages intrinsically expressedSAMHD1, a well-known antiretroviral restriction factor, which isconsistent with previous study showing SAMHD1 expression in other myeloid lineage cells ( Laguette et al., 2011 ). Such constitu- tive expression of ISGs in differentiated cells may provide addi-tional protection to cells of critical importance to the host. Evolutionary Perspectives on Selective Expression of ISGs ISGs highly expressed in human stem cells are similar amongdifferent cell lines/donors. Similarly, different mESC lines ex-press a shared list of murine ISGs. An intriguing question centers on how such intrinsic programs have evolved. Both humans and mice have been exposed to viral infections for millions of years.Viruses, as obligatory intracellular parasites, pose a persistent threat to all living beings, generating strong positive selection for effective protective mechanisms, including physical barriers(Bomsel and Alfsen, 2003 ), as well as intrinsic, innate, adap- tive immunity ( Marques and Carthew, 2007 Cell172, January 25, 2018 435evolutionary timescale, such sculpting is difcult to demonstrate. We speculate that the overlapping but distinct intrinsic ISG sig- natures in different stem cell types reflect the outcome of millions of years of host-pathogen encounters and selection ( Figures S2G-S2I). However, we are handicapped by our narrow cross- sectional view, not knowing the actual pathogens that have ex- erted these selective pressures and how they relate to thosewe are aware of today. Some recent examples provide a fascinating glimpse of how intrinsic resistance mechanisms can unfold in the context of infection. In mice resolving an influenza virus infection, survivinglung-tissue-resident memory CD8 +T cells were found to selec- tively maintain expression of IFITM3 , a potent ISG against influenza virus ( Wakim et al., 2013 ). Interestingly, a human poly- morphism leading to decreased IFITM3 expression in CD8+ T cells is associated with a decrease in this important effector subset and more severe influenza ( Allen et al., 2017 ). This sug- gests possible evolutionary selection for this antiviral effectorbut also the ability of pathogen encounters to elicit intrinsic anti- viral resistance in long-lived mammalian tissue stem cell-like cells. Grow et al. recently found that rec, an early viral transcript from HERVK endogenous retroviruses, is expressed and suf- cient to increase expression of IFITM1 protein in hESCs, raising the possibility that endogenous retroviruses may also beinvolved in the shaping intrinsic stem cell immunity ( Grow et al., 2015 ). Our preliminary epigenetic analyses revealed that chromatin modications and differential transcription factor binding are involved in the regulation of intrinsic ISGs expression in stem cells. Our analysis also suggests that the regulatory mechanismsresponsible for the expression of highly expressed ISGs aremultifactorial and complex: different regulatory factors may be responsible for the expression of different ISGs in different cell types. Notably, future studies should aim at elucidating howsuch transcriptional networks regulate differential expression of ISGs in different types of stem cells. These studies will have important implications for our understanding of stem cell biologyand the evolution of the vertebrate pathogen defense response.

Differentiation was initiated with RPMI/B-27(RPMI/1640, 2% B-27 (minus insulin), 0.5% GlutaMax, and 0.5% non-essential amino acid) supplemented with 10 mM CHIR-98014 for four days, with daily medium replenishment. Endoderm: hESCs were dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated onto Matrigel-coated plates with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) to reach approximately 90% confluence. The next day, was induced with RPMI/B-27 (RPMI/1640, 2% B-27, 100ng/ml Activin-A and 3 mM CHIR99021 for one with 0.25ng/ml BMP4, 5ng/ml bFGF and 100ng/ml Activin-A for three more days. Alternatively, very consistent and reproducibleendoderm could also be generated using the STEMdiff Denitive Endoderm Kit following the manufacturer's instructions.Differentiation Neural stem cells (NSCs): Confluent ectoderm cells were passaged and maintained in the induction medium containing the dual SMAD inhibitors for one additional week. Derived NSCs were then maintained in neural using an embryonic body (EB) protocol ( Kim et al., 2006 ). NSC cultures were replenished with fresh medium every two days. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs): mesoderm cells were passaged and maintained at a low density in MSC enrichment medium. Briefly, cells were cultured on gelatin coated plates with basal were passaged at a 1:4 split for several times (usually around 4-5) to enrich MSCs. Alterna-tively, CD105 +CD24-MSCs were sorted by FACS and expanded according to conditions described above. MSC cultures were re- plenished with fresh medium every two days. Pancreatic stem cells (PSCs): Differentiation of hESCs into PSCs was performed as described ( Rezania et al., 2014 ). Briefly, endo- derm cells were cultured in BLAR medium (custom formulated as described) supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 10mM glucose, 0.25mMascorbic acid, and 50ng/ml for one day and with additional supplement (2% BSA, 0.25 mM SANT-1, 1 mM retinoid acid, 100nM LDN193189, and 0.5% ITS-X) for two more days. Cells were then exposed to the same medium with reduced FGF7 (2ng/ml) for three days. Finally, cells were cultured in the last stage differentiation medium (BLAR medium with 20mM glucose, 2% BSA, 0.25 mM T3, 10 mM inhibitor II, 10 mM zinc sulfate and 10mg/ml heparin) for four days. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs): hESCs were differentiated into hematopoietic stem cells using the Spin-EB method. Briefly, 3000 cells were seeded into U-bottom 96-well non-tissue culture plates in added to cultures (50 ml/well) every three days. On day 8, half of the culture medium was removed and fresh SFM medium containing 10ng/ml bFGF, 10ng/ml VEGF, and 50ng/ml SCF was added every three days until day 14 when cells were collected for purication of HSCs using the EasySep human CD34 positive selection kit according to the manufac- turer's instructions. Terminal differentiation of tissue stem cells Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs)Endoderm cells were dissociated into single cell suspensions using Accutase and plated onto Matrigel-coated plates with ROCK supplemented with 20ng/ml BMP4 and 10ng/ml bFGF. Medium was replaced daily for ve days. Cells were then exposed to RPMI/B-27 containing 20ng/ml HGF for ve days. HLCs were further matured in hepatocyte culture me-dium acid, BSA-FAF, hydrocortisone, transferrin, insulin, GA-1000 and 20ng/ml OSM for an additional one to two weeks. HLCs cultures were replenished with fresh medium every two days. Immature pancreatic b-like cells (Im- b) Further differentiation of PSCs into insulin+ b-like cells was performed as described ( Zhang et al., 2009 ) with some modications. Briefly, confluent PSCs were dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated onto Matrigel-coated plates with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) in last stage differentiation medium described above. Once the culture reached confluence, cells were further maintained e6Cell172, 423-438.e1-e11, January 25, 2018in maturation cells (MYF) Confluent MSCs was dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated onto cell culture plates with ROCK inhibitor in the dif-ferentiation medium (DMEM/F12, VEGF, and 10ng/ml PDGF-AB for two weeks. Cells were further cultured in maturation medium (DMEM/F12, 5% FBS, and 1% GlutaMax) supplemented with the above factors for one week. MYF cultures were replenished with fresh medium every two days.Adipocyte-like cells (Adipocyte)Further differentiation of MSCs into adipocytes was based on the Lonza adipogenic differentiation system with some modications. Briefly, hESC-derived MSCs were dissociated and plated onto cell culture plate at relatively low density in MSCGM medium (Lonza). Medium was replaced every three days until the cultures reached super confluence. Cells were then treated with three to four cyclesof induction/maintenance according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by one-week treatment with maintenance medium. Macrophage-like cells (MLCs) Briefly, puried HSCs were expanded in with 10% CD34 +expansion three days and then transferred to Matrigel-coated plates in the macrophage M-CSF, and replenished every three days. Macrophage-like cells (MLCs) were collected at one week post differentiation. For functional characterization, MLCs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 5 mg/ml) for 6 hr and analyzed for induction of major cytokines and chemokines by qRT-PCR.Neuron-like cells (Neuron) Briefly, hESC-derived NSCs were dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated onto poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated cell culture plate in the neuronal differentiation 20ng/ml GDNF. A half-medium change was per- formed every two to three days for three to four weeks. Astrocyte-like cellsFor differentiation of NSCs into astrocyte-like cells, hESC-derived dissociated into single cell suspensions using Accu- tase and plated onto matrigel-coated cell culture plate in astrocyte differentiation medium (DMEM, 1% N-2 supplement, 2 mM GlutaMax-1 supplement, 1% FBS). Medium change was performed every three to four days for three to four weeks.Human ESC-derived NSCs/Neurons coculture system NSCs were derived from hESCs an EB protocol ( Kim et al., 2006 ) and neural rosettes were isolated using a commercial selec- tion reagent and cultured on Matrigel-coated plates at a low density in neural induction medium for three to ve days. Cells were thentreated with several cycles of induction/differentiation medium for one to two weeks until neuronal morphology became apparentaround rosette structures. Cultures were replenished with fresh medium every two days. Isolation of hematopoietic cells Deidentied fetal livers (16-24 weeks gestation) were procured through Advanced Bioscience Resources (Alameda, CA). Livers received on ice were washed with hepatocyte wash buffer (HWB) consisting of then resuspended in 20-40ml warm diges- tion buffer consisting of Hanks plus 40mM HEPES, 3.26mM CaCl 2, 2U/ml DNase I Grade II (Roche), and 0.2% Collagenase type IV. Tissue was digested for 30 minutes at 37/C14C, then diluted 1:1 with HWB and gently pushed through 70 mm cell- strainers. The suspension was centrifuged at 100 3g for 3 minutes and the supernatant containing hematopoietic cells was trans- ferred to a new 50ml tube and further centrifuged at 400 3g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice by resuspension in HWB. Cells were then resuspended in PBS containing 1% FBS and 1mM EDTA and divided into two fractions for subsequent isolations. CD34+cells were isolated from one fraction by using the EasySep human CD34 positive selection kit. The other fraction was further diluted in appropriate volume (80 ml/10 million cells) of CD45 selection buffer incubated 4/C14C for 15 min. CD45-cells were isolated by immunomagnetic negative selection according to the manufacturer's instructions. FACS-based purication of erythroblasts of different developmental stages was performed as described previously ( Hu et al., 2013 ). Briefly, CD45-cells were rst incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA and 0.4% human AB serum) and 1 3106cells/100 mL were stained the incubation at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, the cells were washed once with washing buffer (PBS and 0.5% BSA), and were suspended at a concentrationof 1.5310 7/ml for sorting on a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter (Beckman). The specic antibodies used for FACS are indicated in the Key Resources Table . For subsequent analyses such as RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR and western blot, hematopoietic cells were immediately pelleted, washed with DPBS, and lysed accordingly. For RNA extraction, pellets were lysed directly in the RLT buffer from RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN);for western blot, pellets were lysed in 2 3SDS-loading buffer at 100 /C14C for 10 min. Cell172, 423-438.e1-e11, January 25, 2018 e7Isolation of CD34+cells from other sources Briefly, cells were diluted with an equal volume of buffer (PBS and 0.5% BSA) and were subsequently separated on a Ficoll density gradient at 400 3g for 30 min at room temperature. The mononuclear cells were collected and washed twice with washing buffer (PBS and 0.5% BSA) by sequential centrifugation at 300 3g and 200 3g for 10 min. The cells were incubated with CD34 microbeads for positive selection using the Magnetic-activated cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bone marrow derived CD34+cells were isolated from a single deidentied donors, while peripheral and cord blood derived CD34+ cells were isolated from pooled mixtures of 2 to 4 deidentied donors. For subsequent experiments such as RNA-seq, qRT-PCR and western blot, puried cells were handled similarly as described for fetal liver-derived cells. RNA-Seq analysis Approximately 100ng of total RNA were used as input. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions for the TruSeqStranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq with a read length of 50 nucleotides (single end conguration). Libraries were sequenced to generate approximately 13 to 20 million reads per sample. Following quality assessment with FASTQC (Version 0.11.5), gene and transcript expression levels (TPM and estimated counts) were quantied using the Salmon pseudo-alignment tool (v0.8.2) with Ensembl v88 reference transcriptome annotation. Gene level expression values were assembled in the R statistical framework using the Tximport package (v0.99.2). Genes with TPM = 0 across all samples were removed. For eachsample, the distribution of gene expression (Log 2TPM) values was plotted and expression thresholds were established as the local minimum partitioning the bimodal distributions: genes above this threshold were classied as ''expressed'' in a given sample. For each sample, ''highly expressed'' genes were dened as the top 20% of these expressed genes ranked by TPM values. Inter- feron-stimulated genes (ISGs, Table S2 ) within this set were dened as ''highly expressed ISGs'' for that sample. Heatmaps were plotted with the pheatmap tool (v1.0.8); genes with maximal TPM values in each cell type (relative to other cell types) are grouped together for visualization. For PCA visualization, estimated read counts were normalized and variance stabilized by regularized log transformation with the rlog() function from the DESeq2 package (v1.14.1, available through Bioconductor). When present, donor or preparation specic ef- fects were corrected using the removeBatchEffect() function in limma. For heatmaps in Figures 1 B, 1F, 2C and S5A, shown are log 2 scaled TPM values for ISGs highly expressed (within top 20% of all expressed genes) by any cell types compared. In Figures 1 B and S5A, additional ISGs and IFN genes with low expression values were manually selected for comparison. For the heatmaps shown in Figures 3 B, 3F, 3I, and S4C, shown are z-score scaled TPM values for ISGs highly expressed in hESCs along ex vivo differentiation of hESCs. For the heatmap shown in Figure 4 D, shown are z-score scaled TPM values for ISGs highly expressed in HSCs along in vivo differentiation of human primary HSCs. For the heatmap shown in Figure S5 D, shown are z-score scaled TPM values for ISGs highly expressed in mouse ESCs along ex vivo differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. z-score scaled heatmaps were used to show general relative abundance patterns of ISGs along ex vivo differentiation of stem cells, therefore ''blue'' color does not necessarily indicate absent of the gene of interest in the given cell type. Generation of IFITM-knockout hESCs Two guide RNAs targeting IFITM3 exon 1 were transfected into HUES8-iCas9 cells, which upon with 2 mg/ml doxycycline (Dox) inducibly expressed CRISPR-Cas9. HUES8-iCas9 cells were treated with Dox for 48 hr prior to and for 24 hr post transfection. Transfected cells were then seeded for limiting dilution cloning and grown on mouse was replenished daily. Clones were expanded and screened by western blot analysis and homozygous IFITM knockout clones were chosen for further char-acterization. Pluripotency was evaluated by checking expression of pluripotent markers (e.g., OCT4 and SSEA4) and differentiation capability into three germ layers, using the conditions described above. Proliferation of modied hESCs and their derivatives (hESC- derived NSCs, MSCs) was measured by using CellTiter-Glo Assay according to manufacturer's instructions. Transduction of lentiviral particles shRNAs targeting the gene of interest were cloned into the pLKO.1-puro vector using standard techniques. Lentiviral particles weregenerated as reported previously ( Zhang and Stefanovic, 2017 ) with some modications. Briefly, plasmids were trans- fected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's directions, medium was changed to DMEM sup- plement with 3% ESC-qualied FBS (Life Technologies) at hr post transfection. Medium containing the lentiviral particles washarvested at 48 hr post transfection and ltered through 0.2 mm lter. shRNA targeting sites are shown in the Key Resources Table . For generation of shRNA-mediated knockdown in hESCs and primary MSCs, lentiviral particles were further concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator according to the manufacturer's directions. For transduction of hESCs, cells were dissociated into single cellsusing Accutase and plated onto Matrigel-coated plates with ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) to a confluency of approximately 20 - 30%.Cells were transduced twice in mTeSR1 medium with concentrated lentiviral particles and puromycin (1 mg/ml) was added to cultures at 48 hr post transduction. For transduction of primary MSCs, cells were seeded at 20% confluency and puromycin (1 mg/ml) was used for selection at 48 hr post transduction. e8Cell172, 423-438.e1-e11, January 25, 2018For lentiviral transduction of particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation: briefly, ltered supernatant containing the lentiviral particles was ultracentrifuged at 70,000 3g for 2 hr at room temperature with the brake off. Pellets were resuspended in sterile PBS (concentrated by 1000:1). Puried CD34+cells were rst recovered overnight in the expansion medium before lentiviral transduction. Briefly, 0.5 3106cells were spun down and with concentrated lentiviral particles (20 to 40 mL virus stock containing approximately 2 3107transduction units, MOI = 40). Cells and viral particles were mixed by pipetting up and down several times before transfer to one well of a 24-well plate (flat bottomed non-tissue culture treated). The plate was spinocu-lated at 1,400 3g for 2 hr at room temperature prior to overnight incubation in transduction medium. Cells were washed and resus- pended in expansion medium on the next day. Puromycin (1 mg/ml) was added to the cultures at 36 hr post transduction for three days. At one week post transduction, CD34 +cells were further puried using the EasySep human CD34+positive selection kit and used for subsequent experiments, including virus infection, ex vivo differentiation, colony formation assay, and transplantation into immunodecient above. Differentiated HLCs were transduced in Lonza hepatocyte culture medium with concentrated vi-ruses and spinoculated at 1,400 3g for 2 hr at room temperature. Viral inoculum was then removed at 4 hr post spinoculation and HLCs were washed with basal medium twice. Virus infection Viruses The construction, characterization and generation of viral stocks for the following viruses have been previously described: recombi- nant clones were obtained for the (+) RNA viruses CHIKV-GFP (derived from pCHIKV-LR 5 0GFP) ( Tsetsarkin from IC30P-A WNV-GFP (derived ic) ( Schoggins et al., 2011 ). ZIKV (Puerto Rican strain PRVABC59) was from obtained from the CDC and passaged three times on Vero cells and twice on Huh-7.5 cells. Infectious virus stocks were obtained for the (-) RNA viruses VSV-GFP (based on strain Indiana) ( Dalton and Rose, IAV strain ), MeV-GFP (MVvac2-GFP, vaccine strain, Edmonston lineage virus) ( del Valle et al., 2007 ), hPIV3-GFP (based on strain JS) ( Zhang et al., 2005 ), and NDV-GFP (based on strain Hitchner B1) ( Park et al., 2003 ). All infections were performed by incubation of virus inoculum with cells for 2 to 4 hr before the cells were washed and changed to the medium appropriate for the specic cell type and differentiation stage. Viral infection was performed using MOI = 1.0 (as determined of the cell type used to titrateeach virus), unless stated otherwise in the gure legend. After infection, cells were xed and stained as follows: infections with two stains of IAV were xed at 9 hr p.i. and stained with anti- NP antibody RSV, NDV, infections with GFP-expressing CHIKV, VSV, and VEEV 16 hr p.i. (green); infections with GFP-expressing hPIV3 was xed at 24 hrp.i. (green); infection with DENV was xed at 48 hr p.i. and stained with NS3 antibody (red); and infection with ZIKV was xed at 72 hr p.i. and stained with anti-flavivirus E (4G2) antibody (red). For pretreated with IFN- b(200IU/ml) hr before being exposed to DENV. IFN- bwas kept in culture medium during virus infection. At 48 hr post infection, cells were harvested for western blot using 2 3SDS-loading buffers as described before, or xed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-NS3 antibody (anti-dengue nonstructural Virus infection of hematopoietic cells CD34 +cells (hematopoietic stem cells) were maintained in expansion medium described above and differentiated progenies (including Pro, Early and Late-Baso cells) were cultured in stage-two medium. For DENV infection, cells were exposed to virus over-night before the inoculum was removed by centrifugation. For testing differential permissiveness to DENV infection, the mixed cells (including HSC, Pro, Early and Late-Baso) were maintained in stage-one medium and exposed to virus overnight before the inoculum was removed by centrifugation. At 48 hr post infection, cells were rst stained with anti-CD34 and/or anti-GPA/CD235a antibodies,followed by xation and staining with anti-NS3 antibody or were directly collected for western blot analysis. For the experiments shown in Figure 6 N, HSCs and three differentiated progeny cell types (Pro, E-Baso, and L-Baso) were isolated from one donor by FACS, mixed together, and exposed to DENV. For the experiments shown in Figure 6 O, HSCs were isolated from one donor, and transduced with control shRNA or shRNA targeting IFITM3. After puromycin selection, cells were divided into two portions: one for ex vivo expansion and the other for ex vivo terminal differentiation into Pro, E-Baso, and L-Baso. Expanded HSCs were mixed with the differentiated cells and were infected with DENV. For both N and O, infection was terminated at 48 hrp.i. and cells were stained with erythrocyte-specic marker glycophorin A (GPA) and NS3 antibodies. IFN mediated inhibition of virus infection in hematopoietic cells was performed by pre-treating cells with IFN- b(200U/ml) for 12 to 16 hr before subsequent exposure to virus. IFN- bwas kept in the culture medium during virus infection. Cells were collected at the indicated time points post infection for western blot or flow cytometry analysis. For ISG induction by IFN stimulation, hematopoieticcells were treated with IFN- b(100U/ml) for 6 hr before being collected for qRT-PCR analysis. Cell172, 423-438.e1-e11, January 25, 2018 e9Transplantation of primary human HSCs After a one-week ex vivo expansion, control and shRNA-transduced human CD34+cells were further puried using the EasySep hu- man CD34 positive selection kit. For infection with IAV (A/swine/Texas/98) or DENV (strain 16681), cells were exposed to viruses for 3 hr in expansion medium, then washed twice with IMDM. Viable cells were then counted and resuspended in PBS. An equalnumber of viable cells from each condition were used in the subsequent experiments: for ex vivo differentiation, cells were seeded at 3310 5/ml and 2 3105/ml for erythrocytes and macrophages, respectively; for transplantation, each mouse was given 1 3105 cells intrasplenically. Ex vivo differentiation of HSCs toward erythrocytes was performed using the ''3 phase method'' as described ( Hu et al., 2013 ). Ex vivo differentiation of HSCs to macrophages was performed as follows: cells were cultured in macrophage differentiation medium (IMDM, 2% human plasma, 3% two weeks. For colony formation assay, briefly,cells from each condition were diluted to a density of 200/ml of MethoCult H4434 classic medium for BFU-E colony assay in 37 /C14C incubator. The different colonies were dened according to previously described criteria ( Hu et al., 2013 ) and counted on day 14 post seeding. During ex vivo differentiation, samples were collected at the indicated time points to monitor expression of surface markers using flow cytometry. Proliferation was examined by counting cells every day during the rst week and is plotted as fold change after normalization to the seeding number on the rst day. Mouse (NOD.Cg-Rag1 IL2rgtmlWjl/Sz (NRG)) was used for HSCs transplantation. At weeks 8 and 12 post transplantation, peripheral blood samples were obtained from recipients and subset reconstitution of human leukocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry. Atweek 16, mice were sacriced and single cell suspensions of bone marrow were prepared by flushing the bone marrow cells out of the femurs into PBS supplemented with 10% FBS using a syringe and 22-gauge needle. Human and mouse hematopoietic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as follows: human B cells were stained with anti-CD19 antibody, and human myeloid cells were stainedwith anti-CD33 antibody; murine cells were Sca-1. Human HSCs were and mouse HSCs were dened as the c-KIT+Sca-1+population. Antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed in the Key Resources Table . Immunofluorescence analysis Cells were xed in 4% para-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 10 min and blocked withPBTG (PBS containing 10% normal (BSA), 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 2 to 3 hr. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in PBTG) at 4 /C14C overnight or 2 hr at room temperature. Isotype mouse or rabbit IgGs were used as negative controls. After four washes with PBS, Alexa-350, 488, or 594 conjugated secondary antibodies(1:500 - 1:1000 diluted in PBTG) were added and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by four washes withPBS. For lipid droplets staining in hESC-derived adipocytes, cells grown on coverslips were xed with 10% formalin for 30 min, and washed with 60% isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with 0.18% freshly made oil-red in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and washed thoroughly with double-distilled water four times. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 2 min atroom temperature. Primary antibodies used for Immunofluorescence analysis are listed in the Key Resources Table . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated from cell lysates using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) followed by reverse transcription using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System. Gene expression was quantied using the LightCycler SYBR Green I Master Mix on a LightCycler 480 Instrument (Roche Life Science) with gene-specic primers shown in the Key Resources Table . PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation step at 50 /C14C for 2 min and 95/C14C for 10 min, then 45 cycles of 95/C14C for 15 s, 56/C14C for 15 s, and 72/C14C for 20 s; followed by a melting step of 95/C14C for 10 s, 65/C14C for 10 s and a 0.07/C14C/s decrease from 95/C14C; and nally a cooling step of 50/C14C for 5 s. PCR product specicity was conrmed by a melting-curve analysis. Western blot Cell lysates were separated by 10% or 4% - 12% sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Comparisons between different groups/cells were made by analyzing equal amounts ofloaded protein from lysates, as determined by BCA protein assay. GAPDH or ACTB was used as loading control, as indicated in the gures and gures legends. Primary antibodies used for western blot analysis are listed in the Key Resources Table . IFN neutralization Human ESCs were cultured in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with anti-human IFNAR2 antibody or isotype control antibody for 48 hr before being collected for qRT-PCR. Antibodies were replenished daily with medium changes. For neutralization assays onHLCs, cells were pretreated with antibodies for 6 hr prior to exposure to IFN- b(100U/ml) and collected for qRT-PCR at 6 hr post IFN-btreatment. mTeSR1 medium that had been exposed to hESCs for 24 hr was collected as conditioned mTeSR1, which was used to examine possible ISG induction in HLCs. Primary antibodies used for neutralization are listed in the Key Resources Table . e10 Cell172, 423-438.e1-e11, January 25, 2018QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For RT-qPCR, fold changes in mRNA expression for cellular markers and ISGs were determined using the DDCt method relative to the values in control samples as indicated in gure legends, after normalization to housekeeping genes ( Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013 ). Results are presented as means \u00b1standard deviation (SD), unless stated otherwise. Comparisons between groups/cells were made using the two-tailed Student's t test, unless stated otherwise.

Cells were infected with i ndicated viruses, xed at the indicated time points post infection (p.i.) and were visualized directly (green, GFP-expressing viruses) or stained with the indicated a ntibodies (red: anti-NS3 for DENV and were visualized by DAPI staining (lower panels in each grouping). Scale bars: 100 mm. (legend continued on next page)(B) Schematic workflow for identifying ISG signature in stem cells. Briefly, for any given stem cell type, we focused on genes with TPM values above a mini mum threshold (approximately TPM > 1.0, detailed in STAR Methods ) in all biological replicates, thereby dened as ''expressed'' genes. The number of expressed genes ranged from 13,000 to 15,000, depending on the cell type and cell stage. Within the highly expressed group (top 20% of genes, ranked by TPMs), wefocused on interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), based on the compiled and mouse ISG lists ( Table S2 ). ISGs within the highly expressed set were dened as ''highly expressed ISGs'' for the cells analyzed. Shown are data from hESC line WA09.(C) Blockade of IFN response by IFNAR2 Left: were pre-treated with isotype control or I FNAR2 blocking antibodies for 4 hr, followed by stimulation with IFN- b(100U/ml) for 12 hr.
