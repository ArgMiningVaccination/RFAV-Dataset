The term is also used to describe the edible part of the plant which is commonly used as a spice in cooking throughout the world. Often erroneously referred to as \"ginger root\", the edible section is actually the horizontal subterranean stem or rhizome of the plant. The ginger plant has a long history of cultivation known to originate in China and then spread to India, Southeast Asia, West Africa, and the Caribbean. Additional recommended knowledge Chemistry Ginger contains up to 3% of an essential oil that causes the fragrance of the spice. The main constituents are The pungent taste of ginger is due to nonvolatile Ginger has a sialagogue action, stimulating the production of Culinary uses Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a very mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or just cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can also be stewed in boiling water to make ginger tea, to which honey is often added as a sweetener; sliced orange or lemon fruit may also be added. Mature ginger roots are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from old ginger roots is extremely potent and is often used as a spice in Chinese cuisine to flavor dishes such as seafood or mutton. Powdered dry ginger root (ginger powder) is typically used to add spiciness to gingerbread and other recipes. Ground and fresh ginger taste quite different and ground ginger is a poor substitute for fresh ginger. Fresh ginger can be successfully substituted for ground ginger and should be done at a ratio of 6 parts fresh for 1 part ground. Ginger is also made into candy and used as a flavoring for cookies, crackers and cake, and is the main flavor in ginger ale-- a sweet, carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage, as well as the similar, but somewhat spicier beverage ginger beer. Regional uses In Western cuisine, ginger is traditionally restricted to sweet foods, such as ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, ginger cake and ginger biscuits. A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Green ginger wine is a ginger flavoured wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle. Ginger is also used as a spice added to hot coffee and In Arabic, ginger is called Zanjabil and in some parts of the Middle East ginger powder is used as a spice for coffee. In India, ginger is called \"Aadu\" in Gujarati, in Hindi and Urdu. Fresh ginger is one of the main spices used for making pulse and lentil curries and other vegetable preparations. It is used fresh to spice tea especially in winter. Also, ginger powder is used in certain food preparations that are made particularly for expecting women and feeding mothers, the most popular one being Katlu which is a mixture of gum resin, ghee, nuts and sugar. In south India, ginger is used in the production of a candy called Inji-murappa (\"ginger candy\" from Tamil). This candy is mostly sold by vendors to bus passengers in bus stops and in small tea shops as a locally produced item. Candied ginger is also very famous around these parts. Additionally, in Tamil Nadu, especially in the Tanjore belt, a variety of ginger which is less spicy is used when tender to make fresh pickle with the combination of lemon juice or vinegar, salt and tender green chillies. This kind of pickle was generally made before the invention of refrigeration and stored for a maximum of 4-5 days. The pickle gains a mature flavor when the juices cook the ginger over the first 24 hours. Ginger is also added as a flavouring in In Japan, ginger is pickled to make beni shoga and gari or grated and used raw on tofu or noodles. It is also made into a candy called shoga no satozuke. In Myanmar, ginger is used in a salad dish called gyin-tho, which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, and a variety of nuts and seeds. Indonesia has a famous beverage that called Wedang Jahe, which is made from ginger and palm sugar; Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called jahe or djahe, as a frequent ingredient in local recipes. In traditional Korean kimchi, ginger is finely minced and added to the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process. In South East Asia, the flower of a type of ginger is used in cooking. This unopened flower is known in the Malay language as Bunga Kantan, and is used in salads and also as garnish for sour-savoury soups, like Assam Laksa. In the Ivory Coast, ginger is ground and mixed with orange, pineapple and lemon to produce a juice called Nyamanku. Medical uses The medical form of ginger historically was called \"Jamaica ginger\"; it was classified as a The characteristic odor and flavor of ginger root is caused by a mixture of zingerone, shoagoles and gingerols, volatile oils that compose about one to three percent of the weight of fresh ginger. In laboratory animals, the gingerols increase the motility of the Nausea Ginger has been found effective by multiple studies for treating Modern research on nausea and motion sickness used approximately 1 gram of ginger powder daily. Though there are claims for efficacy in all causes of nausea, the Physicians Desk Reference recommends against taking ginger rhizomes for morning sickness commonly associated with pregnancy due to possible mutagenic effects,[citation needed] though Chinese women have traditionally used ginger rhizomes during Cancer Research Aside from controlling the nausea associated with cancer caused by chemotherapy, ginger is now proving itself more and more a direct actor in the treatment of cancer, not just its side effects. In 2006, the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center released details regarding its ongoing investigation of ginger as a treatment and preventative for both ovarian and colon cancers. In laboratory studies, the powdered form of the root was dissolved in a solution and applied to ovarian cancer cells, directly resulting in the death of every single cancer cell line tested. Two types of cancer cell death, both apoptosis (the suicide of cancer cells) and autophagy (cancer cells digesting or attacking themselves) were reported. Ginger, when administered responsibly (moderate doses to non-pregnant patients) triggers virtually no side effects, which would place it, if studies continue to reap positive results, on a pedestal above other, harder to administer treatments that induce harsher side effects with uncertain success rates, for example chemotherapy. The author of the study, J. Rebecca Liu, M.D., reasons that \"most ovarian cancer patients develop recurrent disease that eventually becomes resistant to standard chemotherapy - which is associated with resistance to apoptosis. If ginger can cause autophagic cell death in addition to apoptosis, it may circumvent resistance to conventional chemotherapy.\" Folk medicinal uses There are a variety of uses suggested for ginger. A tea brewed from the is a folk remedy for colds. Ginger ale and ginger beer have been recommended as \"stomach settlers\" for generations in countries where the beverages are made and ginger water was commonly used to avoid heat Local uses In the West, powdered dried ginger root is made into capsules and sold in pharmacies for medicinal use. Reactions Allergic reactions to ginger generally result in a rash and though generally recognized as safe, ginger can cause heartburn, bloating, gas, belching and nausea, particularly if taken in powdered form. Unchewed fresh ginger may result in intestinal blockage, and individuals who have had ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease or blocked intestines may react badly to large quantities of fresh ginger. Horticulture Ginger produces clusters of white and pink flower buds that bloom into yellow flowers. Because of the aesthetic appeal and the adaptivity of the plant to warm climates, ginger is often used as landscaping around subtropical homes. It is a perennial reed-like plant with annual leafy stems, three to four feet high. Historical methods of gathering the root describes, when the stalk withers, it is immediately scalded, or washed and scraped, in order to kill it and prevent sprouting. The former method, applied generally to the older and poorer roots, produces Black Ginger; the latter, gives White Ginger. The natural color of the \"white\" scraped ginger is a pale buff--it is often whitened by bleaching or liming, but generally at the expense of some of its real value. References in popular culture Production trends In 2005, China continued to lead the world in ginger production with a global share of almost 25% followed by India, Nepal and Indonesia. Similar species Myoga (Zingiber mioga Roscoe) appears in Japanese cuisine; the flower buds are the part eaten. Another plant in the Zingiberaceae family, galangal, is used for similar purposes as ginger in Thai cuisine. Galangal is also called Thai ginger. Also referred to as galangal, fingerroot (Boesenbergia rotunda), or Chinese ginger or the Thai krachai, is used in cooking and medicine.
