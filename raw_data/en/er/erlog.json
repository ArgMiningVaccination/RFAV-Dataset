Started approximately 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy is a system of healing that has been studied primarily in Europe and India throughout the years. Homeopathy is founded on the principle, \"like cures like\" and works on a deeper level than pharmaceutical medicines to help the body heal itself. Homeopathy can treat all illnesses, from typical childhood sickness to allergies and chronic disease with little to no side effects. Classical homeopathy involves a lengthy, detailed patient history. The patient describes everything from current symptoms and past medical history to personal emotions and family dynamics. The practitioner studies the intake and compares the details of the case to characteristics of different homeopathic remedies, often looking for the most similar remedy, which becomes the constitutional remedy for the patient. Because Integrative Family Practice takes a holistic, integrative approach, classical homeopathy is practiced here with a view of the whole person. All symptoms are taken into account, the entire case is thoroughly reviewed, and one or more remedy will be carefully selected. Improvement is evaluated periodically, and adjustments to the remedy(ies) are made as needed. Each case and treatment plan is individualized. For some, a homeopathic remedies are appropriate, which may be alternated. Other remedies, therapies, and clinical assessments may be incorporated into the treatment plan, depending on the individual's case, such as traditional therapies, botanical remedies, lifestyle changes, nutritional supplements, and lab work.
