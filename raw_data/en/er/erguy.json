Especially, due to lack of proper knowledge about the disorder. Despite various campaigns, lack of awareness happens to be the biggest hindrance in accepting the patients suffering from autism. However, in order to understand the actual disorder you have to know that it's not just limited to one type. It's actually a large spectrum and every person affected is different from the other. Autism Spectrum Disorder, commonly known as Autism, is a neuro-behavioral disorder that affects the brain development of an individual. It impacts the way one communicates or interacts socially, plus affects their sensory, auditory, oral, and visual senses. Normally diagnosed at an early age, autism is caused due to two reasons, either genetics or environmental factors. While some undergo mild symptoms, others can have severe symptoms that can be hard to manage. Autism Although there isn't one set treatment for this disorder because of it has a huge spectrum, there are a few home remedies that can help in the process. As Hippocrates said, \"The natural healing force within each of us is the greatest force in getting well.\" So, let's take a look at 8 of these natural home remedies that can be beneficial for Autism:Bone Broth Bone broth is loaded with amino acids and minerals that are helpful in improving gut health. This helps in boosting the immune system. A leaky gut is a common cause of Autism and improving that helps diminish the symptoms of this disorder.Gluten-free food Gluten Free Although [gluten](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/gluten) isn't an autism-causing factor, it has been known to worsen the symptoms of it. Many kids with autism have been known to be sensitive to the components of foods with gluten in it. So, it's best to avoid it, rather than ignore the effects of it. A gluten-free diet can also help in improving gut health, especially if they have symptoms of digestive disorder. Deep Pressure Individuals with autism can have trouble keeping still or being calm. Applying deep pressure, with the help of an inflatable ball, a cushion or a pillow, can help the individual calm down and go into a relaxed state. This is perfect when the individual goes through a sensory overdrive and can't seem to calm down. It changes the energy of the person and helps them relax. Probiotics Probiotics Including a steady and healthy use of probiotics can help reduce the symptoms of autism in an individual. The diverse symptoms of Autism can make it confusing to know what is good for an individual and what is not, but since the major cause of it is gastrointestinal factors, probiotics can be a huge help. A healthy balance of bacteria in the body is known to have a very positive impact on autism.Omega-3 fatty acids Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids help in the development of brain functions, therefore, including this in the diet of someone who has autism can have a positive effect on their development too. Because autism affects certain brain functions and slows down the growth of said brain functions, food rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help with better development. Earlier studies have shown that it helps with the repetitive behaviours that autism causes. Sleep Sleep Autism can cause an imbalance the [melatonin](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/melatonin) hormone which causes sleeping problems leading to irritability and underdevelopment of brain functions. Including Melatonin in your diet can help in steadying the sleep pattern of the individual. It helps with the regulation of your body functions, i.e. your [hormone](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hormone) levels, your body temperature, etc. Foods like corn, [asparagus](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/asparagus) , barley, etc, are rich in melatonin. If they are not enough, you can also take supplements in small amounts for a short time.Weighted Blankets Weighted Blankets provide a calming effect on the body. People who have autism can benefit the most from it because it increases the release of [serotonin](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/serotonin) and relaxes their body. It's scientifically proven to help the sensory nerves and provide the much-needed unwinding that the individual needs. It's a way to provide deep pressure which alleviates the need for the parent to be present the whole time. It improves the quality of sleep too. A tablet A Tablet No, not a medicine tablet. An electronic tablet can help in improving the motor skills of kids with autism. It can be a little difficult to express what they want through normal communication, so a tablet can be used to help the individual develop better motor skills. Tablets help the overall education of the individual as it goes at their speed and allows them to learn without the pressure of social communication, plus the addition of communicative apps can help them communicate better.
