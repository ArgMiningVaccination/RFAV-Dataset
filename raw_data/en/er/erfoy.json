These are the scents of plants extracted by distillation (water vapor), extraction (by solvent) or by expression (pressure, crushing). This makes essential oils a powerful concentrate of multiple biochemical substances. The use of essential oils is a real pleasure. Their potency and ease of use, combined with the absence of side effects when used wisely, make these aromatic essences an almost perfect medicine. The results can be very fast; patients will discover a new world. In using these essential oils, we enter a natural, sensory and even sensual universe because we make use of our primary senses: touch by massage, smell by smelling their multiple volatile scents, taste by their ingestion and visual by their many variations of colors. Aromatherapy opens the doors to a world of well-being, natural therapy and even cosmetics; pure joy. The use of these small bottles of essential oils is much more aesthetic and pleasant than a blister pack or bottle of tablets or capsules of medicine. Faced by various known accidents and more and more unpleasant side effects caused by synthetic chemical medications, many patients prefer to be treated by natural therapies where we use plants and their essences. Not to mention the conditions no longer responding to traditional modern therapies such as multiple antibiotic resistances. We very often treat ourselves in a positive way without realizing it by daily use of plants with therapeutic properties in the culinary world such as garlic, cloves, sage, rosemary, thyme, cumin, basil, savory and many other plants, spices and condiments. Aromatherapy practiced well is precision medicine, precision in dosage, precision in chemotype and origin of the plant, precision in the choice of mode of intake (inhalation, application, ingestion) and precision in the choice of a synergistic mixture of several essential oils according to individual needs and their multiple symptomatology. Hence the importance of an electronic machine for precise distribution of essential oils for everyday family needs allowing a daily therapeutic approach to medicine in an optimal and safe way. of the future aromatherapy leading us all towards a path of well-being and health. Aromatherapy is like many alternative medicines, a medicine which does not disassociate the body and the spirit, the physiological and the mental, the body and the soul but each one goes with the other. There is also a spiritual part in any essential oil. This is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable advantages of essential oils which are clearly ahead of their time. I believe this approach to address the psychic sufferings of our patients is the future of all medicine in the modern world and in the future. As a doctor with a great deal of experience in the private and professional use of essential and vegetable oils, I can affirm in good faith and, from the heart, that aromatherapy is a rigorous, complete, complex and effective medicine which treats man or woman in their entirety in a powerful way. And I recommend to everyone to safely experience the world of aromatherapy with this exceptional revolutionary machine: the SelfCare1.
