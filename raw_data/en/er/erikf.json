Dr. Oskoui suggested to be open to all possibilities here such that a damaged heart due to the vaccine could not withstand the hit it ordinarily could have.The hit causes a surge in adrenalin etc. that greatly stresses the heartmuscle. With damaged myocardium and disturbed electrical signals, the heartcan go into cardiac arrest. Alexander COVID News-Dr. Paul Elias Alexander's Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Upgrade to paid In short, myocarditis is often silent (due to infection or COVID vaccineinduced), and many who die suddenly die due to heart failure. The heart oftenduring exercise can stop with the dopamine, norepinephrine surges. We need more information, but there is a possibility that the heart myocardium due to vaccine he took is so very damaged that the hit derangedthe electrical impulses in an already damaged heart and it stopped; yes, itcan happen if you take a huge hit to the chest (even with padded protectionand often to the left side of the chest just over the heart) and it iscompounded by an already damaged heart. Yes, a blow to the chest cancause a dangerous heart rhythm and if the myocardium is already damagede.g. due to myocarditis that was silent and undiagnosed and he exertedhimself, one could suddenly die. The surge in dopamine and adrenalinechemicals can place stress on the heart but the heart muscle is damaged andnot working as it should. An exercise bout and we argue, given the surge incatecholamines as you begin to wake after sleep, can cause sudden death.This is why we say so many deaths happen 'in your sleep' now post COVIDgene injection. God will smile on him if he survives and I pray. We pray.

It is a form of ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not theresult of heart disease. The survival rate is 58%, which is an increase incomparison to years 1993-2012, where only 34% victims survived. Thisincrease is likely caused by the prompt CPR , access to defibrillation and higher public awareness of this condition. [1] Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men (average age 15), usually during sports, most frequently baseball, often despite a chestprotector. It is usually caused by a projectile, but can also be caused by theblow of an elbow or other body part. Being less developed, the thorax of anadolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances.'

STATE BOARD OF HEALTH DIVISION OF PUBLIC AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH Administration of Mental Health and Intel- lectual and Developmental Disability Programs Proposed Amendments to Chapter 433 of Nevada Administrative Code LCB File No. R 091-22 Comments of Charter Communications, Inc. Through its local subsidiaries and affiliate companies, Charter Communications, Inc. (\"Charter\") is a provider of communications services in the State of Nevada, providing cable television service , broadband internet access service, and both landline and mobile telephone services to thousands of Nevadans. As a service provider, Charter has an interest in helping ensure that the state's new 988 system functions effectively with the financial support intended. From that perspective, Charter suggests the following revisions to the Board's proposed amendments to Chapter 433 of the Nevada Administrative Code pertaining to the surcharge to support the 988 system. (Charter's proposed revisions are included here, in redline form, as Exhibit A.) First, the rule should be revised so that its scope, consistent with that of the underlying statute's , encompasses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service and mobile telephone service, in addition to traditional landline telephone service. Traditional telephone service is classified as a \"telecommunication service.\"1 Telecommunication service and \"telecommunication providers \" are subject to the jurisdiction of the Nevada Public Service Commission (NPSC).2 More recently, new forms of voice telephony have become popular, especially mobile (cellular) telephone service and VoIP service. For regulatory purposes, these services a re not considered \"telecommunication service,\" and they remain outside the scope of NPSC regulation.3 It is clear, however, that the Nevada legislature intends for the 988 statute to extend to these voice services capable of calling 988. 1 NRS a t the federal level, the term is \"telecommunication s service.\" 2 NRS \u00a7 704.021 (provider \"public utility\") ; NRS 703.150 (NPSC has jurisdiction over public utilities). 3 NRS 704.020(1)(b) (excluding providers of commercial mobile radio service from definition of public utility); NRS 704.685 (removing VoIP service from regulation by state agencies (including NPSC)). As currently d rafted , it is not clear that the proposed rule accomplishes the legislative intent , and we urge that the rule be revised to clearly do so. First, we propose revised definitions for the terms \"access line\" and \"trunk line.\" The proposed definitions for these terms rely on citations to Nevada statutory provisions that do not actually define the terms and do not provide workable definitions of either t erm. Further, because the statutory provisions referenced do not apply to VoIP or mobile voice providers, it is unclear how these definitions would apply to the providers of those services. We suggest that the Board define these key definitions for purpo ses of this 988 surcharge rule, potentially without reference to the Nevada statutory provisions that seem ill -suited to accomplishing the Nevada Legislature's objectives here. Second , we suggest that \"commercial mobile communication services\" be equa ted to \"commercial mobile radio service,\" which is the defined term used in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) rule that is already incorporated by reference. Similarly, we suggest that \"IP - enabled voice service\" be defined by reference to th e federal statut ory provision that defines the term in the context of authorizing state 988 surcharges . The Nevada rule that is currently referenced provides a definition for VoIP that is specifically interconnected VoIP , and not a definition of IP- enabled v oice service that encompasses both interconnected VoIP and one -way VoIP . Both of these recommended federal definitions are well -established in the communications industry, and incorporating them here by reference should add a degree of stability to the ru le. Third , in Section 4 we make two suggestions to clarify the rules for assessing and collecting the new 988 surcharge. In paragraph (a), we suggest that the rule clearly state that the obligation to bill and remit the 988 surcharge on applicable services applies to telecommunication providers, commercial mobile communication services providers, and IP -enabled voice service providers, as required by the 988 statute . In paragraph (b) we suggest that the number of access lines or trunk lines attributed to a given customer be deemed to equal the number of 988 calls the customer can make at the same time. This clarification should eliminate uncer tainty, and be consistent with the approach used for 988 surcharges and other surcharges (such as 911 ) in other jurisdictions .4 Lastly, in Section 5, we propose a revision that will clarify that all contributing communications service providers shall report to the Board of Health as required , as opposed to only the regulated telecommunication providers as defined in Section 2.1 of the proposed rules .5 Again, t his aligns with the statutory intent that the obligation to support the 988 system be imposed on consumer s of communications services that include regulated telecommunication services but are not limited to regulated telecommunication services . 4 See, e.g., Colo. Stats. \u00a7 40 -17.5-101 (number of state 988 surcharges equal to of simultaneous calls possible); Wash. Stats. \u00a7 82.86.020 (same); Tenn. Stats. 7 -86-128 (number of state 911 surcharges for complex/multichannel voice service to fixed locations equals the number of simultaneous outbound calls to 911 that can be placed using the service); N.M. Stats. \u00a7 63 -9D-5 (number of state 911 surcharges on VoIP service equal to number of simultaneous VoIP calls possible). 5 The temporary rules still reference Section 1.1 of the ru les which based on section renumbering between rule drafts, does not now exist. Charter supports the development of the 988 system at both the federal and state levels. Our experience with 911 and other public services that rely on private communications networks gives us insight into issues t hat can arise when implementing and funding such a system. We look forward to continuing to work with the State of Nevada to ensure that the new 988 system is implemented and funded effectively for the benefit of all Nevadans. Respectfully submitted Janua ry 6, 202 3. /s/ Torry Somers Torry Somer s Vice President - State Regulatory Charter Communications, Inc. Exhibit PROPOSED TEMPORARY REGULATION OF THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH Amendments to the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 433 Relating to the 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Explanation - Language in blue italics is new. AUTHORITY : NRS 433.708, NRS 439. 150 Section 1. Chapter 433 of the NAC is hereby amended by adding thereto the provisions set forth as sections 1 to 6, inclusive, of this regulation. Section 2. Definitions. 1. \"Telecommunication provider\" or \"telephone company\" defined. \"Telecommunication provider\" or \"telephone company\" has the same meaning as ascribed to it in NRS 704.027. 2. \"Telecommunication service\" defined. \"Telecommunication service\" has the same meaning as to it NRS 704.028. 3. \"Ac cess line\" defined. \"Access line\" has same meaning as ascribed to it in NRS 704.006(2) means any connection provided by a telecommunication provider, a commercial mobile communication services provider and/or a IP -enabled voice services provider that allows a customer to call 9 -8-8. 4. \"Trunk line\" defined. \"Trunk line\" has the same meaning as ascribed to it in NRS 704.008 means a transmission path, or group of transmission paths, connecting a customer's Private Branch Exchange, an automatic ca ll distributing system, or other similar device, to a service provider's public switched network . 5. \"Commercial mobile communication service s\" defined. \"Commercial mobile communication service s\" means an interconnected voice calling service available to the public, or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public as defined at has the same meaning as \"commercial mobile radio service\" as provided in 47 CFR \u00a7 20.3 (a) and (b) . 6. \"Voic e calling service\" defined. \"Voice calling service\" means voice service capable of dialing the digits 9 -8-8 to access the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, provided to each customer of that service whose place of primary use is in Nevada. (a) \"Place of primary use\" means the street address representative of where the customer's use of the mobile telecommunications service primarily occurs , as defined by 4 U.S. Code \u00a7 124(8) which must be: (1) The residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer; and (2) Within the licensed service area of the home service provider. Commented [Charter1]: This definition needs to be broad enough to reach the connections of VoIP and mobile wireless providers. The existing definition which references a statutory provision that does not apply to these providers does not clearly reach them. Commented [Charter2]: Alternatively, if the definition is left as proposed by t he Board of Health it will not apply to VoIP and wireless providers. Commented [Charter3]: Adopts the FCC definition. Commented [Charter4]: This provision seems unnecessary if the definition of \"commercial mobile communication service\" is changed to eliminate mention of \"voice calling service. \" 7. \"IP-enabled voice service \" defined. \"IP -enabled voice service \" has the same meaning as ascribed to it in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251a . Section 3. To sufficiently support the uses set forth in Section 5(2) of Senate Bill 390 (2021) and produce the revenue projected in the budget for the Division approved by the Legislature, a surcharge of 35 cents is imposed on the following, per month: 1. Each acce ss line providing telecommunication service furnished to a customer ; 2. Each access line of each customer of a company that provides commercial mobile communication services; 3. Each access line providing IP -enabled voice services; and 4. Trunk lines. Section 4 . (a) Each telecommunication provider, commercial mobile communication services provider and/or IP -enabled voice services provider shall bill each of its customers for the surcharge as described in Section 3 and remit the money collected on a monthly basis to the Crisis Response Account within the Division of Public and Behavioral Health or its designated agent in accordance with Funds Transfer Instructions for Telecommunicat ions Providers and subsequent sub regulatory guidance. (b) For purposes of this subs ection, the number of access lines or trunk lines attributed to a customer shall be equal to the number of calls the customer can make to 9 -8-8 at the same time. Section 5 . Within 90 days of the effective date of this regulation, each telecommunication provider, commercial mobile communication services provider and/or IP -enabled voice services provider shall report to the Board of Health or its designated agent the average number of lines in service per month in each of the categories identified in Section 3 in the previous calendar year and annually each April 1st thereafter. This information shall be r egarded as proprietary information regarding trade secret and subject to the provisions of NRS 333.333. Section 6. The surcharge described in Section 3 shall be imposed 90 days after this regulation becomes law. Commented [Charter5]: This terms is expressly defined in the federal statute and is not expressly defined in the Nevada statutes. Commented [Charter6]: Using a defined term instead of an undefined term. Commented [Charter7]: The Nevada statute does not require limiting the surcharge to residential customers of telecommunication service, and doing so in this manner is not equitable. Either delete \"residential\" here or add it appropriately to #2 & #3. Commented [Charter8]: Stating the requiremen t more clearly. Commented [Charter9]: Recommended provision that is consistent with 988 and 911 surcharges in other jurisdictions. Commented [Charter10]: Without the broader provider references, only traditional wireline providers are required to provide this information. Commented [Charter11]: Due to the change in Section references between rule drafts, it appears that if this reference is retained it should be to Section 2 .1.

MCCULLOUGH, MD, MPH JAN 11 SAVE LISTEN By Peter A. McCullough, MD, MPH I mentioned on Tucker Carlson last week in commentary on Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin that genetic conditions will be considered. There is an array of known sodium, potassium, and other ion channel mutations in the heart that pose a genetic proclivity to sudden death. In severe mutational cases, the channelopathy is the sole determinant. Many other circumstances, the baseline abnormality and then a superimposed insult to the heart. Two papers (Lim from Korea, Ittiwut from Thailand) now have found that SCN5A variants for cardiomyocyte channels by genetic assessment or by clinical determination on ECG (Brugada pattern) explain cases of sudden death after vaccination.

I am disappointed that world class electrophysiology research departments at US medical schools are being outclassed by investigators in Asia. COVID-19 vaccine induced myocarditis and sudden death should be a top research priority for every cardiology division in the country at this time. These papers raise the concept that not all patients after the injection or those with manifest COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis are at risk for sudden death. In my clinical practice I incorporate genetic testing for channelopathies to fine tune the prognosis for patients. Let's hope Damar Hamlin gets high quality of care and critical thinking by electrophysiologists who understand the COVID-19 vaccine induced myocarditis can be fatal in the setting of a channelopathy such as SCN5A and probably many others.
