A Word From Eric What's your biggest sleeping pain point? If I wake up during the night, my mind quickly revs up to start thinking about upoming events and to-do lists. It can be a struggle to fall back asleep quickly enough to prevent this from seriously disrupting my sleep. What's your favorite sleep product right now? An eye mask. While its main purpose for me is to block out light, I find that it also acts as a queue for sleep and a barrier to checking my phone if I wake up during the night. What is your nightly sleep regimen? I try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time everyday and only make exceptions for meaningful reasons. I read in low light in bed until I'm sleepy, then put on my eye mask and fall asleep. I then try to get outside and take in morning light as soon as I reasonably can every day. What's your top sleep tip? Optimize your light exposure. Light is the primary cue for circadian rhythm, which is a key driver of when you feel sleepy or alert. As more research is completed, the body of evidence demonstrating the sleep and health benefits from synchronizing your internal clock with your environment gets more and more impressive.
