I was eating dinner with him one night and he told me that he had a sign in his office that read, \"You have ten seconds to get enthusiastic or get out of my office!\" When you come in his office, you'd better be excited about taking care of business. How much more we should wake up every day go into the throne room of grace with joy and anticipation to have a meeting with God and then go out to do \"kingdom business.\" King David said, \"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve the Lord with gladness: Come before His presence with singing...Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise, be thankful unto Him, and bless His name\" (Ps. 100:1, 2, 4). Now that is the proper protocol for entering the presence of God. It is enthusiastic. And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit and power [a proof by the Spirit and power of God, operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them]. So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy), but in the power of God.I found it very interesting that The Merriam-Webster Dictionary's first definition for enthusiasm is \"belief in special revelation of the Holy Spirit.\" In both the Latin and Greek the origin of enthusiasm mean \"a possession by God or having God within.\" In the 1650's the Puritans were known to shake or come under the influence of the Holy Spirit. (1 Cor. 2: 4 - 5 AMP) It was said that they had enthusiasm! When Paul preached with the enthusiasm from the Holy Spirit, it moved the people who heard them. He said his preaching stirred in the minds of his hearers \"most holy emotions and thus persuading them\" (1 Cor. 2:4, AMP). Therefore, we can see the protocol of the Holy Spirit never changes. Follow church history from the book of Acts through the present-day Spirit filled church. You can find many accounts of Christians experiencing what they called \"holy laughter.\" The outpouring of the Holy Spirit which took place in the early 1900's in Azusa Street was also witnessed around the world. From the charismatic revival n the sixties and seventies to this generation there are the same demonstrations of the Holy Spirit. Though looked down by some religious hierarchy, it is true that the wisdom of God will confound the wise (1 Cor. 1:27). The effect of the minds of those who hear, the most holy emotions. It is joy unspeakable and full of glory. The result is that our faith does not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Be Continually Filled Because You Leak The Holy Spirit prompts us to rejoice so we can be filled with Him. Why do you have to be continually filled with the Holy Spirit? Because you leak! Paul said in Ephesians 5:18, \"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.\" In the Greek, it literally means to \"be-being filled.\" We require a continuous refilling. Everyone acts different when they are filled with the Holy Spirit. Some people are full of joy at church and as soon as they leave, they return to their whining and complaining. They leaked! God through the power of the Holy Spirit desires to change our minds so we're not thinking little. One man told me, \"If I believed like that that I think I'd lose my mind!\" I said, \"Go ahead, lose your mind and get the mind of Christ!\" Smith Wigglesworth said the following: As you yield to the Spirit of the Lord He has power over you intellect, over your heart, and over your voice. The Holy Spirit has power to unveil Christ and to project the vision of Christ upon the canvas of your mind, and then use your tongue to glorify and magnify Him in a way that you could never do apart from the Spirit's power. Some people have the Holy Ghost tied up and gagged in the basement! You can barely hear Him saying, \"Let me out.\" You say, \"No, if I let you out, You'll have me witnessing to somebody. The last time I let You out, You had me getting happy and dancing. Then I gave more money in the offering than I had planned to give. I'm not going to let you out!\" Jesus said that the Holy Spirit has come to live in you forever. As you yield to Him, He will have power over your intellect, think through your mind and change your personality. You may say, \"I don't know about that!\" Think about this , you have the media, your grandma's opinion or things you picked up at college all trying to think through your mind. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth and He will speak truth to your mind form God's Word. When you respond to Him and act on the Word, there is power that will be released. \"If you continue in my Word, then you are my disciples indeed; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.\" (John 8:31-32,36). That's when every need is met. The proper protocol before God and in the middle of trouble has never changed! It still brings supernatural results; it is joy unspeakable and its results are the glory of God. Happy are those who hear the joyful call to worship, for they will walk in the light of your presence, Lord. They rejoice all day long in your wonderful reputation. They exult in your righteousness. (Ps. 89:15-16 NLT) This day is holy to God. Don't feel bad. The joy of God is your strength! (Neh. 8:10 MSG) The Holy Spirit prompts us to rejoice so we can be filled with Him. Why do you have to be continually filled with the Holy Spirit? Because you leak!
