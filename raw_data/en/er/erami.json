The growth medium for rubella is Minimum [Essential](https://www.rxlist.com/essential/definition.htm) Medium (MEM) [a buffered salt solution containing vitamins and amino acids and supplemented with fetal bovine serum] containing recombinant human albumin and neomycin. Sorbitol and hydrolyzed [gelatin](https://www.rxlist.com/gelatin/supplements.htm) stabilizer are added to the individual virus harvests. The cells, virus pools, and fetal bovine serum are all screened for the absence of [adventitious](https://www.rxlist.com/adventitious/definition.htm) agents. The reconstituted vaccine is for subcutaneous administration. Each 0.5 mL dose contains not less than 1,000 TCID50 (tissue culture infectious doses) of measles virus; 12,500 TCID50 of mumps virus; and 1,000 TCID50 of rubella virus. Each dose of the vaccine is calculated to contain sorbitol (14.5 mg), sodium phosphate, sucrose (1.9 mg), sodium chloride, hydrolyzed gelatin (14.5 mg), recombinant human albumin (0.3 mg), fetal bovine serum (<1 ppm), other buffer and media ingredients and approximately 25 mcg of neomycin. The product contains no preservative. Before reconstitution, the lyophilized vaccine is a light yellow compact crystalline plug. M-M-R II, when reconstituted as directed, is clear yellow.

INDICATIONS Recommended Vaccination Schedule M-M-R II is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in individuals 12 months of age or older. Individuals first vaccinated at 12 months of age or older should be revaccinated prior to elementary school entry. Revaccination is intended to seroconvert those who do not respond to the first dose. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends administration of the first dose of M-M-R II at 12 to 15 months of age and administration of the second dose of M-M-R II at 4 to 6 years of age.{32} In addition, some public health jurisdictions mandate the age for revaccination. Consult the complete text of applicable guidelines regarding routine revaccination including that of high-risk adult populations. Measles Outbreak Schedule Infants Between 6 To 12 Months Of Age Local health authorities may recommend measles vaccination of infants between 6 to 12 months of age in outbreak situations. This population may fail to respond to the components of the vaccine. Safety and effectiveness of mumps and [rubella vaccine](https://www.rxlist.com/rubella_vaccine/definition.htm) in infants less than 12 months of age have not been established. The younger the infant, the lower the likelihood of [seroconversion](https://www.rxlist.com/seroconversion/definition.htm) (see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CP)). Such infants should receive a second dose of M-M-R II between 12 to 15 months of age followed by revaccination at elementary school entry.{32} Unnecessary doses of a vaccine are best avoided by ensuring that written documentation of vaccination is preserved and a copy given to each vaccinee's parent or guardian. Other Vaccination Considerations Non-Pregnant Adolescent and Adult Females Immunization of susceptible non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age with live attenuated rubella virus vaccine is indicated if certain precautions are observed (see below and [PRECAUTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#P)). Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against subsequently acquiring rubella infection during pregnancy, which in turn prevents infection of the fetus and consequent [congenital](https://www.rxlist.com/congenital/definition.htm) rubella injury.{33} Women of childbearing age should be advised not to become pregnant for 3 months after vaccination and should be informed of the reasons for this precaution. The ACIP has stated \"If it is practical and if reliable laboratory services are available, women of childbearing age who are potential candidates for vaccination can have serologic tests to determine susceptibility to rubella. However, with the exception of premarital and [prenatal](https://www.rxlist.com/prenatal/definition.htm) screening, routinely performing serologic tests for all women of childbearing age to determine susceptibility (so that vaccine is given only to proven susceptible women) can be effective but is expensive. Also, 2 visits to the health-care provider would be necessary \u2014 one for screening and one for vaccination. Accordingly, rubella vaccination of a woman who is not known to be pregnant and has no history of vaccination is justifiable without serologic testing \u2014 and may be preferable, particularly when costs of serology are high and follow-up of identified susceptible women for vaccination is not assured.\"{33} Postpubertal females should be informed of the frequent occurrence of generally self-limited [arthralgia](https://www.rxlist.com/arthralgia/definition.htm) and/or [arthritis](https://www.rxlist.com/arthritis/definition.htm) beginning 2 to 4 weeks after vaccination (see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#AR)). Postpartum Women It has been found convenient in many instances to vaccinate rubella-susceptible women in the immediate [postpartum](https://www.rxlist.com/postpartum/definition.htm) period (see [PRECAUTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#P), Nursing Mothers). Other Populations Previously unvaccinated children older than 12 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women should receive live attenuated rubella vaccine (such as that contained in monovalent rubella vaccine or in M-M-R II) to reduce the risk of exposure of the pregnant woman. Individuals planning travel outside the United States, if not immune, can acquire measles, mumps, or rubella and import these diseases into the United States. Therefore, prior to international travel, individuals known to be susceptible to one or more of these diseases can either receive the indicated monovalent vaccine (measles, mumps, or rubella), or a combination vaccine as appropriate. However, M-M-R II is preferred for persons likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella; and if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available, travelers should receive M-M-R II regardless of their immune status to mumps or rubella.{34-36} Vaccination is recommended for susceptible individuals in high-risk groups such as college students, health-care workers, and military personnel.{33,34,37} According to ACIP recommendations, most persons born in 1956 or earlier are likely to have been infected with measles naturally and generally need not be considered susceptible. All children, adolescents, and adults born after 1956 are considered susceptible and should be vaccinated, if there are no contraindications. This includes persons who may be immune to measles but who lack adequate documentation of [immunity](https://www.rxlist.com/immunity/definition.htm) such as: (1) physician-diagnosed measles, (2) laboratory evidence of measles immunity, or (3) adequate immunization with live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday.{34} The ACIP recommends that \"Persons vaccinated with inactivated vaccine followed within 3 months by live vaccine should be revaccinated with two doses of live vaccine. Revaccination is particularly important when the risk of exposure to wild-type measles virus is increased, as may occur during international travel.\"{34} Post-Exposure Vaccination Vaccination of individuals exposed to wild-type measles may provide some protection if the vaccine can be administered within 72 hours of exposure. If, however, vaccine is given a few days before exposure, substantial protection may be afforded.{34,38,39} There is no conclusive evidence that vaccination of individuals recently exposed to wild-type mumps or wild-type rubella will provide protection.{33,37} Use With Other Vaccines See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Use With Other Vaccines. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION FOR SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION Do not inject intravascularly. The dose for any age is 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously, preferably into the outer aspect of the upper arm. The recommended age for primary vaccination is 12 to 15 months. Revaccination with M-M-R II is recommended prior to elementary school entry. See also INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Recommended Vaccination Schedule. Children first vaccinated when younger than 12 months of age should receive another dose between 12 to 15 months of age followed by revaccination prior to elementary school entry.{32} See also INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Measles Outbreak Schedule. Immune Globulin ( [IG](https://www.rxlist.com/ig/definition.htm)) is not to be given concurrently with M-M-R II (see [PRECAUTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#P), General and [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#DI)). CAUTION: A sterile syringe free of preservatives, antiseptics, and detergents should be used for each injection and/or reconstitution of the vaccine because these substances may inactivate the live virus vaccine. A 25 gauge, 5/8\" needle is recommended. To reconstitute, use only the diluent supplied, since it is free of preservatives or other [antiviral](https://www.rxlist.com/antiviral/definition.htm) substances which might inactivate the vaccine. Single Dose Vial \u2014 First withdraw the entire volume of diluent into the syringe to be used for reconstitution. Inject all the diluent in the syringe into the vial of lyophilized vaccine, and agitate to mix thoroughly. If the lyophilized vaccine cannot be dissolved, discard. Withdraw the entire contents into a syringe and inject the total volume of restored vaccine subcutaneously. It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual patient to prevent transmission of [hepatitis B](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis_b/definition.htm) and other infectious agents from one person to another. [Parenteral](https://www.rxlist.com/parenteral/definition.htm) drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. M-M-R II, when reconstituted, is clear yellow. Use With Other Vaccines M-M-R II should be given one month before or after administration of other live viral [vaccines](https://www.rxlist.com/vaccines/definition.htm). M-M-R II has been administered concurrently with VARIVAX\u00ae [ [Varicella](https://www.rxlist.com/varicella_chickenpox/definition.htm) Virus Vaccine Live (Oka/Merck)], and PedvaxHIB\u00ae [Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate)] using separate injection sites and syringes. No impairment of [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to individually tested vaccine antigens was demonstrated. The type, frequency, and severity of adverse experiences observed with M-M-R II were similar to those seen when each vaccine was given alone. Routine administration of [DTP](https://www.rxlist.com/dtp/definition.htm) ( [diphtheria](https://www.rxlist.com/diphtheria/definition.htm), [tetanus](https://www.rxlist.com/tetanus/definition.htm), measles, mumps and rubella vaccines is not recommended because there are limited data relating to the simultaneous administration of these antigens. However, other schedules have been used. The ACIP has stated \"Although data are limited concerning the simultaneous administration of the entire recommended vaccine series (i.e., [DTaP](https://www.rxlist.com/dtap/definition.htm) [or DTwP], [IPV](https://www.rxlist.com/ipv/definition.htm) [or OPV], Hib with or without [Hepatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/hepatitis/definition.htm) B vaccine, and varicella vaccine), data from numerous studies have indicated no interference between routinely recommended [childhood](https://www.rxlist.com/childhood/definition.htm) vaccines (either live, attenuated, or killed). These findings support the simultaneous use of all vaccines as recommended.\"{62} HOW SUPPLIED No. 4681 \u2014 M-M-R II is supplied as follows: (1) a box of 10 single-dose vials of lyophilized vaccine (package A), NDC 0006-4681-00; and (2) a box of 10 vials of diluent (package B). To conserve refrigerator space, the diluent may be stored separately at room temperature. Storage To maintain potency, M-M-R II must be stored between -58\u00b0F and +46\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C). Use of dry ice may subject M-M-R II to temperatures colder than -58\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C). Protect the vaccine from light at all times, since such exposure may inactivate the [viruses](https://www.rxlist.com/viruses/definition.htm). Before reconstitution, store the lyophilized to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). The diluent may be stored in the refrigerator with the lyophilized vaccine or separately at room temperature. Do not freeze the diluent. It is recommended that the vaccine be used as soon as possible after reconstitution. Store reconstituted vaccine in the vaccine vial in a dark place at 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) and discard if not used within 8 hours.

Dist. by: Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of MERCK & CO., INC., Whitehouse Station, NJ 08889, USA. Revised: May 2017 SIDE EFFECTS The following adverse reactions are listed in decreasing order of severity, without regard to causality, within each body system category and have been reported during clinical trials, with use of the marketed vaccine, or with use of monovalent or bivalent vaccine containing measles, mumps, System [Anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm) and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported as well as related phenomena such as angioneurotic edema (including peripheral or facial edema) and bronchial spasm in individuals with or without an allergic history. Musculoskeletal System Arthritis; arthralgia; [myalgia](https://www.rxlist.com/myalgia/definition.htm). Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and sex, being greatest in adult females and least in [prepubertal](https://www.rxlist.com/prepubertal/definition.htm) children. This type of involvement as well as myalgia and [paresthesia](https://www.rxlist.com/paresthesia/definition.htm), have also been reported following administration of MERUVAX II. Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients developed chronic joint symptoms. Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon and generally of brief duration. In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (children: 0-3%; women: 12-26%),{17,56,57} and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and in adult women. Even in women older than 35 years, these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities. Nervous System [Encephalitis](https://www.rxlist.com/encephalitis/definition.htm); [encephalopathy](https://www.rxlist.com/encephalopathy/definition.htm); been reported approximately once for every 3 million doses of M-M-R II or measles-, mumps-, and rubella-containing vaccine administered since licensure of these vaccines. The risk of serious [neurological](https://www.rxlist.com/neurological/definition.htm) disorders following live measles virus vaccine administration remains less than the risk of encephalitis and encephalopathy following infection with wild-type measles (1 per 1000 reported cases).{58,59} In severely [immunocompromised](https://www.rxlist.com/immunocompromised/definition.htm) individuals who have been inadvertently vaccinated with measlescontaining vaccine; measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI)). In this population, disseminated mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection have also been reported. There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination. Based on estimated nationwide measles vaccine distribution, the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed. This is far less than the association with infection with wild-type measles, 6-22 cases of SSPE per million cases of measles. The results of a [retrospective](https://www.rxlist.com/retrospective/definition.htm) case-controlled study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that the overall effect of measles vaccine has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent higher risk of SSPE.{60} Cases of [aseptic](https://www.rxlist.com/aseptic/definition.htm) [meningitis](https://www.rxlist.com/meningitis/definition.htm) have been reported to VAERS following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. Although a causal relationship between the Urabe strain of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine to Special Senses - Ear Nerve [deafness](https://www.rxlist.com/deafness/definition.htm); [otitis media](https://www.rxlist.com/otitis_media/definition.htm). Special neuritis; [conjunctivitis](https://www.rxlist.com/conjunctivitis/definition.htm). Urogenital System Other Death from various, and in some cases unknown, causes has been reported rarely following vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; however, a causal relationship has not been established in healthy individuals (see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI)). No deaths or permanent [sequelae](https://www.rxlist.com/sequelae/definition.htm) were reported in a published post-marketing surveillance study in Finland involving 1.5 million children and adults who were vaccinated with M-M-R II during 1982 to 1993.{61} Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, health-care providers and manufacturers are required to record and report certain suspected adverse events occurring within specific time periods after vaccination. However, the U.S. [Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.rxlist.com/department_of_health_and_human_services/definition.htm) ( [DHHS](https://www.rxlist.com/dhhs/definition.htm)) has established a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which will accept all reports of suspected events.{49} A VAERS report form as well as information regarding reporting requirements can be obtained by calling VAERS 1-800-822-7967. DRUG INTERACTIONS See [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#DAA), Use With Other Vaccines. Immunosuppressive Therapy The immune status of patients about to undergo [immunosuppressive](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppressive/definition.htm) therapy should be evaluated so that the physician can consider whether vaccination prior to the initiation of treatment is indicated (see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI) and [PRECAUTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#P)). The ACIP has stated that \"patients with [leukemia](https://www.rxlist.com/leukemia/definition.htm) in [remission](https://www.rxlist.com/remission/definition.htm) who have not received [chemotherapy](https://www.rxlist.com/chemotherapy/definition.htm) for at least 3 months may receive live virus vaccines. Short-term (<2 weeks), low- to moderate-dose systemic [corticosteroid](https://www.rxlist.com/corticosteroid/definition.htm) therapy, topical [steroid](https://www.rxlist.com/steroid/definition.htm) therapy (e.g. [nasal](https://www.rxlist.com/nasal/definition.htm), skin), long-term alternate-day treatment with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroid, and intra-articular, [bursal](https://www.rxlist.com/bursal/definition.htm), or [tendon](https://www.rxlist.com/tendon/definition.htm) injection of corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive in their usual doses and do not [contraindicate](https://www.rxlist.com/contraindicate/definition.htm) the administration of [measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine].\"{33,34,37} Immune Globulin Administration of immune globulins concurrently with M-M-R II may interfere with the expected immune response.{33,34,47} See also [PRECAUTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#P), General.

WARNINGS Due caution should be employed in administration of M-M-R II to persons with a history of cerebral injury, individual or family histories of convulsions, or any other condition in which [stress](https://www.rxlist.com/stress/definition.htm) due to fever should be avoided. The physician should be alert to the temperature elevation which may occur following vaccination (see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#AR)). Hypersensitivity To Eggs Live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture. Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, [hypotension](https://www.rxlist.com/hypotension/definition.htm), or [shock](https://www.rxlist.com/shock/definition.htm)) subsequent to egg ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions after receiving vaccines containing traces of chick embryo antigen. The potential risk to benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases. Such individuals may be vaccinated with extreme caution, having adequate treatment on hand should a reaction occur (see PRECAUTIONS).{46} However, the [AAP](https://www.rxlist.com/aap/definition.htm) has stated, \"Most children with a history of anaphylactic reactions to eggs have no untoward reactions to measles or [MMR](https://www.rxlist.com/mmr/definition.htm) vaccine. Persons are not at increased risk if they have egg allergies that are not anaphylactic, and they should be vaccinated in the usual manner. In addition, skin testing of egg-allergic children with vaccine has not been predictive of which children will have an immediate hypersensitivity reaction...Persons with allergies to chickens or chicken feathers are not at increased risk of reaction to the vaccine.\"{47} Hypersensitivity To Neomycin The AAP states, \"Persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to topically or systemically administered neomycin should not receive measles vaccine. Most often, however, neomycin [allergy](https://www.rxlist.com/allergy/definition.htm) manifests as a [contact dermatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/contact_dermatitis/definition.htm), which is a delayed-type (cell-mediated) immune response rather than anaphylaxis. In such persons, an adverse reaction to neomycin in the vaccine would be an erythematous, [pruritic](https://www.rxlist.com/pruritic/definition.htm) [nodule](https://www.rxlist.com/nodule/definition.htm) or [papule](https://www.rxlist.com/papule/definition.htm), 48 to 96 hours after vaccination. A history of contact [dermatitis](https://www.rxlist.com/dermatitis/definition.htm) to neomycin is not a [contraindication](https://www.rxlist.com/contraindication/definition.htm) to receiving measles vaccine.\"{47} Thrombocytopenia Individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia with the first dose of M-M-R II (or its component vaccines) may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of vaccine are needed. The potential risk to benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases (see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#AR)). PRECAUTIONS General Adequate treatment provisions, including [epinephrine](https://www.rxlist.com/epinephrine/definition.htm) injection (1:1000), should be available for immediate use should an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction occur. Special care should be taken to ensure that the injection does not enter a blood vessel. Children and young adults who are known to be infected with human [immunodeficiency](https://www.rxlist.com/immunodeficiency/definition.htm) viruses and are not immunosuppressed may be vaccinated. However, vaccinees who are infected with [HIV](https://www.rxlist.com/hiv/definition.htm) should be monitored closely for vaccine-preventable diseases because immunization may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI)).{42,43} Vaccination should be deferred for 3 months or longer following blood or plasma transfusions, or administration of immune globulin (human).{47} Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk.{33} However, transmission of the rubella vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented (see Nursing Mothers). There are no reports of transmission of live attenuated measles or mumps viruses from vaccinees to susceptible contacts. It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually may result in a temporary depression of [tuberculin](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculin/definition.htm) skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be done, it should be administered either before or simultaneously with M-M-R II. Children under treatment for [tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculosis/definition.htm) have not experienced exacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine;{48} no studies have been reported to date of the effect of measles virus vaccines on untreated [tuberculous](https://www.rxlist.com/tuberculous/definition.htm) children. However, individuals with active untreated tuberculosis should not be vaccinated. As for any vaccine, vaccination with M-M-R II may not result in protection in 100% of vaccinees. The health-care provider should determine the current health status and previous vaccination history of the vaccinee. The health-care provider should question the patient, parent, or guardian about reactions to a previous dose of M-M-R II or other measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines. Information For Patients The health-care provider should provide the vaccine information required to be given with each vaccination to the patient, parent, or guardian. The health-care provider should inform the patient, parent, or guardian of the benefits and risks associated with vaccination. For risks associated with vaccination see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#AR). Patients, parents, or guardians should be instructed to report any serious adverse reactions to their health-care provider who in turn should report such events to the U.S. Department of [Health and Human Services](https://www.rxlist.com/health_and_human_services/definition.htm) through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 1-800-822-7967.{49} Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination, and patients should be informed of the reasons for this precaution (see [INDICATIONS AND USAGE](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#I), Non-Pregnant Adolescent and Adult Females, [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI), and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy). Laboratory Tests See [INDICATIONS AND USAGE](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#I), Non-Pregnant Adolescent and Adult Females, for Rubella Susceptibility Testing, and [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CP). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility M-M-R II has not been evaluated for [carcinogenic](https://www.rxlist.com/carcinogenic/definition.htm) or mutagenic potential, or potential to impair fertility. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with M-M-R II. It is also not known whether MM- R II can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Therefore, the vaccine should not be administered to pregnant females; furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months following vaccination (see [INDICATIONS AND USAGE](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#I), Non-Pregnant Adolescent and Adult Females and [CONTRAINDICATIONS](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CI)). In counseling women who are inadvertently vaccinated when pregnant or who become pregnant within 3 months of vaccination, the physician should be aware of the following: (1) In a 10-year survey involving over 700 pregnant women who received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after [conception](https://www.rxlist.com/conception/definition.htm) (of whom 189 received the Wistar RA 27/3 strain), none of the newborns had abnormalities compatible with congenital [rubella syndrome](https://www.rxlist.com/rubella_syndrome/definition.htm);{50} (2) Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of [spontaneous abortion](https://www.rxlist.com/spontaneous_abortion/definition.htm). Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and fetus, there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans;{37} and (3) Reports have indicated that contracting wild-type measles during pregnancy enhances fetal risk. Increased rates of spontaneous [abortion](https://www.rxlist.com/abortion/definition.htm), stillbirth, congenital defects and [prematurity](https://www.rxlist.com/prematurity/definition.htm) have been observed subsequent to infection with wild-type measles during pregnancy.{51,52} There are no adequate studies of the attenuated (vaccine) strain of measles virus in pregnancy. However, it would be prudent to assume that the vaccine strain of virus is also capable of inducing adverse fetal effects. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine virus is secreted in human milk. Recent studies have shown that lactating postpartum women immunized with live attenuated rubella vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants.{53} In the infants with serological evidence of rubella infection, none exhibited severe disease; however, one exhibited mild clinical illness typical of [acquired](https://www.rxlist.com/acquired/definition.htm) rubella.{54,55} Caution should be exercised when M-M-R II is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of measles vaccine in infants below the age of 6 months have not been established (see also [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#CP)). Safety and effectiveness of mumps and rubella vaccine in infants less than 12 months of age have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of M-M-R II did not include sufficient numbers of seronegative subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects. REFERENCES 37.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Measles, mumps, three common childhood diseases, caused by measles virus, mumps virus (paramyxoviruses), and rubella virus (togavirus), respectively, that may be associated with serious complications and/or death. For example, pneumonia and encephalitis are caused by measles. Mumps is associated with aseptic meningitis, deafness rubella during pregnancy may cause congenital rubella syndrome in the infants of infected mothers. The impact of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination on the natural history of each disease in the United States can be quantified by comparing the maximum number of measles, mumps, and rubella cases reported in a given year prior to vaccine use to the number of cases of each disease reported in 1995. For measles, 894,134 cases reported in 1941 compared to 288 cases reported in 1995 resulted in a 99.97% decrease in reported cases; for mumps, 152,209 cases reported in 1968 compared to 840 cases reported in 1995 resulted in a 99.45% decrease in reported cases; and for rubella, 57,686 cases reported in 1969 compared to 200 cases reported in 1995 resulted in a 99.65% decrease.{3} Clinical studies of 284 triple seronegative children, 11 months to 7 years of age, demonstrated that MM- R II is highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. In these studies, a single injection of the vaccine induced measles hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies in 95%, mumps neutralizing antibodies in 96%, and rubella HI antibodies in 99% of susceptible persons. However, a small percentage (1-5%) of vaccinees may fail to seroconvert after the primary dose (see also [INDICATIONS AND USAGE](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#I), Recommended Vaccination Schedule). A study{4} of 6-month-old and 15-month-old infants born to vaccine-immunized mothers demonstrated that, following vaccination with ATTENUVAX, 74% of the 6-month-old infants developed detectable neutralizing antibody (NT) titers while 100% of the 15-month-old infants developed NT. This rate of seroconversion is higher than that previously reported for 6-month-old infants born to naturally immune mothers tested by HI assay. When the 6-month-old infants of immunized mothers were revaccinated at 15 months, they developed antibody titers equivalent to the 15-month-old vaccinees. The lower seroconversion rate in 6-month-olds has two possible explanations: 1) Due to the limit of the detection level of the assays (NT and enzyme immunoassay [EIA]), the presence of trace amounts of undetectable maternal antibody might interfere with the seroconversion of infants; or 2) The [immune system](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_system/definition.htm) of 6- month-olds is not always capable of mounting a response to measles vaccine as measured by the two antibody assays. There is some evidence to suggest that infants who are born to mothers who had wild-type measles and who are vaccinated at less than one year of age may not develop sustained antibody levels when later revaccinated. The advantage of early protection must be weighed against the chance for failure to respond adequately on reimmunization.{5,6} Efficacy of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines was established in a series of double-blind controlled field trials which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy afforded by the individual vaccine components.{7-12} These studies also established that seroconversion in response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these diseases.{13-15} Following vaccination, antibodies associated with protection can be measured by neutralization assays, HI, or [ELISA](https://www.rxlist.com/elisa/definition.htm) (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) ELISA antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most individuals 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination.{16-18} See [INDICATIONS AND USAGE](/m-m-r-ii-drug.htm#I), Non-Pregnant Adolescent and Adult Females, for Rubella Susceptibility Testing. The RA 27/3 rubella strain in M-M-R II elicits higher immediate post-vaccination HI, complementfixing and neutralizing antibody levels than other strains of rubella vaccine{19-25} and has been shown to induce a broader profile of circulating antibodies including anti-theta and anti-iota precipitating antibodies.{26,27} The RA 27/3 rubella strain immunologically simulates natural infection more closely than other rubella vaccine viruses.{27-29} The increased levels and broader profile of antibodies produced by RA 27/3 strain rubella virus vaccine appear to correlate with greater resistance to subclinical reinfection with the wild virus,{27,29-31} and provide greater confidence for lasting immunity.

Farquhar, Generic name: Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live This is a summary of information about M-M-R II\u00ae. You should read it before you or your child receives the vaccine. If you have any questions about the vaccine after reading this leaflet, you should ask your health care provider. This is a summary only. It does not take the place of talking about M-MR II with your doctor, nurse, or other health care provider. Only your health care provider can decide if M-M-R II is right for you or your child. What is M-M-R II and how does it work? M-M-R II is also known as Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live. It is a live virus vaccine that is given as a shot. This vaccine is usually given to people one year old or older. It is meant to help prevent measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles). M-M-R II of measles virus, mumps virus, and rubella virus. M-M-R II works by helping the immune system protect you or your child from getting measles, mumps, or rubella. M-M-R II may not protect everyone who gets the vaccine. M-M-R II does not treat measles, mumps, or rubella once you or your child has them. What do I need to know about measles, mumps, and rubella? Measles is also known as rubeola. It is a serious illness. Measles virus can be passed to others if you have it. Measles can give you a high fever, cough, and a rash. The illness can last for 1 to 2 weeks. In rare cases, it can also cause an infection of the brain. This could lead to seizures, hearing loss, [mental retardation](https://www.rxlist.com/mental_retardation/definition.htm), and even death. Mumps can also be passed to others. This virus can cause fever and headache. It also makes the glands under your jaw swell and be painful. The illness often lasts for several days. Sometimes, mumps can make the [testicles](https://www.rxlist.com/testicles/definition.htm) swell and be painful. In some cases, it can cause meningitis, which is a mild swelling of the coverings of the brain and [spinal cord](https://www.rxlist.com/spinal_cord/definition.htm). Rubella is also known as German measles. It is often a mild illness. Rubella virus can cause a mild fever, swollen glands in the neck, pain and swelling in the joints, and a rash that lasts for a short time. It can be very dangerous if a pregnant woman catches it. Women who catch German measles when they are pregnant can have babies who are stillborn. Also, the babies may be blind or deaf, or have [heart disease](https://www.rxlist.com/heart_disease/definition.htm) or mental retardation. Who should not get M-M-R II? Do not get M-M-R II if you or your child: - are allergic to any of its ingredients (This includes gelatin or neomycin. See the ingredient list at the end of this leaflet.); - have a weakened immune system, such as an immune deficiency, an inherited immune disorder, leukemia, [lymphoma](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphoma/definition.htm), or HIV/AIDS; - take high doses of steroids by mouth or in a shot; - have a fever higher than 101.3\u00b0F (38.5\u00b0C); - are pregnant or plan to get pregnant within the next three months. What should you tell your health care provider before getting M-M-R II? Tell your health care provider if you or your child: - have or have had any medical problems; - have a history of seizures or a brain injury; - have received blood or plasma transfusions or human serum globulin; - have [active tuberculosis](https://www.rxlist.com/active_tuberculosis/definition.htm)that is not treated; - take any medicines (This includes non-prescription medicines and dietary supplements.); - have any allergies (This includes allergies to neomycin or gelatin.); - had an allergic reaction to any other vaccine; - are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next three months; - are breast-feeding; - have or have had a low blood [platelet count](https://www.rxlist.com/platelet_count/definition.htm); - are allergic to eggs. How is M-M-R II given? M-M-R II is given as a shot to people one year old or older. The dose of the vaccine is the same for everyone. If your child gets the shot when he or she is one year old or older, a second dose is recommended. Often, the second dose is given right before the child goes to elementary school (4 to 6 years of age). If your child is less than one year old when he or she first gets the shot, a second dose should be given when they are 12 to 15 months old. Then, a third shot should be given between 4 and 6 years of age. Your doctor will decide the best time and number of shots by using official recommendations. If a dose is missed, your health care provider will let you know when you should have it. Non-pregnant adolescent and adult females of childbearing age who are susceptible to rubella can be vaccinated with M-M-R II (or live attenuated rubella virus vaccine) if certain precautions are taken. In many cases, it is convenient to give the vaccine to women at risk for rubella right after they give birth. What are the possible side effects of M-M-R II? The most common side effect of vaccination with M-M-R II is burning and/or stinging at the site of the shot for a short time. Other side effects may include: - Fever - Rash Less common side effects may also include: - Swelling of the testicles - Joint pain and/or swelling Some side effects are rare but may be serious. You should call your health care provider if you notice any of the following problems: - Difficulty breathing, [wheezing](https://www.rxlist.com/wheezing/definition.htm), hives, or a skin rash may be signs of an allergic reaction. - Bleeding or bruising under the skin. - Seizures, a severe headache, a change in behavior or consciousness, or difficulty walking. Other side effects may also occur. Your doctor has a more complete list of side effects for M-M-R II. Contact your doctor or health care provider if you or your child have any new or unusual symptoms after receiving M-M-R II. You may also report any adverse reactions to your doctor or your child's health care provider or submit a report directly to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967 or you may report online to www.vaers.hhs.gov. What are the ingredients of M-M-R II? Active Ingredients: weakened forms gelatin, recombinant human albumin, fetal bovine serum, other buffer and media ingredients, neomycin. What else should I know about M-M-R II? If you get M-M-R II while you are pregnant, please call 1-800-986-8999. Or, you can have your health care provider call. This leaflet summarizes important information about M-M-R II. If you would like more information, talk to your health care provider or call 1-800-622-4477.
