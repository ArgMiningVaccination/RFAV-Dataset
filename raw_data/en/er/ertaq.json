Nevertheless, the tremendous effort tounderstand the disease and develop effective methods of control has removed the disease from signi-cant parts of the world. A major component of the research effort against malaria is the capacity of scientists based in Africa to study the disease on the ground. This report identies existing centres of excellence as well as high-lighting areas of remaining need. As is typical of reports of this kind, in which new data are brought tothe fore, interesting phenomena are uncovered which, when revealed, suggest obvious solutions.Perhaps the best example of this is that the majority of collaborations that individual scientists in Africahave are with laboratories outside the continent, mainly Europe and the USA. Surprisingly, there isminimal collaboration within Africa. Therefore, funds need to be made available to foster collabora-tions on the continent and maximize the impact of existing knowledge and experiences. Although the objective of this report was to provide evidence to guide the development of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, its ndings can probably be generalized to many areas of healthresearch. Clearly, further coordination of the multitude of agencies supporting health research is calledfor, but perhaps more importantly there needs to be a closer link between these agencies and scientiststo identify local needs as well as with governments to ensure the long-term sustainability of theresearch infrastructure. It is very much hoped that this report will stimulate such activities in an analo-gous manner to an earlier report on malaria research from the same stable.

Vaccines and diseasetreatments, for example, together with newknowledge to enable people to maintain theirown health, have averted disease, reduced suffer-ing and enabled greater productivity in manyregions. However, the research bases in mostdeveloping countries require signicant strength-ening to enable effective responses to the chal-lenges of local health problems. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is a global initiative that is particularlyconcerned with building research capacity inAfrica to tackle the major and increasing prob-lem posed by malaria. This study was undertak-en by the Wellcome T rust as part of the activitiesof MIM. The purpose was to generate soundanalytical data that could inform discussions onstrategies for strengthening research bases inAfrica and enable future monitoring of progress. The study included a unique survey of train- ing opportunities in health and biomedicalresearch offered by high-income countries to sci-entists in developing regions. It also examinedthe current status of malaria research capacityand training in Africa using a number ofapproaches. Research outputs, infrastructure,availability of trained personnel, training path-ways and funding sources were assessed, and theopinions of African scientists on training needsand solutions were sought. The ndings of the review represent a resource for funding organizations and govern-ments in both developed and developing countries to assist evidence-based approaches toresearch training activities. In addition, the reportis intended to raise awareness amongst Africanscientists of current research training opportuni-ties and the characteristics of leading malariaresearch centres across sub-Saharan Africa.Although the review has a particular focus onmalaria research in Africa, many of the conclu-sions are more broadly applicable to capacitydevelopment in other research areas and otherdeveloping regions.MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE STUDY The study comprised the following analytical approaches:1. A survey of training opportunities for devel- oping-country scientists in biomedical sci-ences and health offered by funding organi-zations internationally (1995-98). 2. An assessment of research capacity and training activities in African malaria research through: analysis of malaria publication outputs in MEDLINE and Science Citation Index(SCI) databases (1995-97) to identify themost productive countries and centres, col-laboration patterns, funding sources, sub-eld specializations and citation impact; analysis of research literature cited in African national malaria treatment guide-lines and policies; a questionnaire-based survey of 54 malaria research centres across Africa to assess facili-ties, expertise and training pathways, and togather opinions on research training needsand solutions. MAIN FINDINGS Broad indicators of malaria research capability Analysis of malaria publications in the SCI data-base for 1995-97 showed that African scientistsand institutes make a major contribution tointernational malaria research: 17.2 per cent ofglobal publications included an address inAfrica. By comparison, the contribution ofAfrica to overall research in health and biomedi-cine, stands at just 1.2 per cent of the world'soutput. The highest contributing individualcountries in malaria research were the USA, UKand France which participated in 30.0, 17.8 and9.6 per cent of publications respectively in thethree-year period assessed. Malaria research is a strong component of all research relevant to health or disease in develop-ing countries, representing an estimated 21 percent of worldwide publications in tropical medi-cine. However, the absolute level of malariaresearch activity is low relative to other areas ofbiomedical research and in relation to the globalburden of malaria disease: publications num-bered approximately 1000 a year and accountedExecutive summary10 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africafor just 0.3 per cent of all outputs in SCI annu- ally. By comparison, cardiology accounted for10.2 per cent, and arthritis and rheumatism 2.4per cent of world SCI publications in 1995.The low publishing activity in internationalmalaria research reflects the relatively smallglobal investment, which stood at aboutUS$100 million in 1998. Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and The Gambia were the highest publishing African countries inmalaria research in 1995-97, each producingmore than 50 papers. The most productive indi-vidual research programmes were located at theUK Medical Research Council Laboratories,Fajara, The Gambia; the KEMRI-WellcomeT rust collaborative programme in Kili andNairobi, Kenya; and the University of Ibadan,Nigeria. Seven centres published more than 20papers in the three-year period assessed. Overall, African malaria research publica- tions show extensive international co-author-ship: 79 per cent of papers were found to involvecollaboration outside Africa, particularly withEurope and the USA, and few linkages acrossAfrica were observed. While this high degree ofcollaboration indicates productive links betweenlaboratory research in 'Northern' laboratories,and eld and clinical studies in Africa, it alsoreflects dependence on foreign funding sourcesand on external expertise. Direct survey of African malaria research lab- oratories provided a more detailed impression ofthe availability of human resources for researchand revealed the presence of a core of trained sci-entists currently engaged in malaria research. Atotal of 752 malaria researchers trained to atleast rst degree level were identied in 54research centres across sub-Saharan Africa. Ahigh proportion (35 per cent) were trained toMaster's level, while postdoctoral scientists andclinicians were also well represented (26 and 22per cent respectively). The majority of PhDgraduates held Master's degrees and nearly halfof clinical researchers also held higher degrees.However, the 192 postdoctoral and 168 clinicalscientists identied were dispersed across 22countries so that the numbers of trainedresearchers per country were small. In addition,about one-third of research groups were led bynon-national scientists. Of the 313 individualquestionnaire respondents, 15 per cent werenon-African. The results, therefore, indicate astrong need for additional African scientic leaders who are able to conduct innovative andindependent research, and play a key role incapacity-building efforts. While numbers of trained personnel and publications provide an indication of the level ofresearch activity, they are unable to measure theimpact and usefulness of that research. Citationindices of publications are commonly usedmeasures of research impact, which indicate theinfluence of published results on the scienticcommunity. African malaria research papers for1995-97 had a lower potential citation impactthan the international set of malaria papers forthe same period. However, the result primarilyreflects the highly clinical and applied nature ofAfrican research, as this type of research isknown to attract fewer citations than more fun-damental studies. Citations, therefore, do notprovide an accurate measure of the value of moreapplied research, and alternative methods arerequired. Literature cited in national guidelines and policies for the treatment and control of malariafrom 11 African countries were examined toassess links between research and policies. Theresults indicated that it is clinical and in-countryresearch, often recorded in grey literature, thatinfluences policies rather than basic research.These observations would support investment inthe local research bases in developing countries,particularly in clinical and applied sciences.Analysis of national policies and guidelines is animportant potential method of demonstratingspecic outcomes from clinical and appliedresearch. However, there was a lack of a system-atic approach to citing scientic literature in thedocuments examined, and more widespread useof this approach would be dependent on coun-tries including full bibliographies in their policydocuments. Investments in research and training in developing regions A diverse set of funding organizations in indus- trialized countries support research and trainingin Africa, Asia and South America, as revealed bysurveys of funding agencies and of malariaresearch laboratories in Africa, and by analysis offunding acknowledgements on malaria publica-tions. These include governmental, non-govern-mental and commercial sources.Executive summaryStrengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 11The most frequently acknowledged funders on African malaria research publications were theUNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programmefor Research and T raining in T ropical Diseases(TDR), the Wellcome T rust, the Kenyan Med-ical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the UKMedical Research Council. Commercial fundingsources for African malaria research were notprominent: only Hoffman La Roche registeredmore than ten acknowledgements on publica-tions over a three-year period. Fourteen commer-cial companies were listed in the survey ofAfrican research centres as providing grants, butfunding was generally on a small scale. Survey of funding organizations and of African malaria research laboratories indicatedthat training opportunities for developing-coun-try scientists are widely dispersed across manyorganizations from high-income countries.However, only a few funders provide substantiallevels of support, notably the Japan InternationalCooperation Agency (JICA), the EuropeanCommission (INCO-DC), the US NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), and TDR. Otherrelatively prominent direct supporters of train-ing (excluding multilateral contributions)include Australian, Belgian, Danish, French,Swedish, Swiss Government agencies, theInternational Clinical Epidemiology Network(INCLEN) and the Wellcome T rust. An aggregate expenditure by industrialized countries of US$261 million for training devel-oping-country scientists in biomedical scienceand health was identied for the three-year peri-od 1995-97. is low comparedwith the gure of US$145 million invested in asingle year (1997) in developing biomedicalresearch expertise in the UK. Nevertheless, thereappears to be a growing international commit-ment to strengthening research capacity indeveloping countries: a 41 per cent increase inexpenditure by high-income countries was observed over the three-year period assessed. Contributions to training by governments in developing regions were not broadly surveyed,but data were obtained from Brazil and SouthAfrica, which are by far the highest investors inresearch in their regions. The gures obtainedsuggest that expenditures by other countries inSouth America and sub-Saharan Africa are likelyto be very low. The research base in Africa is strongly dependent on external investment: 88 per centof malaria research grants to African laboratoriesfor 1993-98 were from organizations outsideAfrica. For PhD training, 65 per cent of fundingacknowledgements were to agencies from devel-oped regions, and 17 per cent to African govern-mental or local sources. Many researchersreported funding their own degree studies.African governments contribute signicantly tosupport for Bachelor's degrees (over half in thegroup analysed), and to salaries of nationalresearchers (68 per cent of survey group). Localgovernment sources were also the highest indi-vidual category acknowledged for PhD andMaster's training. Career progression opportunities in biomedical research Survey responses from 39 funding organzations revealed the broad range of training schemes inhealth and biomedical research offered by higher-income countries to scientists in developingcountries. However, these training opportunitiesare generally dispersed, with many funders pro-viding small numbers of awards annually.T raining is often associated with specic pro-grammes and is not offered openly, thus limitingoptions for individuals seeking to identifysources of funding. Relatively small numbers oforganizations actively monitor the numbers andsuccess of training awards, illustrating the lack ofa coherent international approach to trainingscientists. Despite the large number of trainingschemes overall, there are few opportunities forscientists to develop their careers through thefunding schemes of a single organization, asmany funders target training at one level. Most agencies focus their resources on partic- ular regions, and available data suggested thatAfrica and Asia are slightly favoured over SouthAmerica in terms of training opportunities. The availability of international awards for developing-country scientists at different stages ofcareer progression was assessed. It was found that: T raining attachments in overseas laboratories and short courses are the most frequent typesof support provided by organizations in devel-oped countries, and accounted for a large pro-portion of overall identied expenditure. Very few organizations in high-income coun- tries provide support for Bachelor's degrees.Executive summary12 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa A large proportion (74 per cent) of organiza- tions surveyed provides support for Master'straining, although many provide only smallnumbers of awards annually. Over half of theidentied Master's awards came fromINCLEN and the Belgian Agency forDevelopment Cooperation, and these awardswere focused in the areas of clinical epidemi-ology, public health and related disciplines,indicating that the availability of Master'straining in other disciplines is more limited. A smaller proportion of funders offers PhD training (just over half of those surveyed),but over 90 per cent of identied awardswere provided by the European Commission,TDR, US National Institutes of Health(NIH) and DANIDA. AusAID is an impor-tant supporter of training for Asian scientists,although available data were incomplete.Survey of African research centres also identi-ed L 'Institut de Recherche pour leD\u00e9veloppement (IRD) and the FrenchMinistry of Cooperation as notable fundersof PhD training. Postdoctoral training is often provided in association with larger research programmesand few agencies provide opportunities forindividual postdoctoral scientists to apply forindependent research support. The US NIHand the Wellcome T rust were the mostprominent supporters of postdoctoral train-ing identied in the survey. African scientistscommented on the lack of availability ofresearch awards to develop the careers ofpostdoctoral scientists. The survey of funders from high-income countries identied a total of 684 PhD awardsand 821 Master's awards for 1995-98. By com-parison, in a single year (1997) there were an esti-mated 2101 PhD awards directed towards build-ing biomedical research expertise in the UK, acountry with a population of about one-seventy-fth of the developing-country regions com-bined. This is equivalent to nearly 1000 timesmore PhD opportunities in the UK than in thedeveloping regions, relative to population size. Inview of the dependence of many developingcountries on external funding sources for post-graduate training, the overall conclusion is thatprovision of research training opportunities fordeveloping-country scientists is low relative toopportunities in industrialized countries. These gures must of course be considered in the light of the more limited availability of grad-uates to absorb training at higher-degree levelsin developing countries. However, comparativegures for numbers of tertiary students and PhDawards per unit population in developing anddeveloped countries support the view that cur-rent PhD training in many developing countriesis restricted. In addition, three-quarters of scien-tists in Africa responding to the MIM surveyhighlighted the need for additional opportuni-ties at Master's and PhD level. T raining mechanisms and infrastructure Most funding organizations link training tomajor research programmes that have receivedsupport through a competitive, peer-reviewedprocess, thus providing some assurance thattraining will take place in a strong intellectualenvironment. Funders also tend to focusresources on specic centres to develop facilitiesand a critical mass of people that will encouragehigh-quality science to flourish. The survey of African malaria researchers revealed that 90 per cent of Bachelor's degreeshad been completed within Africa (81 per centlocally or self-funded), but just over half of post-graduate qualications had been obtained whol-ly or partially outside the home country. Exter-nal training occurred most frequently in Europefollowed by the USA. The extent of overseastraining varied among countries, with moreresearchers receiving PhD training at home inNigeria, South Africa, Cameroon and Senegal. Patterns of African scientic partnerships and training sites are strongly moulded by fund-ing mechanisms, which reflect historical andlanguage associations and geographical proximi-ty. In many cases training is offered in the coun-try in which the donor organization is based.There are few funding mechanisms that supportlinkages between countries within developingregions. For example, France and the UK focustheir resources primarily on centres in Franc-ophone and Anglophone Africa respectively,contributing to a lack of interaction betweeninstitutes in these regions. African survey respondents recognized the value of international partnerships as a mecha-nism for training and for technology transfer.They considered overseas training attachments toExecutive summaryStrengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 13be important in exposing developing-country scientists to the scientic culture and facilities ofoverseas centres of excellence. However, they alsonoted that overseas training is not always relevantto the home research base, is expensive, and mayresult in researchers being attracted permanentlyaway from their home countries to locationswhere the facilities and career prospects areadvantageous. It was considered that local train-ing opportunities within Africa are not beingfully exploited, and further investment in Africantraining centres would be valuable to allowregional technology transfer and sharing ofresources. Funding agencies are increasingly rec-ognizing the benets of using local and regionaltraining facilities, combined with shorter train-ing attachments in European or US laboratories,to develop sustainable and locally relevantresearch expertise. Many of the most productive malaria research centres in Africa receive long-term sup-port from external funders and are relatively wellequipped, thus underscoring the importance ofa stable foundation from which to develop aneffective research programme. Over 90 per centof all African malaria laboratories surveyed hadcore laboratory facilities (freezers, centrifuges,incubators and microscopes). However, a highproportion of individual survey respondentscited lack of research funds or poor infrastruc-ture and laboratory facilities as major obstaclesto developing a research career in Africa. Africanresearchers also emphasized the critical impor-tance of good communication links in allowingthem to participate effectively in internationalresearch activities. The survey results indicatethat the communications revolution is success-fully reaching Africa as 90 per cent of laboratorieshad e-mail connections. The quality of electroniccommunications, however, was not assessed. Adequate remuneration is a major factor in successfully retaining scientists in developingcountries. Nearly 70 per cent of African scien-tists surveyed received their salaries from localsources, but many commented that these salarieswere insufcient. The present study identied the location and specializations of a number of strong malariaresearch centres across sub-Saharan Africa. Primary funding sources of these centres andinternational scientic partnerships have alsobeen analysed. This information should assistboth researchers and funders in identifying cen-tres which might be further developed for localand regional training, and for multicentre studies. Research specializations: diseases and disciplines Research training schemes must aim to build capacity that is appropriate to national healthneeds and priorities. Many funding agencies tar-get resources on particular diseases or disciplines.For example, INCLEN focuses on developingexpertise in clinical epidemiology, and related dis-ciplines, while WHO/TDR focuses on eight tar-get tropical diseases. T raining is also often linkedto larger research programmes, whose researchfocus will strongly influence the balance ofexpertise generated by training activities. There isa need for overarching mechanisms to matchcapacity development to research priorities. The major focus of current malaria research in Africa is on clinical studies, epidemiology,intervention trials and health services research.Only 3 per cent of African malaria publicationsin SCI and MEDLINE (1995-97) related tobasic science studies of the malarial parasite, and7 per cent to fundamental studies of mosquitovectors, or vector taxonomy, ecology or behav-iour. Eighty-one per cent of African publicationsreported studies involving human subjects, com-pared with 46 per cent for malaria papers inter-nationally. Direct survey of malaria research lab-oratories in Africa conrmed the strong presenceof expertise in clinical and eld-based research:for example 132 scientists trained in publichealth and 88 in epidemiology were identied.The results also suggested that facilities andexpertise in molecular biology, biochemistry andimmunology are increasing (gel electrophoresisand PCR equipment was present in 76 and 58per cent of laboratories respectively). Thereappeared to be a lack of expertise in biostatistics,sociology and economics: 37, 36 and 12 individ-uals, respectively, were identied with trainingin these disciplines.Executive summary14 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaRECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WAY FORWARD This report has gathered information from dif- ferent perspectives on the availability of trainingopportunities for scientists in developing coun-tries, and on the current status of human andinfrastructural resources for malaria research inAfrica. In view of the enormity of the challengein strengthening research capacity in developingcountries, funding organizations and govern-ments face some difcult decisions on wherebest to direct their resources for maximal effect.The results of this review point to a number ofareas of weakness in current international researchtraining activities and to specic conclusionsrelating to malaria research in Africa. The keypoints are summarized here together with recom-mendations for consideration by the MultilateralInitiative on Malaria, by other coordinating bod-ies such as the Roll Back Malaria Project ofWHO, and by individual funding organizationsin the developed and developing worlds. International investment and coordination in research training The research bases in many developing coun- tries are currently heavily dependent on foreigninvestment, but the success of any capacity-building activities is ultimately dependent onlocal commitment to scientic research. Fundingorganizations internationally and governments ofdeveloping countries must, therefore, worktogether to build sustainable research expertise toaddress clearly identied national health researchpriorities. Coordinated and long-term invest-ment by both national governments and externalfunders is needed to improve infrastructure andfacilities. More formalized, overt partnershipsmay be required for maximal effect. Current training offered by higher-income countries to developing-country scientists isgenerally fragmented and inadequately moni-tored. Greater efforts are required to coordinateactivities internationally and to monitor theeffectiveness of training programmes in order tomaximize the impact of resources in building acore of appropriately skilled scientists. Thiscoordination role is one that might be played bythe Multilateral Initiative on Malaria. Science is a global activity and the migration of scientists to high-income countries is a prob-lem that must be addressed in order to build sus-tainable research bases in developing countries.National research institutes must be able com-pete successfully to retain scientists against bothoverseas institutes and the local private sector.Serious consideration must be given by localgovernments to the provision of adequate salarystructures to reward productive scientists. Moreexternal funders might also consider provision ofsalary supplements to scientists who competesuccessfully for research awards. The aggregate expenditure by industrialized countries in training scientists in developingregions appears low relative to population inthese regions, and relative to expenditure ontraining scientists in industrialized countries.This is particularly signicant in view of theobserved dependence of developing countries onforeign investment in research training. A smallincrease in the proportion of overall budgetscommitted by larger research and developmentorganizations to research training could poten-tially have a substantial overall impact. Accurate measures of the impact of clinical and applied research are required to provide data tosupport investment in this type of research. Theanalysis of research cited in health policy docu-ments is a potentially effective method of assess-ing the influence of research in informing clinicalpractice or disease control strategies, but effectiveimplementation is dependent upon the inclusionof full bibliographies in policy documents. Career progression opportunities in biomedical research The majority of African scientists complete Bachelor's degrees in their home countries.Universities in developing regions, therefore,have the responsibility of ensuring thatBachelor's degree curricula are of high quality,reflect national scientic needs and generate aninterest in scientic research. Current availability of awards for PhD and Master's training in many developing countriesfrom both local and international sources is verylimited, even after taking into consideration thelower numbers of graduates in developing asExecutive summaryStrengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 15compared with developed countries. Greater opportunities are likely to be benecial in devel-oping a critical mass of independent scientists. The wider availability of grants and fellowships to support the research projects of individual sci-entists would provide an incentive for scientists todevelop careers in research and may contribute tothe development of key scientic leaders. There is a relatively large overall investment by high-income countries in providing shorttraining attachments in overseas countries,workshops and short courses. These trainingmechanisms are potentially important, but theymust be appropriately targeted and monitoredfor maximal effect. There is a need for a moredetailed analysis of the nature of current activi-ties of this type. T raining mechanisms and infrastructure T raining patterns are strongly influenced by rigid funding mechanisms that often involvecollaborations between specic high- and low-income countries. The establishment of morevaried funding formats would enable greaterdiversity in international scientic partnershipsfor more effective use of top-class training cen-tres, irrespective of their location. Mechanismsto support linkages within developing regionsare also required to allow sharing of regionalresources and expertise, perhaps through moreformalized research and training networks andmulticentre approaches. A high proportion of scientists from lower- income countries is currently trained overseas.Greater investment in developing countries isrequired to establish top-quality local andregional training centres, which can play a rolein building sustainable and relevant nationalresearch expertise. This approach would assist inbuilding productive collaborations betweenneighbouring countries and may also prove to bemore cost-effective in the long-term.The balance of expertise generated by training is determined primarily by funding policies ofindividual agencies that target particular diseasesor disciplines, and by the focus of large researchprogrammes with which training is associated.There is a need for mechanisms, at national andinternational levels, to assess the overall distribu-tion of training across different research areasand hence assist in mapping capacity develop-ment to national research priorities. Stronger links between the research and con- trol communities are required to facilitate orien-tation of research agendas to practical healthneeds, and to promote rapid uptake of researchresults into policy and practice. Malaria research capacity in Africa Malaria research is a particular strength of sub-Saharan Africa and the current study hasidentied and characterized the most productiveresearch centres. These centres represent a strongbase for the development of a network of sitesfor training and for multicentre studies. A core of training African scientists engaged in malaria research has been established, but thenumbers of trained scientists are relatively smalloverall and there appears to be substantialdependence on external expertise from Europeand North America. Continuing efforts arerequired to train African scientic leaders forthe future. African centres appear to lack expertise in health economics, social sciences, and biostatis-tics, and these disciplines may require specicstrengthening in view of their importance inoptimizing the delivery of healthcare and diseasecontrol interventions. This review has provided baseline data on research activity, infrastructure and trained personnel which can be used to measureprogress in strengthening malaria research capa-bility in Africa.Executive summaryStrengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 171 1.1 APPROACHES TO THE STUDY The MIM review includes the following analyti- cal approaches:1. A survey of training opportunities in health and biomedical research offered by interna-tional funding organizations to scientists inAfrica, Asia and South America. 2. An assessment of current malaria research capacity and training in Africa including: analysis of African malaria research publications, in the context of globalpublications, to assess relative outputs ofcountries and institutes, collaborationlinks, subeld strengths and weaknesses,and funding sources; analysis of journal impact factors for African malaria research publications toassess the potential influence of the report-ed research on the scientic community; analysis of literature cited in African national malaria treatment policies to elucidate theresearch guiding policy formulation; a survey of African malaria research labora- tories to assess current research expertise,facilities and training pathways, and toobtain opinions on needs and solutions incapacity development in Africa. Where possible, the study made use of pre- existing information contained within theDirectory of the African Malaria Vaccine TestingNetwork (AMVTN) 1and the 'Inventory of resources and activities' produced for theInternational Conference on Malaria, held inDakar, Senegal, in 1997. However, the major part of the review presents novel bibliometricand survey information. 1.2 BACKGROUND The quality and productivity of scienticresearch in the lower-income countries of theworld currently lags far behind that ofindustrialized nations, and the lack of localresearch capacity has seriously hindered progressagainst health problems in developing regions.Estimates from the United Nations Educat-ional, Scientic and Cultural Organization(UNESCO, 1996) suggest that Africa, LatinAmerica and the Middle East together accountfor only 13 per cent of the world's scientists,with the majority being concentrated in theWestern industrialized nations. There is,however, growing awareness of the need tostrengthen indigenous research capacity toenable developing countries to respond to theirown health challenges in a more effective and sustainable way (e.g. COHRED, 1990).Scientic research has had a dramatic impact inimproving health this century in many regionsof the world, through the development of newtreatments and control interventions, andthrough providing knowledge to enable peopleto maintain their own health. Research has alsobrought economic benets through avertingdisease and decreasing healthcare costs. It has been estimated that about half of all funds for research relevant to developing coun-tries comes from local governments, with theThis report has been prepared by the Wellcome T rust as part of the activities of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM). A major objective of this initiative is tostrengthen and sustain malaria research in African countries through partnershipswith scientists internationally. However, it was recognized early in the establishmentof the initiative that very little information is available on current research capabilityin developing countries. Organizations involved in MIM agreed that such data werecrucial to inform discussions on potential options for strengthening long-termresearch capability. Hence, it was decided that a review of current research trainingschemes should be carried out, together with an assessment of human andinfrastructural resources for malaria research in Africa. The Wellcome T rust, as thecoordinator of MIM during 1998 and a major funder of malaria research, undertookto carry out this study, drawing on experience from a previous review of internationalmalaria research (Anderson et al., 1996).Introduction 1www.amvtn.org18 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africaremainder coming from external sources (Michaud and Murray, 1996). Successfulstrengthening of the science base in developingcountries is therefore heavily dependent uponexternal investment. In view of the enormity ofthe challenge and limitations in resources, it isevident that inputs from organizations interna-tionally need to be focused and coordinated inorder to achieve maximal effect. On a broad level there has been a recent move towards evidence-based approaches toresearch investments. Individual organizationsare placing greater emphasis on evaluating theirfunding policies and assessing how their contri-butions integrate into an international context.There are also ongoing activities to analyse glob-al resource flows into health research, that willfacilitate rational investment in relation to dis-ease burden estimates (e.g. the WHO Ad HocCommittee on Health Research, 1996; and theGlobal Forum for Health Research, Geneva). Inaddition, initiatives such as the MultilateralInitiative on Malaria are providing a structuralframework for coordinated international invest-ments by scientic funding organizations. Analytical data to inform decision-making on strengthening research in developing coun-tries are not readily available. Comparative g-ures on human resources in different regions aredifcult to obtain and highly incomplete(UNESCO, 1998). Some data specically relat-ing to malaria research capacity have been gath-ered previously, but these have not been subjectto detailed analysis (e.g. AMVTN Directory andan Inventory produced for the InternationalConference on Malaria, Dakar, Senegal, 1997).Reviews focusing on research training have beenlimited in scope and have tended to focus onspecic issues schemes (e.g. Doumbo andKrogstad, 1998; InternalReview, 1999). What is is overviewinformation on the extent and nature of interna-tional training schemes for scientists in develop-ing countries, and the degree to which they pro-vide a coherent training framework. This study aimed to complement existing analytical efforts and to ll some of the gaps incurrently available information. A large body oforiginal data has been gathered and analysed, andthe main ndings are being published in thisreport as a resource for funding agencies interna-tionally. While a major part of the report focuseson malaria research in Africa, many of the con- clusions are of broader relevance to buildingresearch capacity in the poorer countries of theworld. The data on current malaria research pro-ductivity also provide indicators to enable futuremonitoring of the success of programmes to trainscientists in developing countries. Finally, andimportantly, the report is directed towards devel-oping country scientists themselves to raiseawareness of current training opportunities andof the location of centres of malaria researchexpertise across the African continent. 1.3 HEALTH RESEARCH IN DEVELOPINGCOUNTRIES Health problems in Africa and in other low- and medium-income regions remain a signicantchallenge: with the persisting burden of avoid-able childhood and maternal diseases, a diverseand changing threat from infectious diseases,and a rapidly emerging epidemic from noncom-municable diseases and injury. Malaria is onedisease in particular that continues to be a majorproblem, despite previous eradication cam-paigns (see below). Overall, it is estimated that more than 90 per cent of the world's burden of preventable mor-tality occurs in low- and middle-income coun-tries. Nevertheless, these health problems ofdeveloping countries receive relatively littleattention, with most global resources beingdirected towards diseases of higher-incomecountries. Of the global investment in healthresearch and development (about US$55 billionannually), only 5-10 per cent is thought to bedevoted to health problems in low- and middle-income countries, (Michaud and Murray,1996). There is a strong need, therefore, for arational, coordinated international response todiseases of lower-income countries, which willcontribute towards redressing this imbalance. Within the context of international research activity, scientists working in developing coun-tries have a critical contribution to make. Astrong indigenous science base is required forcountries to dene and address their own healthresearch priorities, thereby contributing towardsimproving health and towards social and eco-nomic development. Introduction 1Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 19Investment in science in developing coun- tries over the last 50 years has been successful inbeginning to establish national scientic com-munities with internationally recognized scien-tic leaders. For example, nancing of researchin sub-Saharan Africa increased sevenfold in1970-85 and the number of people engaged inresearch by a factor of ten (Gaillard and Waast,1993). Despite this progress, developing coun-tries still contribute only a small fraction of theworld scientic publications: an estimated 6.5per cent of the total (OST, 1997). Across the developing nations there are regional and country-specic patterns andtrends in scientic research. Figures derivedfrom the Science Citation Index (SCI) andCompumath databases provide some indicatorsof scientic activity (UNESCO, 1998). LatinAmerica accounts for about 1.5 per cent of sci-entic outputs in all disciplines, while sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 0.8 per cent, China1.6 per cent, India and Central Asia 2.1 per centand South-East Asia just 0.1 per cent. The worldshare of publications outputs from sub-SaharanAfrica dropped by 19 per cent between 1990and 1995, while the outputs from China andLatin America increased substantially (+38 and+17 per cent respectively) and the outputs fromAsia remained relatively steady. The different regions also have different dis- ciplinary specializations: sub-Saharan Africa isstrongest in applied biology/ecology and weak-est in basic biology, chemistry, physics and engi-neering. Conversely chemistry, physics and engi-neering are relative strengths of China, India andCentral Asia. Latin America is strongest inapplied biology and ecology. It should be noted,however, that the databases used for these analy-ses are biased towards English-language journalsand do not take into account local and regionaljournals that are particularly prominent inChina and Latin America, and which might pro-vide more accurate insight into locally relevantresearch capacity. The results, however, do give afair representation of the broad international sci-entic visibility of the different regions. Public investment in research and develop- ment (R&D) by developing countries is the low-est in the world, illustrating the lack of localresources to sustain scientic activity. Similarly,the available gures for trained scientic person-nel in developing regions are also very low relativeto industrialized countries. The above data on scientic activity in devel- oping countries are a strong indication that theseregions remain ill-equipped to respond to themajor challenges posed by local health problemssuch as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS andupper respiratory tract infections. 1.4 PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE OFMALARIA Malaria is a major and increasing cause of disease burden globally and is estimated to be responsi-ble for more than one million deaths and almost300 million clinical cases annually worldwide(See 'Rolling Back Malaria' in the WHO WorldHealth Report, 1999). The disease has its greatestimpact in sub-Saharan African where an estimat-ed 90 per cent of cases occur, often in young chil-dren. The economic impact of malaria in Africais substantial. Despite successes in controllingmalaria in the 1950s and 1960s, recent yearshave seen a resurgence due to a combination offactors. There is growing resistance to currentantimalarial drugs in many areas, includingmultidrug resistance. Incr easing insecticide resistance, environmental changes and humanmigration, often the result of political instabilityand wars, are further contributory factors. Areduced commitment to control programmes insome regions has also had the serious conse-quence of exposing populations with decreasedimmunity to the threat of malaria. Over the past few years there has been a growing momentum to address the problem ofmalaria. Strong international commitment hasdeveloped, and action has taken place in a rangeof different sectors. For example in Amsterdamin 1992, a Revised Global Malaria Strategy wasapproved by the health ministers of severalmalarious countries (WHO, 1993). This wasfollowed in 1996 by discussions between theWHO Regional Ofce for Africa (AFRO) andthe World Bank, leading to plans for a malariacontrol programme to be targeted at malariousareas across the African continent. At the sametime, discussions were under way in the researcharena to develop a more cohesive and coordinat-ed international approach to scientic researchagainst malaria, leading to the establishment ofIntroduction 120 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africathe Multilateral Initiative on Malaria. Most recently, WHO, has recognized the impact ofescalating mortality from malaria andannounced a major new programme to 'RollBack Malaria' (Nabarro and Tayler, 1998),which is global and aims to add value to andcoordinate all efforts to control malaria. 1.5 THE MULTILATERAL INITIATIVE ON MALARIA Origins and objectives The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is an international alliance of organizations andindividuals that aims to maximize the impact ofscientic research against malaria. Enhancingcoordination and collaboration, mobilizingresources, promoting capacity building inAfrica, and encouraging research and controlcommunities to engage in fruitful dialogues aremajor emphases of MIM. The origins of MIM go back to a meeting held in 1995 between a number oforganizations supporting scientic research inthe developing world. From these discussionsemerged a recognition that ongoing activitieswere fragmented with different organizationsindependently supporting research activities atvarious locations across the developing world.There was agreement that a mechanism wasrequired to orchestrate these individual activitiesinto a more coherent approach, which wouldhave a stronger and more sustainable impact.Malaria in Africa was selected as an importantfocus to develop a mechanism to promotegreater coordination amongst the range ofdifferent players; and so the concept of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM)came into being. The original overarching goalwas dened as \"to strengthen and sustainthrough collaborative research and training, thecapability of malaria-endemic countries inAfrica to carry out research required to developand improve tools for malaria control\". A dening step in the evolution of MIM was a congress convened in Dakar, Senegal, inJanuary 1997 where the scientic communitywas asked to identify the major research ques-tions that must be answered in order for theproblem of malaria to be addressed effectively(Butler, 1997a; Mons et al., 1998). The meetingwas successful in highlighting specic research priorities, as well as some broad recurring needsthat cut across different subject areas. The recommendations arising from this meetinghave played a crucial role in guiding the activities of MIM. Follow up meetings during1997 in The Hague (Butler, 1997b; Gallagher,1997) and London (Butler, 1997c; Williams,1997) then dened more clearly the areas forconcerted action and set out the strategies foraddressing priorities. At the London meeting,the Wellcome T rust accepted the nomination toact as a coordinator of the activities of MIM foran initial period of 12 months. One of the keypriorities set at this meeting was to carry out areview of malaria research capacity in Africa.This priority, amongst others, was actively pursued by the Wellcome T rust, leading to thepreparation of this report. Key outcomes and future directions MIM has been involved in a diverse range ofactivities since its establishment in 1997 (Davies,1999). Importantly, the Initiative has played asignicant role in drawing additional funds intomalaria research: overall funds committed tomalaria research increased from an estimatedUS$85 million in 1995 (Anderson et al., 1996) to a gure of well over US$100 million in 1999. MIM is particularly concerned with promot- ing global coordination and collaboration in themalaria research community to address scienticneeds and opportunities. To this end, it has facil-itated links not only between scientists, but alsobetween the funding organizations supportingthem. MIM meetings, newsletters and websites 2 have been important channels for enhancingcommunication amongst partners. Furthermore,the Malaria Foundation International has playeda prominent role in raising awareness of theimmense health and economic impacts of malaria. There have also been unprecedented oppor- tunities for interactions between scientists acrossAfrica. The Dakar Conference in 1997 was a sig-nicant event in bringing together scientistsfrom all regions of sub-Saharan Africa and, fol-lowing the success of this meeting, MIM made acommitment to establish a regular forum of thiskind. The rst MIM African MalariaConference took place in Durban, South Africa,in March 1999 and was attended by over 850delegates. It was made possible through the gen-Introduction 1Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 21erous sponsorship of a broad range of funding organizations and commercial companies. TheConference was successful not only in facilitat-ing scientic collaborations across Africa andinternationally, but also in strengthening linksbetween the research and control communities. MIM has also catalysed the establishment of formalized collaborations across Africa.Multicentre approaches can make a particularcontribution by linking fragmented and isolatedresources into networks which have the poten-tial for much greater impact on malaria.Furthermore, single sites are not sufcient toobtain denitive answers in certain types ofstudies where large sample sizes are required,necessitating instead that standardized reagentsand methodologies are applied at multiple sites.For example, a network linking ve sites acrossAfrica has been established to study severemalaria in children and particularly to evaluatenovel treatments and develop new interventions. To full the need for standardized and well- characterized malaria research reagents identi-ed in Dakar, a Malaria Research and ReferenceReagent Repository has been established withfunding from NIAID. This facility will maintainand distribute reagents such as parasite strains,mosquitoes, genetic material (e.g. DNA probes)and antibodies. The immense opportunities offered to African scientists by electronic communications technol-ogy and the Internet have been recognized byMIM, and the US National Library for Medicinewas nominated to lead an initiative in this area.Much improved connectivity has been achievedin Mali, and at two sites in Kenya, while plans forsites in Tanzania and Cameroon are advancing. As part of its commitment towards building research expertise in Africa, MIM was responsi-ble for the establishment of the new Task Forcefor Malaria Research Capability Strengtheningin Africa, which is administered by theUNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programmefor Research and T raining in T ropical Diseases(TDR) and is funded from several differentsources. This Task Force provides support forresearch training in association with large multi-centre studies across Africa. Overall, MIM has helped to energize a new phase to improve approaches to internationalmalaria research through creating new partner-ships, and through providing a practical frame-work and point of reference to guide the activi- ties of the international research community.The new working relationships establishedbetween the major funders are also having aninfluence in improving coordination in thebroader eld of biomedical and health researchin the tropics. In the future MIM will continueto tackle key priorities, as well as bottlenecksimpeding progress. It is also committed to work-ing with the WHO Roll Back Malaria Project toensure smooth integration of malaria researchand control activities.

The studyfocused primarily on funding organizationsbased in established market economies. Someinformation was obtained from governments oflower-income countries, although these sourcesof support were not broadly surveyed. A questionnaire was sent to organizations requesting details of award schemes throughwhich individuals from developing countriesmight receive funding. Information for the peri-od 1995-98 was requested on: numbers of awards to developing- country scientists; expenditure on awards; training level of awards; the regional breakdown of awards into Africa, Asia and South America; proportion of awards for malaria research training. As the questionnaire format was not neces- sarily compatible with the records kept, organi-zations were encouraged to submit as much rele-vant data as possible in a format convenient fortheir records. All organizations that contributeddata were given an opportunity to check theaccuracy of the presentation of their data in thereport prior to its publication. The following points should be noted: Although every effort was made to obtain comparable data, it cannot be assumed thatall funding agencies classify their awards inthe same way. Accurate gures for expenditure on training were sometimes difcult to identify wheretraining was provided as part of a largerresearch or development programme. The review focused on organizations that administer training schemes and consequent-ly funding agencies that contribute funds tosecondary organizations for training may beless well represented in the review. Wherepossible, contributions from one organiza-tion to another are specically stated anddouble counting of the funds avoided. 2.1.2 Data analysis Expenditure totals were converted to US dollarequivalents using annual average exchange rates 1 for each of the years 1995 to 1997. Figures for1998 were converted according to the exchangerate for June 30 1998. Expenditure was classiedaccording to the nancial year of the particularorganization contacted. The specic time periodcovered in a nancial year varies between organi-zations. Where the nancial year spans morethan one calendar year, the year assigned wasthat containing the greater proportion of thenancial year. For example, the nancial year ofthe Wellcome T rust runs from 1 October to 30September, therefore FY 1995 refers to the peri-od from 1 October 1994 to 30 September 1995. Awards were classied according to the fol- lowing categories: Bachelor's: Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00c9tudes Approfondies; PhD: doctorate awarded for original research in a subject; postdoctoral: studies, research or professional work above the level of doctorate; training attachment: specic skills or techni- cal training not necessarily leading to theaward of a formal certicate. T raining isoften, but not always, provided at a researchinstitute in a developed country; diploma: courses and specializations where a certicate is awarded.This chapter presents the results of a survey of international research training opportunities in biomedical sciences and health for researchers in developing countries.The aim was to obtain an analytical overview of existing training schemes in or der to assess the availability of support at different levels of training, in various disciplines,and across different geographical regions. Such data are essential to guide futuredirections in strengthening research capability in developing countries. The informationshould also be a valuable resource for scientists seeking support for research training.T raining opportunities 1International Monetary Fund (1997) International FinancialStatistics Yearbook,Vol. 50.24 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaT raining opportunities 2 Awards were classied into three geographi- cal regions: Africa, Asia and South America.Although several organizations supportedresearch projects and training in Eastern Europeas part of their international programmes inhealth, these awards were excluded from theanalysis. The review focused on research trainingopportunities and career progression in biomed-icine and health. It should be noted, however,that in some instances it was difcult to separateresearch training from other more general typesof training in health. The term 'developing-country scientist' is used broadly in this report torefer to laboratory and eld-based researchers,health professionals, clinicians, sociologists,economists etc. 2.2 RESULTS A total of 54 funding organizations wereapproached in the MIM survey and 39 organiza-tions (74 per cent) responded with relevant infor-mation on research training activities for develop-ing-country scientists in biomedicine and health.Of the responding organizations, 13 provided fulldata, 16 provided partial data and ten providedqualitative information. Respondents includedgovernmental and non-governmental organiza-tions, private foundations and internationalorganizations (see Annex 2 for contact details).

There areeight Public Health Service Operating Divisionswithin the HHS. T wo of the divisions, theNational Institutes of Health (NIH) and theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), have schemes of support for developing-country scientists. US National Institutes of Health (NIH) US$69.8 million in FYs 1995-98The National Institutes of Health is the world'spremier medical research organization whosemission is to uncover new knowledge that willlead to better health for everyone. The NIHbudget for 1999 was US$15.7 billion. WithinNIH, the Fogarty International Center (FIC)and the National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases (NIAID) develop andadminister research training programmesfocused on developing countries. These pro-grammes support research and training in a widerange of subjects including infectious diseases(with emphasis on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis andmalaria), environmental/occupational health,population-related issues, drug discovery andmedical informatics. Table 2.1 shows theschemes of support offered by the FIC andNIAID that are open to scientists in developingcountries and the expenditure per scheme in1995-98. As well as these targeted schemes,NIH offers open grant programs to US sndnon-US citizens. Expenditure by the FIC and NIAID on training developing-country scientists increasedby 80 per cent in FYs 1995-98 (Figure 1).Within these training programmes, US$1.4 mil-lion (2 per cent of total) was devoted to malaria.The FIC and NIAID support training at allstages of career progression, but particularly atPhD and postdoctoral levels, and via trainingattachments (Figure 2).

The FIC and NIAIDalso conduct training workshops in developingcountries. In FYs 1995-98 nearly 400 workshopswere organized, with over 28 000 participantsfrom Africa, Asia and South America (Table 2.2). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) CDC's mission is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease,injury and disability. Its budget for 1999 wasUS$2.7 billion. CDC supports developing-country scientists in two ways: The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS). The EIS is a two-year postgraduate fellowship pro-gramme run by CDC for health professionalsinterested in the practice of epidemiology.During 1996-98, 17 developing-country sci-entists participated in the programme (Africa5, Asia 5, South America 7). T raining as part of CDC international research projects, principally at the eld sta-tions in Kenya (CDC/KEMRI) and Guatemala (MERTU/G). In Kenya, studentsmay receive training at Master's and PhDlevel while working on CDC research proj-ects. In Guatemala, the eld station is anintegral part of the Universidade del Valle deGuatemala. Undergraduates participate inresearch projects, and opportunities for train-ing at Master's and PhD level exist. CDC hasno dedicated award schemes for developing-country scientists and consequently expendi-ture on training varies according to the avail-ability of research projects and the level offunding per project. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) USAID is the foreign assistance arm of the US Government. USAID supports applied researchwhich includes biomedical, epidemiological,behavioural, economic and clinical research.

These institutions in essence operatesmall grants programmes. The cost and durationof support varies according to the research pro-gramme. The US-based funder normally playsthe role of technical adviser and only participatesin the research in a limited number of cases. Capacity building is an important component of the research programmes with efforts focusedon proposal development, workshops, short-termtraining in new methodologies and technologies,training in data analysis, and on developing skillsfor translating research results into policy andprogrammes. Networking and effective commu-nication are also considered important compo-nents of the research. Both in-country and inter-national networks have been fostered, the lattermainly through multi-country/multi-site inter-vention trials. Almost all research training at thepostgraduate level is accomplished within thecontext of a research project. USAID expendi-ture on health research in total in 1995-98 wasapproximately US$158 million. US Department of Defense - Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) The WRAIR is the largest of six medical research laboratories under the US Army's MedicalResearch and Material Command. It is the USDepartment of Defense's lead agency for infectiousdisease research and a major source of researchsupport for medical product development. T raining of developing-country scientists by WRAIR has an emphasis on antimalarial drugdiscovery and drug resistance, and vaccine devel- opment. Support is predominantly at postdoc-toral level, through the National ResearchCouncil Associateship awards (funded byWRAIR) and funds from NIAID/FIC andWHO. Short research training attachments inmalaria drug and vaccine development are alsosupported. In general, training is conducted atthe WRAIR unit in Washington DC, USA,although opportunities for local training alsoexist in the six overseas laboratories in Brazil,Peru, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt and Kenya.Table 2.3 shows the number of developing-coun-try scientists trained by WRAIR in 1995-98.

INCLEN'scentral funding is primarily from two donors, theRockefeller Foundation and USAID, with addi-tional support from various sources. INCLENhas training centres in Canada, USA andAustralia, and regional clinical epidemiologytraining centres in Latin America, China, SouthAsia and India. INCLEN's total expenditure inFYs 1995-98 was US$17.6 million (the nancialyear of INCLEN runs from 1 July to 30 June andFY 1995 was used to refer to the period 1 July1994 to 30 June 1995). Expenditure on trainingin FYs 1995-98 was US$4.9 million. This gureis restricted to the expenditure on personal sup-port and training of developing-country scien-tists and excludes core support for INCLEN'straining centres. The majority of INCLEN'straining is at Master's level (Figure 2.3) in the dis-ciplines of clinical epidemiology, biostatistics,health social science and clinical economics. Takemi Program in International Health, Harvard School of Public Health, USA The Takemi Program is a ten-month research programme that focuses on the problems ofmobilizing, allocating, and managing limitedresources to improve health. Financial supportfor the Program comes from various sources: the Japan Foundation for the Promotion of International Medical Research Cooperation,in collaboration with the Japan Ministry ofHealth and Welfare, the Japan MedicalAssociation, and the Japan PharmaceuticalManufacturers Association; the Carnegie Corporation of New York; the Merck Company Foundation. Takemi Fellows are mid-career professionals from around the world, particularly from devel-oping countries. Fellows carry out their researchprojects at Harvard, generally using data theybring with them. Projects are closely linked toaction programmes and to the work of Fellows intheir home country. During 1995-97, 22 Fellowsfrom developing countries completed the TakemiProgram (Africa 8, Asia 10, South America 4).

Courses on a range oftropical diseases, including malaria and tubercu-losis, are held regularly in developing countries. Danish Government Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA) DANIDA supports collaborative research with developing countries and training of develop-ing-country scientists through several channels: The programme for Enhancement of Research Capacity in Developing Countries(ENRECA) aims to strengthen researchcapacity in developing countries throughpartnerships between Danish universitiesand research institutions, and institutions indeveloping countries. The programme coversa range of disciplines in agriculture, medicineand health, technology, social and naturalsciences. Projects have a duration of 10-15years and typically include postgraduatetraining of developing-country researchers,exchanges of research staff, provision ofresearch equipment, and improvement ofresearch infrastructure and communications.There have been four ENRECA-supportedmalaria projects in Africa since theprogramme's inception in 1988: Ghana,Mozambique, Tanzania and Sudan. The Danish Bilharziasis Laboratory (DBL) is a private institution involved in training,research and technical cooperation. It receivesthe majority of its funding from DANIDA. African researchers receive support through aCollaborative Award scheme for denedresearch or research training projects conduct-ed in the home country with collaborativeassistance and training from DBL. During1995-98, 43 Master's and 92 PhD studentswere trained via the scheme, which has anannual budget of US$1.5 million. The Danish Council for Development Research supports three- to four-year collaborative projects with developing countries, where part of the research is conducted in the developing country. Contributions to TDR. The Danish govern- ment is a major contributor to the TDR pro-gramme, having donated US$26.3 millionduring 1989-98 (see Annex 1). French Government The French Government, in addition to itsdirect support to Institut de Recherche pour leD\u00e9veloppement (IRD), Institut National de laSant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM)and Institut Pasteur, provides funds via theMinistry of Cooperation for French-Africancollaborative malaria research. French Ministry of Cooperation Estimated US$3.4 million per annum on malariaresearch in AfricaExpenditure by the Ministry of Cooperation onmalaria research in Africa is via three main channels: nancial support to institutions and malaria research programmes in Senegal,Madagascar, Cameroon, Congo, Burkina-Faso and Gabon; support of French scientists working on French Cooperation assignments in thehealth research sector in Africa; re-entry grants (three-year awards) to African researchers trained in France toenable them to establish a research career in their home country.T raining opportunities 22 In November 1998, ORSTOM became l'Institut deRecherche pour leD\u00e9veloppement (IRD). 32 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaT raining of developing-country scientists is conducted as part of the Ministry's research pro-grammes.

INSERM's annual budg-et is approximately US$488 inFrance. During 1995-98, 50 awardstotalling US$3.9 million were made to scien-tists from developing countries (Africa 14,Asia 24, South America 12). Cooperative Agreements support collabora- tions between INSERM units in France andresearch laboratories in developing countriesby providing funds for travel and researchattachments in the partner laboratory.Expenditure on Cooperative Agreements inFYs 1995-98 was US$2.1 million. North-South networks are partnership- based awards that promote collaborationsbetween French and foreign laboratories (atleast two on each side). In 1995-97, 13awards totalling US$1 million supported col-laborations with developing countries. Thescheme was discontinued in 1998. Workshops organized by INSERM scientists are held in developing countries.Expenditure on workshops in 1995-98 wasUS$80 000. Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppe- ment (IRD) (formerly ORSTOM)2 IRD is a state-owned public service agency under the joint authority of the French researchand overseas development ministries. It offers arange of consultancy services and is involved ininternational research programmes through itscollaborations with scientic institutes inFrance, Europe and developing countries. Amajor objective of IRD is to strengthen the sci-entic capabilities of developing countriesthrough research training and specic assistance.IRD trains junior scientists through multidisci-plinary research programmes in the eld, in theInstitute's own laboratories, or in the laborato-ries of its research partners. IRD also providessupport for scientic networks and communitiesin developing countries. IRD scientists work in research institutions in more than 15 countries in Africa. Malariaresearch and training programmes are based in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon andMadagascar. Data on training were obtainedfrom the Malaria and Medical ZoologyLaboratories in IRD-Dakar, Senegal. During1995-98, 84 scientists (technicians, nurses, elddoctors as well as laboratory-based researchers)received training as part of ongoing malariaresearch projects (Figure 2.7).

It is not a fund-ing agency per se and has no specic schemes of support for developing-country scientists.However, it has a history of malaria research duein part to its network of daughter institutions inmalaria-endemic regions, and it supports train-ing through its research programmes. Currently,Institut Pasteur has an integrated research pro-gramme on malaria, with emphasis on vaccinedevelopment, at four main centres: Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, has malaria research programmes focused on parasitebiology, vaccine development and entomolo-gy. The institute conducts postgraduate train-ing courses in infectious diseases and studentsworking in other institutes of the networkreceive training in Paris towards the Dipl\u00f4med'\u00c9tudes Approfondies (DEA) and PhD. Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal, has malaria research programmes in epidemiology,immunology and human genetics. The insti-tute has research and training links with theUniversity of Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar, andacts as the national malariacontrol programme. Institut Pasteur, Antananarivo, Madagascar, is an integral part of the Ministry of Healthof the Malagasy Republic and contributes tonational control programmes. It has collabo-rative and training links with the Universityof Antananarivo. Institut Pasteur, Cayenne, French Guyana, conducts research on the Saimiri sciureus monkey malaria model and provides a drugsensitivity screening service. Institut Pasteur provides a small number of training grants to developing-country scientistsleading to tenure in one of the institutes of itsnetwork. Approximately ten training grants havebeen awarded for malaria research in Senegaland Madagascar during 1995-97. German Government German Agency for Technical Cooperation Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr TechnischeZusammenarbeit (GTZ) Technical and nancial development coopera- tion in Germany is the responsibility of theMinistry of Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (BMZ).

Programmes range fromshort-term exchanges to full doctoral scholar-ships. Several Master's courses have been designedspecically for participants from developingcountries. The Master's course in CommunityHealth and Health Management in DevelopingCountries at the University of Heidelberg is aWHO collaborating centre for health systemsresearch in developing countries. DAAD awardsapproximately ten scholarships per annum todeveloping-country scientists worldwide. German non-governmental organizations Alexander von Humboldt Foundation US$0.9 million in FYs 1995-98 The Alexander von Humboldt foundation is anon-prot organization which is largely sup-ported by the German Government through itsForeign Ministry. It supports highly qualiednon-German postdoctoral scholars to carry outresearch projects in Germany. Research may beundertaken in any subject eld. In 1995-98, 22scientists from developing countries receivedfunding for research in biomedicine and healththrough the Humboldt Research Fellowship andGeorge Forster Fellowship schemes (Africa 5, Asia 10, South America 7). Expenditure on fel-lowship awards was US$0.9 million. The Netherlands Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs International development programmes in TheNetherlands are administered by the DirectorateGeneral for Development Cooperation, part ofthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the majorityof programmes there is cooperation between aDutch institution (usually a university faculty ordepartment) and an institution in the partnercountry. In 1995-98, 17 scientists from develop-ing countries were trained at the Department ofMedical Microbiology, University of Nijmegen(Figure 2.8). Norwegian Government The Norwegian government supports training ofdeveloping-country scientists through contribu-tions to multilateral development schemes(including the TDR programme, to whichNorway is a major contributor), and bilateraldevelopment schemes.

Institute of Hygiene and T ropical Medicine, New University of Lisbon, Portugal The Institute of Hygiene and T ropical Medicine (IHTM) in Lisbon conducts postgraduate coursesof relevance to developing-country scientists andhas research links with several African countries.The Centre for Studies on Malaria and otherT ropical Diseases, which is based within the IHTM and funded directly from the Ministry ofScience and Technology, is also involved intraining, predominantly through its researchcollaborations with African countries. The datapresented in this report reflect training carried outby the IHTM and the Centre for Malaria Studies,excluding clinical training activities. In 1995-98,82 scientists received training, mainly via attach-ments and diploma courses (Figure 2.9). Swedish Government The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) Sida administers Swedish aid programmes. Within Sida, the Department of ResearchCooperation, SAREC, supports research andstrengthening of research capacity in developingcountries. The data presented in this report referto years 1996 and 1997. SAREC supports bio-medical/health research via three main channels: Country-based and Regional Research Cooperation. SAREC expenditure for 1996and 1997 was US$10.2 million. Examples inthe eld of parasitic research include aTanzania-Sweden collaborative project onmanagement of childhood malaria inprimary healthcare institutions and a studyof the impact of land use change on socio-economic status and incidence of malariaand schistosomiasis in Ethiopia.T raining opportunities 2 Training attachment 33 (40.2%)Master's 5 (61.0%) Number of individuals supported Africa 78 (95%) South America 4 (5%)Figure 2.9 Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Portugal: Classification of support by training level and region in 1995-98.Number of individuals trained = 82 Diploma 36 (43.9%)Postdoctoral 8 (9.8%)36 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa International research programmes and other special programmes and projects, including theTDR programme to which Sida/SAREC is amajor contributor (Annex 1).

The research projectsmust be of relevance to developing countriesand are often carried out in collaborationwith institutions in developing countries. SAREC has no xed budget for training: expenditure varies on a project or needs basis,although, in general, a high proportion of theprogramme budget is devoted to training.T raining may be conducted locally, or via the'sandwich' model where students combine workin their own university departments with studiesat a Swedish institution. Swiss Government The Swiss Government supports training andresearch cooperation with developing countriesthrough a variety of channels. The gures pre-sented in this report are underestimates of thetotal expenditure, due to difculties in tracingcontributions from the various sources. Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) The SDC is responsible for bilateral develop- ment cooperation, which is concentrated on 16target countries in Africa, Asia and SouthAmerica. SDC supports training in a range ofsubjects, with emphasis on management of pub-lic affairs, the environment, agriculture andhealth. The majority of health research trainingis conducted at two Swiss institutions: theWHO Immunology Research and T rainingCentre (IRTC), runs a seven-week Immunology, Vaccinology and Biotechnology Applied toInfectious Diseases course (in English andFrench) for health professionals from developingcountries. Refresher courses are held in develop-ing countries for previous course attendees.SDC provides an annual award of US$0.4 mil- lion to WHO to cover training costs. The STI offers a range of courses of interest to health professionals working in developingcountries, and it is a partner in developmentprojects that are largely nanced by SDC. Forexample, more than half of the participants onthe Health Care and Management in T ropicalCountries (HCMTC) are from developingcountries. A high proportion receives scholar-ship SDC. SDC expenditure in FYs 1995-97 on arships in health was US$3 million. A total of135 scholarships was awarded, mainly for cours-es and training attachments (Africa 81, Asia 37,South America 17). It should be noted that thesegures do not include training conducted as partof research programmes and development proj-ects, for example on STI collaborative projectswith developing countries. Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) The SNSF was established in 1952 to promotebasic scientic research at Swiss universities andother scientic institutions. Research grantsconstitute about 75 per cent of the budget of theSNSF , and are distributed in all areas of science(Humanities and Social Sciences, Mathematics,Natural and Engineering Sciences, Biology andMedicine). Fellowships and research grants areawarded mainly to Swiss researchers, but SNSFalso supports efforts to encourage collaborationsbetween Swiss scientists and researchers in developing countries. The SNSF , in conjunctionwith the SDC, supports specic projects onEnvironment and Development, which are conducted by researchers in developing coun-tries working in collaboration with Swissresearch groups. Federal Commission for Scholarships for foreign students (FCS), Switzerland The Swiss Government offers scholarships via the FCS to foreign postgraduate students whowish to study or undertake research work in anysubject eld at Swiss universities. The scholar-ships are offered to governments of developingcountries on a unilateral basis. During 1995-98,55 students from developing countries receivedT raining opportunities 2Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 37scholarship support for studies in biomedicine and health. In the last few years, an annualscholarship support of approximately US$2.2million has been awarded to students fromdeveloping countries. UK Government UK Department for International Development (DFID) DFID is the government department responsi- ble for promoting development and the reduc-tion of poverty. It manages Britain's bilateral andmultilateral development programmes. DFIDhas no specic award schemes for developing-country scientists, but provides training as partof its bilateral programmes. It also allocatesfunds to support training administered by theUK Medical Research Council and the BritishCouncil, and it is a major donor to the TDRprogramme (Annex 1). DFID does not holdcentral records on training conducted throughits development projects, therefore the Africanregional ofces were contacted for further infor-mation. A total of 30 students received trainingas part of DFID projects in Uganda, Zambiaand Kenya during 1994-98 (Master's 18, train-ing attachments 12). T raining is not normallyprovided beyond Master's level.The British Council The British Council promotes educational, cul-tural and technical cooperation between Britainand other countries. The Council's work isdesigned to establish long-term and worldwidepartnerships, and to improve internationalunderstanding. Schemes managed by the BritishCouncil in 1995-98 supported 70 studentsfrom developing countries in studies in biomed-icine and health. The majority of awards were atMaster's level (Figure 2.10). T raining was con-ducted in the UK. UK Medical Research Council (MRC) The MRC is a UK governmental research organi-zation. Its mission is to improve health by pro-moting research into all areas of medical andrelated science. It supports medical research inthree main ways: through its research establish-ments; grants to individual scientists; and sup-port for postgraduate students. The MRC totalannual budget in FY 1997 was US$485 million. The MRC supports major research pro- grammes in Africa (The Gambia and Uganda)and Jamaica. T raining of local researchers in TheGambia occurs through several mechanisms.

Study at local or overseas uni-versities is also supported. In Uganda, the MRCreceives an annual allocation from DFID forvocational and technical training of Ugandanstaff. In Jamaica, the MRC Laboratories willshortly be transferred to the University of theWest Indies. Collaborations and interchanges ofscientists between UK and Jamaica are encour-aged. Under the recently re-launched RogersFund, local researchers and technicians in TheGambia, Uganda and Jamaica may undertake astructured training programme usually lastingone year in an MRC research establishment. UK non-governmental organizations The Wellcome T rust US$17.7 million in FYs 1995-98The Wellcome T rust is an independent, privatecharity that funds research in the biomedical sci-ences and the history of medicine. Established in1936 under the will of Sir Henry Wellcome, asuccessful industrialist and philanthropist, theT rust is currently the world's largest medicalresearch charity. Total expenditure on researchawards in FY 1998 was US$345 million.Although the greater part of the T rust's incomesupports the work of researchers in UK and theRepublic of Ireland, its international activitiesare currently being expanded. The T rust has ahistory of providing support for tropical medi-cine research. Major research programmes out-side the UK are currently funded in Kenya,Malawi, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa. A range of award schemes is open to scien- tists internationally; several have a focus ondeveloping countries. 1995-98, theT rust's expenditure on awards developing-country and totalledUS$17.7 million (Figure 2.11). These gures aregenerally restricted to individual training andcareer development awards, and exclude expen-diture on major programmes of research indeveloping countries. The majority of the T rust'sprogrammes are aimed at postdoctoral scientistsand medical or veterinary researchers (Figure2.12), with fewer awards at earlier career stages. Awards are normally available for all research rel-evant to health or disease in developing coun-tries. In addition, a number of specic schemesare offered to encourage research on noncom-municable diseases, population studies andreproductive health, health services research andclinical epidemiology. Postdoctoral awards rele-vant to this survey are: T ravelling fellowships: awards to individual scientists to travel to another country (usual-ly the UK) to carry out a research project.Awards include project costs, travel and astipend for the period spent overseas. T raining fellowships: up to four years' support for a study focusing on a health problem ofrelevance to the trainee's home country.T raining (including Master's training whereappropriate) may be in centres of excellencein the developing world or the UK, but a sub-stantial part of the trainee's time should bespent in the home institute. Collaborative awards: support for a research project in a developing country led by oneprincipal investigator, with scientic supportfrom a developed country. Awards are avail-able to postdoctoral researchers returninghome after a period of training in the UK aswell as for more senior researchers.Collaborations may link the UK and anydeveloping country; South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa; or Australia/New Zealandand South-East Asia. Project and programme grants: three- to ve-year awards to scientists in their home country that provide the full directcosts of research projects focusing on health problems of local signicance. T raining at Master's and PhD level is provid- ed mainly in association with large overseasresearch programmes such as those in Kenya,Thailand and Malawi, rather than through dedi-cated award schemes. However, a ResearchT raining Fellowship at Master's Level inPopulation Studies has been introduced recently.

T rainingprogrammes delivered through bilateral grantsare of three types: training programmes conducted in Japan; training programmes in a developing coun- try for local participants; training programmes in a developing coun- try for local and regional participants. The data presented in this report are limited to training programmes conducted in Japan.(Expenditure on training in health was estimat-ed from the mean expenditure per person ontraining in all sectors.) All training was in theform of short courses on a wide range of subjectsin health and medicine, including infectious dis-eases, public health, oncology and occupationalhealth. More than half of the trainees were fromAsia (Table 2.5). Australian Government Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) AusAID manages Australia's development coop- eration programmes. Education and trainingconstitutes around 20 per cent of the total devel-opment cooperation budget. Support is provid-ed for technical and further education training,undergraduate and postgraduate studies, and training can take place in Australia, in the homecountry, or in another developing country. Cur-rently, the majority of training is conducted inAustralia through the Australian DevelopmentScholarships scheme. A recent review of trainingawards showed that as at March 1998 there were3851 AusAID-funded students, mainly fromAsia and the Pacic Islands, engaged in highereducation and technical and further education. 3 Of these, 10 per cent were engaged in Healthand Community Services training. The overallbreakdown of awards in all subject areas wasapproximately 1400 awards at Bachelor's level,1400 at Master's, and 600 at PhD level. 2.2.4 International organizations The UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and T raining inT ropical Diseases (TDR) Estimated US$22 million on Research Capability Strengthening Grants 1995-98The Special Programme for Research andT raining in T ropical Diseases (TDR) is co-spon-sored by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP), the World Bank and theWorld Health Organization (WHO). TDR issupported by voluntary contributions from gov-ernments, international organizations, charitiesand other non-governmental bodies (see Annex 1for contributions to the programme in 1989-98). The programme has two objectives: to research and develop new tools to control TDRtarget tropical diseases (malaria, schistosomiasis,leishmaniasis, lymphatic lariasis, onchocercia-sis, African trypanosomiasis, disease andleprosy) and to increase the research capability indeveloping countries through training of indi-viduals and strengthening of institutions. Thetotal annual TDR grants budget [ResearchCapability Strengthening (RCS) and Researchand Development] is US$18.5 million, of whichUS$5.5 million is devoted to RCS for institu-tional and training support). Within RCS, training support to developing- country scientists is via Research T raining Grants(RTG) and Re-entry Grants. RTGs are awardedon a competitive basis for studies at Master's,PhD or postdoctoral level, or for acquiring spe-cialized skills. Studies are restricted to one ormore of the TDR target diseases in any of T raining opportunities 2 Table 2.5 JICA: Participants on Health training courses in Japan FYs 1995-97.

Preference is given to applicants from countries with lesser developed researchcapacities, and to those who wish to pursue studies in their own country or within their own region. TDR expenditure on RTGs in1995-98 was US$8.3 million. In the same period, TDR Research T raining Grants supported193 researchers, predominantly at Master's andPhD level. The majority of awards were directedto scientists in Africa (Figure 2.13). Re-entry Grants provide support for researchers, who have recently completed post-graduate training, to establish an independentresearch programme or laboratory in the homecountry. In 1995-98, 43 Re-entry Grants wereawarded. TDR expenditure on Re-entry Grantsaverages US$0.5 million per year. The TDR Multilateral Initiative on Malaria Task Force is a time-limited programme to sup-port malaria research capability strengthening inAfrica. Awards support collaborative projectsbetween partners in developed and developingcountries. Projects must include at least twoAfrican research institutions (one establishedand one emerging) and at least one internationalpartner. T raining is an integral element of theprogramme. Fifteen awards were made inFebruary 1998 at a cost of US$2.5 million. Within TDR's other grant formats, training opportunities are available and encouraged. Inaddition to training administered through dedi-cated award schemes, TDR conducts short-termtraining courses in specialist areas.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) The IAEA serves as the world's central intergov- ernmental forum for scientic and technicalcooperation in the nuclear eld. The Agencyseeks to enhance the capabilities of developingMember States to address important health prob-lems through the development and applicationof nuclear and related techniques. Human healthactivities focus on methods for curative and pal-liative treatment of cancer and the establishmentof comprehensive quality assurance programmesfor radiation dosimetry, on techniques for earlydiagnosis of diseases such as tuberculosis, andeffective nutritional studies. Assistance to devel-oping countries is made via two principal mecha-nisms: Technical Cooperation Projects (TCP)and Co-ordinated Research Projects (CRP). TCP awards have a problem-solving orienta- tion. They seek to contribute, in a cost-effectivemanner through the provision of experts, train-ing and equipment, to activities addressing highdevelopment priorities relating to health servicesin Member States. CRP awards provide support for three years for networks of research institutions workingtogether on a specic topic. The aim of the CRPis to promote high-quality research in developingand developed countries (the latter provide cost-free expertise to the projects). The Agency'sexpenditure during 1997-98 on malaria researchand associated training was US$1.0 million. In addition, the Agency convenes and sponsorsseminars, symposia and international confer-ences, and disseminates information throughcost-free publications.T opportunities 2 Training attachment 12 (6.2%) Master's 38 (19.7%)Number of individuals supported Africa 120 (62%) Asia 38 (20%)South America 35 (18%)Figure 2.13 TDR: Classification of support by training level and region in FYs 1995-98.These figures are restricted to training via the Research Training Grant Scheme.Number of individuals trained = 193 Postdoctoral 7 (3.6%) PhD 136 (70.5%)Medical and basic health research grants 722 (11.9%) Medical and basic health scholarships overseas 181 (3.0%)Master's 15 (38.5%) 42 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa2.2.5 Dev eloping Countries Brazilian Government Ministry of Science and Technology Ministerio da Ciencia e Tecnologia (MCT) US$71.5 million CNPq and INPA in FYs 1995-97MCT is responsible for the planning, coordina-tion, supervision and control of all activities relat-ing to science and technology in Brazil. WithinMCT, there are three collegiate bodies, four secre-tariats, two funding agencies and four researchinstitutes (for further information see Brazil: a sci-ence and technology prole, Bogliolo, 1998). Thetwo funding agencies are the National Councilfor the Development of Science and Technology(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00ed-co e Tecnol\u00f3gico, CNPq) and the BrazilianAgency for the Studies and Projects(Financiadora de Estudos e Projectos, FINEP). CNPq is mainly concerned with the training and qualication of human resources, and withsupport for research. Its funding activities aredivided into Basic Programmes for traditionalelds of knowledge and Special Programmes forstrategic areas and multidisciplinary projects.CNPq expenditure on scholarships and researchgrants in biomedicine and health in FYs 1995-97 was US$65.6 million (Figure 2.14). FINEP is a state-owned company attached to MCT, with responsibility for nancing Brazil'stechnological development. FINEP providessupport in the form of loans for public and pri-vate enterprises, and universities and researchcentres. FINEP expenditure on research projectsin biomedicine in FYs US$4.2million. An additional US$72 000 providedsupport for scientic meetings and publicationson health sciences. The National Amazon Research Institute Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia(INPA) INPA is one of the four research institutes attached to MCT. It was established in 1952 toundertake scientic research of the physicalenvironment and living conditions in theAmazon region. It also trains personnel to carryout research in the region by means of Master'sand doctoral courses. Biomedical research andtraining at INPA is focused on studies of the vec-tors of malaria and leishmaniasis.

In FY1998, 38 awards totalling US$0.5 million weremade to scientists in the eld of biochemistry. Fourawards (US$40 000) were for malaria research. South-East Asia SouthEast Asian Ministers of Education Organization Regional T ropical Medicineand Public Health Network (SEAMEO-TROPMED) US$2.3 million on training and special projects FYs 1995-97SEAMEO-TROPMED's mission is to developthe capacity of individuals and institutions todeliver quality healthcare through training andresearch. The network offers academic degreeprogrammes and a range of short-term coursesand workshops, including distance learningmodules. Its four regional health centres con-duct research and offer training in the followingelds of speciality: TROPMED/Indonesia at the University of Indonesia, Jakarta is the Regional Centre forCommunity Nutrition; TROPMED/Malaysia at the Institute of Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur is theRegional Centre for Microbiology,Parasitology and Entomology; TROPMED/The Philippines at the University of The Philippines, Manila is the Regional Centre for Public Health; TROPMED/Thailand at Mahidol University, Bangkok, is the Regional Centrefor T ropical Medicine. Expenditure on training courses, scholar- ships and special projects was US$2.3 million inFYs 1995-97. A proportion of SEAMEO'sfunding is provided by partner organizationswith whom SEAMEO organizes special projectsand courses. These include the GTZ-supportedHIV/AIDS/STD Partnership project in the Asiaregion, and the SEAMEO-France CooperationProgramme on Control of CommunicableDiseases. During FY 1997, 424 students, mainlyfrom Asia, received scholarship support fromSEAMEO (Figure 2.18). 2.3 OVERVIEW OF AWARDS AND DISCUSSION The present survey gathered comparative data from a range of funding organizations onresearch training opportunities in health and thebiomedical sciences in developing countries.Previous reviews of have tended to be qualitativein nature or limited in their scope, whereas thepresent study provides a much broader analyticaloverview of the availability of training opportu-nities at the various stages of career progression,in different disciplines and in different regions.This study, however, has not attempted to assessthe success of training schemes, either individu-ally or collectively, in building sustainable andproductive research capacity in developingcountries. Data are therefore limited to numbersof trainees, expenditure gures and descriptiveinformation on training mechanisms. SomeT raining opportunities 2 PhD 330 (29.9%)Master's 566 (51.2%)Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 45T raining opportunities 2 indicators of the current levels of research activi- ty in developing countries and of the effective-ness of training schemes are presented in laterchapters. However, more detailed assessments byindividual organizations are needed to yieldanswers on optimal training mechanisms. Collecting comparable and reliable data on international support for training developing-country scientists represented a signicant chal-lenge. The quality and quantity of data collectedfrom individual organizations varied, andinevitably there were omissions in the overallinternational data obtained. A particular dif-culty was in obtaining details of training thatwas delivered as part of a larger research or devel-opment programme, as this training was oftennot recorded separately or monitored.Nevertheless, a substantial body of data was col-lected and an overview is presented here. Thisresource of information should be of value bothto funding agencies considering their contribu-tions to training, and to researchers seekingnancial support. Contact details for funderssurveyed are provided in Annex 2. 2.3.1 Investors in training The 39 organizations that participated in the sur-vey included governmental and non-governmen-tal organizations, private foundations and inter-national organizations. Information from gov-ernmental agencies in two lower-income coun-tries (Brazil and South Africa) was also obtained. Resources from governments in developed regions principally flow to low- or middle-income countries through specialized researchcouncils or agencies, bilateral programmes offoreign assistance agencies or ministries, or con- tributions to multilateral institutes or organiza-tions such as the UNDP/World Bank/WHOSpecial Programme for Research and T raining inT ropical Diseases (TDR). Most private founda-tions and non-governmental organizationsadminister their own funding schemes, butsome also contribute to other agencies. Wherepossible, this report has given due credit toorganizations providing funds to secondaryagencies, but the principal focus is on the pointof administration of training schemes. T rainingprovided through bilateral resources was oftendifcult to identify through survey of fundingorganizations, due to decentralization of records.Further information on organizations for whichdata were incomplete was in some cases obtainedby direct survey of malaria research laboratories(see Chapter 4). The results of the survey clearly showed the immense number and variety of schemes offeredby the international funding community, eachindividual scheme having its own aim and remit.The majority of funding organizations providerelatively small numbers of training awards each year, and only a few funders operate larger- scale training schemes: namely Commission of Healthand WHO/TDR. Other more prominent directsupporters of training include Australian,French, Swedish, Swiss, Danish and BelgianGovernment agencies, the International ClinicalEpidemiology Network (INCLEN) and theWellcome T rust.

Although everyeffort was made to present only the direct expen-diture on training, this was not always possible,and the footnotes to the table provide additionalinformation. Aggregate identied expenditure on training of developing-country scientists in biomedicineand health by organizations in higher-incomecountries was US$261 million (FYs 1995-97),with nearly a third of this from JICA. This gurerepresents a minimum estimate of expendituredue to the incompleteness of informationreceived from a number of organizations, anddifculties in achieving comprehensive surveycoverage of all relevant funders. For example, thesurvey focused on TDR as the largest WHOprogramme providing research training for sci-entists in developing countries, and does not include other WHO programmes such as thatfor T raining in Human Reproduction (HRP);nor other multilateral institutes or agencies suchas PAHO and UNICEF . In addition, responseswere not obtained from a number of privatefoundations. Nevertheless, the survey almostcertainly captured the majority of larger contrib-utors from the established market economies(for an overview of investors in health researchin general, see Michaud and Murray, 1996). The trend in investment in research training in developing countries was upwards, with anincrease of 41 per cent during the three-yearperiod 1995-97 (data not adjusted for inflation;Figure 2.19). Several organizations reported further increases in 1998. Those organizationsshowing the most notable increases in trainingexpenditure were the US National Institutes ofT raining opportunities 2 Table 2.6 Summary of identified support for training developing-country scientists in FYs 1995-97.

Data were available from some organizations on the signicance of their investment in train-ing of developing-country scientists in relationto overall expenditure. In 1998, the US NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) committed US$24million to training scientists in developingregions (dedicated training schemes only), repre-senting 0.15 per cent of the total NIH budgetand an estimated 6 per cent of expenditure onresearch relevant to developing countries(Michaud and Murray, 1996). The WellcomeT rust's expenditure on training of developing-country scientists increased from 0.17 per centof the total research funding in 1995 to 1.5 percent in 1997. Overall, approximately 10 percent of the T rust's total grants expenditure goesto research relevant to developing regions and,in 1997, 15 per cent of this was for training. Theabove gures show that training of scientists inlower-income countries represents a small pro-portion of overall activities for NIH and theWellcome T rust. These two organizations areleading international funders of research intodiseases that predominantly afflict developingcountries, and a small increase in the proportionof their budgets allocated to training has thepotential to make a large global impact. In fact,the expenditures of both the Wellcome T rustand NIH on training overseas scientists havealready increased over the last few years. Itshould be noted that the US Government, in addition to contributing through NIH, also pro-vides training through CDC and USAID, andvia WHO/TDR. The review focused primarily on training support from organizations based in higher-income countries and did not attempt to obtaincomprehensive data from developing countries.Estimates of nancial investment in research anddevelopment by governments in lower-incomeregions are generally very low, although there issubstantial variation between countries(UNESCO, 1998). Information was obtainedin the current study from the governments oftwo lower-income countries: Brazil madeimportant contributions to training of local sci-entists and research projects (US$71.5 millionin 1995-97), while South Africa made moremodest contributions (about US$8.6 million in1997-98). Brazil and South Africa have thehighest levels of research and developmentexpenditure for their respective regions and thegures from these two countries therefore prob-ably represent the upper levels of governmentcommitment to training. The gures fromSouth Africa in particular suggest that invest-ments by other countries in sub-Saharan Africaare extremely low, and these countries are there-fore likely to be heavily dependent on externalfunding resources to maintain research activities. Data were also requested from organizations on training of developing-country scientists in Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 47T raining opportunities 2 Figure 2.19 Expenditure in FYs 1995-97 on training scientists in developing countries.

The US National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome T rust devoted approxi-mately 2 per cent of their training expenditure tomalaria in 1995-98, reflecting the broad remit oftheir training schemes. 4In contrast, 20 per cent of the INCO-DC Health budget was devoted tomalaria during 1995-98 and a recent review ofTDR Research T raining Grants revealed that 42per cent of PhD awards in 1991-97 supportedprojects on malaria (TDR, 1999). 2.3.3 Training level of awards The availability of support at different stages ofcareer progression was assessed by analysing thenumber of awards and the principal contributingorganizations at each training level (Figure 2.20). T raining attachments and short courses were the predominant forms of support identied inthe survey, accounting for 5010 awards (70 percent of total identied awards). Many organiza-tions support this type of training, althoughJICA provided the greatest number, particularlyto Asian countries. Detailed information on thenature of training attachments, such as the stageof scientic career where they were most oftendirected, was not available. Many organizations also provide support for training workshops andthe US NIH was notable in this respect. At undergraduate level there were very few opportunities for support from agencies interna-tionally: only 1 per cent of all identied awardswere for Bachelor's studies. Available data indi-cated that the European Commission INCO-DC programme and AusAID provided the high-est numbers of awards at this level. Postgraduate training identied in the study (excluding training attachments) comprised 821Master's awards (40 per cent of total), 684 PhDawards (33 per cent) and 564 postdoctoralawards (27 per cent) for the period 1995-98.Again, these are likely to be underestimates dueto the incompleteness of data. For example, thelarge numbers of AusAID awards to scientists inAsia and the Pacic islands were not included inoverview analyses due to a lack of precise data.Similarly, data from French agencies wereincomplete. Nevertheless, the aggregate guresinclude the majority of larger funders and pro-vide an indication of the order of magnitude ofpostgraduate training opportunities.T raining opportunities 2 4Malaria represents about a third of Wellcome Trustexpenditure on tropicalmedicine research activitiesoverall.Figure 2.20 Availability of training at levels in FYs 1995-98.

Afew organizations provided substantial supportat Master's level: the Belgian Agency forDevelopment Cooperation (BADC) and Clinical Epidemiology Network(INCLEN) provided 256 and 209 awards in1995-98 respectively, accounting for over halfof the total Master's awards identied. Otherprominent supporters of Master's training during1995-98 were the INCO-DC programme (100awards), the British Council and DANIDA(40-50 awards each). The awards provided byINCLEN and BADC were focused in the areas ofclinical epidemiology and public health respec-tively, so that the availability of Master's trainingin other research disciplines was more limited. Support at PhD level was available from just over half of funding organizations surveyed, but94 per cent of the identied awards came fromfour organizations: the European Commission,NIH, TDR Partial data providedby AusAID, IRD, Sida/SAREC and the SwissAgency for Development and Cooperation sug-gested that these agencies may also make impor-tant contributions to training at PhD level.Contributions from some of these agencies wereconrmed by direct survey of African laborato-ries (Chapter 4). Identication of opportunities for postdoc- toral scientists to extend their scientic skills andconsolidate their PhD training was complicatedby the differing denitions and perceptions of'training' and the lack of formalized qualica-tions at this level. It is likely that a proportion ofthe identied large number of training attach-ments and workshops are aimed at postdoctoralscientists, although insufcient information wasavailable to conrm this. Postdoctoral scientistscan also extend their experience by working inassociation with ongoing research projects, andthere are a number of bilateral awards to supportexchange of scientists between high- and low-income countries. Accurate assessment of theextent of these types of postdoctoral training wasdifcult as they are often an integral part of alarger programme. Few opportunities were identied for post- doctoral scientists to apply for research funds todevelop their own individual careers; the majori- ty of support going to larger-scale programmes.TDR, NIH, and the Wellcome T rust appear tooffer the most extensive possibilities for supportin this respect, although most TDR grantopportunities are focused on strategic priorityareas or linked to institutional strengtheninggrants. TDR also provides small one- to two-year Re-entry Grants to researchers upon returnto their home institution after a period of train-ing. The Wellcome T rust offers schemes todevelop the expertise of junior postdoctoralresearchers, including opportunities to train inor collaborate with centres of excellence indeveloping countries or in the UK, as well asawards for more senior scientists. NIH offersinternational research fellowships to supportpostdoctoral training of foreign scientists in theUSA and in addition, unsolicited grant applica-tions are accepted from non-US citizens. 2.3.4 Geographical distribution of awards Geographical information was available for just over half of the agencies contacted and 89 percent of the specic awards identied in the sur-vey (local support from Brazil and South Africawas excluded from the analysis). Overall, theregional distribution of awards in FY 1995-98was Asia 41 per cent, Africa 32 per cent andSouth America 27 per cent, but the distributionwas strongly skewed by the very large number ofawards to Asian researchers from JICA. The dis-tribution would further favour Asia if awardsfrom AusAID were included in the analysis(accurate gures not available). When trainingattachment awards from JICA were excluded,the distribution of awards moved towardsAfrica: Asia 27 per cent, Africa 46 per cent andSouth America 27 per cent. Many of the largerfunders were included in this analysis, but itshould be noted that geographical informationfor the awards of the European Commission andBADC were not available. Geographical proximity and historical links between countries, as well as a common lan-guage, appeared to be important influences onthe focus of support by an organization. In somecases, distribution of awards was determined bya funding strategy to support particular coun-tries or diseases. For example, TDR focuses itsresearch capability strengthening grants mainlyT raining opportunities 250 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africaon Africa and in least developed countries: 62 per cent of TDR Research T raining Grants wereawarded to African researchers (1995-98).Awards from JICA and AusAID were directedmainly to researchers in South Asia; support toLatin America was derived mainly from fundingorganizations based in the USA and Canada;and French and UK organizations tended tofocus on specic countries in Africa (Franco-phone and Anglophone). Other factors likely toinfluence the distribution of awards include theexistence of established collaborations, the abili-ty of researchers to compete for funds, the avail-ability of alternative local funds to supportresearch, and the efciency of advertising media. 2.3.5 Training mechanisms The survey revealed that a variety of strategies areemployed by funding agencies to deliver trainingto scientists in developing countries, althoughtraining is often linked to ongoing research pro-grammes. Some agencies focus long-term sup-port on a small number of centres in developingcountries and train local scientists associated withthese centres (e.g. IRD, the UK MRC, WellcomeT rust, CDC). Other agencies link training tocompetitively awarded larger scale programmesat a variety (but usually small number) of sites(e.g. NIAID, DANIDA, EC INCO-DC).Relatively few funders offer trainingawards that are not restricted to specic sites orlinked to other awards. The Wellcome T rust andTDR offer some possibilities in this respect,although many of their awards are also restricted. Linking training to research projects that have received support through a competitive,peer-reviewed process provides some assurancethat training will be in an appropriate intellectu-al environment. Concentrating resources at alimited number of centres also assists in buildingresearch facilities and a critical mass of peoplewhere high-quality science can flourish; avoid-ing wasteful dispersion of resources acrossunproductive sites. However, the selection ofcentres at which resources are focused is critical-ly important and a number of key elements arerequired for successful research and training; forexample the presence of talented scientic lead-ers, efcient administration, and local commit-ment to research (for a fuller discussion of effec-tive research programmes and institutions seeWHO, 1996, Chapter 7).Many organizations target support for research and training on particular diseases, spe-cic research disciplines or even individual train-ing courses. For example, TDR programmesfocus on eight target diseases, while the govern-ments of Belgium, Norway and Germany sup-port Master's training on selected courses speci-cally for participants from developing countries.NIAID and FIC offer some schemes that areopen to all areas of biomedical sciences, whileothers aim to encourage research on particulardiseases (e.g. tuberculosis) or in specic disci-plines (e.g. reproductive biology, medical infor-matics). Similarly, the Wellcome T rust encouragesresearch in specic areas (e.g. population studies,health services research and noncommunicablediseases), whilst also offering open schemes. Many funding agencies support training in a developed country, usually in the country wherethe agency itself is based. A signicant problemassociated with overseas training of developing-country scientists is that trainees are often drawnaway from their home countries to regionswhere the laboratory facilities and careerprospects are far superior. For this reason fun-ders often require an assurance from the home-country institute that a post will be available to atrainee following completion of an overseastraining attachment. A recent internal reviewcarried out by TDR (TDR, 1999) showed thatonly 4.5 per cent (6/131) of PhD graduatestrained between 1991 and 1997 failed to returnto their home country following training, thusindicating the success of the TDR approach. There is also growing recognition that over- seas institutes often cannot provide training thataddresses a research problem of relevance to thestudent's home country or that is appropriate tothe facilities and equipment in the home insti-tute. The higher cost of training abroad is anoth-er factor that would favour exploring local orregional training options. Nevertheless, exposureof developing-country scientists to the researchculture and high-quality training environmentsof laboratories abroad is still considered to beextremely valuable in training internationallycompetitive researchers. In the light of theseissues, several funders support training in homeinstitutes with attachments in a developed coun-try (e.g. TDR, SAREC, DANIDA) and fundersare beginning to make more use of local orregional training facilities where possible (TDR, T raining opportunities 2Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 51INCLEN and the Wellcome T rust for example). There are currently few mechanisms that can link sites together within developing regions formulticentre studies or regional training net-works. The European Commission INCO-DCprogramme, the MIM/TDR awards, SEAMEO-TROPMED and INCLEN are the most promi-nent in this respect. 2.4 CONCLUSIONS The survey results showed the complex array ofresearch training opportunities offered to devel-oping countries by a broad range of fundingorganizations. This diversity of schemes presentsdifculties to potential trainees attempting toidentify and secure sources of funding. In addi-tion, training opportunities are in many caseslinked to larger research programmes and arenot offered openly. In general, training schemes are dispersed and fragmented with the majority of fundersproviding relatively few awards annually andonly a small number of organizations providinglarger-scale training programmes. Few devel-oped countries include a strong commitment toresearch capacity building as an integral elementof their overseas development programmes.Furthermore, there appear to be few opportuni-ties for scientists to develop their research careersthrough the funding schemes of a single organi-zation, as support from most organizations tendsto be targeted at one particular level. Available data suggest that Africa and Asia are slightly favoured over South America in terms ofthe availability of training awards. Overall, it wasevident that the location of training is stronglyinfluenced by mechanisms of bilateral support,and by historical and language associationsbetween countries. The majority of training isoffered overseas, often in the country of thedonor organization, and training partnershipstend to link specic developed countries to par-ticular regions or countries. The establishment offunding mechanisms that can support morediverse training links would assist in optimizingthe use of the best training centres globally and inpromoting greater diversity in collaborations, forexample amongst Francophone and AnglophoneAfrican countries. Additional funding mecha-nisms to support networks and multicentre stud-ies are also required to allow regional technology transfer and sharing of resources. This is an issuethat has been recognized by the MultilateralInitiative on Malaria, and some progress hasalready been made in establishing schemes tosupport multi-centre studies and networks acrossAfrica (e.g. the MIM/TDR awards). T raining attachments and short courses are the predominant type of training provided by organi-zations in developed countries. Very few organiza-tions provide support for undergraduate training.Nearly three-quarters of organizations surveyedprovide Master's awards and just over half offerPhD training. However, over 50 per cent ofMaster's awards came from two organizations andover 90 per cent of identied PhD awards camefrom four organizations. Postdoctoral training isoften provided in association with larger researchprogrammes and few agencies provide opportuni-ties for individual scientists to apply for inde-pendent research support. T raining offered by funders is often linked to large research programmes or targeted at partic-ular diseases, disciplines or courses. The balanceof research expertise generated in different sub-ject areas will obviously be strongly influencedby these approaches to training. There is there-fore a need for a mechanism that allows a strate-gic overview of ongoing activities, which willassist in matching research efforts to actualhealth needs and disease burden. Even after taking into consideration the inevitable underestimation in the survey results,the data suggest that investment by higher-income countries in training biomedical scien-tists in developing countries is low relative totraining activities in industrialized countries. In1997, the UK spent US$145 million 5on train- ing and fellowships to develop UK expertise inbiomedical research, compared with a gure inthe present study of about US$100 million inthe same year for training scientists across Africa,Asia and South America; regions with an aggre-gate population of about 75 times that of theUK. Similarly, the 684 PhD awards to develop-ing-country scientists identied for the fouryears 1995-98 compares with at least 2101 PhDawards in biomedicine and health in the UK in asingle year (1995, supported by the UKGovernment-funded Medical Research Counciland the Biotechnology and Biological SciencesResearch Council). Despite the small overallT raining opportunities 2 5In 1997 UK Medical Research Council expenditure on train-ing awards and fellowships(Master's and PhDstudentships; junior mil-lion was spent on PhDstudentships.52 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africainvestment, there was a marked increase in expenditure over the survey period, suggesting agrowing commitment by organizations in high-income countries to support training of scien-tists from developing countries. The above gures need to be considered in the light of the more limited educational basesin developing countries at undergraduate level,and hence the availability of individuals toabsorb training at doctoral level. The extent ofhigher education varies considerably betweencountries. For example in Africa the number oftertiary students per 10 000 population in 1991ranged from two to four for Ethiopia, Malawi,Tanzania and Uganda, through 30-50 forCongo, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and upto 80 for South Africa. By comparison, theequivalent gures for China and Japan were 19and 238 respectively (African DevelopmentBank, 1994). Thus, it might be approximatedthat there are 10-100 times more tertiary stu-dents per unit population in industrializedcountries as compared with developing coun-tries. The gures for PhD awards obtained in thepresent study indicate that there are approaching1000 times more awards per unit population inthe UK than in the developing regions com-bined. Although these gures encompass a rangeof different educational systems across the devel-oping world and involve a lack of precision, theydo indicate the disparity in the numbers of sci-entists trained in high- and low-income coun-tries in relation to population sizes; particularlyif the dependence of developing countries onexternal support for postgraduate training istaken into consideration. The gures on num-bers of tertiary students relative to numbers ofPhD awards also suggest that there is additionalcapacity to absorb PhD training in some lower-income countries. An important observation in the present study is that relatively few organizations activelytrack the levels of training that they provide andthe success of their schemes: only 13 out of the39 organizations that responded to the surveywere able to provide full data. Many do notmaintain accurate central records, particularlywhen training is provided as part of largeresearch programmes. This observation under-scores the fragmented nature of currentapproaches to training scientists in developingcountries and the need for a more concertedapproach. The results of this study would sup- port a call for greater international effort tomonitor and review the effectiveness of currentschemes in building productive scienticresearch capability in lower-income regions ofthe world. In view of the enormity of the challenge in building research capacity in developing coun-tries, funding organizations face some difcultdecisions concerning where best to direct theirresources for maximal effect. The data gatheredin the present survey provides essential informa-tion on the international context against whichsuch decisions can be made. T raining opportunities 2Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 533 3.1 BACKGROUND Evaluation of the results of biomedical research can be approached in a number of different waysand each approach is able to provide a specicinsight into scientic activity. Methodologytherefore needs to be tailored to the particularassessment being carried out. The limited scopeof current indicators, however, means that acombination of approaches is required to obtaina more complete view of scientic activity andits social, economic and cultural impacts. Analysis of publication outputs in interna- tional databases (bibliometrics) or analysis ofcommercial patents toassess direct output from scientic activity(Narin, 1994; Dawson et al. , 1998). Published papers represent relatively accessible and con-venient measures of research activity whichbroadly equate with advances in knowledge.Although numbers of papers provide measuresof the volume of research outputs, they cannotindicate the quality of these outputs or the ulti-mate impact of research on policy developmentand on health. Patents are another accessiblemeasure which provide indicators of technologi-cal potential at the frontiers of knowledge. The present study selected bibliometric approaches to assess the current status of malariaresearch activity in Africa. The results, however,necessarily reflect the databases used for theanalyses. Currently available databases concen-trate on papers published in international, peer-reviewed journals, and cannot capture informa-tion published in local sources, the so-called 'grey literature' (e.g. ministry of health publications,technical memoranda or conference proceed-ings). The omission of this grey literature is amajor constraint, particularly when evaluatingresearch of relevance to malaria-endemic coun-tries, and when examining links between researchand implementation. This chapter therefore givesan insight only into publication performance asrepresented in the international, predominantlyEnglish-language scientic literature. Assessments of longer-term outcomes of research, such as the development of new prod-ucts to ght disease or improvements in health-care, require more complex approaches. In thisstudy, references cited in malaria guidelines andpolicies in African countries were examined tomake a more direct assessment of the degree towhich both published and unpublished papershave been incorporated into policy and practice.Policies and guidelines are resources aimed athealth professionals and disease control person-nel which are intended to influence or direct clin-ical practice and approaches to preventing dis-ease. Reference to a scientic paper in a policy orguideline therefore demonstrates a link betweena research study and policy development, andprovides an indication of the practical utility ofthe research results reported in the paper.The number of published papers is an indicator of research output that can provide a proxy measure of research activity in a particular eld. More detailed characterizationof publications yields information on key research centres, international collaborationpatterns and strengths and weaknesses in different subelds of research. The presentchapter uses this approach to assess the current status of African malaria researchactivity, set against the background of international activity. Publication analyses are,however, limited in their scope and this chapter therefore also explores the use ofnational malaria treatment guidelines and policies to make an assessment of theinfluence of malaria research in developing policies for disease treatment and control.Similar future analyses of these indicators will enable changes in research status to bemonitored, providing mechanisms for evaluation of the broad success of schemesaimed at strengthening research capability in Africa.Outputs of malaria research54 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa3.2 METHODS 3.2.1 Overview of bibliometric analyses The current assessment of malaria research in Africa employed a number of different biblio-metric approaches.1. Numbers of publications were used as a quantitative measure of research activity atdifferent levels: internationally, withinAfrica, at individual country level and at spe-cic research centres. 2. Author addresses were used to explore pat- terns of international collaboration. 3. Classication of papers into dened subelds of malaria research provided information onthe balance of global and African activityacross different disciplines, and on theresearch focus of individual research centres. 4. Funding acknowledgements quoted in publi- cations were used to analyse sources of nan-cial support for research. 5. Journal impact factors were used to assess the potential impact of publications. The combination of approaches aimed to provide a detailed insight into the characteristicsof research ongoing in Africa in the context ofinternational activity. 3.2.2 Databases and search strategy The databases used for the bibliometric analysiswere the Science Citation Index (SCI) producedby the Institute for Scientic Information inPhiladelphia, and MEDLINE, produced by theUS National Library of Medicine. MEDLINEcovers a more comprehensive set of journalsrelating to medical research, particularly jour-nals reporting on clinical and epidemiologicalstudies. It also has better coverage of local,regional and non-English language journals. SCIhas greater coverage of basic chemistry and drugdevelopment studies, but is primarily based onEnglish language journals and therefore is biasedtowards the USA and Europe (Sancho, 1992).This bias will have particular signicance in theeld of malaria, which predominantly affectsdeveloping countries and is of local interest toresearchers in those countries. A major advan-tage of SCI is that it provides multiple authoraddresses, enabling analysis of international col-laboration patterns. MEDLINE records only theaddress of the rst author, precluding its use in analysis of co-authorship on publications.However, MEDLINE includes abstracts thatassist in assessment of the specic research focusof publications. The search strategy employed was that used in a previous review of malaria research activity(Anderson et al. , 1996)(Annex 3). Specic key- words relating to malaria were used to search thetitles of publications in SCI and MEDLINE data-bases for the three-year period 1995-97. Thistime period was chosen in order to obtain themost up-to-date information on malaria researchactivity. Articles, notes and reviews were includedin the analysis as these are generally considered tocontain substantial scientic material, but letters(apart from those to Nature ), meeting reports, news and editorials were excluded. The broader eld of tropical medicine was dened by a similar process (Lewison, 1996).The denition aimed to capture all publicationsrelevant to health and disease in developingcountries. Publications were retrieved from SCIfor the period 1995-97 in order to compare theoutputs in the eld of malaria with the widereld of tropical medicine. 3.2.3 National outputs and collaboration patterns Author addresses on malaria publications were used to determine the outputs of individualcountries and to identify the most prolicresearch institutes in Africa. For publicationsrecorded in the SCI database, addresses of allauthors were used. For MEDLINE, however,only rst author addresses were available - a lim-itation which means that the contribution ofcountries and institutions not associated withrst authors is missed. Addresses were analysedusing integer counts, such that one count wasassigned for each paper with at least one addressfrom a specic country. Thus, the gures repre-sent the numbers of publications in which acountry has participated, rather than the num-ber exclusively produced by that country.Author addresses on SCI publications were alsoused to examine co-authorship on malaria publi-cations and hence patterns of international col-laboration. Collaboration patterns were exam-ined for the highest publishing countries world-wide and countries in Africa.Outputs of malaria research 3Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 553.2.4 Research categories To examine the levels of research activity in dif- ferent areas of malaria research, and to identifyregional, country- and institute-specic researchstrengths, publications retrieved from SCI andMEDLINE were classied into a series of sub-eld categories. The classication systememployed was that developed for a previousreview (Anderson et al. , 1996) and is shown in Annex 6. Malaria research publications were cat-egorized by inspection of the title, and wherepossible, on the basis of information in theabstract. Precise denition of research categoriesreduced the number of papers spanning morethan one category, although separation of small-er categories of biology, biochemistry and genet-ics of Plasmodium was difcult. Each paper was also classied as either 'human' if it involvedstudies of malaria in humans, or 'non-human' ifit described studies in animals or in vitro models. 3.2.5 Funding acknowledgements Financial support for published research was analysed using acknowledgements to fundingbodies on papers and institute addresses (toidentify intramural support e.g. from govern-ment or industry). Acknowledgements and/orinstitute addresses for each malaria publicationwere obtained by examining individual papers inlibraries. 3.2.6 Impact of research The potential impact of a paper (W), based onrecent average citation impact data for journals,was calculated using the methodology outlinedby Dawson et al. (1998) for both the internation- al and African data sets. High W values reflect ahigher potential impact; the range is from 1 to 4. Papers were also assigned a research level value (RL) determined by the clinical or basicnature of the journals in which they were pub-lished. RL1 journals describe clinical observa-tion, whilst RL4 journals report basic science.3.2.7 Malaria guidelines and policies The references in ministry of health guidelinesand policies from selected countries in Africawere examined to assess the types of data onwhich they were based, for example, whetherthey incorporated information from recentmalaria research publications and publicationsemanating from the specic country concerned. 3.3 RESULTS Unless otherwise stated all results are based onpublications in both SCI and MEDLINE. 3.3.1 Global and African malaria research outputs A total of 3672 malaria papers were retrieved from the SCI and MEDLINE databases for theyears 1995-97. There was an increase in thenumber of malaria papers published interna-tionally, from 1121 in 1995 to 1295 in 1997.However, there does not appear to be a steadyupward trend as the equivalent 1994 gure was1302 (Anderson et al., 1996). There was a considerable degree of overlap in publications in the MEDLINE and SCI data-bases. Malaria research papers were published ina total of 568 journals across the two databases,with 119 journal titles specic to SCI and 153titles specic to MEDLINE. A greater numberof non-English language and local journalsappeared in MEDLINE (e.g. Sant\u00e9 , Central African Journal of Medicine ,West African Journal of Medicine ,Tropical Doctor ). Of the 3672 malaria papers identied, 2869 (78 per cent)papers were included in SCI and 3211 (87 percent) in the MEDLINE database. Over the same period, 13 815 papers in the eld of tropical medicine were identied inter-nationally in the SCI database, with malariapapers constituting 20.8 per cent of the totaloutput in tropical medicine.Outputs of malaria research 3A total of 633 malaria research papers pub- lished between 1995 and 1997 included at leastone author address in Africa. This represents17.2 per cent of the global malaria research out-put over the three-year period. In 329 papers (52per cent), the rst author address was in Africa.Of the African output, 121 papers were foundonly in SCI, while 112 papers were found onlyin MEDLINE. Malaria research output fromAfrica remained fairly constant, with 201 paperspublished in 1995 and 215 papers in 1997. Analysis of address information recorded on malaria papers from both SCI and MEDLINErevealed the leading publishers over the period1995-97 (Figure 3.1). The USA participated inthe greatest number of malaria publications, fol-lowed by the UK and France. Although the USAremains the top malaria-publishing country, itsshare of international outputs has decreased from37 per cent for the years 1984, 1989 and 1994(Anderson et al., 1996) to 30 per cent in 1995-97 (SCI database only). The UK and French contri-butions to malaria publications have remainedsteady since 1994. The malaria-endemic coun-tries India, Thailand and Kenya have a notablyhigh share of global malaria publications. Table 3.1 illustrates country contributions to international malaria research relative to perform-ance in the overall eld of biomedicine. All of thetop ten publishing countries, with the exceptionof the USA and Germany, contribute relativelymore to international malaria research than tooverall biomedical research. Thailand and Kenyahave particularly high commitments to malariaresearch, as does Africa as a whole. AlthoughAfrica contributes 17.2 per cent of world malariapublications, it participates in only 1.2 per cent ofall biomedical publications. Figure 3.2 shows sub-Saharan African coun- tries that published 14 or more malaria researchpapers over the three-year period. A completelist of publication output by African country isgiven in Annex 4. These data include all publica-tions with an address in Africa and no attemptwas made to separate African and expatriateresearchers. 56 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaOutputs of malaria research 3 Figure 3.1 T op publishing countries in malaria research 1995-97. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000USA UK France India Australia Thailand Switzerland Netherlands Germany Kenya Africa (pooled) Number of publicationsStrengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 57Outputs of malaria research 3 Table 3.1 Country contributions to international publication outputs.

African papers showed a high level ofinternational co-authorship, with 79 per centinvolving a collaboration outside Africa. Africa has particularly strong collaborative links with Europe: 68 per cent of its publicationswere co-authored with a European country and22 per cent with the USA (Figure 3.4).However, collaborations between African coun-tries were rare, with only 34 publications (6.5per cent) containing more than one Africanaddress. The actual level of collaboration acrossAfrica may be higher, however, as this co-author-ship analysis was restricted to SCI, which focuseson European and US journals and omits mostlocal and regional journals from Africa. UK andFrance both collaborated more frequently withAfrica than with other European countries,while the USA collaborated more extensivelywith Europe than with Africa. Analysis of the countries with which Africa collaborates revealed that the UK, followed bythe USA and France are the most frequent col-laborators (Figure 3.5).Outputs of malaria research 3 Figure 3.5 Leading collaborators with Africa in malaria research, 1995 -97 (SCI).

However, coun-try-specic variations in collaboration patternswere observed: Nigeria and South Africa pro-duced a higher proportion of papers without anyexternal collaborations.

Only 0.7 percent of papers were judged to span more thanone discipline. Internationally, the category withthe greatest number of publications was clinicalmedicine, drug trials and pathophysiology with23 per cent of publications, followed bybiology, biochemistry and genetics ofPlasmodium with 17 per cent. Comparison of the international output in 1995-97 with aprevious review of papers published in 1984,1989 and 1994 (Anderson et al., 1996) revealed that there has been very little change in therelative activity of the different subelds.The emphasis of research in Africa was on clinical and eld studies: publications were mostnumerous in the category clinical medicine, drug trials and pathophysiology (33 per cent),followed by epidemiology (20 per cent) andintervention trials and health services research (14 per cent). Studies of the biology, biochem-istry and genetics of Plasmodium accounted for only 3 per cent of total output. Similarly, funda-mental studies of mosquito vectors or vector taxonomy, ecology or behaviour accounted for 7 per cent of African papers, compared with 12 per cent for the international set. About aquarter of African epidemiological studiesfocused on mosquitoes (5 per cent of the totalset). Nine per cent of papers described studies onOutputs of malaria research 3 Figure 3.8 Malaria research publications (1995 -97) by major research category (SCI and MEDLINE).

The category of intervention trials and health services research was well represented in theAfrican set of papers (14 per cent of the total),but was less signicant in the international set (7 per cent of total). About half of the Africanpapers in this category focused on social, culturalor economic aspects of malaria treatment or con-trol measures. It should be noted, however, thatnot all research relevant to these areas will havebeen captured by the databases employed, andthe use of the Social Sciences Citation Indexdatabase might have extended coverage. Internationally, 46 per cent of papers des- cribed studies of malaria in humans, whereas theequivalent gure for Africa was 81 per cent. In drawing conclusions from these results it should be borne in mind that the research effortrepresented by a single paper varies between sub-elds due to differences in experimentalapproaches and techniques. In addition, theextent of the subeld, which is determined bythe denition employed to describe it, will alsoaffect the absolute number of publications persubeld. Finally, the overall eld of malariaresearch is relatively small and individualresearch groups may substantially influence out-put in a particular subeld and hence the bal-ance between subelds.3.3.4 Funding acknowledgements Table 3.2 shows the number of malaria papers inthe SCI and MEDLINE databases that wereretrieved from UK libraries and examined forfunding acknowledgements. Of the 2724 inter-national papers examined, 75 per cent acknowl-edged at least one funding agency. In the Africandata subset, 82.2 per cent of the papers locatedhad at least one funding acknowledgement. As the search was restricted to UK libraries, it is possible that journals published in Englishwere more readily available than those in otherlanguages, resulting in a bias towards funders ofEnglish-speaking researchers. Furthermore, ininterpreting funding acknowledgements data, itshould be noted that the results can only serve asan indicator of support provided by fundingbodies, and they do not necessarily reflect theactual expenditure. The numbers of acknowl-edgements will be influenced by the degree ofemphasis placed on researchers acknowledgingtheir funders, and the specic funding strategiesemployed by organizations. A funding bodymay, for example, choose to provide partialfunding for a project, or to provide the full costsas far as possible. Moreover, some agencies pro-vide infrastructure costs for research institutes,whereas others do not. Counts of fundingacknowledgements do not take into accountthese differing levels of support, nor do they rec-ognize funders that have contributed throughother agencies.Outputs of malaria research 3 Table 3.2 Number of funding acknowledgements on malaria publications 1995 -97.

In the African papers, TDR was againthe most frequently acknowledged funder, with24 per cent of all papers containing at least oneacknowledgement, followed by the WellcomeT rust (19 per cent), KEMRI (17 per cent) andthe UK Medical Research Council (15 per cent). TDR was also the most frequently acknowl- edged funder in a previous analysis of interna-tional malaria publications from 1984, 1989 and1994 (Anderson et al., 1996) accounting for 23 per cent of all acknowledgements. However, theTDR share of acknowledgements decreased to19 per cent in the current analysis. NIAID, thesecond ranked funder in terms of acknowledge-ments in the earlier survey also appears to havedecreased its share from 17 per cent to 9 per cent.These gures may, however, be influenced by the acknowledgement practices of authors in the useof NIH and NIAID (NIAID being one of theinstitutes of NIH). NIH received only 2 per centof acknowledgements in the earlier survey com-pared with 8 per cent in the current survey. Over-all, 353 papers (17 per cent) acknowledged eitherNIH or NIAID. The Wellcome T rust and theEuropean Commission both increased their per-centage share over the period of the two surveys.Funding from French sources was noted to bedistributed across a range of organizations, par-ticularly governmental agencies. The number ofpapers with an acknowledgement to at least oneof these agencies totalled 221 for the internation-al set and 64 for Africa, thus conrming the sub-stantial support from France overall. One Africangovernmental source, the Kenyan MedicalResearch Institute, featured strongly as a funderin the African set of papers. The governments ofCameroon, Tanzania, Burkina-Faso, The Gam-bia, Ethiopia and Malawi received smaller num-bers of acknowledgements.

Similar earlier analy-sis (Anderson et al. , 1990) had shown involve- ment of the Wellcome pharmaceutical company(now Glaxo Wellcome plc), but their activities inmalaria research have now been reduced. 3.3.5 Characterization of top research institutes in Africa The top publishing institutes across Africa are well balanced in their distribution between Eastand West Africa, but the published output fromsouthern (excluding South Africa) and particu-larly central Africa is low (Figure 3.9).Table 3.4 summarizes the major research spe- cializations and primary sources of funding forthe top publishing African malaria research insti-tutes in 1995-97. Subeld analysis indicated that many insti- tutes conduct multidisciplinary research pro-grammes: four institutes publish research in veor more malaria research subelds, and themajority of institutes publish research in at leastthree subelds, with the exception of theMinistry of Health, Malawi; University ofAbidjan, Ivory Coast, and CNLP , Burkina-Fasowhere research publications are predominantlyfocused on a single subeld.

Half of the centres pub-lished in clinical management of malaria andantimalarial drug trials, while two centres pub-lished basic studies of biochemistry, genetics andmolecular biology. Analysis of sources of funding for the top publishing institutes illustrated the substantialinvolvement of external funds in supportingproductive research programmes. Many fundingagencies focus support on specic centres. Forexample, French funding bodies (IRD, InstitutPasteur and the French Ministry of Coopera-tion) focus primarily on centres in FrancophoneAfrica, and tend not to co-fund with organiza-tions from other European countries or theUSA. USAID and CDC tend to fund institutesconcerned primarily with health servicesresearch and intervention trials, reflecting theirmore applied missions.3.3.6 Impact of research African malaria research publications have alower mean potential impact (W = 1.67) com-pared with the international set of publications(W = 1.92). This is not unexpected, however, inview of the signicantly more clinical nature ofAfrican malaria research compared to interna-tional research and the observation that clinicaljournals generate fewer citations (Dawson et al., 1998). The clinical nature of African malariaresearch is evidenced by two types of data.Firstly, the set of African papers was published inmore clinical journals, having a mean researchlevel value (RL) of 2.24 compared with a valueof 2.89 for the international set (RL1 = mostclinical, RL4 = basic science). Secondly, subeldanalysis showed that 81 per cent of Africanpapers describe studies of malaria in humans,whereas the equivalent gure internationally was46 per cent.

Table 3.5 summarizes the studies cited in these policies and guidelines (see Annex 5 forfull titles). Only two countries, Kenya andSouth Africa, included a comprehensive refer-ences list in their guidelines. Senegal includedspecic references in the text of guidelines, butno bibliography; whereas guidelines fromNigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe referred tostudies and research, without citing specic ref-erences. Policies from Namibia, Ghana, Zambia,Uganda and Malawi included non-specic refer-ences to in-country operational research studiesand projects, mainly relating to drug resistancetesting and epidemiological studies. Grey litera-ture and local research featured prominently inthe malaria guidelines examined. Of the 45 ref-erences in the Kenyan and South African malar-ia guidelines, only 20 (42 per cent) were publica-tions in peer-reviewed research journals, and 15(33 per cent) referred to local research. WhenSenegal, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Tanzania areincluded in the analysis, 85 of the 128 references(66 per cent) cited in guidelines and policieswere to research papers and studies of local ori-gin. Fifty-one percent of the references were topapers and studies less than ve years old andWHO publications constituted 10 per cent ofthe references in the guidelines and policies. Despite the lack of a formal references sec- tion, the Malawi guidelines clearly refer to oper-ational research which has affected policy. Theexperience of Malawi in changing from chloro-quine to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine for rstline treatment of malaria has become a 'bench-mark' in the development of malaria treatmentpolicies for other countries in the region.Similarly, the references in the South Africanguidelines reflect the close working relationshipbetween the South African Medical ResearchCouncil and the Ministry of Health. The clinical or basic nature of the 45 refer- enced papers was characterized by analysing thedistribution of the papers across different jour-nal types. The average research level (RL) of thecited papers in the African guidelines was 1.6,with over half in level 1 (clinical) journals, indi-cating the strongly clinical nature of the cited papers. This is signicantly lower than the meanRL for African malaria papers 1995-97 at 2.24.Similar analysis of available WHO malaria pub-lications referenced in the guidelines revealedthat the majority of cited papers were also pub-lished in clinical journals. 3.4 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION Bibliometric analyses were based on publica- tions recorded in MEDLINE and SCI between1995 and 1997. These analyses provided insightinto the publications performance of Africancountries in malaria research in the context ofworldwide productivity, based largely on inter-national peer-reviewed journals. The use ofMEDLINE in addition to SCI allowed greatercoverage of clinical and eld-based research, andalso of non-English language journals and jour-nals from malaria-endemic regions. It should benoted, however, that the contribution of localgrey literature could not be accurately assessed,as this literature is not recorded comprehensivelyin any current database. To gain some insightinto local research that might be influencingclinical practice in malaria-endemic countries, acomplementary analysis of African malaria guide-lines and policies was carried out. Publication outputs The number of malaria publications worldwidewas small relative to other areas of biomedicalresearch and in relation to the high global bur-den of disease from malaria. On average 1070papers were produced per year between 1995 and1997 (SCI and MEDLINE), with no markedtrend in output apparent over the time periodassessed. By comparison, publications relating totuberculosis increased from 1078 in 1991 to1521 in 1998 (MEDLINE), thus overtakingmalaria research outputs. Malaria research represented an important proportion of tropical medicine research (21 percent of global output), but did not competestrongly with other areas of biomedical research,accounting for just 0.3 per cent of all publica-tions recorded in SCI. By comparison, a recentreview indicated that publications on arthritisand rheumatism accounted for 2.4 per cent ofOutputs of malaria research 370 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africaworld biomedical publications in 1995, and car- diology research papers constituted 10.2 percent of the world biomedical total in 1995 (SCIdatabase, Dawson et al., 1998). The USA followed by the UK and France were the highest contributors to global malariapublications, although the influence of the USAhas decreased in recent years. African scientistsand research institutes make a major contributionto the eld of malaria research, participating in17.2 per cent of the world publications output.This gure is particularly striking when com-pared with the very low overall African biomed-ical research output (1.2 per cent of world total). Analysis of author addresses allowed identi- cation of the highest publishing countries andinstitutes in Africa. Nine countries producedmore than 25 publications in 1995-97, whileseven research centres published more than 20papers. The most active malaria research centreswere based in East and West Africa, but very lit-tle research activity was found in Central andSouthern Africa, apart from South Africa. The distribution of active research centres across Africa may reflect differences in malariaendemicity and transmission intensity, withfewer resources being committed to malariaresearch in areas of lower transmission.However, investment by external funding organ-izations, national government commitment toscience and education, and political stability arealso likely to be major factors influencing levelsof research activity. South Africa, Nigeria andKenya train the highest absolute numbers of stu-dents at universities and polytechnics of all theAfrican countries (for which data are available),and also rank in the top ve for the numbers oftertiary students per 10 000 population (1991gures, UNESCO, 1998). These gures indi-cate that educational base is probably an impor-tant factor contributing to the observed researchstrengths in these countries. Conversely, verylow numbers of students from Malawi andTanzania are trained at university level suggest-ing other factors are likely to be important inbuilding successful research programmes inthese countries. Analysis of funding acknowledgements on publications clearly demonstrates the majorinput from external funders in supportingresearch at the top publishing research centres.Many funders focus their support on speciccentres over a long time period: for example the UK Medical Research Council has supportedthe MRC Laboratories in The Gambia for over50 years, the Wellcome T rust supports pro-grammes in collaboration with KEMRI inNairobi and Kili, IRD supports institutes inSenegal and Cameroon, and the Swiss T ropicalInstitute has provided long-term support for theNational Institute for Medical Research inIfakara, Tanzania. This sustained funding fromexternal sources undoubtedly has an importantimpact on the productivity of research pro-grammes, but country-specic factors such asexisting commitment to research and politicalstability are important criteria in the selection ofsites for investment of resources. Collaboration patterns African malaria publications have a very highlevel of international co-authorship. Links withresearchers in Europe are most common, whilecollaborations between African countries arerare. Collaborations tend to be polarized betweenspecic countries: for example there is little over-lap in the African countries collaborating withthe UK and with France. The low co-authorshipacross Africa is likely to be a reflection of poorcommunication links, language barriers and alack of funding mechanisms to support trans-African collaborations. International scientic partnerships between African researchers and colleagues international-ly play an important role in maximizing the pro-ductivity of global research and buildingresearch expertise in Africa. T ropical medicineresearch in general exhibits a high level of inter-national collaboration, probably reflecting theneed for strong links between basic research in'Northern' laboratories and applied clinical andfield studies in disease-endemic countries.Nevertheless, the particularly extensive interna-tional co-authorship observed for African malar-ia research publications also reflects a depend-ence on external funding sources and substantialinvolvement of external scientists in designingand executing research programmes in someAfrican institutes. The present study did not attempt to assess systematically the relative contributions ofAfrican nationals and expatriate scientists toAfrican publication outputs, for example throughcounting the proportion of papers with AfricanOutputs of malaria research 3Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 71rst authors. However, supercial inspection of author names conrmed that many Africanaddresses were associated with expatriate scien-tists. A recent study found that 28 per cent of theresident scientists working on malaria in Kenya in1998 were non-African nationals (Snow et al., 1998), while in the present study 15 per cent ofscientists surveyed in malaria research laboratoriesacross Africa were non-African (Chapter 4). Theproportion of expatriate scientists, however, variesconsiderably in different countries and institutes,and again this was evident from inspection ofauthor names on publications from a variety ofinstitutes. Nigeria and South Africa, particularlythe Universities of Ibadan and Witwatersrand,were notable in producing a large proportion ofpapers that did not involve any external collabora-tions or input from expatriate scientists. This highdegree of self-reliance is likely to be linked in partto the fact that South Africa and Nigeria not onlyhave the highest number of students trained totertiary level, but over 98 per cent of these aretrained at home. By comparison, Tanzania, Kenyaand Cameroon respectively train 42, 20 and 25per cent of tertiary students overseas (1985-92figures, UNESCO, 1998). Enforced isolation dur-ing apartheid is likely to be another contribtoryfactor to South Africa's lower collaboration rate. Funding sources Analysis of funding acknowledgements on publi-cations revealed that a broad range of organiza-tions support malaria research, with some beingmore prominent in the international set ofpapers and others featuring more strongly in theAfrican papers. The results were able to indicateimportant contributors to malaria research fund-ing, although they could not provide an accuratemeasure of the magnitude of nancial support. TDR followed by the Wellcome T rust were the two organizations most commonly cited assources of funding for both the internationaland African sets of papers. The percentage shareof TDR has, however, decreased since an earliersurvey of 1984, 1989 and 1994 papers, whilethe shares of the Wellcome T rust and theEuropean Commission have both increased.Some African government agencies featured inthe funding of malaria research, most notablythe Kenyan Medical Research Institute. Onlytwo commercial companies were identied assupporting malaria research in Africa. Research subelds Subeld analysis demonstrated that research inAfrica focuses primarily on clinical and eldstudies with practical applications in Africa.Outputs from basic science studies of the malari-al parasite were very low. Examination of thepublications of individual institutes across Africaprovided an important insight into the researchspecializations of these centres. The results, how-ever, reflect research carried out prior to 1997and as such are not necessarily an accurate viewof current studies. Impact of malaria research African publications had a lower potential cita-tion impact than the international set of papers.However, standard citation indices are measuresof the impact of research on the scientic com-munity and they are positively correlated withresearch that is more basic in nature. Africanmalaria research is therefore intrinsically disad-vantaged in this type of assessment due to itshighly clinical character. Alternative approachesare required to assess the impact of medicalresearch, particularly more applied and clinicalresearch, on health policy and practice, or onpopulation health status. The current study examined national malaria guidelines and policies for the treatment andcontrol of malaria from a sample of Africancountries to assess links between scienticresearch and policies. The usefulness of thisapproach was, however, limited by the lack of asystematic approach to citing scientic literaturein the documents examined. Nevertheless, sometentative conclusions can be drawn on the basisof the limited information obtained. Firstly, justover half of the references in guidelines were tostudies less than ve years old, indicating thatpolicies are being informed by recent research.Furthermore, in-country research, often record-ed in grey literature, was most frequentlyreferred to, and references to international stud-ies in peer-reviewed journals were less promi-nent. The influence of local research on healthpolicies was also observed in a study of 15British clinical guidelines, where 33 per cent ofthe cited papers were published by UK authors,over three times the British share of internation-al biomedicine publications (Grant, 1999).However, 96 per cent of papers cited in bibli-ographies in the UK clinical guidelines wereOutputs of malaria research 372 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africafrom research journals, contrasting with the situ- ation in Africa where references to grey literaturewere more common. The studies referenced inAfrican guidelines tended to be clinical innature, with few references to basic science, andthis was also the case for the UK clinical guide-lines. WHO documents constituted 10 per centof the references in African guidelines and poli-cies, indicating the importance of WHO as asource of high-quality and readily available tech-nical material. The observed signicant role of local and clinical research in determining health policyformulation in Africa and elsewhere is an argu-ment that might favour investment in the localresearch base in individual countries, and main-tenance of strong clinical science research inorder to achieve a direct impact on health. The development of health policies and guide- lines is a complex process requiring the involve-ment of many different individuals and organiza-tions. A range of factors will therefore influencethe choice of information sources used in policyformulation. The observed dependence on localand grey literature in Africa may in part reflect thelack of availability of international scientic liter-ature to policy makers. However, a more signi-cant factor may be the importance assigned tolocally relevant studies, and perhaps the difcultyin publishing this type of research in internationaljournals. A substantial amount of scientic mate-rial is contained in local conference and meetingreports, non-governmental organization (NGO)survey material and ministry of health reportswhich are not recorded in any major databases,and are therefore not easily accessible to theworldwide scientic community. These sourcesare often not subject to peer review, but neverthe-less comprise a signicant body of knowledge,which is likely to be important in the develop-ment of local policies. The infrequent use of peer-reviewed litera- ture in policy formulation in African healthguidelines may also reflect a lack of a strongresearch culture in the circles responsible for pol-icy development, and a broader need for moreopen dialogue between research and controlcommunities. Early involvement of ministries ofhealth in research programmes can informresearch design and objectives, and is more likelyto lead to prompt and efcient incorporation ofresults into policy. Greater access of ministries ofhealth to internationally published research results would facilitate the process by whichresearch results influence practice. The use ofnon-peer-reviewed literature in policy formula-tion raises potential concerns regarding the lackof a mechanism to assure the quality of theresearch results. With the limited availability of resources for support of scientic research activities there is anincreasing need to measure the productivity ofscientists and the impact of their research.Standard bibliometric citation techniques aremore suited to measuring the impact of basicresearch in advancing scientic knowledge andare less appropriate for assessment of the impactof more clinical and applied research. Despitethis, there is a dependence of funding organiza-tions on high-prole publications for evaluatingresearch productivity in all elds. This approachwill tend to favour basic scientists in competi-tion for funds and potentially discourageresearchers from working in more appliedresearch areas, even though these areas are essen-tial to achieve an ultimate impact on health.Alternative methodologies are therefore requiredthat can provide a rational basis for investmentin research that has the potential to influenceevidence-based medicine and approaches to dis-ease control. Assessment of the degree of incorporation of scientic research into national health policiesand guidelines could potentially provide an effec-tive and important method of evaluating researchimpact on healthcare and disease control prac-tices. However, the format of national guidelinesmust include detailed bibliographies for accurateanalysis of the information guiding policies. Outputs of malaria research 3Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 734 4.1 METHODS A questionnaire was designed for the MIM sur- vey concerning research capacity in Africanmalaria research centres. In developing the ques-tionnaire, two pre-existing sources of informa-tion were taken into account: the 1997 Directory of the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network (AMVTN), 1which presents information on 30 malaria researchinstitutions from 20 African countries; the 'Inventory of Resources and Activities', produced for the International Conferenceon Malaria in Africa, held in Dakar, Senegal,1997, 2which presents summary information on 41 research groups in Africa. The MIM survey aimed to build upon and extend these two reports, rather than to dupli-cate them. Some elements of the AMVTNDirectory were incorporated into the MIM sur-vey to increase coverage of data. In addition,some analyses were not restricted to MIM surveyresults, but were based on data from the two pre-existing reports. The questionnaire comprised two sections (Annex 8). The director of the research programmewas asked to complete section A of the question-naire, and to distribute section B to all membersof staff educated to at least rst-degree level. Section A requested summary information on the research group: the number of researchers in the group; the proportion of time spent on malaria research; the research expertise within the group, including the number and qualications ofindividuals trained in different disciplines; the research grants held by the group during 1993-98. Section B sought information on the career paths of individual researchers and the opinionsof these researchers on effective approaches todevelop research capacity in Africa. Details wererequested from researchers on: current employment position, including sources of support for salary and research; all scientic training undertaken, including location and source of funding; difculties experienced during their research careers and potential solutions to identieddifculties; optimal mechanisms to build research capacity. Malaria research laboratories in Africa were identied from the AMVTN and Dakar directo-ries, analysis of malaria publications (Chapter3), and lists of African delegates at recent malariaconferences. Questionnaires were sent by post,fax and e-mail, depending on the availablemodes of communication, to 52 senior scientistsleading malaria research programmes at 45 insti-tutions in Africa. Questionnaires were sent inEnglish or French according to the predominantlanguage of the research programme.In the previous chapter, analysis of publications outputs provided a powerful and relatively straightforward method to characterize a range of different aspects ofmalaria research activity in Africa. This approach, however, is necessarily retrospectiveas it generally reflects research carried out in the few years prior to the publicationdate. It also cannot provide more detailed insight into the human resources andinfrastructure in African research centres. This chapter therefore takes an alternativeapproach, a questionnaire-based survey, to obtain information directly from malariaresearch groups currently active in Africa. The survey gathered information onongoing and past research projects, the expertise and training paths of African malariaresearchers, eld and laboratory facilities and sources of funding. It also provided anopportunity for African scientists to express their opinions and experiences ondifculties in pursuing a career in science and on potential solutions to buildingsustainable research activity in Africa. The bibliometric analysis and the survey ofresearch centres are complementary approaches, which together provide a detailedpicture of the current status of malaria research capacity in Africa.

The analysis of researchexpertise used data collected from the MIM sur-vey combined with data from the AMVTNdirectory; the analysis of laboratory facilities wasbased on data from the AMVTN and Dakardirectories; while the analysis of the epidemio-logical conditions at eld research sites used datafrom the AMVTN Directory. Contact details for malaria research groups are shown in Annex 12. 4.2.1 Overview of research groups Survey respondents More than three-quarters of the research pro- gramme leaders contacted participated in theMIM survey. The respondents comprised 48research groups based at 40 institutes in 19African countries, mainly in East and WestAfrica (Figure 4.1, Annex 9). Information onadditional groups was obtained from theAMVTN Directory, such that the total data setincluded 54 groups in 22 countries. The sample group included 13 of the 18 top publishing African malaria research centres iden-tied from the bibliometric analysis (Chapter 3).It should be noted that the concept of a 'researchgroup' or 'centre' was difcult to dene due tothe widely varying situations in different researchinstitutes and the added complication of collabo-rations or formalized links between institutes(e.g. a university and the Ministry of Health).Interpretation of results was standardized as far aspossible, but some variation is inevitable. In gen-eral, the returned questionnaires were completedin full by researchers, although there were somegaps and omissions. The questionnaire responses conrmed that malaria was the major topic of investigation: 34of the 48 groups devoted more than 50 per centof their time to malaria research.Laboratory facilities A summary of the equipment and facilities inAfrican laboratories was produced using datafrom the AMVTN and Dakar directories. Thisanalysis provides an overview of the facilitiespresent in African research institutions at thetime of survey (1996-97), although it cannotindicate the quality or functionality of equip-ment. Owing to variation in the response ratesto individual questions, the sample size for thisanalysis ranged from 35 to 39 research groupsand institutes. All research institutions thatresponded had access to telephone, fax and com-puting facilities, with 91 per cent reporting e-mail connections. Core laboratory facilities(freezers, centrifuges, incubators and micro-scopes) were present in over 90 per cent ofresearch laboratories, and around 80 per centwere equipped with ELISA readers and laminarflow hoods. More specialized facilities such as gelelectrophoresis equipment and PCR machineswere present in 76 per cent and 58 per cent oflaboratories respectively. All laboratories thatresponded had at least one four-wheel drivevehicle for eld work.Malaria research capacity in Africa 4Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 75Malaria research capacity in Africa 4 Figure 4.1 Malaria research groups participating in the MIM survey or included in the AMVTN directory.

The results are summarized inTable 4.1. Data were available for 29 centres(which covered 14 of the top 18 publishing cen-tres identied in Chapter 3), and encompassed32 different eld study areas. The sites cover abroad spectrum of malaria endemicities and vec-tor systems. Plasmodium falciparum is the princi- pal human parasite at all sites although varyinglevels of other parasites were also reported. Forexample, P . vivax is prominent in Ethiopia. Research funding Research funding was investigated by analysis of two types of data collected from the question-naire: research grants held by programme direc-tors during 1993-98 (Section A), and fundingacknowledgements for current research supportlisted by individual respondents (Section B).Summaries of both sets of data are presented inTable 4.2. The data provide an indication of thelevel of support from different funding organiza-tions for malaria research in Africa, althoughseveral points should be noted: The analysis of research grants does not pro- vide information on the magnitude of thevarious awards, which may vary considerably.For example, a single grant to provide majorsupport for a research institute would not beadequately represented when compared to alarge number of smaller awards to a variety ofinstitutes. Although the coverage of laboratories across Africa was generally high, gaps in data mayhave led to under-representation of somefunding organizations, particularly if fundsare directed to a specic centre that did notparticipate in the survey.A total of 284 grants were reported by the directors of 46 research groups in the responsesto Section A of the questionnaire, and 225researchers (African and non-African) provideddetails of their research funding in Section B.The research topics listed on awards were consis-tent with the malaria publications output fromAfrica (Chapter 3), with the majority of grantssupporting studies in clinical medicine, epi-demiology, intervention trials and health servic-es research. Sixteen per cent of awards supportedresearch on subjects other than malaria. The sources of support for African malaria research were many and diverse (Table 4.2,Annex 10). The majority of research fundingcame from organizations based outside Africa,particularly from European sources, with only 9per cent of research grants and 21 per cent ofindividual funding acknowledgements listing anAfrican governmental or other local source.Nevertheless, local funding was still the mostfrequently acknowledged single category of sup-port for individual researchers. In terms ofresearch grants, TDR emerged as the most fre-quently acknowledged funder, accounting for 20per cent of all grants. A third of awards overallwere from a WHO programme. Commercialcompanies made a relatively low, but signicantcombined contribution, accounting for 6 percent of research grants. Although the numbers ofgrants and funding acknowledgements cannotgive an accurate measure of the relative levels ofinvestment by different organizations, the resultsclearly identify those organizations makingmajor contributions towards supporting themalaria research base in Africa.

One-third ofawards involved a research collaboration, withEuropean countries being the most frequentcollaborators (Table 4.3). Collaborations acrossAfrica accounted for 16 per cent of the total.Research expertise Overview data of research groups completed inSection A of the MIM questionnaire wereanalysed together with AMVTN data to assessthe number of individuals trained to differentdegree levels in particular disciplines (Figure4.2). In total, 752 individuals qualied to atleast rst-degree level were identied as beingactively involved in research programmes in thegroups surveyed (AMVTN and MIM survey):Malaria research capacity in Africa 4 Table 4.2 Sources of funding for African malaria research laboratories.

About a third ofresearch groups were led by overseas scientists.The majority of research groups appeared to be multidisciplinary, with expertise in a range ofdifferent research skills. The broad research areasof parasitology and public health were moststrongly represented, with more than 130 trainedpersonnel in each category.

This number is lessthan half the number of researchers reported bygroup leaders to be engaged in research in thecentres surveyed (see Figure 4.2). Hence, thecoverage in this survey was not comprehensive.In certain cases, individuals were unable to com-plete questionnaires as they were undergoingtraining outside their home institute. Neverthe-less the data provide some important insightsinto existing research capability and the trainingpaths of scientists in African research centres. Researchers at all stages of career progression were represented in the sample of respondents,with postdoctoral researchers and PhD studentsconstituting the largest group of Africanresearchers: 37 per cent in total (Table 4.4). Alarge proportion of respondents held more than one higher degree for example 84 per cent ofpostdoctoral researchers also held a Master'sdegree, and 44 per cent of clinicians held addi-tional PhD, MD or Master's qualications. Current position Sixty-four per cent of African survey respondentsheld a permanent position of employment.Researchers employed on temporary contractswere predominantly junior scientists. Salary pro-vision was mainly from within Africa: 68 percent of African researchers received a salary fromthe national government or other local source.Salary provision from external sources tended tocome from organizations providing substantialsupport to specic research centres in Africa,namely Institut de Recherche pour leD\u00e9veloppement (IRD), the Wellcome T rust,Institut Pasteur, the US Centers for DiseaseControl and the UK Medical Research Council(Figure 4.3). T raining paths of African researchers The majority of African scientists (90 per cent)completed their Bachelor's degree in Africa, with52 per cent funded by national governments, 29per cent self-nanced and 3 per cent funded byan organization based outside Africa. Manymore researchers (54 per cent in total) complet-ed postgraduate training outside their homecountry (Figure 4.4): 28 per cent in Europe, 11Malaria research capacity in Africa 4 Table 4.4 Survey respondents according to nationality and highest qualification obtained.

However, varia-tions in patterns of training were evident for dif-ferent countries. For example, more than 80 percent of respondents in Nigeria and South Africaconducted postgraduate training in the homecountry. Similarly, a high proportion of respon-dents in Cameroon and Senegal conducted train- ing in Africa (in the home country or anotherAfrican country). In contrast, the majority ofTanzanian respondents completed postgraduatetraining outside the home country, mainly inEurope or in another African country. These dif-ferences may reflect the educational facilitiespresent in each country, and/or established linkswith researchers or institutes outside Africa.

African governmentalsources were still the highest single contributorto postgraduate training, accounting for 23 percent of funding acknowledgements in total(Table 4.5). TDR was the second most frequent-ly acknowledged funder, while IRD and theFrench Ministry of Cooperation were alsoprominent supporters of postgraduate studies inthe sample analysed. However, it was evidentthat there were many diverse funding organiza-tions that contributed to research capacity build-ing in Africa (Annex 11). It was also observedthat a high proportion of African scientists fund-ed their own studies at all levels of training.4.2.3 Training needs and solutions: an African perspective A total of 244 researchers (African and non- African) completed the opinion survey inSection B of the questionnaire. The responsesrepresent the personal views of a diverse group ofmalaria researchers in Africa on research capacitystrengthening. The following section presentsthe questions posed to researchers and theresponses received. Please identify any specic difculties that you may have experienced in developing and maintaining aresearch career in tropical medicine. How mightthese difculties be overcome in the future?Not unexpectedly, the most frequent response tothis question was lack of funds. However,respondents identied the key areas that, in theiropinion, required greater nancial investment asfollows.Malaria research capacity in Africa 4 Table 4.5 Sources of funding for Master's and PhD training of African malaria researchers.

Overall,respondents wanted a general increase inresearch funding from both local and interna-tional sources, particularly schemes to enablejunior researchers to develop their careers inAfrica. T raining in grant application writing toenhance the competitiveness of Africanresearchers; reservation of a quota of awards forjunior researchers (without compromising stan-dards); and efforts to increase awareness amongthe research community about potential fundingsources were proposed as solutions to this problem. Laboratory facilities Poor laboratory facilities, together with the highcost of reagents and lack of efcient systems forobtaining reagents were cited as problems by 26per cent of respondents. The general view heldwas that long-term and large-scale investment bynational governments and international fundingorganizations is needed to improve infrastruc-ture, as the short-term nature of science fundingfails to address this problem. Respondents alsosuggested provision within research grants forequipment, and the creation of funding schemesto support upgrading of facilities. Establishmentof distribution networks in Africa for laboratoryreagents, equipment spares and repair facilitieswas proposed by respondents as a practical solu-tion to counteract the costs and delays associatedwith the purchase of reagents and maintenanceof laboratory equipment. Communications Poor telecommunications, computing andlibrary facilities were viewed as an obstacle to thedevelopment of viable research partnershipswithin Africa and internationally by 18 per centof respondents. Respondents proposed long-term commitment and concerted action by gov-ernments and international funding agencies toimprove telecommunications. To address theimmediate problem, respondents proposedstrengthening of existing facilities in order toestablish a network of laboratories, to whichsatellite groups might link up in future. It wasrecognized that the increasing availability ofjournals over the Internet might circumvent the need for a well-stocked library, but would inturn require improvements in computing andtelecommunication facilities. Respondents alsosuggested the introduction of a reduced journalsubscription rate for developing countries. Salary provision and career development Poor salary and limited career developmentopportunities were cited as difculties by 17 percent of respondents, who considered that thesefactors contributed to the exodus of researchersfrom Africa. Respondents recommended thatnational governments increase salaries and takeaction to standardize pay and working condi-tions to enable researchers to focus full-time onresearch. Respondents observed that a lack oflocal employment opportunities deters juniorresearchers from pursuing their career in Africafollowing completion of training abroad andthat researchers without a local position are usu-ally ineligible to apply for international sourcesof research funds. To overcome this difculty,respondents proposed that African institutes cre-ate honorary positions for researchers and thatresearch grants from international organizationsshould include full salary costs, or at least a sup-plement to the local salary. Respondents also highlighted the difculties encountered by senior researchers, such as aninability to keep up to date with scienticadvances due to lack of on going training; inexpe-rience in running a research programme, particu-larly managing staff and budgets; lack of technicalsupport; and scientic isolation in Africa. To tackle these problems, respondents recommendedprovision within research grants for trainingattachments; management and nancial training;funds to support technical staff; and funds toattend meetings and conferences. Other difculties (< 10 per cent of respondents) In addition to the main issues outlined above, a number of other difculties were identied inthe questionnaire responses. Poor participation by the local population in studies and trials . Respondents felt that action should be taken by governments andresearchers to raise public awareness aboutresearch and its potential benets to thecommunity.Malaria research capacity in Africa 484 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaLack of government cooperation and support for research. Respondents reported a general lack of government support, and highlightedthe failure of governments to make use ofresearch ndings, and government bureau-cracy that hinders the process of obtainingtravel visas and the transport of researchmaterials as particular problems.Respondents recommended greater dialoguebetween scientists and government ofcials. Inadequate resources for conducting eld trials. Investigators conducting eld studies in remote areas reported problems due topoor road conditions and a lack of suitablevehicles. Respondents proposed that researchawards should include provision for purchaseof vehicles and maintenance costs, wherenecessary. Lack of trained technical support staff. This problem was deemed to put a considerableburden on the principal investigator, who hasto contend with the demands of a researchcareer, teaching or hospital commitments,and all the other activities connected withrunning a laboratory. It was also observedthat training of junior and technical staffwould boost staff morale. Funds to attend meetings and conferences. Researchers reported difculties in obtainingfunds to attend meetings and conferences.They recommended provision withinresearch grants for travel to meetings andconferences to enable researchers to presentresults and establish contacts and collabora-tions, as well as the establishment ofnetworks of researchers locally and interna-tionally to ensure that scientists have oppor-tunities to discuss research ndings. French-English language barrier. Researchers from French-speaking African countriescited the French-English language barrier as a difculty in communicating researchresults and establishing collaborations.What types of schemes (e.g. collaborative, training, funding etc.) do you consider, are or would be, par-ticularly benecial in developing research capacityin African universities, research institutions andministries of health? Please give details of level oftraining (MSc, PhD etc.), mechanism, location etc. T raining The overall availability of training opportunitiesand nancial support for training was of concernto most respondents, and 77 per cent of respon-dents highlighted a need for additional opportu-nities at Master's and PhD level. Respondentsidentied the following as elements of a success-ful training scheme: training as a component of a local research project to ensure relevance to the particularhealth problems of a country; exposure of students to the high-quality research environment in external centres of excellence; application in Africa of techniques learnt abroad to ensure technology transfer. In general, respondents considered that all available mechanisms for training should be uti-lized, whether in Africa or in developed coun-tries, although there was some variation in thepreferred location of training. For example, pro-ponents of local training considered that train-ing abroad was ineffective as researchers may notreturn home following training; \"techniqueslearnt abroad fail to be applied in Africa due todifferences in the conditions of the differentenvironments (i.e. laboratories)\"; and the costsof training abroad are prohibitively expensive.Furthermore, respondents observed that oppor-tunities for training in Africa are under-utilizeddue to lack of funds, as international fundingorganizations tend to support training in devel-oped countries. Respondents proposed greaterinvestment in developing African centres ofexcellence as this would contribute to buildingsustainable research capacity and enable themajority of training to be conducted in Africa.Nevertheless, many respondents recognized theimportance of training links with developedcountries in building research expertise inAfrica. The 'sandwich' format of training wasconsidered a useful mechanism to allow \"stu-dents from Africa to undertake training in devel-oped countries and then return home to do theirMalaria research capacity in Africa 4Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 85project work. In this way they would obtain expertise from abroad and be able to use it tosolve problems on the ground.\" Although postgraduate training was identi- ed as a priority, all stages in the career develop-ment of scientists were considered to requireadditional attention. The career development ofpostdoctoral scientists was considered importantby respondents, who proposed provision withinresearch grants for training attachments, andregular training workshops on specialist skillsand topics to keep researchers up to date withscientic advances. Respondents also felt that\"training at junior and technical levels wouldimprove and motivate staff and help to createthe next scientic generation\". Similarly, inclu-sion of a stronger research component in under-graduate degrees would encourage a 'researchculture' in developing countries and contributeto research capacity strengthening. Collaborations Collaborations within Africa and with col-leagues internationally were cited by 55 per centof respondents as an important means ofstrengthening research capacity in Africa.Respondents envisaged the principal benets ofcollaborations to be: opportunities for training; coordination of research activities and the ability to participate in multidisciplinaryresearch projects conducted at different sites; sharing of knowledge and experiences, result- ing in technology transfer between researchinstitutions. The value of training provided by visiting overseas scientists was also recognized. Further-more, respondents wanted greater researchcooperation within Africa, citing the TDR Mul-tilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) awardsscheme as a model that should be extended toenable the development of research collabora-tions and networks in Africa. The need to promote greater interactions between researchers and ministries of health wasraised by respondents.4.3 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION The present study used a questionnaire-based approach to gather data on the current humanand infrastructural resources in African malariaresearch laboratories. Detailed information wasobtained on the career paths of Africanresearchers and on sources of funding forresearch and training. The opinions of Africanresearchers on difculties experienced andpotential routes to building effective researchcapacity in Africa were also obtained. Overall,the response rate to the survey was high (>80 percent), particularly in view of the communicationdifculties usually associated with Africa.Researchers in 19 countries, the majority basedin East and West Africa, took part in the surveyand the distribution of questionnaires in Englishand French was successful in ensuring participa-tion from researchers in both Anglophone andFrancophone Africa. However, ve of the 18highest publishing research centres (see Chapter3) did not respond to the survey, thus illustrat-ing the difculty in obtaining complete coverageusing a survey approach. Data from the MIMsurvey were supplemented with informationfrom the AMVTN Directory such that the totaldata set encompassed 54 groups in 22 countriesacross Africa. There is a lack of reliable national data on personnel in science and technology, and henceof meaningful regional gures for humanresources in sub-Saharan Africa. Available infor-mation suggests that the numbers of trainedAfrican scientists are low. Figures from theObservatoire des Sciences et Techniques (Paris)(UNESCO, 1996) indicate that there are in theregion of 0.4 scientists per 1000 population inAfrica, compared with 1.8 and 2.7 for theEuropean Union and the USA respectively.However, other data suggest a very much greaterdisparity in human resources for scienticresearch between Africa and the established mar-ket economies. The current MIM survey hasgathered important data on the training andexpertise of African scientists engaged in onefocused area of biomedical research: malariaresearch. It should be noted, however, that thiseld probably represents one of the strongestareas of biomedical research in Africa: 21 percent of global 'tropical medicine' publicationsMalaria research capacity in Africa 486 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africaare devoted to malaria research and 17.2 per cent of these malaria publications involveAfrican scientists (Chapter 3). Research expertise: qualications Overall, the survey results are encouraging asthey indicate that a core of trained Africanmalaria researchers has been established. Datafrom 54 research groups identied 752 re-searchers engaged in malaria research who weretrained to at least rst-degree level. A large pro-portion of these researchers had higher qualica-tions: personnel trained to Master's level weremost numerous, although postdoctoral and clin-ical scientists were also well represented. Nearlyhalf of clinical scientists held higher degrees.There is a culture within Africa to progressthrough Master's training before proceeding to aPhD and the majority of postdoctoralresearchers held Master's degrees. However, the 192 postdoctoral scientists and 165 clinical scientists identied were dispersedacross 22 African countries so that the numbersper country are generally small. In addition,many of the most productive research centresinvolved substantial input from senior expatriatescientists. The results therefore indicate a strongneed for additional African scientic leaderswho are able to conduct innovative and inde-pendent research. To put the numbers of trained malaria researchers into context requires comparisonwith gures for the numbers of scientistsengaged in health research in Africa. Data in thisrespect are limited and subject to inaccuraciesand incompleteness. Figures for 1995 estimatethat researchers in national research centres in38 African countries totalled 13 174, with aquarter of these centres focusing on health andnutrition, basic sciences or social and human sci-ences (Gerring, 1995). These gures do notencompass all research institutes or countries,but they nevertheless support bibliometrics dataindicating that malaria research is a strong com-ponent of African biomedical research. Hence, itis likely that the trained malaria scientists identi-ed in this survey represent one of the strongestsets of health researchers in Africa. Expertise inmost other diseases prevalent in Africa willalmost certainly be considerably less.Research expertise: scientic disciplines The ongoing research programmes reported byAfrican research groups in the current surveylargely reflected the research strengths identiedby analysis of malaria publications (Chapter 3),with a focus on clinical and eld studies. Thismore applied focus was also reflected in the spe-cializations of trained personnel in the samplegroup. However, expertise in the more basic sci-ence categories also showed a notable presence. Inview of the low publication outputs from Africain basic studies of Plasmodium (1995-97, Chapter 3), the present results suggest thatAfrican researchers are increasingly training inbasic laboratory disciplines. The majority ofresearch centres incorporated expertise in multi-ple research disciplines, rather than focusing onone approach, and this was also noted previouslyin publication outputs from individual centres. Three disciplines of biostatistics, sociology and economics were less well represented, withfewer than 40 individuals in total identied foreach category. This may reflect the tendency forresearchers in these areas to be associated withinstitutions other than those surveyed (e.g. spe-cic social science or economics institutes)and/or to work on a range of health problemsrather than focusing only on malaria. However,consensus opinions from researchers expressedduring MIM meetings and the relatively lowpublication outputs in these areas (Chapter 3)suggest that there is indeed a current lack ofexpertise in these areas. In view of the impor-tance of biostatistics, sociology and economicsin studies to optimize the delivery of healthcareand disease control interventions, these disci-plines may require specic encouragement andstrengthening through targeted schemes. Funding sources Survey data showed that a diverse set of funderscontributes towards sustaining malaria researchactivity in Africa. These included governmental,non-governmental and commercial sources, par-ticularly from Europe. Funds from outsideAfrica predominated both for research grants(88 per cent of acknowledgements) and for post-graduate studies (54 per cent). Nevertheless,African governmental and local sources account-ed for just over half of funding acknowledge-ments for rst degrees and nearly a quarter ofPhD and Master's degrees. Local governmentsMalaria research capacity in Africa 4Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 87also contribute to sustaining research capacity through the provision of salaries for researchers(68 per cent of acknowledgements) and coresupport to institutions. Government commit-ments to scientic research vary considerablybetween African countries, although currentsurvey data were too limited to establish anyclear patterns in this respect. The observed funding patterns reflect esti- mates of expenditures on research and develop-ment in sub-Saharan Africa, which are amongstthe lowest in the world relative to gross domesticproduct and in absolute terms (UNESCO,1998). In addition, the current results are con-sistent with previous studies which estimatedthat up to 70 per cent of funds for research insome low- and middle-income countries comesfrom external sources (UNESCO, 1998). The survey identied the agencies that sup- port the African research base, although datacould not provide an accurate measure of rela-tive levels of investment. The World HealthOrganization and in particular the UNDP/WHO/World Bank Special Programme forResearch and T raining in T ropical Diseases(TDR), 3received the highest number of acknowledgements both for research pro-grammes and for Master's and PhD training.French sources (IRD and the Ministry ofCooperation), the European Commission andScandinavian sources (DANIDA and Sida/SAREC) were other notable contributors topostgraduate training. Figures obtained directlyfrom French agencies (Chapter 2) were incom-plete, but the results of the survey of laboratoriesdemonstrate the signicant training contribu-tion of these agencies. Although 14 commercialcompanies were identied as providing researchgrants, their aggregate contribution accountedfor only 6 per cent of the total. TDR's particular impact in this survey is a reflection of the success of its training schemes,but also in part reflects its major focus on malar-ia and on least developed countries (Chapter 2).Other substantial supporters of training may notbe so visible in this survey due to their particularresearch subject or geographical remits. Alterna-tively, a lower-than-expected prole in this sur-vey, may suggest a lack of success in contributingtowards a sustainable pool of researchers inAfrica. Assessment of individual schemes isrequired to ascertain the true situation.Despite the range of varied organizations contributing towards research and training inAfrica, over three-quarters of survey respondentsexpressed the view that there were too fewopportunities for Master's and PhD level train-ing. Researchers also felt that opportunities forpostdoctoral scientists to obtain independentresearch grants were very limited. These perspec-tives are generally supported by the results of thereview of training opportunities presented inChapter 2. Infrastructure The survey results indicate that the majority ofAfrican malaria research institutions (>90 percent) are equipped with core facilities, includingfreezers, centrifuges, incubators and micro-scopes. In addition, over half of the institutionshave access to PCR equipment, suggesting thatmolecular biology techniques are increasinglybecoming standard in African laboratories.However, the views expressed in the opinion sur-vey suggest that current facilities are often inade-quate to maintain competitive research pro-grammes: a quarter of respondents highlightedpoor infrastructure and laboratory facilities asmajor obstacles to developing a research careerin Africa. Respondents considered that greaterand long-term nancial investment was essentialto tackle this problem. Although 90 per cent oflaboratories reported e-mail connections, manysurvey respondents specied poor telecommuni-cations, computing and library facilities asobstacles to the development of productiveinternational collaborations. The opportunitiesoffered by new electronic communication facili-ties for dramatically reducing the isolation ofAfrican scientists have been recognized by MIMand are being actively pursued. Field research sites surveyed encompass a range of malaria endemicities and malaria mos-quito vector systems. These sites provide anopportunity for coordinated, multi-centre inter-vention studies, such as vaccine trials or clinicalstudies, under different transmission intensityconditions. Development of any further eldmalaria research sites should take into considera-tion the balance of expertise and epidemiologi-cal characteristics at existing sites. The majority of African scientists surveyed receive their salaries from local sources, but theinadequacy of these salaries was highlighted inMalaria research capacity in Africa 4 3The TDR programme is supported by voluntarycontributions fromgovernments, internationalorganizations, charities, bodies andthe three co-sponsors of HealthOrganization (WHO), theWorld Bank and the UnitedNations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP).88 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africathe opinion survey as a major problem that deterred junior scientists from pursuing researchcareers in Africa. The provision of enhancedsalaries, by local or external funders, would pro-vide an incentive to encourage junior researchersto remain in their home countries, and wouldalso allow African researchers to focus on theirresearch without the necessity of seeking addi-tional employment to raise their income to anacceptable level. Salary supplements are in factprovided by a number of organizations, includ-ing MIM/TDR awards, and the survey resultswould support this practice being extendedacross other organizations. T raining mechanisms and collaborative partnerships Most African students (90 per cent) completed their rst degrees within Africa and this is con-sistent with the lack of opportunities forBachelor's training offered by internationalorganizations (Chapter 2). A high proportion(43 per cent) of African scientists carried outtheir postgraduate training wholly or partlyoverseas, reflecting a dependence on externalfunding and the training mechanisms offered bythese funders (Chapter 2). This was of concernto respondents in the opinion survey who con-sidered that greater investment in African train-ing centres was necessary to develop sustainableresearch capacity. Marked variation wasobserved in the proportion of researchers trainedoverseas from different countries. For example, ahigh proportion of researchers in Nigeria andSouth Africa completed their postgraduate stud-ies in Africa, a factor that is likely to be impor-tant in the observed lower international co-authorship in publications for these countries(Chapter 3). However, African scientists also recognized the critical importance of international partner-ships to facilitate effective training of scientists,and sharing of expertise and resources. The exis-tence of mechanisms to support internationalcollaborations was therefore considered a highpriority. T raining mechanisms that are largelybased in the trainee's home country, but allowoverseas training attachments were favoured.This approach combines the benets of bothsites, ensuring that the training is relevant to thehealth problems, facilities and available tech-nologies in the home country, but allowingexposure to leading overseas laboratories. African scientists further suggested the value of continuing training at postdoctoral level, toallow updating of skills and to maintain linkswith collaborating laboratories. Improved mech-anisms to raise awareness of existing research andtraining opportunities, and workshops in grantapplication writing skills were also called for. Stated collaborations on research grants showed that African researchers collaborateextensively, particularly with researchers inEurope. This was consistent with the results ofbibliometric analysis, although the overall extentof collaborations on research grants was lowerthan on publications (Chapter 3). This lower col-laboration rate may be due to the omission ofawards held by scientists outside Africa in thesurvey responses, but it may also indicate that theresults of African research activities without anexternal collaborator are published less frequent-ly in international journals recorded in SCI. Collaborations across Africa were mainly supported by TDR/MIM awards or grants fromthe European Commission INCO-DC pro-gramme. A slightly higher level of collaborationacross Africa was observed from research grants,as compared with publications analysis, but thenewly introduced TDR/MIM awards would nothave had an impact in the publication yearsanalysed (1995-97). Malaria research capacity in Africa 4Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 895 5.1 INTRODUCTION Data collected by UNESCO (1996) clearly illustrate the deep divide between establishedmarket economies and developing-countryregions in terms of their research capacity andproductivity: four-fths of the world's scientistsare estimated to reside in Western industrializednations, Japan and to a lesser extent other largeAsian countries. Furthermore, in 1994, develop-ing-country regions together contributed only6.5 per cent of the world's scientic publications(OST, 1997). Indigenous research expertise in developing regions is essential for an ultimate impact onhealth: locally relevant studies are needed to linkinternational research into a national frameworkof disease epidemiology, health services and pop-ulation-specic clinical, behavioural and socialdata. However, resource constraints demandthat support for science in developing countriesis focused effectively according to policies basedon sound analytical data. The present studyobtained information on research trainingopportunities across developing-country regions,and on a number of indicators of malaria researchcapacity in Africa. Data were derived from ques-tionnaire surveys of funding organizations and ofmalaria research laboratories in Africa, and alsofrom analyses of malaria publications. The conclusions and key issues are summa- rized here together with recommendations forconsideration by the Multilateral Initiative onMalaria, by funding organizations and govern-ments in developed and developing regions, andby other coordinating bodies such as the RollBack Malaria Project of the World HealthOrganization.5.2 POLICY ISSUES International investment and coordination Scientic research in many developing countriesis heavily dependent on foreign investment: thesurvey of African malaria research laboratories inthe present study found that 88 per cent ofresearch grants and 68 per cent of PhD fundingacknowledgements were to external sources.These gures indicate the current degree ofinfluence exerted by the policies of foreigninvestors on research training in Africa, andpotentially in other developing regions. How-ever, any capacity-building efforts are ultimatelydependent upon local commitment and theestablishment of a culture in which science haslegitimacy and status. Funding organizations internationally and governments of developing countries must worktogether to build sustainable and locally relevantresearch expertise and facilities. This may requirethe establishment of formalized, longer-termpartnership arrangements. The results of the survey of funding organiza- tions indicate that research training offered byhigher-income countries to developing regions isgenerally fragmented and does not represent acoherent international approach to generatingscientists to meet health research priorities. Greater efforts are required to coordinate ration- al allocation of resources to training activitiesinternationally and to monitor the effectiveness oftraining programmes. Such a coordination rolemight be played by a body that involves partner-ships between funding organizations internation-ally, such as the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria(MIM). This study has combined a variety of approaches to obtain information on the training opportunities in health and biomedical research in developing regions, and on thestatus of malaria research capability in Africa. The current chapter aims to drawtogether the information derived from these different sources and to set out some keyissues for consideration in developing strategies to enhance the research bases indeveloping regions and particularly to strengthen malaria research capacity in Africa. Overview and policy issues90 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaDespite the signicance of foreign investment in training scientists in developing countries, theoverall expenditure is low relative to trainingactivities in developed regions and represents a small percentage of the activities of some of the larger investors. A slight increase in theproportion of the budgets of larger research ordevelopment funders committed to training inlower-income countries could therefore have asubstantial overall impact. Science is now indisputably a global activity and the issue of retaining developing-country scien-tists in their home countries, so that their skillscan bring benet locally, must be addressed. Inan international market, incentives are requiredto encourage researchers to remain in their homeinstitutes: national research institutes must com-pete to retain scientists against overseas centres,as well as with the local private sector. This studyshowed that nearly 70 per cent of scientists inAfrican malaria research laboratories receivetheir salaries from local sources, but thesesalaries were often considered inadequate for areasonable standard of living. Governments of developing countries should give serious consideration to the potential largegains of investing in well-targeted research andproviding adequate salary structures to rewardproductive scientists. More external funders might also consider provision of salary supplements to scientists whocompete successfully for research awards. T raining mechanisms International scientic partnerships are an important mechanism for training. The currentstudy has shown that collaborative training linksfor developing countries are driven substantiallyby the format of schemes offered by high-income countries. Funding mechanisms tend tolink specic countries, with training often beingprovided in the donor country. Whilst countriesmust focus their resources in some way, the cur-rent situation does not permit optimal use of sci-entic training opportunities globally and dis-courages interactions between countries within aregion. For example, co-authorships on malariapublications clearly showed the lack of overlapin the African countries with which France andthe UK collaborate and the rarity of linkages between Anglophone and Francophone regionsof Africa. There is a need for a greater variety of funding formats to allow diversication of collaborationsand more efcient use of scientic strengthsirrespective of location. Mechanisms to support linkages and networks within developing regions are also required toenable sharing of resources and expertise, andexploitation of local and regional trainingopportunities. This problem has been recognizedby MIM and progress is being made inestablishing multi-centre studies within Africa.Additional mechanisms are, however, needed. Funding mechanisms that facilitate commun- ication and collaboration with scientists who havemigrated overseas will also bring benet to thehome research base. In view of the relatively weak research bases in many developing countries, training in high-income countries is still considered to be impor-tant in generating internationally competitivescientists. The survey of malaria research centresin Africa showed that half of the scientists inthese centres had undertaken their PhD trainingwholly or partially outside Africa, although therewas considerable variation in the extent of over-seas training in different African countries. A consequence of overseas training, however, is that developing-country scientists are oftenattracted away from their home countries tolocations where facilities and career prospects arepreferable. In the long-term, therefore, they maybe less likely to contribute to the home sciencebase. Moreover, overseas training is expensiveand may not be relevant or readily transferableto the home country. Thus, local and regionaltraining is likely to represent an importantapproach to building sustainable and relevantnational research expertise. The provision of training opportunities in developed countries should be maintained toallow exposure of scientists to internationallycompetitive laboratories. This might be in theform of shorter overseas training attachments,combined with local and regional training.Overview and policy issues 5Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 91Greater investment in developing countries is required to create 'centres of excellence' that canserve as local and regional training bases.Selection of appropriate centres for developmentwill be essential for efcient use of funds formaximal impact. These centres should be ofinternational scientic standing, and this willrequire focusing of resources to build top qualityfacilities and a critical mass of intellectualcapacity, preferably in multiple disciplines. Regional training is also potentially an impor- tant mechanism for building productive researchlinks between neighbouring countries. Mechanisms to allow input of teaching and research expertise from overseas scientists atundergraduate through to postdoctoral levels areimportant in contributing to high-quality train-ing in developing countries. Another approach to combining the benets of local and overseas training is for developing-country centres to register for training throughdistance learning schemes such as the 'OpenUniversity', leading to the award of an overseas degree. Analysis of the most productive malaria research centres in Africa, revealed that many of thesereceived sustained and high-level support fromexternal funders, thus illustrating the impor-tance of a stable foundation from which todevelop an effective research programme. Mostfunding organizations link training to majorresearch programmes that have received supportthrough a competitive, peer-reviewed process,an approach that associates training with topquality research studies. In addition, funds areconcentrated at specic sites to establish an envi-ronment where productive research programmesare more likely to flourish. An important difculty is that scientists in developing countries are frequently compelledto undertake major teaching and administrativeresponsibilities before they have had an opportu-nity to consolidate their postdoctoral researchtraining. Furthermore, absence of academic andministry of health staff for training, whether thisbe locally or overseas, often leaves home insti-tutes short-staffed and increases the burden onremaining staff.A commitment to research activities by local institutes, for example by ensuring that staff areable to devote adequate time to research activities,is essential for the development of productiveresearch programmes. The provision of research fellowships, which include salaries and research expenses, wouldenable scientists to focus primarily on theirresearch. Such relatively stable funding would alsoprovide a signicant incentive for them to pursuea career in research. Malaria research is a particular strength of sub- Saharan Africa and data obtained in the presentstudy have shown that a cadre of trained malariascientists has been established in Africanresearch institutes. However, about one-third ofidentied research groups were led by non-national scientists. There is a need to develop additional African sci- entic leaders, but in the interim, the input of com-mitted and able expatriate scientists into training oflocal scientists should be maximally exploited. The information obtained on the location, research specializations and primary sources offunding for malaria research centres should assistboth researchers and funders in making optimaluse of these centres for further development ofresearch capacity in Africa. Career progression opportunities Very little support from foreign investors is direct- ed at the Bachelor's degree level and the majorityof African scientists surveyed in the study com-pleted their rst degrees in their home countries. This observation underscores the responsibility of governments in developing countries to supporttertiary education in order to generate a supply ofgood-quality candidates for research training. Uni-versities in developing regions must also establishdegree curricula that reflect the scientic needs ofthe country and which begin to instil an apprecia-tion of the importance of scientic research. Survey of funding agencies and of African malaria research laboratories suggested that current avail-ability of awards for PhD and Master's training,from both local and international sources, is veryOverview and policy issues 592 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africarestricted. Only 684 PhD awards to scientists across the developing world were identied fromthe major funders in high-income countries, and65 per cent of African scientists surveyed indi-cated that their PhD funding was from an over-seas rather than a local government source. By comparison, the opportunities for PhD trainingper unit population in the UK are nearly 1000times greater than those in developing countries.Even after taking into account underestimates inthe survey gures and the more limited availabil-ity of graduates in developing countries, thenumbers of PhD awards appear low. The creation of more opportunities for PhD and Master's training is likely to be benecial ingenerating a core of scientic leaders for thefuture, although adequate support must also beprovided for research at the postdoctoral level. There is a large overall investment by high- income countries in training attachments, shortcourses and workshops. This type of training canfull an important role but it must be appropri-ately targeted and monitored for maximal effect. Further analysis of the nature of current train- ing attachments, short courses and workshopswould be valuable to assess the effectiveness ofcurrent activities. Only a small number of organizations provide opportunities for scientists in developing countriesto apply for independent research funds. Localsources of funding are extremely limited and for-eign investors tend to provide larger-scale supportto groups of researchers, often involving partner-ships with external scientists. While this approachcan use resources effectively to develop productiveresearch programmes, it is less effective in encour-aging individual innovation of local scientists. The wider availability of individual grants to postdoctoral scientists would provide importantcareer development incentives and may facilitatethe emergence of key scientic leaders. Fellow-ships might involve honorary academic positionsto ensure formalized association with localresearch institutes, and opportunities to inputinto teaching. Awards might also be linked tolarger research grants to ensure that trained indi-viduals are focused together.Research specializations Most countries in the developing world face immense economic and health problems, and itwould be inappropriate to advocate increasedexpenditure across all areas of research, or to aimto duplicate existing major strengths elsewherein the world. In view of the globalization of sci-ence, it is feasible to establish strategies that willallow developing countries to tap into the resultsof science internationally and build upon thesefor local benet. Thus, strategic research priori-ties for lower-income countries might focus onrelevant health problems or aim to exploitunique opportunities. Mechanisms, at national and international lev- els, are required to assess the overall distributionof training across different research areas andhence assist in mapping capacity development toresearch priorities. Progress is being made in establishing essential national health research priorities in developingcountries, and effective publicizing of these scien-tic strategies would enable external funders totarget research resources more effectively. Strengthening of research and control interac- tions would assist in ensuring that research agen-das generate data required to underpin treat-ment and control strategies, and facilitate rapiduptake of research results into policy and prac-tice. This might require research training experi-ence for public health personnel for example, orinvolvement of laboratory scientists in servicedelivery activities. African malaria research is currently strongly focused on clinical and eld studies, which canyield practical solutions to local problems andthese studies are often linked to basic researchongoing in Europe and the USA. Nevertheless,there is growing expertise and facilities withinAfrica in more fundamental disciplines, show-ing that many basic science techniques aretransferable to Africa where they can comple-ment ongoing clinical and eld studies. Basicscience is important for innovation and tech-nological breakthroughs and the ongoinggrowth in these disciplines in developing coun-tries should therefore be encouraged. However,initial targeting should preferably be towardsOverview and policy issues 5Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 93technologies that are more readily transferable, rather than those requiring major investmentin facilities. Results from the current study suggest that social sciences, health economics and biostatisticsare areas that lack expertise in Africa. In view ofthe importance of these disciplines in optimizingimplementation of health interventions andinforming policy development, they may requirespecic strengthening. The extent to which the subeld strengths and weaknesses observed for malaria research inAfrica can be extrapolated to other researchelds or developing regions is difcult to assess.However, broad publications outputs indicatethat fundamental biology is a weak eld acrosssub-Saharan Africa, in China and South-EastAsia, but is slightly stronger in India and CentralAsia and in Latin America. It is estimated thatonly 8 per cent of research and developmentexpenditure in Africa goes to basic sciences andengineering, as compared with 40 per cent forindustrialized countries (OST, 1997). Measuring progress Greater efforts to monitor the effectiveness ofcurrent research training schemes, at both indi-vidual and collective levels, are important toensure that resources are being used to best effect.Numbers of trained scientists and publicationoutputs are broad measures of human resourcesand research productivity. However, researchtraining and capacity-strengthening programmesmust be targeted so that they are appropriate tonational and regional needs, and assessmentsshould therefore also evaluate the type of expert-ise generated (disease and disciplinary specializa-tions) and the success of research in producingrelevant knowledge. More detailed monitoring ofindividual capacity-strengthening schemes canalso assess indicators such as numbers of grantssuccessfully obtained by trainees, numbers ofpresentations at conferences, and availability ofinfrastructure in research institutes. This report provides valuable baseline data by which to monitor the progress of capacity build-ing efforts in malaria research.Effective local and national systems are required to harness the results of scientic research forindigenous development. Early dialogue betweenexternal funders, researchers and local govern-ments will assist the effective translation ofresearch results into policy and practice.Clinical and applied research are essential toachieve an impact on health, and accurate meas-ures of the outcomes of these types of researchare needed to provide a rationale and justica-tion for investment of resources, by both localand foreign contributors. The examination of research cited in health policy documents is a potentially effective methodof assessing the influence of research in determin-ing clinical practice or disease control strategies.However, in order for this approach to be imple-mented effectively, policy documents from devel-oping countries must include full bibliographies. Local research, often recorded in non-peer- reviewed grey literature, appears to influencenational policies for malaria treatment and control. Greater effort to record grey literature in cen- tral, accessible databases, and/or more extensivepublication of locally relevant research in peer-reviewed journals would be benecial. The future There remains a major challenge to build research bases in developing countries that canhave a signicant impact on health. Fundingorganizations in developed and developingcountries must prioritize and coordinate theiractivities to use limited resources efciently intraining productive, independent scientists andestablishing competitive research facilities. Thisreview provides data on the background contextagainst which funding decisions must be madeand it is hoped that it will facilitate an evidence-based approach to capacity building. Partner-ships between scientists as well as between fund-ing organizations may be required to achievesignicant progress. While there are commonthemes that are applicable across developingregions, it is clear that there is considerablediversity between individual countries in termsof their educational bases, existing trainingactivities and research facilities. T raining strate-gies will therefore need to be responsive to coun-Overview and policy issues 594 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africatry-specic circumstances and opportunities. Despite the scale of the task ahead, there are positive signs for the future as lower-incomecountries increasingly recognize the importanceof scientic research. For example, countries inthe Latin American region have been reformingtheir science policies (see Macilwain, 1998), anda chain of regional centres of excellence has beenproposed to share resources and expertise. Chinais also an emerging success story, its research pro-ductivity having increased very signicantly overthe last decade under directed governmentalpolicies. Further major reforms have recentlybeen announced (Normile and Lei, 1999),including a threefold increase in salary for scien-tists, aimed at retaining scientists in China andencouraging those working overseas to return. There are also positive signs from Africa with an innovative proposal emerging from the WorldConference on Science in June 1999. This pro-posal, which was supported by ministers of sci-ence and education from Africa, was to create ascience fund for poor countries from the debtrelief agreed upon by G8 nations for the world'sleast-developed countries (Masood, 1999). 5.3 REFLECTIONS ON METHODOLOGIES This study combined a number of different methods to generate data relevant to interna-tional training opportunities for researchers indeveloping countries, and to malaria researchcapacity in Africa. These approaches provideddifferent perspectives on the same issue andoffered relative advantages and disadvantages. Anumber of points concerning the techniquesemployed in the study are set out below toinform future studies. Assessing funding inputs Information on funding inputs into malariaresearch and training was obtained in a numberof different ways: from data obtained directlyfrom funding organizations; from fundingacknowledgements on research publications andfrom direct survey of research centres in Africa.Survey approaches in general are time consum-ing and limited by the extent of coverage of thetarget population, as well as response rates.Conversely, analysis of publications has theadvantage of relative rapidity and can generally achieve systematic coverage of a eld. A majoradvantage of direct survey of funders is thatinformation can be obtained on actual expendi-ture, whereas numbers of funding acknowledge-ments on publications do not give an accuratemeasure of magnitude of funding. The survey oflaboratories was not effective in this particularstudy in obtaining information on levels offinancial support, probably due to condentialityconsiderations. The format of records kept by funding organizations is an important factor influencingthe success in obtaining relevant data, for exam-ple in a specic subject area. Organizations thatprovide block grants to other institutes or organ-izations, often do not have centralized records ofhow this expenditure has been allocated. In thissituation, the direct survey of malaria researchlaboratories was successful in identifying funderswhich make signicant contributions to post-graduate training, but which did not registerhighly in the funding survey due to incompletedata. The survey of African centres was also ableto provide an indication of the relative contribu-tions of local and foreign investors in supportingresearch and training. Analysing research outputs Bibliometrics is a convenient means of measur-ing research activity in a particular eld.However, databases must be selected accordingto the particular analysis being carried out. Forexample, MEDLINE has better coverage of clini-cal research and of non-English language jour-nals compared with the Science Citation Index(SCI), but does not include full details of authoraddresses, precluding its use in co-authorshipanalyses. A signicant disadvantage of commer-cially available databases is that they are biasedtowards research in industrialized countries, asthey do not have comprehensive coverage of localand non-English language journals in developingcountries or of other types of grey literature. Standard bibliometric citation techniques for measuring research impact and quality arerestricted in their application, since citationindices primarily reflect the influence of researchon the scientic community. Research of a moreclinical or applied nature is intrinsically disad-vantaged in this type of analysis as it receivesfewer citations than more basic research.Overview and policy issues 5Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in Africa 95Alternative approaches are required to assess the success of research in generating new diseaseinterventions or influencing disease treatment orcontrol. Examination of literature cited inmalaria treatment and control guidelines couldpotentially provide a valuable method to assesslinks between research and policy. However, inthe present study it was noted that nationalguidelines often did not include full referencesto research results that had guided the develop-ment of recommendations. A more systematicapproach to citing literature would thereforehave to be adopted by countries to allow thisapproach to be employed more generally. Assessing human and infrastructural resources Publications analyses rapidly identied the most productive countries and research centres inAfrica, and showed their research specializationsand collaboration patterns. However, despitebasing analyses on the most recent research out-puts, the information was retrospective as itreflected research carried out in the few yearsprior to publication. In contrast, the direct survey of active malaria research laboratories gave a current view ofresearch focus and expertise, and identied areas of growth. The survey also provided a moredetailed insight into research capacity, includinglaboratory facilities and the training paths of researchers. Furthermore, the questionnairegathered the opinions of African scientists withrst-hand experience of performing research inAfrica. The responses raised issues relating tocapacity development that were not evidentfrom the other approaches employed in thestudy. The breadth of response from researchgroups was a key feature of this study and thedistribution of questionnaires in both Englishand French was likely to have contributed to thesuccess in obtaining high response rates fromboth Anglophone and Francophone Africa. The survey of funding organizations was able to give an overview of the types of awards avail-able in Africa and in other developing regions,and of the numbers of scientists trained annuallyat different levels. It also provided more detailedinformation on the strategies of funders in sup-porting training. However, the survey of Africancentres was able to give a clear impression of therelative contributions of these schemes towardsdeveloping the core of malaria researchers whoare currently active in Africa.Overview and policy issues 5References 96 Strengthening Health Research in the Developing World Malaria Research Capacity in AfricaAnderson J, Maclean M, Davies C (1996) Malaria Research: An audit of international activity.
