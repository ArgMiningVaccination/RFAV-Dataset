Methods Employees of Cleveland Clinic who were previously infected with or vaccinated against COVID-19, and were working in Ohio the day the Omicron variant was declared a variant of concern, were included. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined over two months during an Omicron variant surge. Protection provided by boosting (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses were adjusted for time since proximate overt immunologic challenge (POIC) as a time-dependent covariate. Results Among 39 766 employees, 8037 (20%) previously infected and the remaining previously vaccinated, COVID-19 occurred in 6230 (16%) during the study. Risk of COVID-19 increased with time since POIC. In multivariable analysis, boosting was independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 among those with vaccine-induced immunity (HR, .43; 95% CI, .41-.46) as well as those with natural immunity (HR, .66; 95% CI, .58-.76). Among those with natural immunity, receiving 2 compared to 1 dose of vaccine was associated with higher risk of COVID-19 (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.97). Conclusions Administering a COVID-19 vaccine not designed for the Omicron variant, 6 months or more after prior infection or vaccination, protects against Omicron variant infection in both previously infected and previously vaccinated individuals. There is no evidence of an advantage to administering more than 1 dose of vaccine to previously infected persons. Summary Among 39 766 Cleveland Clinic employees already protected by prior infection or vaccination, vaccine boosting after 6 months was associated with significantly lower risk of COVID-19. After COVID-19 infection, there was no advantage to more than one dose of vaccine. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study did not receive any funding ### Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.
