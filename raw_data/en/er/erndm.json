[Bacopa](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/Bacopa) is another historical Adaptogenic herb, it has been used in India as a form of Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. Bacopa owes its Nootropic effect to boosting serotonin levels. You need to make a longer-term commitment to it for true cognitive enhancement. This article is mostly going to focus on decoding what the human studies are saying about Bacopa and how this squares up with the anecdotal experiences of Biohackers online. Scientific Research There are nearly a [hundred human studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Bacopa%5BTitle%2FAbstract%5D) listed on Pubmed done on Bacopa, so it's been studied thoroughly as an Adaptogen and is respected in eastern traditional medicine.

The present review considers the literature on the effects... www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov History Bacopa monniera or Brahmi is another historical Nootropic that has been used for three millennia in India. It comes from the waterhyssop plant which is a creeping herb, so this herb grows just outside of the windows of cute Indian girls and likes all their photos on Facebook \u2014 just kidding! It's a cornerstone of traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Ayurveda means the knowledge of long life. If you're curious about it [check out this documentary](https://youtu.be/S6RJaZ_Drmw). It's also found in China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the southern part of the USA. Cognition The primary value I see in Bacopa for Biohackers is that unlike other adaptogenic Nootropics it works on cognition. The other Adaptogens are good for energy, pep, mood, stress management, and immunity but they are not quintessential smart drugs that will make you a whole lot better at solving complex problems or making better decisions. An extensive double-blind placebo-controlled [study was done](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18683852) by Swinburne University, School of Biophysical Science in Victoria, Australia. It concluded that it consistently improves higher-order cognitive processes: - Improved speed of visual information processing - Learning rates - Memory consolidation - Reducing state anxiety From a [6 month study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18611150) of 48 human subjects from Helfgott Research Institute: Controlling for baseline cognitive deficit using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test, Bacopa participants had enhanced AVLT delayed word recall memory scores relative to placebo.

Bacopa most improved delayed word recall, which is a task where you memorize a sequence of words, distract yourself with something else, then come back and try to recall the sequence. So this would suggest that Bacopa will actually make you better at multi-tasking.

After two months, this initial rush of creativity and motivation has diminished, to be replaced with increased lucidity, and what seems to be more general resilience. All in all now I feel as if the Bacopa Monierii has created a subtle elevation of both my mood and general clarity, but without any of the initial focus and motivation.

Memory Bacopa is a long-term memory Biohack, so it's not likely to help you much with exams next week but an abundance of high-quality human studies indicate that it may help you with a long-term memory challenge, like [learning a new language](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/blog/nootropics/584-accelerated-language-learning). It can take up to 12 weeks to get the maximum mind power benefits from a Bacopa regimen. From Bud a Nootropic connoisseur... \"Yes, very very good. I've been a fan of bacopa for a couple of years now. It can take some people up to six months to observe any positive benefits. Myself I noticed discernible effects after about two months. And, when it happened, this happened: \"I have found that it ridiculously potentates any stimulant I take. Anyone notice this as well? I can usually have a large cup of tea and feel nothing from it, but if I drink it after taking this supplement that it becomes incredibly stimulating.\" Having said that, I was sold as to it's validity from that point forward, and it will always remain a vital part of my stack. Bacopa is one Nootropic that has been demonstrated to improve the memories and learning capacity of otherwise healthy people as opposed to improving the memory of those retarded by cognitive decline, stroke, etc. From a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled [University of Wollongong study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12093601) of 76 humans: The results show a significant effect of the Brahmi on a test for the retention of new information.

It takes several weeks before any memory improvement can be noticed (according to studies and my own experience). 5-12 weeks maybe with daily use (twice daily). So Bacopa as a memory hack aids with effectively forming new memories underlying new skills, so it's not like the fictional drug NZT-48 that allows you to effortlessly reach back 10, 15, or 20 years into your past. [Piracetam](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/Piracetam) is your best bet for that! Vs Stress As a quintessential Adaptogen, it has a helpful effect on our stress management.

Taste & Aesthetics I prefer to consume Bacopa as a tea, I jump a few little spoonfuls of powdered Bacopa into hot water which I let sit for a few minutes, and then drink it. Its taste is pretty decent compared to many powdered Nootropics which are frankly disgusting but compared to other [adaptogenic Nootropics](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/adaptogenic-nootropics-comparison) it's very strong and will likely put a bit of scowl on your face. It's fat-soluble so you do want to consume it with some form of fat. Sources & Pricing Bacopa can be taken as a [capsuled supplement](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/Bacopa-DW) and is very affordable at $10-$20 for a Researching Bacopa, I kept hearing about a potential issue with metal contamination. This can be avoided by consuming high-quality pharmaceutical-grade Bacopa, as opposed to the cheapo stuff sold on the shelves of your local grocery store or as an ostensible ingredient of those flashy Nootropic stack products. My preferred vendor Science.bio, sells 50 grams of COA-verified [powdered Bacopa for $20](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/Bacopa-SB), a several-month supply. According to [Adaptogens](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/#Adaptogens-Book): Safety Issues: Make sure that the bacopa used has been organically grown because commercially grown bacopa can absorb whatever pollutants (especially lead and nitrates) are in the water it grows in. Since you have to consume Bacopa for at least several weeks and likely months for it to really benefit you, you'll want to be sure you're using a high-quality supply. Since Bacopa is really unleashed when taken with Nootropic cofactors, if full-spectrum cognitive enhancement is what you're after you can simplify things by just taking it as part of a quality Nootropic stack, like [Mind Lab Pro](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/Mind-Lab-Pro).

It can be combined with other cerebral stimulants such as rosemary, bacopa, and ginkgo to help people with menopausal cloudy thinking, poor memory, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to speed up recovery from head trauma. Bacopa, St. John's wort, Ginkgo, and Holy Basil can be a transformative cocktail for overcoming cognitive impairment. Consider this remarkable case documented in [Adaptogens](https://www.limitlessmindset.com/#Adaptogens-Book): In one remarkable case from many years ago, I had an opportunity to use a similar formula with great success. A friend's wife came down with bacterial meningitis. Luckily, they caught it early enough. She was rushed to the hospital and given intravenous antibiotics. Her life was saved and she was discharged from the hospital, but she still had severe cognitive problems. Her ability to hear, see, speak, and smell all were seriously impaired. She was unable to hold a conversation, work, or read; even food had a strange taste. Her doctors had done all they could do and advised her that these troubling symptoms would hopefully resolve after six to twelve months. I was asked to help at this point and recommended several nootropic and adaptogenic herbs. In two weeks, she reported significant improvement, and after a month on this formula, she stated that she was \"back to normal, and maybe even better than that.\" This case, although remarkable in its quick and total success, is not all that unusual and shows how herbs can offer significant benefits for many \"untreatable conditions.\" (p. 223) Side Effects: Bacopa is regarded as being very safe. For many, it's a downer. One [Canadian biohacker](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/25616-bacopa-monnieri-anyone-else-using-this/?view=findpost&p=451395) reported insightfully: \"I've been using Bacopa... for 8 weeks with negative results...

The very mild side effects of a high dosage can include dry mouth, muscle fatigue, and nausea. It's not recommended to take Bacopa with chlorpromazine, a drug in the pharmaceutical family of perphenazine Conclusion... The benefits it offers, if used alone are not unique to it as a Nootropic; if you are looking for a memory and cognition enhancer that helps with anxiety there are a lot better options that work a whole lot faster than the few weeks to 3 months that Bacopa does. I think it's worth attention as an anti-aging preventative measure for treating neural inflammation and as a neuroprotective agent but it will remain pretty far from the top of the list of Nootropics that I recommend to young people. For otherwise healthy Biohackers Bacopa's real value as a performance enhancer is in "}
