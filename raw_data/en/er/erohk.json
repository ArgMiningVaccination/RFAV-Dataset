WVU Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center Philanthropy Annual Report 2014-2015I have had the amazing privilege in the last year to return to the University that made me into a doctor - and the state that made me who I am\u2014 to be a part of a profound change sweeping across West Virginia. It's clear that we are at a turning point for West Virginia and for WVU. I am convinced that we have a golden moment, together, to write our state's future and contribute to a change that will send ripples around the country and the world. West Virginia is building a culture of collaboration, coordination, and connection. It's an amazing opportunity to create competitive advantages for our state. We start at the Health Sciences Center by focusing on health - and how it is interconnected to the state's longstanding challenges: declining population, lack of jobs and lack of hope for many citizens, lack of sufficient education and training for many to compete for available jobs, and poor overall population health. Can we make a difference? I believe we can. We will rewrite the future so that West Virginia is a beacon for others to follow. Our success will be based on the strength, intelligence, and commitment of our people and our ability to work together. Our students, faculty, and staff in the schools of Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Medicine are crucial to this effort. Alumni, friends, and colleagues are vital to us and our work.CREATING HOPE AND OPPORTUNITY Our Vice President's Message Clay Marsh MD, Vice President and Executive DeanMomentum is published by the West Virginia University Robert C.

JARRETT WITH HIS CHILDREN, ALLISON AND JORDANPUBLIC HEALTH: Dr. Gordon Murray, a longtime faculty member in the School of Medicine, and his wife, Sharon, have made an additional $20,000 gift to the scholarship fund they established to honor their late son. The William M. Murray Public Health Education Scholarship in the School of Public Health provides graduate scholarships for West Virginia residents pursing master's degrees in public health at WVU. The Murrays first established the scholarship in 2009 to honor their son, William \"Bill\" Murray, who passed away at the age of 39. Bill, a 1996 graduate of WVU with a master's degree in public administration, was the financial officer in the Department of Community Medicine, which later became the School of Public Health. Since its establishment, the Murray scholarship has supported seven graduate students in public health. A Michigan native, Dr. Gordon Murray earned his medical degree from the University of Michigan, and completed his residency training at The Johns Hopkins and Massachusetts General Hospitals.

This milestone campaign for the WVU School of Medicine, Charleston Division was launched by a generous gift from Dr. Pfister. As a beloved figure in the southern West Virginia medical community for the past 50 years, Dr. Alfred K. Pfister's name is associated with compassion, tireless care, knowledge, and humor by both his patients and peers. In addition to practicing as a general internist, Dr. Pfister has served as a teacher and mentor for hundreds of medical students at the WVU School of Medicine, Charleston Division.

ALFRED K. PFISTER 12SCHOLARSHIP HONORS MEMBER OF NURSING SCHOOL'S FIRST GRADUATING CLASS NURSING: Ralph Glover's endowment of a scholarship in the WVU School of Nursing honors his late wife, Marti-Lou, and ensures that her desire to support WVU nursing students in pursuit of their education and careers will become a reality. Marti-Lou Glover was a member of the Class of 1964 in the School of Nursing's first graduating class. She passed away in 2014, and it was her wish to create a scholarship for undergraduate nursing students at WVU. Ralph's gift of $25,000 will do just that. The Marti-Lou Glover Nursing Scholarship will help outstanding undergraduate nursing students by providing a scholarship in their senior year. Recipients must demonstrate superior scholarship, leadership, or show a strong record of community and public service. Ralph graduated from the WVU Forestry School in 1962 and is treasurer of the WVU Forestry Alumni Association. Ralph and Marti-Lou were married for 50 years and raised four children, who are all WVU alumni. Sarah Kennedy, of Smithfield, Pennsylvania, is a senior undergraduate nursing student and the first student to receive the Marti-Lou Glover Nursing Scholarship. \"Being the first recipient of the Marti-Lou Glover Nursing Scholarship is beyond humbling,\" said Sarah. \"To know that I was chosen for a scholarship that honors Mrs. Glover and her nursing legacy is a rewarding privilege and I am extremely grateful.\" \" After completing my sophomore year, I truly realized that nursing is my passion. With its endless options and multiple graduate programs, nursing combines every aspect that I desire in a future lifelong career. It encompasses direct and holistic patient care that can be provided to all ages and ethnicities, and I am so excited to graduate in May 2016 and begin my own journey in the profession of nursing.\" \" As I approach graduation, I am not only excited that I will soon be fulfilling my dream of becoming a nurse, but I am also filled with respect for a strong and caring woman who graduated with the first WVU School of Nursing class 52 years ago. She and I share in the pursuit of the same compassionate profession. It is a true honor to receive a scholarship in Mrs. Glover's name.\" 13 SARAH KENNEDY NURSING CLASS OF 2016CANCER INSTITUTE: \"My mother was my best friend,\" said West Virginia University men's basketball head coach Bob Huggins. \"When you lose someone you're close to, you just want to do something.\" When Norma Mae Huggins, Bob's mother, lost her battle with colon cancer in 2003, he decided that he wanted to support researchers in the battle against cancer, an illness that claims more than half a million lives each year in the United States. HUGGINS HONORS HIS MOTHER THROUGH SUPPORT OF CANCER RESEARCH 14To accomplish this goal, Bob established the Norma Mae Huggins Cancer Research Endowment in the WVU Cancer Institute. The fund supports clinical research in cancer, and gives West Virginians struggling with the disease the opportunity to participate in clinical trials. Coach Huggins' commitment was not a one-time thing: he has spearheaded a number of fundraisers in the past decade, and others have made significant contributions to the fund. Coach Huggins announced his most recent gift of $50,000 in April 2015 at the annual Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center Gala. This, along with other significant gifts, helped put the Norma Mae Huggins Cancer Research Endowment over the million-dollar mark. \"Our family has always thought the world of West Virginia and West Virginia University,\" said Coach Huggins. \"Everyone is affected by cancer in some fashion, and like everybody else, we want to find a cure. We decided to enable the good people we have here at WVU to work toward that goal.\" \"We are so grateful for the support from Coach Huggins to the WVU Cancer Institute for clinical trials research,\" said John Naim, director of WVU's Clinical Trials Research Unit. \"Through these research studies we are able to gain a better understanding of cancer, to test promising new, innovative methods of treatment, and ultimately to advance cancer care.\" Coach Huggins graduated from West Virginia University magna cum laude in 1977 and received his master's in health administration from WVU in 1978. He became WVU's men's basketball coach in April 2007. The School of Public Health established an undergraduate program. The School of Medicine launched a doctoral degree in clinical and translational science. WVU added a new Healthcare Information and Management Systems (HIMS) degree program. The PharmD and PhD programs in the School of Pharmacy as well as the Dental Hygiene program in the School of Dentistry were named \"WVU Programs of Excellence.\" Anne Swisher, PT, PhD, faculty member in the School of Medicine, has earned a Fulbright Award. WVU has joined a multi-university team developing new prosthetics with sensory technology. 2015 ACADEMIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS BOB AND HIS WIFE JUNE HUGGINSCHILDREN'S: In recognition of a generous gift from a loyal WVU graduate, the front desk of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at WVU Medicine Children's has been named for the late Gary and Loretta Poling. Gary passed away in December 2013 and left a $50,000 estate gift to WVU Medicine Children's. A native of Philippi, West Virginia, Gary attended WVU and played in the Mountaineer Marching Band, later earning his master's degree in secondary education in 1973. Gary's passion was helping local youth and his life was full of jobs and volunteer roles of great variety, including helping school bands, working as a park ranger, umpiring baseball games, and teaching. Gary spent many years helping underprivileged children, including establishing a Youth Opportunity Camp in his native Barbour County. He taught for 38 years at Washington Irving and Robert C. Byrd High Schools and for 18 years at Fairmont State College. \"Gary was phenomenal \u2014 a man of integrity, a true educator, and the most loyal Mountaineer. He made me and many others realize that it's okay to be in the band, and it's ok to be a 'jock.' Whatever you want to be, Gary made it cool. He brought people together,\" said Gary's former student and longtime friend, John LOYAL GRAD LEAVES GIFT TO WVU MEDICINE CHILDREN'S 15Our hospital system extends across West Virginia and provides 25% of all hospital care statewide.Miller. John is the executive editor of the Exponent Telegram in Clarksburg. \"Gary was a firm believer in pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. . . and helping people step up in life through education. He taught me the value of perseverance and hard work,\" John said, adding that he also helps local youth today because of the impact Gary had on him. \"Gary was, without question, a tremendous WVU fan and supporter, and was also committed to anything he could do to help an individual, youth, or kids in general. WVU Medicine Children's is a natural fit for him,\" said Harrison County Circuit Judge Thomas Bedell, a good friend of Gary's and executor of the Poling estate. \"We are very grateful that Mr. Poling included a gift for WVU Medicine Children's in his will, and we appreciate Judge Bedell's efforts to see his friend's wishes become a reality,\" said Cheryl Jones, director of WVU Medicine Children's. \"We are at or near capacity every day and every dollar raised towards our expansion means we can continue to provide the highest quality of care to every family who needs our help.\" We serve approximately 3,600 people a day; our 11,600 employees make us the second largest employer in WV.Revenue from healthcare contributed $81.9 million toward academics and education last year.THE LATE LORETTA AND GARY POLINGMEDICINE: James G. Arbogast, MD, a family medicine physician for 36 years and former chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the West Virginia University School of Medicine, says he came to WVU a naive but open-minded medical student and developed into a doctor under the tutelage of an amazing and competent cadre of teachers, including Drs. John Traubert, Clark Sleeth, Ed Flink, Herb Warden, John Jones, Gunter Franz, and Bill Fleming. \"I wanted nothing more than to continue in their mold, so I accepted an invitation to stay on the faculty as an instructor,\" Dr. Arbogast recalled. Teachers are leaders who have the power to project either light or shadow on their students. Over the years, Dr. Arbogast helped transform many medical students into competent, caring physicians. RETIRED DEPARTMENT CHAIR STRENGTHENS FAMILY MEDICINE, CREATES LEGACY WITH FIRST ENDOWED POSITIONS 16\"It was a tremendous responsibility,\" he observed. \"I interacted with students over a seven-year metamorphosis from the altruistic and clinically inexperienced first-year medical student to the 'hardened' senior family medicine resident anxious to independently pursue their career. My challenge was to guide them through this journey of self-discovery and to show them how to become lifelong learners by constantly adjusting my teaching style to complement their particular stages of development.\" Family medicine physicians take care of patients of all ages. They may perform minor surgeries, deliver babies, and practice geriatrics and sports medicine. The School of Medicine's family medicine program has been an important part of medical education and service for decades. In addition to training in the family medicine clinic on the Morgantown campus, WVU medical students and residents benefit from family medicine programs at WVU's Eastern Division, based in Martinsburg, and at the school's Charleston Division, affiliated with Charleston Area Medical Center. Following his retirement from the department, Dr. Arbogast decided to strengthen family medicine and service to the state of West Virginia in perpetuity by including the Department of Family Medicine in his estate. He will be leaving a legacy of education and care through the creation of two chairs for the Department, the first endowed faculty positions for the department. Arbogast earned a bachelor's degree in biology from Lafayette College in 1972 and is a 1976 graduate of the WVU School of Medicine. During his career at WVU, Arbogast has been recognized numerous times for his outstanding teaching and service to the University. In 2003, he was one of three finalists for the West Virginia Faculty Merit Foundation Professor of the Year award. \"Dr. Arbogast is one of the treasures of the Department of Family Medicine at WVU,\" said Dana King, professor and chair in the Department of Family Medicine. \"He trained here, served here on the faculty for many years, and topped off his career as chair of the department. He dedicated his professional life to Family Medicine, his patients, and WVU. His gift is the first of its kind for the department, and will allow us to continue to grow, attract excellent faculty, and support rural programs that are at the heart of what we do and what Jim loves.\" DR. ARBOGAST AND PRESIDENT GEEDENTISTRY: Students pursuing a degree in dentistry face both academic and financial challenges. Currently the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) program costs for in-state residents is estimated to exceed $205,000. Through the generosity of David and Linda Edwards of Wellsburg, West Virginia, that burden will be lessened for dental students thanks to a new endowed scholarship. The Dr. David G. Edwards Dental Scholarship will benefit above-average students with leadership skills and a commitment to service. West Virginia residents who plan to practice dentistry in the state will receive preference. \"Establishing this scholarship partially fulfills our desire to give back to this great University, which prepared me so well for the profession I love, and to help it remain a first-class school for students entering a profession so vital to the citizens of West Virginia,\" Dr. Edwards said. Dr. Edwards earned a master's in biology from WVU in 1969 and a DDS degree in 1973, and has maintained a private dentistry practice in Wellsburg since then. He was a clinical assistant professor in the School of Dentistry from 1996 to 2005, and served as a member and past president of the West Virginia Board of Dental Examiners. He is a member of the School of Dentistry's capital campaign and admissions committees. He was named one of the WVU School of Dentistry's Distinguished Alumni and received the Pierre Fauchard Academy's Outstanding Dentist Award. He is a member and past officer of many professional organizations, including the American Dental WELLSBURG COUPLE ENDOWS SCHOLARSHIP TO SUPPORT DENTAL STUDENTS Association, West Virginia Dental Association, Wheeling District Dental Society, and several others. He is a fellow of the American and International Colleges of Dentists. He has also been active in many civic and charitable organizations in his community. Linda earned her registered dental hygienist license and dental hygiene bachelor's degree from West Liberty University. She's had her dental hygiene license for 53 years and worked for 10 great dentists- including her brother, Bruce Forbes, and her husband. Linda earned a master's in communications from WVU in 1986. In 2015, the inaugural Dr. David G. Edwards Dental Scholarship was awarded to Caitlyn Nelson, a member 17of the Class of 2016 from Charleston, West Virginia. \"Thanks to Dr. and Mrs. Edwards, I am one step closer to my goal of practicing dentistry in West Virginia,\" said Caitlyn. \"This scholarship helps immensely with lessening the burden of my student loans, and the Edwards' altruism has inspired me to help others and give back to the community.\" \"We are so grateful to David and Linda for their generous support of our dental students,\" said Anthony \"Tom\" Borgia, dean of the School of Dentistry.L-R: LINDA EDWARDS, INAUGURAL RECIPIENT CAITLYN NELSON, AND DR. DAVID EDWARDS AT THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY SCHOLARSHIP CELEBRATION DINNER ON NOVEMBER 13, 2015. EYE INSTITUTE: Eye disease and blindness affect many people in West Virginia and beyond, but a gift from Dr. Jodie Trotter made in honor of her late husband, Dr. Robert R. Trotter, will help WVU researchers develop better treatments for those who suffer from them. Dr. Robert R. Trotter, a native West Virginian and WVU graduate, gave much of his life to improving eye care for West Virginians, founding and serving as the very first chair of the Department of Ophthalmology in the WVU School of Medicine. Before returning to West Virginia, he served at Harvard University. After he passed away in 2006, his wife, a successful psychologist, decided to carry on her husband's legacy by supporting research and education at the WVU Eye Institute.The Drs. Robert R. and Jodie Trotter Vision Research Fund will support clinical and bench research, greatly enhancing WVU researchers' work in these areas. Dr. Jodie Trotter had her own very successful career in psychology, including serving as chief psychologist at the Kennedy Youth Center, clinical assistant professor at the WVU School of Medicine Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, and consultant in Social Security Disability for West Virginia. She also established the first private practice in adult clinical psychology in West Virginia in 1976. Dr. Ronald L. Gross, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and director of the WVU Eye Institute, said Jodie Trotter has long been a treasured friend of the Department.\"We are very grateful to Jodie for this generous gift,\" said Dr. Gross. \"These funds will assist our physicians and basic science researchers in advancing research to prevent blindness by better understanding and treating eye disease here in West Virginia and beyond.\" \"This gift is especially fitting since Dr. Robert Trotter was a true physician researcher and is the reason the Eye Institute exists today,\" he added. Research is a top priority of the WVU Eye Institute, where physicians and basic research scientists investigate the causes of eye diseases and develop better treatments for them. The Eye Institute is the only academic facility in West Virginia conducting eye research. 18SO OTHERS MAY SEE L-R: VISVANATHAN RAMAMURTHY, PHD, DIRECTOR OF THE VISION RESEARCH CENTER, TONY REALINI, MD, MPH, DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL RESEARCH WITH DR.

Generations of future students will benefit from the couple's pledge of a $25,000 scholarship for student pharmacists at WVU.Debra graduated from the School of Pharmacy in 1986, and William earned his degree from the Statler College of Engineering and Mineral Resources in 1985. \"WVU is close to our hearts,\" Debra McMann said. \"It's not easy getting started and we've been there, so we wanted to give back.\" The couple's pledge established the Kline McMann Family Pharmacy Scholarship. Preference will go to residents of Morgantown, where Debra grew up. Endowing a scholarship fund is an excellent way to help current students while also establishing a permanent asset that will benefit many students for years to come. \"We are truly grateful for the generous support of the McManns,\" Mary Stamatakis, Pharm.D., interim dean of the WVU School of Pharmacy, said. \"Knowing that through scholarship endowments such as these that we will be able to provide support to students on an annual basis is a great feeling.\" Ryan Watson, a student pharmacist in the Doctor of Pharmacy professional program, is the first recipient of the Kline McMann Family Pharmacy Scholarship. Ryan said the scholarship means more to him than just the obvious financial assistance it will provide. INAUGURAL RECIPIENT RYAN WATSON, WITH DEBBIE MCMANN AT THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY SCHOLARSHIP AND AWARDS CONVOCATION ON APRIL 17, 2015.GIVING BACK, CHANGING LIVES EYE INSTITUTE: The Appalachian Vision Outreach Program (AVOP) received a $40,000 grant from the Bernard McDonough Foundation. The grant will support adult vision screenings, general clinics, sub-specialty clinical services and education on the importance of vision health for those who do not have access to regular eye care and are not able to travel to the Eye Institute because of lack of transportation or other barriers. \"Thanks to the Bernard McDonough Foundation's support of AVOP , we are able to continue our adult vision outreach services to West Virginians who may otherwise not receive the vision care they need for independence and employability,\" said Ronald L. Gross, MD, director of the WVU Eye Institute and chair of the Department of Ophthalmology. The Appalachian Vision Outreach Program began in 2011 and since then has evolved to reach more venues, more patients, and offer an expanded range of services throughout the state. The Bernard McDonough Foundation, a private foundation located in Parkersburg, West Virginia, was founded to improve communities within West Virginia. The Foundation's benefactor, the late Mr. Bernard P . McDonough, emerged from humble beginnings to have a very successful business career. McDonough's focus was to use philanthropy to enhance the mind, body, and spirit. After McDonough's death, his wife, Alma G. McDonough, further supported the Foundation. For more than 40 years, the Foundation has addressed human need issues in basic health and social welfare. Current Bernard McDonough Foundation directors continue the legacy left by the McDonoughs by instituting grants that create a healthier, more educated, and culturally appreciative citizenry. BERNARD MCDONOUGH FOUNDATION ENABLES ADDITIONAL EYE CARE CLINICS \"Receiving a scholarship from an alumna of the School of Pharmacy helped me to understand how important the field is to those who go into it,\" Watson said, \"and how big of a family this profession is.\" \"College is a memorable time,\" Debra McMann said. \"That's where you get your start, and it's what you remember. I can see that the program is different now from when I was a student. There are new classes and avenues to explore. It has broadened and is a completely different atmosphere. We want to help and support students.\"20 MEDICINE: A $2.6 million gift from the Barbara B. Highland Charitable Trust will fund an endowed chair in stroke research in the School of Medicine. The late Barbara B. Highland was a native of Clarksburg, West Virginia, who earned a degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1945, was one of the first women admitted into the Wharton School of Business, and worked for IBM in Charleston, West Virginia. She passed away in 2012. Barbara's husband, Cecil B. Highland, Jr., was a New Martinsville, West Virginia, native who earned a bachelor's in political science from WVU in 1940 and a law degree from Harvard Law School. He was president and general manager of Clarksburg Publishing Company, which owns the Clarksburg Exponent and Telegram. He also was president of Empire National Bank in Clarksburg; helped found the Clarksburg law firm now known as McNeer, Highland, McMunn and Varner; and served on the WVU College of Law faculty. He passed away in 2002. The Highlands were longtime innovators, leaders, and philanthropists. A gift by the couple helped build the new United Hospital Center in Clarksburg. Cecil was a member of the WVU Foundation Board of Directors and inducted into the Order of Vandalia, WVU's highest honor for service. \"Barbara believed strongly in making a difference and was undeterred in her efforts,\" said Marcia A. Broughton, a member of the Highland Trust Board of Trustees. \"Her input was often unrecognized, but rarely ignored. She and Cecil were a team, each supporting and enhancing the other. Both contributed so much to central West Virginia and beyond.\" In December 2015, Jim Simpkins, director of the WVU Research Center for Basic and Translational Research, was named the first holder of the Barbara B. Highland Stroke Chair. A professor in the Departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, and Neurology, Dr. Simpkins has spent more than 40 years researching the causes and potential treatments for Alzheimer's disease and stroke, and is a leader in the field. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Toledo, and a PhD in physiology from Michigan State University. Before coming to WVU in 2012, he served on the faculty at the University of Florida for 23 years, then as professor and chair in the Department of Pharmacology and Neuroscience at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. \"Dr. Simpkins is a well-known and respected educator and researcher,\" said Clay Marsh, WVU vice president and executive dean of health sciences. \"He was named BARBARA B. HIGHLAND CHARITABLE TRUST ENDOWS STROKE CHAIR IN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE to the Barbara B. Highland Stroke Chair due to his leadership of our team that is attacking stroke from every direction. His work is vital in improving prevention, promoting recovery, and refining treatment methods for stroke in West Virginia and across the country.\" The gift to the School of Medicine from the Barbara B. Highland Charitable Trust is part of a $5.2 million donation that will be split evenly with the College of Law.DURING THE INVESTITURE CEREMONY. L-R: CLAY MARSH, MD, DR. SIMPKINS, JOHN F.

The slide - 1,000 feet long, 40 feet wide and the length of three football fields - raised $21,000 for Rosenbaum Family House, which provides a home away from home for adult patients and their families at WVU Medicine. Vicki Antion-Nelson, event co-chair and SLIDE TO GIVE! DENTISTRY: A $50,000 research innovation award in endodontics was awarded to the School of Dentistry in 2015. Endodontics is the study of the tooth root, dental pulp, and surrounding tissue. The American Association of Endodontists (AAE) Foundation/DENTSPLY Innovation in Research Grant will equip a dedicated endodontics research laboratory that will be used by faculty and students to prepare experimental samples and specimens. The 4,000-square-foot lab was developed in collaboration with the West Virginia Clinical and Translational Science Institute. David Funderburk, DDS, MS, an AAE Foundation Trustee and School of DENTAL RESEARCH BOLSTERED BY NATIONAL AWARD Dentistry alumnus, says WVU has a tremendous track record of advancing the endodontic specialty. \"The AAE Foundation and DENTSPLY Tulsa Dental Specialties are honored to present this award in recognition of WVU's new initiatives to promote excellence in research,\" Dr. Funderburk said. The grant is given annually to one or more universities, chosen based on their achievements in research or their future goals for developing a research initiative at their institution. The intent is to highlight and promote excellence in endodontics research. \"The generous support of the AAE Foundation and DENTSPLY will greatly enhance our endodontics research program here at West Virginia University,\" said Anthony \"Tom\" Borgia, DDS, dean of the WVU School of Dentistry. \"With this gift, residents and faculty will have new tools to advance our mission to address the present and future oral health needs of the citizens of West Virginia and beyond.\" a board member at Rosenbaum Family House said, \"These funds will directly assist families who have nowhere to go, who cannot afford or find a hotel room in the area, who need a shower or a warm meal during an extended hospital stay.\" Leah Cyphert, event co-chair, said, \"Special events like this are part of what allows Rosenbaum Family House to provide such important services to our patients and their families.\" Sliders purchased single, triple, or unlimited slide passes, and Family House received a portion of the proceeds from each pass. In addition, the organization recruited more than 100 volunteers to work at the event and received funds from Slide the City for each volunteer hour. While some volunteers helped run the main event, others engaged in fundraising activities for Family House - including running a concession stand and tie-dye-shirt-making station, and inflating inner tubes for sliders who purchased them at the event. Volunteers and donations are vital to Family House, said Antoin-Nelson and Cyphert, not just at this event but year-round. \"The greater Morgantown community welcomes these families by donating their time and efforts to cook for the families and donate personal items to make their stays a little less stressful,\" said Antion-Nelson. Slide the City sponsors included WVAQ, Greater Morgantown Convention and Visitors Bureau, and Interim Healthcare. EYE INSTITUTE: Ask retired WVU professor Joginder Nath why he keeps giving back to the University where he taught for more than 40 years, and the answer is clear. He is passionate about learning, and he cares about people. Nath created an endowed lectureship - the Joginder Nath Ophthalmology Lecture - through the WVU Eye Institute. The Nath Lectures will bring nationally and internationally recognized lecturers in the field of ophthalmology - whether in research, teaching, and/or service - to speak at WVU. \"We are honored to be the recipients of this endowed gift from Dr. Nath,\" said Ronald L. Gross, MD, chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and director of the Eye Institute. \"By bringing in internationally recognized lecturers, our residents, fellows, faculty, and anyone interested in the field of vision research will have the opportunity to engage in pioneering discoveries to advance the work we do to treat eye disease and prevent blindness.\" SHAW'S S.T.E.P .S. CENTER DEDICATED HSC: On October 15, 2015, the David and Jo Ann Shaw Center for Simulation Training and Education for Patient Safety (WV STEPS) re-opened after its latest expansion, which nearly quadrupled the educational space. The WV STEPS Center is an interprofessional laboratory that provides students with hands-on educational training. Patient simulators are capable of everything from trembling and crying, to bleeding, or giving birth, providing clinicians the opportunity to learn, rehearse, and perfect procedures. Inter-professional education is stressed as nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and other members of an integrated health care team train together, just as they perform in the healthcare setting. This expansion was made possible by a generous gift from David and Jo Ann Shaw. The Shaws hope their philanthropy inspires others to support the Center so that simulation training continues to be enhanced at WVU. Currently there are opportunities to name laboratory or learning spaces and support equipment and technology needs. Nath, an emeritus professor in the Department of Genetics at the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, retired in 2009 after more than four decades of teaching and research at WVU. Nath remains active in the University community, serving on both the Eye Institute and Davis College Campaign committees. \"It is hoped that this lecture will not only serve the need of professionals in the field of medicine and ophthalmology but also the education and needs of the citizens of Morgantown and the state,\" said Nath. The inaugural Joginder Nath Ophthalmology Lecture was held at the WVU Eye Institute on the ophthalmology department's annual research day in May 2015. Nath has made several other gifts to the University and community over the years, including previous donations to the Eye Institute, the student food pantry known as \"The Rack,\" and the Art Museum of WVU. He endowed a lectureship in the Honors College and a graduate student travel fund at the Davis College of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Design, and he has supported local arts projects and hospitals in the region. 22 SUPPORTING KNOWLEDGE, ADVANCING DISCOVERY L-R: DAVID SHAW, DR.

The R. Dean and Charlene Hartley Community Engagement Program supports projects that promote public health through collaboration between public health students and West Virginia communities, enriching student learning and supporting the School in its mission to serve the state. The Hartleys committed $75,000 to the School of Public Health for the program. To apply, groups of at least threestudents must propose a project that meets a public health need in West Virginia and involves community engagement. This year, 13 students are participating in two projects - one a pedestrian safety campaign using social media to reduce pedestrian injuries and deaths; and the other a photography project working with youth and the elderly to explore issues relating to hunger and food insecurity. Both Dean and Charlene Hartley are natives of Moundsville, West Virginia, members of the WVU Foundation's Woodburn Circle Society, and Charles Brooke fellows. Locally, the Hartleys are active in support of the YWCA and Make-A-Wish Foundation.COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM TO BENEFIT STUDENTS, COMMUNITIES CHARLENE AND DEAN HARTLEYDean, a graduate of the WVU College of Law, is a trial attorney and founding partner of Hartley & O'Brien, where he has successfully represented injured workers for many years. He serves as chair of the American Association for Justice's Benzene/Leukemia Litigation Group. An avid supporter of WVU, he is a member of the WVU Alumni Association Board of Directors, the Mountaineer Athletic Club's Development Council, WVU Athletic Executive Committee, and WVU Athletics Capital Campaign Committee. He previously served on the WVU College of Law Development Council. Dean is also a founding Visiting Committee member in the WVU School of Public Health. Dean and Charlene have seven children, two of whom are WVU graduates, and 14 grandchildren. \"Through the generosity of Charlene and Dean Hartley, our students are able to expand their practical experiences in the community,\" said School of Public Health Dean Gregory A. Hand. \"These educational opportunities both in classroom and community learning are a vital part of public health practice. It is truly how you prepare students to discover solutions, be deeply engaged in the community, and improve public health.\" DENTISTRY: Future students in West Virginia University's Dental Hygiene Program will benefit from a generous planned gift from alumnus Deborah McMechen Hock. Deborah is leaving $450,000 in her estate to be added to an endowed scholarship already established by her and her late husband, Conrad Hock Jr., in 2008. \"My hope is that each year when a student receives our scholarship, it will help ease some of their financial burdens, and that it will also instill a desire to give back to the school if they are ever in the financial position to do so,\" Hock said. \"Her announcement provides a tremendous boost of confidence to our hard working students, faculty and staff as the program celebrates its 50th anniversary and continued designation as a Board of Governors Program of Excellence at WVU,\" said Amy Funk, director of the Dental Hygiene Program. \"The McMechen Hock Family gifts will forever be an important part of our School's legacy.\" Funk added, \"The WVU Dental Hygiene Program is thankful to have a true advocate in Deborah McMechen Hock. Many students suffer with anxiety because they know they will graduate with a large amount of student debt. Generous scholarships such as the McMechen Hock Family Scholarship help alleviate this anxiety, thereby allowing the students to concentrate on their didactic, clinical, research, and service components in the curriculum.\"Along with the planned gift and endowed scholarship, other gifts from the Hocks include funding for the conference room on the Health Sciences campus for use by dental hygiene students and staff from the School of Dentistry and WVU's dental hygiene program. The funds for the renovation of the room were given in memory of Deborah's parents, Ruth Gardner Salmons McMechen and Dr. Charles Reid McMechen. Deborah graduated from WVU's Dental Hygiene Program in 1968. She then spent two and a half years as a dental hygienist in Richmond, Virginia, before continuing her studies at the University of Missouri where she earned a master's degree in dental hygiene education. Deborah has served as a clinical instructor at the University of Tennessee and as a clinical instructor at the Ohio State University Dental School Division of Dental Hygiene. She was also the assistant director of the Caruth School of Dental Hygiene, Baylor College of Dentistry, and served on the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners Dental Hygiene Advisory Board. She is now living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Deborah knew she wanted to pursue a future in the dental field. She spent numerous summers throughout high school and during her time in the dental hygiene program at WVU working as a dental assistant in her father's office. She attributes her successful career path in dental hygiene education not only to her father, but also to her mother who was a school teacher. \"In the coming years, my dream would be for each graduating class to work as a group to pool funds representing their class for an annual scholarship. Also, it would be wonderful to urge graduates to make a donation in their will toward a financial gift that would be a legacy and tribute, giving back for the careers they have as a result of their education at WVU.\"DENTAL HYGIENE ALUM ADDS TO SCHOLARSHIP THROUGH ESTATE PLAN 24 DEBORAH MCMECHEN HOCK WITH TWO RECIPIENTS OF THE MCMECHEN HOCK FAMILY SCHOLARSHIP FOR DENTAL HYGIENE, ALEXA BLATT (LEFT) AND BRENNA CRISER GOODSON (RIGHT).MEDICINE: Jerry and Susan Dorsch both graduated from the WVU School of Medicine and went on to residency and careers in anesthesiology, authoring multiple successful books on anesthesia equipment along the way. A medical crisis inspired a new direction, and now they are supporting research to improve medical treatments for others going through the same things they experienced. In May 2015, the couple established the Jerry and Susan Dorsch Department of Anesthesiology Research Fund, the first endowed research fund in the department. Jerry and Susan never waited for someone else to find an answer to a problem. During their residencies, realizing the need for a resource on anesthesia equipment, they co-authored Understanding Anesthesia Equipment , which became known as \"the Bible on anesthesia equipment.\" First published in 1975, the book is now in its fifth edition. \"We caught the wave of burgeoning technology in the field,\" said Susan. \"Technology and equipment were, in large part, responsible for tremendous improvements that were occurring in anesthesia safety.\" The Dorsches were involved with the controversial 1982 ABC Television 20/20 program \"The Deep Sleep\" that gave prime-time coverage to unsafe anesthesia practices. The dramatic expose featured a patient who suffered brain damage from hypoxia and caused much public debate and pressure for action. Ultimately, this show prompted safety reforms that substantially reduced anesthesia professional liability premiums. \" Anesthesia became much safer, and a lot of that had to do with improved technology and safer equipment,\" Susan said. Susan still serves on several standards committees, including one in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). \"Somebody had to be first,\" said Susan, reflecting on her days as a female physician in the 1970s balancing a busy family with her husband, Jerry. \" A trailblazer? Yes,\" she said. \"I was the first chief of the Department of Anesthesiology at Riverside Hospital, and I was also the first to head a committee at Saint Vincent's Hospital, both in Jacksonville, Florida.\" Susan and Jerry's long marriage of nearly 50 years has been a true partnership. The couple pursued their education in anesthesia as a way to balance their work and family life. Life took a turn in 2011 when Jerry suffered a stroke and became paralyzed on the right side of his body. As he began to recover, they became interested in using electrical muscle stimulation, which causes muscle contraction, to prevent muscle loss or contracture (permanent shortening of a muscle or joint), which often occurs in bedridden patients. \"When a patient suffers a contracture, they are stuck with it for life, and most of the time it could've been prevented with immediate therapy,\" said Susan. She spent hours following the instructions of physical and occupational therapists, passively exercising the muscles in Jerry's limbs. At the same time, she began to explore electrical stimulation as a way of preventing contractures. In 2015, inspired by a desire for further investigations in this area, Susan and Jerry decided to make a gift to the School of Medicine to fund research. \"When I see someone suffering from a contracture, I keep thinking, 'Gee, that could've been prevented,'\" MAKING PROGRESS HAPPEN, MAKING LIVES BETTER 25 JERRY AND SUSAN DORSCH THE DORSCH TEXTBOOKS said Susan. \"I think electrical stimulation therapy used early on could really work wonders, but we need the right study to show it.\" Thanks to Jerry and Susan, that study is now under way in the form of an inter-professional pilot project. The project is bringing WVU anesthesiologists, physical therapists, and physiologists together to advance the study of electrical stimulation therapy in the treatment of patients in the intensive care unit. NURSING: Patricia \"Joy\" Maramba is passionate about nursing and about her alma mater, the WVU School of Nursing, where she is also a longtime faculty member.Joy recently created the $25,000 Maramba Family Endowed Scholarship for Nursing. Joy earned her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees from the School and is the current president of its Alumni Association. She also has been on the faculty for 16 years, teaching critical care nursing and leadership in the undergraduate program. She continues to practice as a bedside RN at Ruby Memorial Hospital. \"My family has strong ties to West Virginia and WVU,\" said Joy. \"While my Dad moved around during his medical training, Beckley has been our home since 1970, and my three siblings and I all attended WVU,\" she said. Joy's devotion to the School of Nursing is evident. \"I think we have a crazy strong nursing program. Our graduates do great things and write back and tell us how well prepared they feel. I love the commitment of the faculty and their pride in wanting to produce qualified, caring nurses,\" she said. \"WVU prepared me extremely well for my career. As a student, the faculty presented me with many opportunities that shaped what I'm doing now, helping me secure pivotal experiences\u2014an ICU nurse externship, teaching assistantships, publishing opportunities . . . I hope to do the same for our graduates,\" she added. Joy said that her parents discouraged her from working while she was in school, because they wanted her to concentrate on her studies. \"I see a lot of students who can't focus on school because they have so many other responsibilities. I hope in a small way this scholarship can give them a break,\" she said. Joy combined current and planned giving to create the scholarship, which will benefit undergraduate students in the School of Nursing.\"Joy Maramba is passionate about educating our future nurses, and that passion extends beyond her teachings in the classroom,\" said Tara Hulsey, dean of the School of Nursing. \"Because of her giving and caring spirit, future nursing students will be able to pursue their dreams at the West Virginia University School of Nursing through the Maramba Family Endowed Scholarship for Nursing.\"JOY MARAMBA: NURSE, TEACHER, GIVER DR.

STEVENSON AT HIS RETIREMENT CELEBRATION. ROSA RECEIVED THE IMELDA DEEGAN STEVENSON SCHOLARSHIP ALL FOUR YEARS SHE WAS A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE STUDENT. 27MEDICINE: Gracious, soft-spoken, sincere, and grateful about his successes and advancements in treating mental illness, Jim Stevenson, MD, retired as the longest serving psychiatry chair for a school of medicine in the United States, from 1979 to 2014, and one of WVU's longest serving department chairs. Not only has Stevenson made a tremendous impact on behavioral medicine in the state, in his retirement he remains committed to WVU Medicine. A philanthropist himself, Stevenson is serving as the associate dean of development to advance WVU Medicine through private philanthropic support. Stevenson's passion and dedication to healthcare in West Virginia, paired with his dedication to WVU, is evident from his long and successful career. Helping to shape early treatment programs for severe mental illness, Stevenson acted as a catalyst for the progressive improvement of mental health treatment. As the executive medical director starting in 1987, Stevenson's influence helped build WVU Medicine's Chestnut Ridge Center into the leading regional referral center in the state. Through his experience as the state medical director for behavioral health services, Stevenson came to fully appreciate and comprehend the challenges associated in developing policy needed to shape the future of mental health services in West Virginia. \"Behavioral and mental health illnesses permeate all areas of medicine, and people with mental disorders have long faced discrimination in healthcare. Creating any kind of change or improvement at the state and national level is an unbelievably difficult job,\" Stevenson said. Demonstrated by his clinical and academic appointments, and his role in development, Stevenson's colleagues and students say his passion and dedication are infectious.\"Dr. Stevenson's warmth, compassion, and enthusiasm for psychiatry and life in general is contagious,\" said Caitlin Wenzke, a postgraduate intern in psychiatry at the WVU School of Medicine. With the stigma of mental illness slowly diminishing, Dr. Stevenson still believes that WVU and West Virginia are poised to provide the best care to patients. Today Dr. Stevenson remains very active in the School of Medicine and is deeply committed to making a positive impact through philanthropy. In 1995, he established a scholarship in memory of his late wife, Dr. Imelda Deegan Stevenson. Dr. Imelda Deegan Stevenson was a Clarksburg native and 1987 graduate of the School of Medicine. CHILDREN'S : WVU Medicine Children's received a donation for $88,000 from the proceeds of the 19th Annual Ted Harriman Memorial Log-a-Load for Kids Auction, which was held on October 1, 2015, in Elkins.
