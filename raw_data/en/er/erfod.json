From Tradition Looks Forward, a history of the University of Vermont from 1791- 1904 by Julian Ira Lindsay Introduction Even before the fledgling Republic of Vermont joined the Union as the four\u00ad teenth state, its 1777 constitution called for a university which \"ought to be established by direction of the General Assembly.\" The provision was retained as Vermont moved toward statehood, although it was 1791 before the pioneers of this largely raw and unsettled wilderness territory managed to act on the mat\u00ad ter and actually charter a university, to be located in the young town of Burl\u00ad ington on Lake Champlain. Nine more years passed before, in 1800, the University of Vermont was finally set in motion with a president-professor and a handful of students. With the adoption, on November 3, 1791, of its charter, the University became the twentieth college in the United States and the fifth in New England, notable in view of the fact that only five of all the citizens in the new state were college- educated. Given the social and religious attitudes of eighteenth century New England, the University was also remarkable in that it was the first in America to have it declared plainly in its charter that the \"rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give preference to any religious sect or denomination what\u00ad soever.\" Thus did the founding Legislature of Vermont establish a university which was to develop like no other in the fledgling nation. While the enabling legislation provided for funding to come from rents, those were often fixed at \"$.25 per acre as long as grass is green and water runs,\" and in any event were not reliably collectable. One result is the tradition, born of necessity, which has seen The University of Vermont develop in many of the same ways as the private institutions of the country have developed, with a substantial reliance on alumni and other private philanthropy. Today, the University's appropriation from the State of Vermont is about 17 per\u00ad cent of the total operating budget of $96 million. The largest single share (about 31 percent) is obtained from student tuition. Grants and contracts account for about 22 percent of the budget and the remainder comes from alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales, services, and auxiliary enterprises. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that edifice in 1824, its successor, for which General Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill\u2014still in use today\u2014was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the buildings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and The Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by state funding, did not come until 1907. Other buildings made possible by private philanthropy include Waterman Memorial, Southwick, Fleming Museum, Converse, Dewey, and Lafayette Halls, Medical Alumni and Given Medical Buildings, Dana Medical Library, the Patrick Gymnasium, Gutterson Field House, and Forbush Pool complex, and, most recently, the Howe addition to the Bailey Library. 4 INTRODUCTION | 5 Ground will be broken during 1981 for a building to house the programs of the School of Natural Resources to be named the George D. Aiken Center for Natural Resources. The funding for this building will come from a combination of private and state funding. The University of Vermont was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and univer\u00ad sities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, especially for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical education which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities\u2014those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education.\" For example, she noted that the University is believed to be the first non-military institution to have offered engineering courses. The University pioneered in yet another area of society, that of giving women equal status with men in higher education. In 1871, the University defied custom and admitted two women as students and four years later was the first institution in the country to admit women to full membership in the scholarly society, Phi Beta Kappa. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Chapel grounds is a memorial to a late nineteenth century graduate of this University, philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still debated with passionate vigor. During 1980-81, 7,938 students were enrolled in the seven undergraduate col\u00ad leges and schools\u2014the Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, Education and Social Services, and Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration, and the Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Natural Resources, and Nursing\u2014and 943 were enrolled in the Graduate College and 358 in the College of Medicine. Beginning with the year 1981-82, the present College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration will be reorganized into a College of Engineering and Mathematics and a School of Business Administration. The campus of the University of Vermont is located in Burlington, the state's largest city. Within a greater Burlington area of 100,000 people, the city with its population of 38,000 enjoys magnificent views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains to the west and Vermont's Green Mountains to the east. THE UNIVERSITY'S MISSION Combining the heritage of a private university with that of a land-grant institu\u00ad tion, the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College embraces a broad range of instructional and research programs in the liberal disciplines and in the professions, and, as well, focuses a significant portion of its resources on serving the practical concerns of the citizens of the state. The blend of these characteristics is reflected in the student body, drawn from Vermont and throughout the nation. The University is at once a local and a national resource and, because of its moderate size, is accurately characterized as a comprehensive university with the teaching environment of a college. The University of Vermont is dedicated to the advancement, transmission, and application of knowledge through teaching, research and scholarly pursuits, and public service. Its faculty and students participate in enhancing the understand\u00ad6 | INTRODUCTION ing of self and of environment. Exposed to the range of human achievement, stimulated by a spirit of inquiry and intellectual rigor, faculty and students are enabled to develop and extend their knowledge. The curricula of the undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs pro\u00ad vide a balance between response to changing societal needs and the preservation and enhancement of the foundations of liberal education. The University offers a rich environment for research, scholarship, and creative work in many realms of human inquiry, sharing the excitement and fruits of investigation and creation with students and society. Through a variety of research, extension, continuing education, and other programs, the University provides assistance, in its special partnership with the state, in the solution of human, social, technological, en\u00ad vironmental, and educational problems of the citizens of Vermont. Supporting the mission of the University are the services and academic programs described in this catalogue and, in addition, the following: THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES In the Bailey/Howe Library, the main unit of the University libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Ver\u00ad mont, and maintains a representative collection of major periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications. The Special Collections Department in\u00ad cludes the Wilbur Collection of Vermontiana, rare books, literary and historical manuscripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with the state and the federal government. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Waterman Building contain the permanent, official records of the University. VERMONT EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION Vermont Educational Television is the public television network and owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network provides an instructional service to schools, college courses for credit, programs for children out-of-school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Education Network and Public Broadcasting Service programs. Locally produced programs address the concerns and issues of Vermonters. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Burlington; WVTB, nel 20, WVTA, channel 41, Wind\u00ad sor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Bennington. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE Extension Service agents in every Vermont county simplify and quickly spread the knowledge of UVM's resources and research directly to Vermonters so latest findings can be put to work. This \"grassroots\" approach which reaches nearly all Vermont residents has trig\u00ad gered rapid advances in agriculture, community and natural resources, youth development, and home economics. INTRODUCTION | 7 MORGAN HORSE FARM The Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont, has been a shrine for Morgan Horse lovers for more than a century. The Morgan breed dates back to 1789 when the first small but powerful stallion was born to a mare owned by school teacher Justin Morgan. The Morgan Farm was established in 1878 by Joseph Battell of Middlebury who compiled the first volume of the Morgan Horse Registry and constructed the farm landmark, an ornate Victorian barn with mansard roof. In 1907, Battell deeded the farm to the U.S. Government, which in 1951 turned the farm over to the University of Vermont. The farm has become a laboratory for UVM students and the focal point for Morgan Horse lovers around the world. The farm continues to host thousands of visitors annually. A versatile, highly intelligent horse, the Morgan is Vermont's State Animal. The breeding program at the Morgan Farm has produced numerous blue ribbon win\u00ad ners at the National Morgan Horse Show. ENDOWED CHAIRS Since the establishment of the Williams Professorship in Mathematics in 1853, the University has been the recipient of a number of generous endowments in\u00ad tended to support teaching and research in various academic fields.

Fall financial aid information should be submitted by March 1 for freshmen and May 1 for transfers. Early Notification for Vermont Students An early notification program is available for prospective freshmen who are Vermont residents (see residency rules, page 44). Vermonters applying under this program will be notified concerning admission during mid-December if the ap\u00ad plication, high school transcript, official (sent directly from College Board) report of SAT scores, and recommendations have been received by November 1. Students who receive offers of admission under this program will have until May 1 to respond. Admissions Criteria Qualification for admission is determined on the basis of the secondary school record, rank in graduating class, recommendations, and College Entrance Ex\u00ad amination Board Scholastic Aptitude Test results. College Board Achievement Tests and additional information may also be requested by the Admissions Of\u00ad fice. Each application is carefully reviewed by the Admissions Office staff and, in some cases, by the college or school to which the student is applying. The can\u00ad didate's record is thoroughly examined in order to determine whether the student has adequately prepared for the academic program of his/her choice. All qualified Vermont freshmen applicants will be offered admission. Non-resident applicants are competing for admission and will be selected on the basis of overall academic qualifications, leadership potential, special talents, and ability to add to the diversity of the undergraduate population. 10 ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY | 11 Sons and daughters of alumni of the University of Vermont are encouraged to apply and are given special consideration. Increasing competition means that the University must evaluate the application of each alumni son or daughter in terms of the total number of applications, their relative qualifications, and the limita\u00ad tion which must be placed on the number of applicants who may be offered ad\u00ad mission to the various academic programs which are available. Most prospective freshmen are expected to present at least 16 high school units, including a minimum of four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of social sciences, two years of a foreign language, and two years of science. The three years of mathematics should be two years of algebra and one year of geometry. Students who plan to specialize in engineering, forestry, mathematics, or science should present both a second year of algebra and a course in trigonometry for a total of four years of mathematics. Students applying to business administration are expected to be enrolled in the college preparatory curriculum at the high school level. These students should present a strong background in mathematics and have a generous exposure to the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Students planning to major in an allied health science must have taken high school courses in biology and chemistry, while physics is highly recommended. Physics is required for students planning to major in physical therapy. For students planning to major in professional nur\u00ad sing, a high school course in chemistry is required and courses in biology and physics are highly recommended. For students planning to major in technical nursing, biology is required; chemistry and physics are recommended. For students planning to major in most programs in the College of Agriculture, courses in biology and chemistry are recommended. Exceptionally qualified students may in some instances be admitted even though they do not meet the above requirements in full. Additional courses in mathematics, history, science, the fine arts and music, and a third year in foreign language are strongly recommended as desirable prepara\u00ad tion for college. In evaluating the secondary school record, careful attention is given to the course load a student has been carrying and any advanced work is given special consideration. A student planning to major in music must arrange for an audition and interview with the chairperson of the department prior to the deadline for completion of the application. Interviews and Visits Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impres\u00ad sions about the University. Prospective students may schedule an appointment with a current UVM student or a staff member on most weekdays during the academic year in order to gain information about the academic and non- academic aspects of undergraduate life. On most Saturday mornings while the University is in session, information group sessions will be held on campus for interested students and parents. Students should write or call the Admissions Office, (802) 656-3370, for addi\u00ad tional information about the group meetings or individual appointments. 12 | ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY New England Regional Student Program The University of Vermont is currently an active participant with the Univer\u00ad sities of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island and with Lowell University, Southeastern Massachusetts University, and the public four- year and two-year colleges and technical institutes in a program of regional cooperation aimed at increasing educational opportunities for qualified young men and women of the New England states. Under the program, New England residents are given tuition privileges in certain specialized curricula which are not offered by public institutions in their home state. New England students enrolled in regional student programs at the University of Vermont who are not residents of Vermont are charged 125 percent of the University's in-state tuition. A brochure detailing these specialized curricula has been prepared by the New England Board of Higher Education and is available through the Board, 68 Walnut Road, Wenham, Massachusetts 01984. Under the New England Regional Student Program, the University of Vermont offers the following undergraduate programs for the 1981-82 academic year: REGIONAL PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT TO STUDENTS FROM Canadian Area Studies CT, MA, NH, RI Dairy Technology ME, MA, NH, RI Dietetics NH Greek CT, ME, RI Latin RI Recreation Management CT, MA, RI Russian ME, NH Russian/Eastern European Area Studies ME, NH, RI Student Exchange: New England State Universities The six New England land-grant universities (Universities of Maine, New Hamp\u00ad shire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut) participate in an ex\u00ad change program to enable students at the sub-degree level to take advantage of a course or combination of courses not available at the home institution. In order to participate in the program, a state university student must: 1. Identify a course or combination of courses which is related to his/her area of academic interest and which is not available on the home campus. 2.

Applications for fall transfer should be complete by April 1, except for those students applying to the Allied Health Sciences or Professional Nursing. These students have a February 1 completion date. Transfer candidates should see that SAT scores and official transcripts of their high school and college records are sent to the Office of Admissions by the appropriate deadline. A transfer applicant may not disregard the record of any previous education received at another institution. 14 | ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY A student who transfers to the University from another accredited college or university may be given provisional credit for all courses satisfactorily com\u00ad pleted, provided that similar courses are counted toward graduation at the University of Vermont. Transfer credit is not allowed for work completed with grade \"D\" or its equivalent, unless a more advanced course in the same subject has been passed with a higher grade in the institution from which the student transfers. Please note: GRADES do NOT transfer. The quality point average of transfer students is computed on the work taken at the University of Vermont only. The credit is provisional, pending satisfactory completion of a semester's work at the University. The provisional transfer credits are fully granted if the student is in good standing at the end of the first semester. The determination of how transferred course(s) listed on the Evaluation of Transfer Credit form fit a specific degree program rests with the academic dean/director of the college/school in which the transfer student subsequently becomes a candidate for a degree. Advanced Placement Examinations The University welcomes Advanced Placement Examinations in all areas under the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB). Credit is granted for Grades of 3, 4, and 5 (a Grade of 2 in Mathematics BC). No college grade is assigned when APP credit is granted. Instead, credit is recorded on the student's permanent academic record for specific University courses. No fee, beyond that charged by CEEB, is assessed for such college credit. Appropriateness and applicability of the Advanced Placement Examina\u00ad tion credit is determined by the dean/director of the college/school in which the student is subsequently a candidate for a degree. Credit by Examination A degree student who wishes to do so may, under the following conditions, receive credit for a course by taking a special examination and paying the special examination fee charge of $25 per credit hour. The examination fee must be paid prior to taking the examination. A request for such an examination must be made in writing at least one month before the date of the examination, and it must be approved by the student's ad\u00ad visor, the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, and the academic dean/director, in that sequence. The student must neither have audited, previously received a grade or mark, or have attempted a prior special examination in this course at the University of Vermont or at any other institu\u00ad tion of higher education. The student may not take a special examination in a course whose content is presupposed by other courses the student has already taken. In cases of uncertainty, the department chairperson shall decide whether it is appropriate for the student to take a special examination for credit in a par\u00adADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY | 15 ticular course. Upon passing the special examination, as determined by the ex\u00ad aminer and the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, the student receives credit, but not a grade, for the course. Credit by examination forms are available in the Office of the Registrar. College-Level Examination Program The University grants a maximum of six hours of credit for the following minimal total scores on the General Examinations: English Composition (600), Humanities (500), Mathematics (500), and Social Sciences-History (500). Each General Examination yields a total score reported on a scale that ranges from a low of 200 to a high of 800. Each General Examination, with the exception of English Composition, has two subscores, reported on a scale ranging from a low of 20 to a high of 80, which describe achievement on the subdivisions of the test. Three semester hours of credit is granted for a subscore of 50 or higher. The minimum creditable score on CLEP Subject Examinations is the average score of students who earned a grade of \"B\" in a comparable college course. These scores fall between 50 and 57 on a 20 - 80 range of scores. To learn the score required for credit in a specific examination, contact the Office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. Credit granted for CLEP Examinations may be applied toward distribution re\u00ad quirements and to the total semester hours specified for a particular degree pro\u00ad gram when approved by the dean/director of the college/school in which the student is subsequently a candidate for a degree. Information about CLEP and application forms are available at the Counseling and Testing Center, 146 South Williams Street. Credit for Military Service A veteran who has been accepted into a degree program may, upon presentation of DD Form 214 (Report of Transfer or Discharge), receive military studies credit for this experience in those divisions of the University in which credit for Reserve Officers' Training Corps courses is allowed. Exemption from the physical educa\u00ad tion requirement is given for service of more than one year. The University accepts college level credit earned through the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) formerly the United States Armed Forces Institute (USAFI).

To be eligible to apply for financial aid, a student must be a U.S. citizen or in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose and intend to become a permanent resident. A student must also be enrolled at least half-time (sue credits) in a degree program. Students who believe they are unable to meet college expenses, are urged to apply to the Office of Finan\u00ad cial Aid for assistance in the form of grants, loans, and employment. Entering undergraduate students who wish to apply for aid may do so by: (1) indicating their inten\u00ad tion on the Admissions Application Form, and (2) submitting the Family Financial State\u00ad ment (FFS) directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa, or the Financial Aid Form (FAF) to the College Scholarship Service in Princeton, New Jersey. These forms may be obtained from local high schools or by request to the Office of Finan\u00ad cial Aid, 330 Waterman Building, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405. ALL STUDENTS REQUESTING AID SHOULD ALSO APPLY TO THE Pell Grant Pro\u00ad gram (formerly BEOG) (check appropriate section of the FFS or FAF) and your state agency (for Vermonters: Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (VSAC), 5 Burlington Square, Burlington, VT 05401).

They must also submit the Family Financial Statement (FFS) or the Financial Aid Form (FAF). Both forms are available early in the spring semester from the Office of Financial Aid. Preference is given to those students who have complete applications on file by May 1. Applications received after that date will be processed in chronological order according to the date received, subject to the availability of funds. In addition to University loans and grants the University participates in the federal Sup\u00ad plemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, the National Direct Student Loan Pro\u00ad gram, the College Work-Study Program, both the Nursing Health Profession Grant and Nursing Health Profession Loan Program, and the Medical Health Profession Loan Pro\u00ad gram. On the basis of the Financial Aid Application and the financial information ac\u00ad companying it, applicants will be considered automatically for all such programs for which they are eligible. Aid is most often awarded in combinations or \"packages\" of the various types of aid. Almost all awards include some loan or work-study; the application lets the student state a preference. Financial aid funds are limited. Accordingly, all assistance offered by the Financial Aid Of\u00ad fice is based on a calculated determination of financial need which considers the following factors: 1. STUDENT BUDGET, comprised of tuition, required fees, room and board, books and supplies, and moderate personal expenses. 2. EXPECTED PARENTAL SHARE of educational cost as determined by the financial aid application. 3. STUDENT SELF-HELP, usually from earnings or private loans or savings. 4. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES, such as private scholarships/grants, state agency awards, etc. Standard student budgets for the 1981-82 academic year are shown below. Actual costs for subsequent years may be higher if tuition, fees, and/or housing increase. STUDENT EXPENSES | 23 SINGLE In-State Out-of-State Tuition $1,875 1,504 1,504 Books/Supplies 250 250 Totals $8,793 $11,980 * For dependent children the budget is increased by $1,000 for the first child, $800 for the second child, and $600 for each additional child. ** Average cost reflects additional allowance for meals above minimum plan and is used for both on-and off-campus students. Undergraduates seeking fellowships for graduate study, such as The Danforth Graduate Fellowship and The Rhodes Scholarship, should make initial inquiries in the Dean's Office of the College of Arts and Sciences or in the Office of the Graduate College. The University of Vermont awards financial aid without consideration of sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, or physical/mental handicap. 330 Waterman Building (802) 656-3156 Tuition Refunds CANCELLATIONS Returning students who notify their academic dean/ director and the Registrar in writing before the semester begins that they will not be attending the University that semester, will receive a refund.

In no case will a refund be made after the first day of classes of the following semester. STUDENTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID For students receiving financial aid, change in student status or credit hour load may result in revision or loss of that financial aid, depending on the regulations of the particular aid programs involved; and, except when aid program regulations specify otherwise, any such change which reduces the student's University charges will usually result in a matching reduction of the financial aid award, with that reduction prorated among all aid sources making up the award. Such reduction of aid will usually require immediate repayment of the aid so reduced. Student Life Division of Student Affairs A STATEMENT OF MISSION It should be recognized that students are going through a period of rapid per\u00ad sonal growth while on the college campus. In addition to developing new academic skills, they are being challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investigate new life styles. They are exploring future career options and learning social and interpersonal skills. Therefore, the broad focus of the Division of Student Affairs at the University of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense personal development and intellectual growth, in addition to playing a leader\u00ad ship role in developing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the institution. To accomplish this mission the student life areas are divided into various func\u00ad tional departments and programs. Each of these provides or coordinates support services and educational experiences to meet student needs. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center provides a service to assist individuals and groups to live more effectively and confidently through a greater understanding of their life situation, the nature of change, and the process of making decisions and choices.

An opera or musical show is generally presented each year and faculty, senior, and monthly department recitals are scheduled throughout the year. The University Band appears at athletic events, presents formal concerts, and makes a spring concert tour. The University Choir and the Choral Union give three annual concerts and the Madrigal Singers sing for various groups around the state. The University Orchestra presents two annual concerts, and assists the Choir in a third. The Music Department is located in a new music building, located behind Redstone and Southwick on the Redstone Campus. The building houses the of\u00ad fices of the department as well as a beautiful recital hall accommodating one of the finest organs in the Northeast. The new facility serves as a showcase for the musical talents of the department and its students, as well as those students seek\u00ad ing musical activity as a part of their extracurricular life on campus. STUDENT LIFE | 31 THE GEORGE BISHOP LANE ARTISTS' SERIES .. The George Bishop Lane Artists' Series should include musical productions and...other theatrical and artistic productions (and) should be open to the students of the University of Vermont and the public generally....\" \u2014from the will of Mrs. George B. Lane (April 27, 1954) Since Mrs. Nellie Lane's generous bequest to the University of Vermont, the Lane Series has presented well over 650 concert and stage productions, over 100 film programs, and many events programmed especially for children. More than one million tickets have been purchased for performances that have included the ma\u00ad jor artists, entertainers, and performances of the time. Each Lane Series season has presented a carefully balanced program of the best in classical music, dance, opera, the theatre, and jazz, rock, and/or folk music. Performances have included such orchestras at the Chicago Symphony under the direction of Sir Georg Solti, and the London Symphony Orchestra under Herbert Von Karajan; dance has included such events as a full-length SLEEPING BEAU\u00ad TY with Dame Margot Fonteyn, the Martha Graham Dance Company, Alvin Ailey, and the Joffrey Ballet. Jazz and popular music have been an important part of the Lane Season with appearances by Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Simon and Garfunkle, and Joan Baez and Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. Soloists have been a prominent feature of the Lane Series with appearances by Arthur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, Marcel Marceau, Beverly Sills, Julian Bream, Rudolph Serkin, and Lily Tomlin. Active not only in Burlington, the Lane Series has maintained state-wide ac\u00ad tivities with series in St. Johnsbury, Brattleboro, and Springfield. In 1973, the Lane Series helped found and manage the Vermont Mozart Festival, and in the summer of 1976 helped found Stowe Performing Arts, a festival of outdoor events in Vermont's ski capital. As a result of all of these activities, the Lane Series has led the way to the establishment of the Green Mountain Consortium for the Performing Arts, the membership of which represents virtually all presenters of the performing arts in Vermont. THE ROBERT HULL FLEMING MUSEUM The Fleming Museum houses a distinguished teaching collection of art and ethnography. Originally founded as the Park Gallery in 1873, the collection owes much of its growth to the generosity of alumni and other friends. The O.B. Read American Plains Indian Collection and the David B. Pitman ('32) and Henry Schnakenberg Collections of American art are notable examples. The spacious Marble Court is a center of activity. Along with visiting exhibitions of wide variety, changing exhibitions are organized by faculty and students in museum studies, art history, and studio art, often in collaboration with the Departments of Religion, History, Anthropology, and historic preservation. Lectures, gallery talks, recitals, and children's tours serve the community at large. Many activities are supported by Museum membership, which is open to all. A center for the study of art history and museology, the Museum houses the Art Department collection of 75,000 slides and photographs, audio-visual class and seminar rooms, as well as a reference library for art research. 32 | STUDENT LIFE HONORARY AND RECOGNITION SOCIETIES Honorary and recognition societies exist on the University of Vermont campus to recognize student contributions to the University community and student leadership in campus life. There are a few local societies, i.e. Boulder Society, that acknowledge individuals by class. National Honorary Societies represented on the University of Vermont campus include: The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Chapter at the University in 1848, and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing with emphasis on a broad distribution of liberal studies. A detailed statement of the criteria used is available from the chapter president. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to initiate women into member\u00ad ship. Mortar Board is a national society for senior women and men. Although membership in Mortar Board comes as a high honor for a University of Vermont student in recognition of outstanding service, scholarship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholarship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the college campus. The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, initiates those who have proven their ability to do research in one of the sciences, including students who have a high scholastic standing. Other national honorary societies include: Alpha Omega Alpha, medicine; Alpha Zeta, agriculture; Kappa Delta Pi, education; Tau Beta Pi, engineering; Omicron Nu, home economics; Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, debating; Sigma Phi Alpha, dental hygiene; National Collegiate Players, dramatics; Alpha Lambda Delta, freshman women's scholastic; Ethan Allen Rifles, outstanding students in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; Pershing Rifles, a military fraternity. Housing Any full-time student may apply to live in University residence halls but priority is given to full-time undergraduate students. All freshmen students, except those living at home and commuting, or those living with their spouses, must live in University housing. Housing is guaranteed for all freshmen who meet ap\u00ad propriate deadlines. Housing is not guaranteed for upper-class students and is determined by a lottery held in the spring of each year. Upper-class students who are actives or pledges of a fraternity or a sorority may register for University residence hall housing or chapter housing. On-campus housing is seldom available to transfer students entering UVM for the fall semester. The possibility of obtaining housing for the spring term is con\u00ad siderably better though not guaranteed. In recent years most transfer students have been offered housing for the semester beginning in January. STUDENT LIFE [ 33 RESIDENCE HALLS A residence hall is more than a place to sleep, store one's belongings, and study. It is a place where a student can take advantage of the various opportunities and experiences surrounding him or her. A diversity of residence halls and programs are offered. There are freshman halls, upper-class halls, coed halls, single sex halls, an environmental hall, and the Living and Learning Center (additional in\u00ad formation on the Living and Learning Center is on page 126. Each residence hall is under the guidance and direction of a Hall Advisor who is assisted by specially selected undergraduate Resident Assistants. These staff members encourage the development of intellectual, social, and cultural programs and assist the residents in their growth toward maturity and responsible self-direction. Each student in the residence halls is a member of his or her residence hall student government which represents student opinion and provides educational and social programs for its constituents. Contracts for room and board are binding for the college year unless cancelled for due cause with the approval of the Office of Residential Life. In August, each new student will receive notification of a housing assignment and the date of the opening of the residence halls. Rooms may not be occupied until the date specified. Each student is expected to leave the residence halls not later than 24 hours after his or her last examination at the close of each semester. All students living in the residence halls must have board contracts. Student rooms are equipped for comfortable residence hall living. Each double room has two beds, with mattress pads, two desks and chairs, bureau space for each student, two closets, and blinds or shades on the windows. Bookshelves are provided in some rooms. Students provide their own bed linen, towels, window draperies, pillows, wastebaskets, bureau covers, desk lamps, and reading lamps. Facilities for doing personal laundry are provided in residence areas as well as space for storage of trunks, baggage, bicycles, and skis during the academic year. The Department of Residential Life is located in Mansfield House, 25 Col\u00ad chester Avenue, (802) 656-3434. SINGLE STUDENT APARTMENTS In the fall of 1979, the University initiated an \"off-campus\" housing option ap\u00ad proximately five miles from campus at the former Fort Ethan Allen. There are a total of 31 apartments housing up to 12 students in each unit. Occupancy will be limited to undergraduates (excluding freshmen) or graduate students at the University with priority given to full-time undergraduates. All the apartment units have a large kitchen (furnished with a stove, refrigerator, and garbage disposal), living room (most with a working fireplace), and one bedroom on the first floor. The other bedrooms and a full bath are on the second floor. Many apartments also have a small bathroom with shower on the first floor. In addition to the kitchen equipment, a coin-operated washer and dryer will be provided in each apartment as well as a single bed for each occupant. All other furnishings are to be provided by the tenant(s). One building has been set aside as a Community Center. This facility has space for meetings, parties, recreation, and study. Three tennis courts, adjacent to the apartments, are available on a first come, first use basis. 34 | STUDENT LIFE Apartments may be leased for a nine- or a twelve-month period. Rental charges include all utilities (except telephone), use of tennis courts and recreational areas, and use of the shuttle bus. The bus will operate during the academic year, ten hours per day (Monday through Friday) between the apartments and the main campus. Detailed rental information may be obtained from the Ethan Allen Housing Of\u00ad fice, 503 Dalton Drive, Winooski, Vermont 05404. MARRIED STUDENT HOUSING There are 131 University-owned apartments designated for married students, located just outside Winooski at Fort Ethan Allen. About five miles from Cam\u00ad pus, on Route 15, the apartments are close to a shopping center, hospitals, and educational institutions. These apartments are divided into two complexes. County Apartments, completed in 1970, consist of 89 unfurnished units; 42 two- bedroom apartments on either the first or second floor, 14 one-bedroom apart\u00ad ments on the first floor and 33 two-bedroom townhouse apartments in 11 two- story buildings. Located in the center of these buildings is a Community Center containing laundry facilities and a large multipurpose room. There are three parking areas within this complex. Each apartment is furnished with an electric stove, refrigerator, water heater, kitchen cabinets, shelves, garbage disposal and wall-to-wall carpeting. The apartments are heated electrically and each room is individually controlled. The other section, called Ethan Allen Apartments, is former military officers' quarters built between 1895 and 1933. There are 15 buildings with one to five apartments in each. Thirty-one apartments in this complex have two bedrooms, and 11 have three bedrooms. Many have basement or attic storage areas. These apartments have no carpeting, but stoves, refrigerators, and garbage disposals are provided. The cost of the fuel oil heating is included in the rent of about half the apartments. In the others, the tenants are billed directly by the fuel company. Detailed rental information may be obtained from the Manager of Ethan Allen Housing, 503 Dalton Drive, Fort Ethan Allen, Winooski, Vermont 05404. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING University students eligible to live off campus may utilize the facilities of the Residential Life Office in locating housing in the greater Burlington area. This of\u00ad fice provides a free listing service by which community landlords and rental agents are able to make known their housing availability to students at the University. Students may examine up-to-date listings for available apartments, houses, rooms, and roommate requests on a bulletin board just off the College Street en\u00ad trance of Waterman Building on the main campus. The University is not respon\u00ad sible for the approval of off-campus housing facilities. It is impractical to send information concerning individual listings by mail. A catalogue of available listings is issued each May, August, and December. To reserve a catalogue, contact the Office of Residential Life, 25 Colchester Avenue, Burlington, Vermont 05401. General Information This section offers a summary of regulations and procedures for registra\u00ad tion, change of enrollment, grades, and advisement. It also gives a brief ex\u00ad planation of withdrawal, leave of absence, readmission rules, undergraduate degree requirements, and residency rules. The importance of these regulations and procedures cannot be underestimated. REGISTRATION Students in attendance must preregister for the next semester at the designated time. Unless excused in advance by the dean/director of the college/school concerned, students who do not preregister will be considered as dropped and may apply for readmission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Written approval of the student's dean/director is required to preregister for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective academic advising involves an established rapport between student and teacher. Accordingly, each new student is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admission to the University. The student remains under the guidance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a departmental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic planning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especially during the preregistration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the dean/director of their college/school. Each academic unit within the University maintains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a variety of other advising resources of\u00ad fices available to University undergraduates. The Academic Advising Center: assists students who are undecided about their academic plans. The Center also helps students with complaints and grievances about course instruc\u00ad tions, scheduling, and other academically-related problems. Pre-Health Advisor: assists undergraduate students with the admissions requirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is maintained which includes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogues, and premedical education jour\u00ad nals. Pre-Law Advising: the UVM Pre-Law Committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions regarding career options in law. Advising also includes specific in\u00ad formation on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogues is maintained for interested students. Pre-Veterinary Advising: is available to discuss plans for graduate school and employment in animal science career areas. A selection of catalogues, pamphlets, and other related literature is maintained. International Students and Scholars Advising: verifies immigration status, interprets immigration laws and immigration forms to foreign students, faculty, and scholars. American students planning to study abroad should also make their plans through this office. 35 36 | GENERAL INFORMATION Minority Student Advising: is an effort to meet the needs of students entering the University who demonstrate that additional support services are needed. Incoming freshman minority students may elect to take part in a \"Summer Enrichment Pro\u00ad gram\" held on campus for a month (three credits). Center for Career Development: assists students who are exploring a variety of poten\u00ad tial career options early in their academic careers. A library of career information and school catalogues is maintained. Veterans Affairs Advising: advises students of their G.I. Bill benefits in education. Counseling and referral on academic matters are available to veterans. ADD/DROP/WITHDRAWAL 1. Courses may be added or dropped only during the first three weeks of classes. After the first week of classes, the instructor may refuse to allow the add if certain material may not be made up (e.g. laboratories) and the loss of this work would seriously af\u00ad fect the quality of educational experience gained by the student in the course. In any case, faculty would not be required to give make-up exams, papers, or quizzes. 2. No drops will be allowed after the third week except in cases where the student is enrolled by administrative error and has not attended the course. The disposition of such cases would be handled entirely by the Registrar's Office. 3. From the end of the third week to the end of the ninth week of classes, a student may withdraw from a course. A student who wishes to withdraw would fill out the course withdrawal form, consult with his/her advisor, and submit the form to the instructor. The instructor would record an evaluation of the student's work. The evaluation op\u00ad tions are shown below: WP: Withdraw passing WF: Withdraw failing The instructor will send one copy to the Registrar to be recorded on the transcript. The student will bring a copy to his/her dean for information purposes. The instruc\u00ad tor will also record the withdrawal grade (WP or WF) on the final grade sheet which is sent to the Registrar. 4. Between the end of the ninth week and the last day of classes, a student may withdraw from one or more courses only by demonstrating to his/her college or school studies committee, through a written petitionary process, that he/she is unable to continue in the course(s) due to circumstances beyond his/her control. Such petition must contain conclusive evidence, properly documented, of the illness or other situation which prevents completion of the course(s). Acceptable reasons would not include dissatisfaction with performance or expected grade, with the course or instructor, or desire to change major or program. If the petition is approved, a grade(s) of \"WP\" or \"WF\" will be assigned by the instructor(s) and recorded on the student's permanent record. If the petition is denied, the instructor(s) will assign a final grade (\"A\"\u2014\"F\") in accordance with the same criteria applied to all other students in the course(s). 5. No withdrawals are permitted after the last day of classes. 6. The grade of WP will not enter into the GPA. The grade of WF will enter the GPA as anF. 7. The grade of \"W\" no longer is used so it is deleted from the set of available options. PASS \u2014NO PASS PASS \u2014 NO PASS course enrollments were approved by the University Senate for im\u00ad plementation in September, 1968. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program student, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (three courses for two-year students; or as many courses as he/she has semesters remaining for future transfer students) during his/her undergraduate career on a GENERAL INFORMATION | 37 pass-no pass basis, beginning in his/her sophomore year (second semester of his/her first year for two-year students). These courses may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only free electives (without con\u00ad dition) may be taken as pass-no pass. This option may not be used for electives within the distribution requirements of a college or department. Students who have enrolled in ineligi\u00ad ble distribution elective courses on a pass-no pass basis prior to September 1, 1974, shall not be penalized. The student must complete all work normally required in these courses and he/she will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS. Neither \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade-point average. SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January, 1974: Physical education (activity) courses, whether taken to fulfill a requirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass-no pass basis and shall not be counted as a part of the six standard courses described above. Procedure: 1. Obtain a PASS \u2014 NO PASS Request Form from the Registrar's Office and consult the academic advisor. 2. Obtain the advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as pass-no pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college/school dean or director. 3. Submit the request to be placed on pass-no pass status at the Registrar's Office during the first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students may not take courses on pass-no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the dean/director and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Director of Continuing Education is necessary for auditing courses in the Evening Division or Summer Session. GUIDELINES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES 1. Independent study is an education experience (taken for credit) which occurs outside the traditional \"classroom/laboratory\" setting. The project is faculty supervised and tailored to fit the interests of a specific student. 2. Independent study will be under the direct supervision of a faculty member having expertise in the area of investigation and consequently the project will be done in the department which is primarily responsible for the field of study in question. 3. Prior to enrollment in independent study, the student must obtain the approval of his/her advisor, faculty sponsor, and the faculty sponsor's department chairperson. 4. Independent study may be taken for variable credit. The amount of credit to be granted should be mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty sponsor at the time of enrollment. 5. When a project is to cover more than one term, the XC, rather than incomplete, should be used for the first term of work. 6. All departments in which a student may obtain \"service learning\" or \"field experience\" credit should list this option in their description of courses. If a department offers the 38 | GENERAL INFORMATION opportunity for both \"Readings and Research\" and \"Field Experience (service learn\u00ad ing, internships, etc.),\" these offerings should have different course numbers, titles, and catalogue descriptions. In the rare instance where one cannot differentiate bet\u00ad ween these two offerings, they may be listed under the same name. 7. All academic units offering independent study courses will be responsible for administering such work. Specific guidelines which define the responsibilities of both faculty and student in terms of administering the independent study project are given in Part 8. Alternative guidelines which incorporate the basic points in Part 8 are ac\u00ad ceptable. 8. Procedure: a. The success of an independent study project is often related to the amount of advanced planning expended on the project. Consequently, planning for the pro\u00ad ject should, whenever possible, be initiated in the semester before the course is taken. b. By the end of the add/drop period, students will be required to submit to their faculty sponsor a specific plan which must include, but not be limited to, the following: i. The project title. ii. A statement of justification, indicating why independent study is being selected and the reason for undertaking the project, its importance, and how it relates to other work done by the student. iii. A clear and complete statement of project objectives. iv. A concise statement of the plans and methods to be used in order to accomplish each objective. c. During the first full week of classes the student and the faculty sponsor will meet and prepare a document which includes the following: i. A schedule of dates when the student and faculty member will meet and discuss progress, including a time plan indicating when various parts of the work are projected for completion. ii. A list of those ways in which documentation of work can be shown. iii. A plan for evaluation, which will include the specific work to be submitted for evaluation on the project, and a statement of criteria to be used for evaluation, will also be included. d. It is the responsibility of the faculty supervisor to ensure that all the provisions in numbers 7 and 8 above have been satisfactorily accomplished. Copies of all documents and schedules mentioned in 8.b and 8.c must be filed with the depart\u00ad ment chairperson by the end of the add/drop period. Completed projects, along with faculty evaluations, should be retained in the faculty member's files, to be available for review, if necessary, by appropriate school and college committees. REPEATED COURSES A student who repeats a course loses any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the student's permanent academic record and is includ\u00ad ed in computing his/her cumulative grade average. ATTENDANCE Class Attendance: Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself/herself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. GENERAL INFORMATION | 39 Absence from Classes: Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. A student not present at the beginning of an exercise may be marked absent. RIGHT OF APPEAL Any student who believes that he/she has been unfairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to his/her academic dean/director. PRIORITY OF UNIVERSITY EXERCISES University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Atten\u00ad dance at: 1. regularly scheduled classes have priority over specially scheduled common hour examinations. 2. common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other activities. FINAL EXAMINATIONS REGULATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official University calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the dean/director of the college/school on request of the chairperson of the department. No examination shall be given during the last week of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examination are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is circulated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairperson of the department concerned when conditions seem to warrant such special arrangement. Decision on such requests rests with the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless excused by the instructor. 5. A student who is absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to his/her instructor within 24 hours. If the absence is due to any situation beyond the reasonable control of the student (e.g. illness or family tragedy), the instructor must provide the student with the opportuni\u00ad ty to complete the course requirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an examination or some other suitable project. The instructor may require evidence in support of the student's reason for absence. 6. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instructor, the examination is regarded as failed. Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. TARDINESS GRADES A Excellent B Good.. . 4 points per semester hour 3 points per semester hour 40 | GENERAL INFORMATION C Fair. . D Poor. F Failure 2 points per semester hour . 1 point per semester hour 0 points per semester hour Other grades are: AU Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to course work which is not completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control, e.g. illness, as documented by the Univer\u00ad sity Health Service; personal tragedy; breakdown of computer or laboratory equip\u00ad ment; or unanticipated delay in receiving information from sources inside or outside the University. Incompletes can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college/school dean/director. The incomplete course requirement will be satisfied at the earliest possible date. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. In cases of laboratory assignments, the student must complete all work the first time that the laboratory ex\u00ad perience is offered again. Procedure; 1. The student requests permission for the incomplete grade from the instructor. 2. In consultation with the student, the instructor will fill out and forward to the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean/director an incomplete card which will describe the reason for the incomplete as well as define the deadline. 3. Along with the incomplete card, the instructor will include his/her recommenda\u00ad tion and confirmation of eligibility for the incomplete on academic grounds (e.g. breakdown of equipment or computer or unanticipated delay in receiving informa\u00ad tion from sources inside or outside the University). 4. Confirmation of eligibility for medical incompletes and personal tragedy will be provided by the dean/director's office. 5. It is the student's responsibility to learn from the dean/director whether the in\u00ad complete request has been approved, the date by which the work is to be com\u00ad pleted, and from the instructor the nature of all outstanding requirements. 6. It will be the responsiblity of each dean/director's office to determine through the Registrar whether any incompletes have been awarded without prior approval. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identified course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or impossi\u00ad ble for the student to complete the required work within the regular semester. NP Not Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. P Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. WP Withdrawn, without penalty, not used in grade-point average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computation of the grade-point average. M Missing. Grade not turned in by the instructor. In cases in which a student requests reconsideration of a grade for a course already taken, the grade change, if any, must be made by the instructor and approved by the student's dean/director by the end of the first month of the following semester unless an extension is granted by the student's dean/director. CLASS STANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Freshman 0-29.9 credit hours Sophomore 30.0-59.9 credit hours Junior 60.0-89.9 credit hours Senior 90.0 and over credit hours GENERAL INFORMATION [ 41 TRANSCRIPTS An official transcript is the reproduction of a complete, unabridged academic record validated with the University seal, facsimile signature of the Registrar, and date of issue. A key to transcript is included which contains a full statement of pertinent definitions. A rank-in-class entry is made upon graduation. Currently enrolled, as well as former undergraduate and graduate students, may obtain an official transcript of their permanent academic record by writing or telephoning the Office of the Registrar, 363 Waterman Building, (802) 656-2045. The charge is $2 for each transcript. Please allow a minimum of one week for normal processing and three weeks following the end of a semester. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confidential manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly stated in writing. If a student feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is inaccurate, a hear\u00ad ing may be scheduled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. HONORS The Bachelor's and Associate's degrees may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are distinguish\u00ad ed and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum laude; the following three percent will receive magna cum laude; the next six percent will receive cum laude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this University. In order to be eligible for consideration, a student must have taken at least 60 hours (30 hours for two-year pro\u00ad grams) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans/directors of the undergraduate colleges/schools publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students who stood in the top 20 percent of each class of their college/school during the preceding semester. Full-time enrollment in this case shall be a minimum of 12 credit hours in courses in which grades of A,B,C,D, or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a student who is eligible for continued enrollment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmission. This policy benefits both the student and the University in that it enables a student to plan for readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the expected date of return of its students, to refine further the plan\u00ad ning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence: 42 | GENERAL INFORMATION a. Upon application to his/her academic dean/director a student may be granted a leave of absence by that dean/director when that application merits the commitment of the University to insure the student's readmission. b. A leave must be granted for a finite period of time. c. A leave normally may not exceed four semesters. d. A leave normally may not be granted for the current semester after the day on which courses can be dropped without penalty. e. A leave may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. f. A leave is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. g. A leave does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. h. A leave guarantees readmission to the student's college/school in the University if the student confirms his/her intent to return by the closing date for a normal readmission application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). i. While on a leave, an individual's student status is temporarily terminated. A leave of absence guarantees an individual's readmission only if he/she takes the appropriate action. j. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmission period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures applicable to that period. k. A leave should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the dean/director of the college/school involved. WITHDRAWAL A student who wishes to withdraw from the University must first notify his/her academic dean/director in person or in writing. READMISSION Any degree student who has left the University for one semester or more must write to his/her dean's/director's office to request readmission. Students must apply for readmis\u00ad sion by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholarship standing. The Studies Committee of each college/school may determine additional or sup\u00ad plementary requirements. Students with questions regarding their academic standing should consult with their college/school dean/director. 1. \"On Trial\": a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. The student remains enrolled according to stated academic conditions of his/her col\u00ad lege/school. b. A student is placed \"on trial\" by the dean/director or the designated committee of the college/school concerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of \"trial\" status is one semester. c. The circumstances under which a student is placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Any student who is readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enters \"on trial.\" (2) Generally a student is placed \"on trial\" if in any semester he/she has failed half or more of the hours of his/her enrollment but has been permitted to continue in college/school. GENERAL INFORMATION | 43 (3) A student whose record has been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or con\u00ad tinued \"on trial\" even though he/she does not come within the provisions of Section (2). d. A student who has earned fewer than 30 semester hours of credit and is \"on trial\" is barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation: a. A student is dismissed from the University if he/she receives grades below passing in one-half or more of the semester hours of his/her enrollment in any semester unless he/she is allowed to continue by action of the designated com\u00ad mittee. b. A student who fails to meet the condition of his/her trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though he/she does not come within the pro\u00ad vision above. c. A student dismissed for low scholarship must address his/her application for readmission to the college/school taking the action. d. Any student dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from his/her previous academic dean/director (or the Dean of Students for disciplinary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college/school of this University may transfer to another college/school of the University only with the consent of the deans/directors of the two colleges/schools concerned. In the case of veterans receiving educational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must also be approv\u00ad ed by the advisor to veterans in the Center for Career Development. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the colleges/schools and specific re\u00ad quirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges/schools. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the college/school in which the student is officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 45 semester hours of credit (15 of the last 30 for two-year students) in residence at the University except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the University are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only upon decision of the dean/direc\u00ad tor or the appropriate faculty committee of the college or school in which the student is enrolled. To qualify for a second Bachelor's degree, the candidate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually 30 hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore year, is required of all undergraduate students in four-year programs. The two credits earn\u00ad44 | GENERAL INFORMATION ed in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass-no pass basis. (For further details see the pass-no pass heading under General Information.) Medical examinations are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be ex\u00ad cused by the Director of University Health Services. The physical education requirement for students pursuing two-year degree programs shall be one credit of course work earned in activities instruction. Students 25 years of age or older are exempt from physical education requirements. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to. provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is expected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the University Health Service. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regardless of content. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usage may be referred to the English Department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high standards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students, as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of University regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the Universi\u00ad ty- The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he/she considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans/directors and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt of academic credits, graduation, and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The Univer\u00ad sity is free to cancel a student's registration at any time on any grounds if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in \"The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the University of Vermont.\" Each student is held responsible for knowledge and observance of these rules and regulations, including those concerned with academic hones\u00ad ty- UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tuition for students who are Ver\u00ad mont residents. Such a policy has as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of operating and supporting the University of Vermont between Vermont residents GENERAL INFORMATION | 45 whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learning or presence within the state for purposes of attending an institution of higher learning shall not con\u00ad stitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, December 14,1974; amended June 15,1979) The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admission, tuition, and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile to be continuous for one year prior to the commencement of the semester next following the date of applica\u00ad tion. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of application. There shall be one date designated each year for the commence\u00ad ment of each semester and the summer term. A semester shall commence on the day classes begin for that semester. The summer term shall commence on the day classes begin for the summer term. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed, and permanent home, to which he/she intends to return when absent. A residence established for the purpose of attending an educational institution or qualifying for resident status for tuition purposes shall not of itself constitute domicile. Domicile shall not be determined by the applicant's marital status. 3. The applicant must demonstrate such attachment to the community as would be typical of a permanent resident of his/her age and education. 4. Receipt of financial support from the applicant's family will create a rebuttable presumption that the applicant's domicile is with his/her family. 5. An applicant becoming a student at an institution of higher learning in Vermont within one year of first moving to the state shall have created a rebuttable presump\u00ad tion of residence in Vermont for the purpose of attending an educational institution. 6. Eligibility to enroll as a resident student in another state shall create a rebuttable presumption against eligibility to be enrolled at the University of Vermont as a \"Ver\u00ad mont Resident.\" 7. A student enrolling at the University of Vermont shall be classified by the appropriate officer (designated by the President), as a resident or non-resident for admission and tuition purposes. The decision by the officer shall be based upon information furnish\u00ad ed by the student and other relevant information. The Officer is authorized to require such written documents, affidavits, verifications, or other evidence as he/she deems necessary. 8. The burden of proof in all cases rests upon the student claiming to be a Vermont resident and shall be met upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. 9. The decision of the Officer on the classification of a student as a resident or non-resident may be appealed in writing to the Committee on Residence, whose deci\u00ad sion shall be final. Note: These regulations were under review at the time of publication of the catalogue. Questions should be addressed to the Office of the Dean of Students. The College of Agriculture The Bachelor of Science degree is awarded for the programs listed below. Please refer to the departmental listings in this section for more information and specific requirements. Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics Food Production Economics Food Marketing and Agribusiness International Agriculture Department of Animal Sciences Animal Science Animal Industry Dairy Production General Preprofessional/ Science Dairy Technology Business-Management-Quality Assurance Dairy Science General Department of Botany Botany Department of Human Nutrition and Foods Dietetics Human Nutrition and Foods Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry Biochemical Science Department of Plant and Science Plant and Soil Science Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Consumer Studies Clothing Fashion Merchandising and Management Textiles Textile Design Department of Vocational Education and Technology Occupational and Extension Education Agricultural and Natural Resource Education Extension Education Health Occupations Education Home Economics Education Industrial Education Agricultural Technology Inter-Departmental Biological Sciences General Studies 46 THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE [ 47 The College of Agriculture performs four public functions: it teaches resident students, investigates problems, brings information to the people, and per\u00ad forms related services. These four areas of work are performed by the resident instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Cooperative Extension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division prepare students for profes\u00ad sional careers. Upon receiving the Bachelor of Science degree, students usually enter management, specialized services, sales, education, government service, or research. The evolution of society necessitates continual progress and change. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is be\u00ad ing met through programs designed to give a foundation both in the social sciences and the humanities plus a fundamental technical education. In each area of study certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and integrated educa\u00ad tional program and to insure reasonable concentration. Faculty advisors counsel students in the selection of elective courses and educational problems. The nor\u00ad mal semester program includes 15 to 18 credit hours of courses. Programs of Study The programs in the College are broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student. Therefore, responsible departmental advising is important in the development of each student's program. Every candidate for a degree, in consultation with his/her advisor, must choose one of the above programs upon entering the College. The candidate must then fulfill the requirements stated below. Degree Requirements All programs in the College of Agriculture leading to the Bachelor of Science degree re\u00ad quire: A. The successful completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours of course work plus two credit hours in physical education. B. A minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.00. C. The successful completion of at least two courses in each of the following areas: 1. Writing, communication, and public address 2. Science, mathematics, and statistics 3. Fine arts, philosophy, language, and literature 4. Social sciences D. Courses as specified in individual programs. Applicability of courses to specific areas will rest with the advisor and, if necessary, with the concurrence of the dean of the College. It is further recommended that courses chosen to fulfill these requirements be taken outside the department in which the student's program of study is located. Students desiring to complete teacher education programs and teacher certification must apply for admission to Teacher Certification through the Vocational Education and Technology Department prior to their junior year and enroll in appropriate courses in the College of Education and Social Services (see College of Education and Social Services). 48 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Preprofessional Preparation Students who are striving for admission to professional colleges, such as dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, can meet the undergraduate requirements for these pro\u00ad grams through enrollment in the College of Agriculture. Those interested in human medical sciences usually enroll in biological sciences while individuals interested in veterinary medicine usually enroll in either animal sciences or biological sciences. Any student in\u00ad dicating a specific professional interest will be assigned a faculty advisor knowledgeable in that area. Competition for places in professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an undergraduate program is necessary to receive consideration for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candidates are encouraged to also complete the requirements in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture, and expressing an interest in medicine or preveterinary medicine, should present evidence of high performance in high school level science and math courses, plus additional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores and strong letters of recommendation. Biological Sciences Core Students initially interested in the broad area of biological sciences may enroll in this core curriculum for the freshman and sophomore years. The curriculum is designed to permit students to continue in basic biology or to transfer to one of the applied biology programs. In addition to the general college requirements listed, students should complete during the first two years the following courses or their equivalents: Biology 1, 2 or Zoology 9 and Botany 4; Math, 19, 20 or Math 21; Chemistry 3, 42 or Chemistry 1, 2 and 141, 142; Microbiology and Biochemistry 55 (Microbiology). Course descriptions are listed under the appropriate departments. Programs available upon completion of the core curriculum are listed below. Students may wish to select offerings from these programs during the freshman and sophomore years in addition to the required courses state above. Freshman and Sophomore Years: Junior and Senior Years: Take Biological Science Core Continue in Biological Science or transfer to Animal Sciences, Biochemical Science (see Microbiology and Biochemistry), Botany, or Plant and Social Science An alphabetical listing and description of programs and concentrations follows. Agricultural and Resource Economics The Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics offers two major programs of study: Agricultural Economics in the College of Agriculture and Resource Economics in the School of Natural Resources. AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS Options in the agricultural economics program provide students with basic work in agricultural economics, together with an exposure to courses in the liberal arts and the sciences. Students in this program acquire quantitative skills and analytical concepts that can be applied to the problems of U.S. or world agriculture.

Animal Sciences Two programs, Animal Sciences and Dairy Technology, are offered in the Department of Animal Sciences, with several specialized options under each program. A strong advisor- advisee relationship exists to help students meet their professional goals. Specific programs are planned by the student and his/her advisor; however, each student must successfully complete a minimum of eight courses in the Department of Animal Sciences, including at least five of advanced standing. ANIMAL SCIENCES This program deals with a wide range of activities. The major agricultural enterprise in Vermont is related to dairy cattle farming. Consequently, our primary production option relates to the feeding, breeding, and management of dairy cat\u00ad tle. Supporting courses are also offered in the production of livestock, pleasure horses, and poultry. Graduates from the dairy option are successful dairy farmers, farm managers, and sought by employers in related agribusiness as well. High quality preprofessional science THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 51 graduates are competitive for admission to schools of veterinary medicine and are sought for graduate study in nutrition, physiology, and genetics by universities across the country. In addition, graduates in all options are successful in many related agribusiness jobs in\u00ad cluding feed and equipment sales, banking, management, etc. Options under the Animal Sciences Program are: 1. Dairy Production: Provides formal training in the theories and practices of dairy cattle production. Major emphasis is placed on breeding, feeding, and farm management. This option prepares the student for employment as a farm owner or manager or for field work with breed associations, farm organizations, or commercial companies close\u00ad ly allied with dairy cattle production. A variation of this option is livestock production which includes similar courses but with more emphasis on other types of livestock. A possible four-year curriculum for the Dairy Production Option is shown below. 2. Animal Industry: Primarily for those students who are interested in business. It prepares them for supervisory and management positions in industries related to animal sciences, such as those involved with the processing and sales of dairy, meat, and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; farm equipment and supply agencies; advertising and public relations; and other areas of public service. A possible four-year curriculum for the Animal Industry option would be similar to the Dairy Production option below except that students in this option would take fewer science courses and a heavier concentration of courses in economics, accounting, and agricultural economics including small business management, agricultural finance, agricultural policy, marketing institutions, advanced agricultural economics, and agricultural price analysis and forecasting. 3. Preprofessional/Science: For those students interested in careers in veterinary and human medicine, research, or university positions. Students in this program will be pro\u00ad vided with the strong science background that is necessary for advanced study in such areas as medicine, physiology, nutrition, genetics, and related biological fields. In com\u00ad parison with the curriculum for dairy production, students in this option would take fewer courses in business and production sciences and more courses in the basic sciences. A possible four-year preprofessional/science curriculum is shown below. 4. General: For those students with interest in the animal sciences but without specific career goals. Students in this option are required to take at least eight Animal Sciences courses and are encouraged to select one of the other options by their junior year.

'DAIRY TECHNOLOGY This program deals with all aspects of handling, processing, quality assurance, and marketing of fluid milk and manufactured dairy products. Options under the Dairy Technology Program are (1) General, (2) Business-Management/Quality Assurance, and (3) Dairy Science. Core courses in the department that a student should take for all three of the options are: Introductory Animal Sciences, Introductory Dairy Technology, Fundamentals of Nutrition, Dairy Testing and Quality Control, Food Microbiology, Manufactured Dairy Products, Sensory Evaluation of Foods, Milk Process\u00ad ing, Ice Cream and Frozen Dairy Products, Dairy Plant Management, and Senior Seminar. Sequence of courses for each option of a four-year curriculum will be prepared by the stu\u00ad dent in consultation with his/her advisor. A suggested four-year curriculum in the Dairy Science Option is given below: Dairy Science Option Freshman Year Credits Sophomore Year Credits Introductory Animal Sciences 4 Introductory Dairy Technology 3 Inorganic Chemistry 8 Fundamentals of Nutrition 3 Math, (through Calculus) 3 Microbiology 4 Electives* 15 Statistics 3 Computer Applications 3 Organic Chemistry 8 Electives* 3 Junior Year Credits Senior Year Credits Food Microbiology 3 Sensory Evaluation of Foods 3 Dairy Testing and Quality Controi 1 3 Milk Processing 3 Manufactured Dairy Products 3 Dairy Plant Management 3 Ice Cream and Frozen Dairy General Biochemistry 4 Products 3 Physical Chemistry 3 Small Business Management 3 Quantitative Analysis 4 Physics 8 Senior Seminar 1 Electives* 8 Electives* 8 Includes courses for college requirements such as communications, social sciences, and fine arts and humanities. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 53 Vermont has the only Dairy Technology Program in the Northeast. Consequently, our graduating seniors have many job opportunities in areas such as the manufacture of fluid milk products, cheese varieties, ice cream, and butter and powder operations, quality con\u00ad trol and assurance programs, sales and services, sanitarians, public relations, etc. Also, our graduating seniors are eagerly sought for graduate-study programs at universities throughout the United States. Biological Science This program is designed to provide flexibility in developing a background in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically-oriented departments (Animal Sciences, Botany, Microbiology and Biochemistry, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or professional schools or they may obtain employment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportunities would include basic and applied research in educational institutions and governmental agencies, technical writing, employment with environmental consultants, etc. The following courses are required of all students in the Biological Science program follow\u00ad ing completion of the core requirements: genetics (one semester), biochemistry (one semester), physics (two semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addition, all students must take six additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course in botany or applied plant science, one course in zoology or applied animal science, one course in the area of evolution and diversity of life, one course in ecology, and two courses in physiology or biochemistry. Of these, at least one or more courses at the 200 level should be included. These courses are selected in con\u00ad sultation with the advisor from the diverse offerings of the various colleges and depart\u00ad ments. Botany Students in the Colleges of Agriculture or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal department advisor. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of electives when planning for each individual's career. Cross-disciplinary study is encouraged as botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not require formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g. preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, educa\u00ad tion, administration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare themselves for graduate education and professional careers requiring advanced degrees, e.g. careers in botany, biology, medicine, dentistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or environmental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to increasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through individualized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecology, phycology, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required courses: Math. 22; or Math. 21 and Statistics; or Math. 19, 20 and Statistics, Physics 11, 12 or preferably 15, 16; Chemistry 42 or preferably 141, 142; Biology 1, 2; Botany 101, 104, 107, 108, and 109 or 160; two additional semester courses in Botany, at least one at the 200 level. Botany 4 and Zoology 9 may be substitued for Biology 1,2. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recommended. Students may petition the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the planning of in\u00ad dividual programs. 54 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Environmental Studies The College of Agriculture participates in the interdisciplinary University Environmental Program as described on page 121. Most students select the Coordinate Major Program and fulfill the requirements in one of the major programs available in the College. General Studies This program is designed for students seeking a general rather than a specialized knowledge in the field of agriculture and related subjects. Through the proper selection of electives, a student may choose an area of concentration within the College and also select courses that contribute to a liberal education. Required: In addition to the basic College requirements, each student must satisfactorily complete 40 credit hours in the College of Agriculture, 20 of which must be at the 100 level or above. All additional courses must be selected in consultation with and have the ap\u00ad proval of the student's advisor. Human Nutrition and Foods The Department of Human Nutrition and Foods prepares professionals to enter the rapidly growing field of nutrition and/or foods. Such preparation requires a strong foundation in basic science including chemistry, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry. The Department also recognizes the importance of general education and majors are required to complete courses in psychology, sociology, economics, English composition, speech, and the humanities. Courses in statistics and language are strongly encouraged. The majority of course credits are earned in Human Nutrition and Foods providing background in normal, cellular, and therapeutic nutrition as well as nutrient requirements for growth, development, and health at various stages of the life cycle. Because nutrients are supplied in food, other courses focus upon physical, chemical, and nutritional proper\u00ad ties of food, and consumer aspects of food as related to socioeconomic status, lifestyle, cultural beliefs, and state of health. Although a series of courses providing information in these areas are required of all majors, each student has some choice of electives to be selected from Human Nutrition and Foods courses. Students may concentrate in Dietetics (approved by the American Dietetic Association, Generalist Plan IV) or Human Nutrition and Foods with an emphasis in foods, food service administration, human nutrition, or nutrition education. Dietetics: This concentration is designed to meet all academic requirements for membership in the American Dietetic Association under the Generalist, Plan IV. Graduates must, however, also complete a dietetic internship or three years of approved work experience to qualify for membership. This course plan provides a solid background in basic science, nor\u00ad mal and therapeutic nutrition, foods, and quantity food management. Career opportunities include hospital dietetics as well as community nutrition programs, quantity food manage\u00ad ment, or graduate school. Human Nutrition and Foods: This concentration is designed to provide a strong background in basic science, normal nutrition, and foods with the opportunity to develop an emphasis in one of four areas: foods, food service management, human nutrition, or nutrition education. Each student also develops a supporting area (9-12 credits) in the biological sciences, social sciences, behavioral sciences, education, communications, language, business, or social work. Graduates may find career opportunities with food companies, food management companies, community nutrition programs, government agencies and the Agricultural Extension Service, or go on to graduate school. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 55 Microbiology and Biochemistry BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end, the program in Biochemical Science provides a coor\u00ad dinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the stu\u00ad dent's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1) Cellular Biochemistry which emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology which focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemistry which emphasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these concentrations normally commences in the junior year after completion of the Biological Sciences Core (p.48 ). Students are required to complete a minimum of three hours of physical chemistry (or eight hours for the Molecular Biology option), 12 hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their specialty (e.g. nutrition, physiology, genetics, etc.). The Plant and Soil Science program is designed for students interested in horticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, and insect pest management as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber production or to recreation and the environment. The program is flex\u00ad ible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agribusiness. Suggested groupings of courses have been developed by the Department to be used as guides for students interested in general plant and soil science, soil science, plant science, ornamental horticulture and landscape design, horticultural therapy, and insect pest management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. All students majoring in Plant and Soil Science must take Principles of Plant Science, In\u00ad troductory Soil Science, Plant and Soil Career Orientation, Soil Fertility and Management, one semester of Seminar, two semesters of chemistry (one semester of inorganic and one semester of organic), one semester of mathematics or statistics, plant pathology, and insect pest management. A minimum of six additional courses in Plant and Soil Science at the 100 level or above are required, to be selected in the student's area of interest and approved by his or her advisor. Courses in related areas may be substituted for one or two of these six courses with the consent of the student's advisor.

The application of design and aesthetic principles is emphasized. MERCHANDISING AND CONSUMER STUDIES The two areas of professional concen\u00ad tration in this program are: (a) Fashion Merchandising, and (b) Consumer Studies. The concentration in Fashion Merchandising is appropriate for students seeking careers in the retailing, marketing, buying, and promotion of consumer goods, particularly in the apparel or textile areas. A core of courses in textiles, apparel, and design is combined with business management courses. The Consumer Studies concentration prepares students for consumer-related careers in business, government, financial institutions, and public utilities. This concentration provides a broad base with courses in management and in specific consumer areas. Programs can be structured to emphasize consumer economics or consumer education. The VOTEC department offers two major programs, (1) Occupational and Extension Education and (2) Agricultural Technology, which provide an opportunity to choose from seven areas of professional concentration. The programs are flexible. Certain concentra\u00ad tions may be completed either as (1) a major in this department, (2) a dual major when combined with other programs in the University, and/or (3) without having to attend the University campus on a full-time basis. Courses of general interest are available to students majoring in other programs in the University. OCCUPATIONAL AND EXTENSION EDUCATION Five areas of concentration prepare students for teaching certification. One concentration prepares students for adult education responsiblities in governmental agencies, private organizations, business, or in\u00ad dustry. Prior to the beginning of their junior year, students desiring teacher certification must apply for admission to teacher education, and students desiring to complete the Exten\u00ad sion Education concentration must declare their intent. Contact the Department office, 108 Agricultural Engineering Building. Teacher certification concentrations are offered in cooperation with the College of Educa\u00ad tion and Social Services.

Con\u00ad gruent with this central purpose, we seek to instill in students at all levels the spirit of reasoned inquiry and habits of intellectual discipline which are required for the critical thinking expected of free men and women. We further seek to ac\u00ad quaint students with their intellectual, cultural, and aesthetic heritage, and to provide them with the skills necessary to cope with the complex human, societal,, and technological problems of modern society. Finally, we seek to prepare students for direct entry int o rewarding careers in a variety of fields and for ad\u00ad vanced study that may be prerequisite to other opportunities. These objectives of a liberal education are achieved through the courses of instruction which com\u00ad prise the undergraduate curricula of the College. These curricula, through satisfaction of the major requirement, allow the student to attain baccalaureate 61 62 | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES level mastery of a specific discipline or an approved interdisciplinary program. As well, through satisfaction of the distribution requirement, students acquaint themselves with the diversity of approaches whereby people have come to understand themselves and their environment.

Transfer students from other institutions should note that 30 of the last 45 credits and one- half of the major credits must be earned at the University of Vermont and as a student in the College of Arts and Sciences. Although the physical education require\u00ad ment may be waived for transfer students, the minimum required number of credits remains 122. Transfer credit will be initially evaluated by the Registrar, although judgment as to the applicability of credit toward satisfaction of degree requirements rests with the Dean's Office and the chairperson of the major department. Transfer credit from other institutions is not used in the calculation of the University of Ver\u00ad mont grade-point average. VI. SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING CREDIT Credit will not be given for the following combinations: Biology 1,2 and Biology 3 Biology 1,2 and Botany 4 Chemistry 1,2 and Chemistry 11,12 Chemistry 1,2 and Chemistry 3,4 Chemistry 141,142 and Chemistry 140 Mathematics 2 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 9 and Mathematics 10 Mathematics 19 and Mathematics 21 Mathematics 20 and Mathematics 21 Music 1 and Music 15 Music 2 and Music 12 Philosophy 1,2, and 3 Physics 11,12 and Physics 15,16 Zoology 5, 6 and Zoology 104 Zoology 9 and Zoology 5, 6 or Biology 1,2 Zoology 104 and Anatomy 9 and/ or Physiology 10 VII. ACADEMIC STANDARDS The following criteria for academic trial and dismissal, while making allowances for the student in the freshman year, are designed to encourage academic work of quality equal to or greater than the minimum average required for graduation. Any student experiencing academic difficulty is encouraged to meet with a member of the Dean's Office. DISMISSAL: Students who earn a semester average of 1.00 or less, or who fail (F, NP, WF) half or more of their credit hours (excluding physical education and military studies), are dismissed for low scholarship. Students who are dismissed may not enroll in any University courses during the term of dismissal. TRIAL: Students who earn a semester average higher than that which merits dismissal, but below 2.00 (1.70 for first-semester freshmen), are placed on trial. During the following term, students on trial must earn a 2.00, have no more than one failure, enroll in no courses on a pass/no pass basis, and maintain a program of 12 or more credit hours. Failure to satisfy any of the conditions of trial is grounds for dismissal. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 65 It is the prerogative of the Committee on Academic Standing to modify the above regulations in light of extraordinary or extenuating circumstances. VIII. COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC STANDING The Committee on Academic Standing reviews all requests for special consideration with regard to College regulations, changes in enrollment, curriculum standards, and graduation requirements. Students may petition to this Committee through the Dean's Office. IX. MAJORS: DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS For the Bachelor of Arts degree, the major field must include a minimum of 36 semester hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. Concentration re\u00ad quirements, including courses and necessary prerequisites may not exceed 60 semester hours. For the Bachelor of Science degree, the major field must include a minimum of 36 hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. No more than 94 semester hours of the total program, including distribution requirements and major field, may be in specifically designated courses. ANTHROPOLOGY Thirty hours in Anthropology including 21, 24, 26, and 28 (these provide an introduction to the discipline's four major fields); 225 and 228 (recommended for the junior year) and four additional advanced (100- or 200-level) courses of which only one may be an independent study and at least one must be at the 200 level. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering students are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area and International Studies. Courses in several academic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geographical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credit to enable them also to fulfill department requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The four areas presently available for concentration are: CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). The approach to undergraduate education combines exposure to the traditional disciplines with integrative knowledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus combines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. During their freshman and sophomore years, students who plan to major in Area Studies should take the required foreign language courses as well as beginning courses in the humanities and social sciences which are prerequisites of subsequent required courses and also meet the general distribution requirements. Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact the Director, Area and International Studies, Extension 4062. Specific requirements of the individual programs (with the exception of ASIAN) are as follows: ASIAN STUDIES Currently available as a major field only for those students who can fulfill the language re\u00ad quirement in their special field.

Preprofessional Preparation Students who plan to enter professional colleges requiring previous collegiate preparation will find the variety of courses offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the freedom of election in that College is such that all the requirements for any professional school may be met. Many students will desire so to direct their four-year undergraduate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. Special advising is available in the College for students preparing for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wishes to concentrate in Biology while pursuing a liberal arts education. It will also serve as a basis for programs leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appropriate major for students in premedical and predental programs. The concentration consists of a year of elementary biology and single-semester courses in genetics, ecology, cellular biology, animal structure and function, and plant structure and development. This core is followed by three elective courses selected from a wide range of offerings in biologically-oriented departments at the University. A year of chemistry, a year of physics, and mathematics (calculus or statistics) are also required. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is generally open to academically qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interested students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, including work in the social sciences, in mass communication, and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum for admission to law school, and candidates pursue their undergraduate studies in a wide range of majors. A Pre-Law Advisory Committee aids students in planning their academic programs and in making application to law schools. Members of the committee include: Professors Hoffman and Holland, Department of Political Science; Professor McGovern, Department of History; Professor Stanfield, Department of Sociology; Professor Tashman, Department of Business Administration; Larry Simmons, Center for Career Development; Susan Perkins, College of Arts and Sciences. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for 76 | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy, religion, psychology, and social studies. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 12) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year program with years of preprofessional work which includes English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, a course in fine arts, and orientation to pharmacy. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an ac\u00ad credited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should during his/her sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which he/she expects to apply, and arrange to include in his/her program courses required by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum re\u00ad quirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: a) Math. 21,22 (recommended for able students) b) Math. 19,20 (recommended) c) Math. 21 (adequate) d) Math. 9,19 (adequate) e) Math. 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) f) Math. 7, 8 (not acceptable) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1,2, or 11,12,13,14 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 141,142 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory a) Physics 15,16 (recommended for students with calculus background) b) Physics 24, 25 (recommended for students concentrating in the physical sciences or engineering) c) Physics 11, 12 (acceptable for students without calculus background, or taking calculus concurrently) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1,2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may,, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least three years of college work. (The majority of applicants will have completed four years.) In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. A student should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which he/ she expects to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the undergraduate level in those areas taught at the professional level: i.e. human anatomy, human physiology, microbiology. Many medical colleges now strongly recommend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES I 77 SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon ap\u00ad plication to the Dean of Education and Social Services, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours, can count as electives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. College Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior level is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a student enters a pro\u00ad gram of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his/her choice. A student may take honors in either or both years.

The program requires a nine credit on-campus residency unit. Residency may be fulfilled during any academic semester or summer and is part of the total 30-36 program credits. Further information may be ob\u00ad tained from the Office for Student and Field Services, Waterman Building. The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration became effective July 1, 1981. It includes the College of Engineering and Mathematics and the School of Business Administration. The College and School offer degrees in: Business Administration Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Civil Engineering Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science i n Mechanical Engineering Mathematics Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Statistics Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Computer Science Bachelor of Science in Computer Science The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration offers professional undergraduate programs which provide the basis for professional practice or further study. Graduates of professional schools are expected to fulfill unique and significant roles in planning and directing the work of the world and in effecting and manag\u00ad ing change. The primary objective of professional education is, therefore, to develop skill in the \"problem-solving art.\" This includes not only intellectual knowledge of complex and high order, but also the intelligent and intuitive ap\u00ad plication of that knowledge to the situations of life. Professional graduates must have the ability, the confidence, and the self- discipline to identify and define a problem, break it down into operable com\u00ad ponents, marshal the necessary resources from the natural and social sciences, mathematics, and the humanities, and to employ these resources in a systematic, effective, and efficient fashion to derive a useful solution. To enhance and pro\u00ad mote these qualities in students, the Division's curricula all emphasize the balanced development of conceptual understanding and specific skills. The professional graduate is also often required to act on the basis of incomplete knowledge and with limited time and resources. The Division therefore requires that its students exhibit certain personal qualities in addition to the intellectual achievement expected of all university graduates. Foremost among these are in\u00ad tegrity, acceptance of responsibility, and reliability in independent work. The Division is also committed to the idea that learning is a life-long endeavor. Our undergraduate programs therefore provide a base upon which students may build as the demands of their professional careers increase and their personal in\u00ad terests broaden. Academic Information GENERAL The instructional programs of the Division are made up of a lower level (nor\u00ad mally freshman/sophomore years) and a variety of upper level curricula (majors). Each curriculum is administered by one of the Division's schools, departments, or programs. 91 92 I THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION Admission to the Division as a freshman does not guarantee admission to an upper level program. In order to enter one of these programs, students must: A. be in good academic standing in the lower level of their chosen major or in another college/school of the University. B. meet specific requirements established by the school, department, or program responsible for the upper level curriculum to which they seek admission. These re\u00ad quirements include (1) the completion of specific prerequisite courses, and (2) a minimum grade-point average in these prerequisite courses. In any year, places in the several upper level programs may be limited by available resources (faculty, laboratory facilities, etc.). In such cases, only the most qualified students will be accepted, and some students who have satisfied the minimum requirements (above) may not be admitted. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students who receive a cumulative or semester grade-point average of less than 2.0 will be placed on trial. Students who have failed half their course credits for any semester, or who have had two successive semester averages below 2v0, or two successive semesters in which their cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0, are eligible for dismissal. COOPERATIVE PROGRAMS The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration offers cooperative work-study programs for majors. At least one year of practical work experience related to the student's major field is required. Academic credit is not ordinarily awarded for co-op work but may be possible to arrange for faculty- super\u00ad vised independent study projects as part of the co-op experience. Students interested in a cooperative program arrangement should consult the Dean's Office or the unit in which they intend to enroll before the end of the sophomore year. Although the Division will attempt to place all qualified students in co-op positions, it can\u00ad not guarantee the availability of these positions in advance. CORE COURSES A group of fundamental, or \"core,\" courses is identified in each of the three primary areas: business administration, engineering, and mathematics. These courses provide the foundations needed, both for advanced work and for specialization, within the respective fields. Some core courses deal with essential concepts and skills and must be completed during the first and second years. Others treat material which, though more ad\u00ad vanced, is common to all branches of the field. These courses are found primarily in the se\u00ad cond and third years. If exempt from a core course, a student must replace it with a higher level course recommended by a faculty advisor. HONORS THESIS PROGRAM The Division Undergraduate Thesis Program is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special program without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a student enters a program of reading, research, design, or creation under the direc\u00ad tion of a school, department, or program of the student's choice. Such a unit need not be in the Division \u2014 e.g. a Computer Science major could do a special project in Physics. The student matriculated in the Division who, at the time of application, has an average of 3.00 or above for sophomore and junior year work may apply to the school, department, or program of his/her major and simultaneously to the unit in which he/she intends to do the project. These participating programs can establish whatever mechanism they choose to provide the necessary approvals outlined hereafter. The student proposal for a thesis must normally be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the participating school, department, or program. A written report of the completed project must be approved by the participating school, department, or program and the student may be asked to pass an oral examination on the field of special study. At the time of graduation, the student's THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 93 transcript and the graduation program wil be appropriately denoted with \"Honors Thesis\" and the title of the thesis. HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL STUDIES The objective of the Humanities and Social Studies requirements for all programs is to broaden the student's understanding of mankind and relationships in human society. The Division has a minimum requirement of 18 Humanities and Social Studies credit hours for the B.S. degree but specific programs may require more than this minimum. English 1 is required of all students except Mathematics and Statistics majors, unless exempt by recommendation of the English Department. Students whom the English Department ex\u00ad empts from English 1 are required to take another course in English. Engineering students may not include English 1 as a Humanities and Social Studies elective even though it is re\u00ad quired. No credit is given for a \"dash course\" (a two-semester sequence listed with a dash between the course numbers) unless the second semester is completed. Credit for elementary language courses is granted for degrees in the mathematical sciences and Business. Ad\u00ad ministration only if the intermediate level course is also satisfactorily completed. No credit toward Engineering degrees is granted for elementary language courses. Engineering students must select their Humanities and Social Studies courses from lists held by their advisors. These courses shall be from the categories of language and literature, fine arts and philosophy, and social sciences. A minimum of nine credits must be in one category and a minimum of six must be in one departmental area. INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED MAJORS Occasionally, students whose interests fall within the overall curricular domain of the Division are nevertheless unable to find a pro\u00ad gram or option which addresses their specific educational objectives. In such cases, the stu\u00ad dent may propose an \"individually designed major.\" Any such proposal must contain an appropriate college core program, must contain a breadth and depth of courses consistent with regular professional programs or options, must be sponsored by a faculty member who is willing to act as the student's advisor, and must be approved by the Studies Com\u00ad mittee. Proposals for individually designed majors must be presented to the Dean's Office and approved before the student can be admitted to the upper level of the Division. Each student must select one of the options available, or have an approved individually designed major, when applying for the upper division. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration does not, in general, grant credit for military service. Credit for specific courses or other academic experience acquired during military service may be available through petition to the Studies Committee. CREDIT FOR MILITARY STUDIES COURSES Army ROTC at the University of Vermont The Division grants eight credits for Military Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the category of humanistic social studies for all programs in the Division. Normally, other Military Studies courses may be utilized as free electives only. See advisor. Air Force ROTC at St. Michael's College No academic credit is granted for the first two years of AFROTC courses at St. Michael's College. At the junior and senior level the following St. Michael's courses are approved: Military Studies 301-303 \u2014 A total of six credits (three each semester) will be granted under the UVM elective category of \"Political Science.\" Military Studies 401-403 \u2014 Six credits will be granted under the UVM elective category of \"Business Administration.\" Credit will not be given for both the UVM course Business Administration 170 and Military Studies 401 at St. Michael's. 94 | THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION Credits from these courses will be treated as transfer credits, and they may be used as elec- tives only, not as substitutes for required UVM courses. PHYSICAL EDUCATION In addition to the course requirements listed for each cur\u00ad riculum, all students must satisfactorily complete two credits in physical education. RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROJECTS Opportunities for undergraduate research and work on special projects are offered by the several departments and programs of the Divi\u00ad sion. Credit may be arranged, with a maximum of four hours per semester. No more than 12 hours of courses in these categories may be used to satisfy the requirements for the B.S. degree. It is understood that credit for such courses is contingent upon submission of a final report or other acceptable evidence of project completion. TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credits from other institutions are not used in the calcula\u00ad tion of the University of Vermont grade-point average. Students who wish transfer credit must obtain approval from their departments. The School of Business Administration The School of Business Administration offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. The curriculum is designed to provide the student with a broad background in the fields of knowledge useful for managerial decision making and, additionally, considerable exposure to the humanities and the social, physical, and mathematical sciences. The core program required of all students provides: A. A background of the concepts, processes, and institutions in marketing and distribution, production, and financing functions of business enterprise. B. A background of the economic and legal environment of business enterprise along with consideration of the social and political influences on business. C. A basic understanding of the concepts and methods of accounting, quantitative methods, and information systems. D. A study of organization theory, interpersonal relationships, control and motivation systems, and communications. E. A study of administrative processes under conditions of uncertainty including integrating analysis and policy determination at the overall management level. Beyond this core, study in a specialty option allows the student to pursue in more depth a functional area of interest. The areas available are Accounting, Finance and Banking, Marketing Management and Sales Promotion, and Management. The School of Business Administration cooperates in the offering of courses in the Manage\u00ad ment Engineering curriculum administered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering which is described in the section on engineering curricula. The Accounting option is registered with the University of the State of New York, The State Education Department, Albany, N.Y.

Two options are available to students interested in an Environmental Studies program with emphasis in natural resources. The Coordinate Major option requires completion of an approved program of studies including the re\u00ad quirements of another major program within the School. The major in Environmental Studies is an individually-designed interdisciplinary program available to qualified students upon approval of a petition to the Director of the Environmental Program. The detailed re\u00ad quirements of these two options are described in the Environmental Program section of this catalogue. UNDECIDED - N.R. Some high school seniors who do not wish to decide among the various programs of the School are admitted as \"undecideds.\" These students and their ad\u00ad visor develop a one- or two-year curriculum which enables them to explore several fields of natural resources. With careful planning and gradual refinement of their interests, undecid\u00ad ed students who maintain acceptable academic records can be admitted to one of the School's degree programs and graduate within the usual time required. The Environmental Program Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science The Environmental Program is a University-wide program of undergraduate education, research, and community service dedicated to the study of the cultural and biophysical environments essential to the quality of life on earth. It seeks to serve the needs of students for sound education and career preparation and the needs of society \u2014 two goals that strengthen one another in practice. The Environmental Program is an interdisciplinary academic program involving students and faculty from throughout the University, as well as community pro\u00ad fessionals, recognizing that study of the environment involves all disciplines and professional fields. Thus, the Program is not a unit of any single college or school of the University, but works cooperatively with other academic programs and action organizations on campus and in the community. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide range of en\u00ad vironmental interests, its primary focus is the individual student. A Director and interdisciplinary faculty assist students in planning an individualized program of studies which combines a broad, comprehensive understanding of the environ\u00ad ment and depth in a specific discipline or profession leading to a future career. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet where students are invited to visit with the staff regarding their academic plans, to gain assistance with research or action projects, and to seek information about community internships and future employment. The Environmental Studies Curriculum The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students several alternatives leading to an individualized program of studies: The Coordinate Major in Environmental Studies com\u00ad bines study of the environment with a traditional disciplinary major or professional field. The Major in Environmental Studies provides a unique opportunity for the student seeking an individually-designed interdisciplinary major. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergraduate colleges and professional schools. Choice of the ap\u00ad propriate college or school will depend on the individual's interests and educational objec\u00ad tives or, in the case of the Coordinate Major program, on the major or professional field to be coordinated with Environmental Studies. It is recommended that incoming students con\u00ad sult with the Environmental Program before making application to the University.

Reserve Officers' Training Corps ARMY GENERAL Army ROTC offers programs for men and women leading to a commission as an officer in the United States Army. The University's Depart\u00ad ment of Military Studies offers courses in world military affairs and other related areas. Additionally, special courses offer basic education and technical training in military subjects with emphasis on leadership and management. PROGRAMS Military Studies at UVM consists of several programs: (1) A four-year program comprised of a Basic Course open to all freshmen-and sophomores and an Advanced Course for qualifying juniors and senior. This generally requires one military studies course per term during the four years of undergraduate study. Attendance at a summer camp of six weeks' duration is re\u00ad quired between the junior and senior year. (2) A two-year program for sophomores who have not taken any prior ROTC courses. The program requires a six-week summer camp, or attendance at a six-week on-campus military studies institute, between the sophomore and junior year; one course per term during the junior and senior year, and attendance at a six-week summer camp between the junior and senior year. (3) The Simultaneous Membership Program allows students to be active members of local National Guard units or Reserve units drawing approximately $100 per month pay, in addition to being members of the Advanced Course (regardless of academic year). (4) The Early Commis\u00ad sioning Program allows students who have fulfilled the military prerequisites for commissioning to receive a Reserve Officer's Commission while still completing their undergraduate studies. (5) The Veterans Program recognizes previous military service and provides commissioning opportunities for enlisted veterans. SCHOLARSHIPS Scholarships, available for four, three, two years, and one year, provide tuition, books, and all associated fees plus $100 a month during the school year. Application for the four-year scholarships is made during the senior year in high school. The three, two and one-year scholarship applications are made through the Department of Military Studies. SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE All junior and senior cadets receive $100 a month. Students also receive travel allowances to and from summer camp, plus approximately $600 while at camp. EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES Champlain Sabers and the Ethan Allen Rifles offer membership to participating students. The Champlain Sabers is a military fraternity fostering a spirit of friendship and cooperation among ROTC students. Ethan Allen Rifles is an honorary society for the promotion of military and academic excellence. POSTGRADUATE Upon graduation, ROTC students are normally commis\u00ad sioned as officers in the U.S. Army. The active duty service obligation will vary from three months with a Reserve Commission (six years' active reserve) to four years with a Regular Army Commission, dependent upon Army needs and per\u00ad 124 RESERVE OFFICERS TRAINING CORPS [ 125 sonal desires. Active duty may be deferred for as many as four years for those who wish to pursue an advanced degree while studying as a full-time graduate student. AIR FORCE The Department of Aerospace Studies provides preprofessional preparation for future Air Force Officers. The curriculum is designed to develop career-oriented men and women who can apply their university education and AFROTC ex\u00ad perience to their initial active duty assignments as Air Force Commissioned Of\u00ad ficers. AFROTC is open to all college majors. In addition to the formal courses of study, pilot candidates participate in a 25-hour Flight Instruction Program during their senior year. SCHOLARSHIPS Air Force ROTC College Scholarships provide payment of tuition, laboratory fees, textbooks, and $100 per month for each ten months of the school year on scholarship status. SUBSISTENCE PAY All students in their last two years of AFROTC receive tax-free subsistence pay of $100 per month. UNIFORMS Uniforms are furnished at no cost. AFROTC FIELD TRAINING Field training is offered during the summer bet\u00ad ween the sophomore and junior years at selected Air Force bases throughout the United States. Students in the four-year program participate in four weeks of field training during the summer between their sophomore and junior years. Students applying for entry into the two-year program must successfully com\u00ad plete six weeks of field training prior to enrollment in AFROTC. For additional information contact the AFROTC, Saint Michael's College. The Living/Learning Center The goal of the Living/Learning Center is to integrate academic and cultural activities with residential living in ways that enrich the personal and intellec\u00ad tual lives of its participants. It is both an academic support unit and a residence, housing 588 students and eight faculty families, as well as faculty and ad\u00ad ministrative offices. The Center is organized into programs, which are year-long plans of coursework seminars and/or special activities related to academic or avocational interests. These programs are created and directed by either students or faculty members. Living/Learning Center programs sometimes supplement an existing course of study but often define a totally new educational direction, providing exciting and unusual opportunities for the students who want to explore a curricular or personal interest in innovative ways. All of the programs have a specific theme and plan, outlining what skills, knowledge, creative talents, judgment, and abilities the program member will seek to develop. The freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and graduate students who reside in the Center live with fellow program members in five-, six-, or seven-person suites adjoining a common living room and bathroom facilities. This fosters close friendships and communication among the program members. The suites are located in each of the five buldings (A, B, C, D, and E) as are classrooms, laundry rooms, common living rooms and kitchens, as well as apartments for eight resident faculty and their families. The Center has a reading room/reference library, computer terminal room, grocery store, music practice rooms, dining hall, a pre-school, an audio/visual room, U.S. post office, ad\u00ad ministrative and faculty office space, a main Center lounge with a fireplace, and an art gallery. In addition, through the efforts and expertise of three accomplish\u00ad ed staff artists, the Center has pottery, graphics, and photography studios that provide direct program support for the L/LC community. The University com\u00ad munity is invited to become \"co-op\" members of the pottery and photography studios, providing members with informal instruction and use of the facilities and equipment. The building is accessible and equipped for the handicapped. Every program, faculty and student directed, sponsors educational activities to which the entire UVM community is invited, making Living/Learning a center of cultural and intellectual activity. An evening's involvement might include a sign language workshop, conversational Russian, dialogue with UVM faculty, ar\u00ad tistic performances and gallery exhibits, and various other program events. Attracting townspeople with exciting opportunities for involvement and learn\u00ad ing, the Living/Learning Center and its residents benefit from the expert advice of interested Burlingtonians who participate as L/LC Student Program Advisors, workshop leaders, loyal audiences (theatrical and musical performances), L/LC art gallery devotees, and as guest artists who exhibit or perform their art for the L/LC students and University community. Above all, the Living/Learning Center is an opportunity to be part of a com\u00ad munity of people \u2014 students, faculty, and administrative staff \u2014 who share the goal, work, and excitement of together improving the scope and quality of their University experience. 126 The Graduate College The mission of the Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desire a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields. The College offers 66 programs leading to the Master's degree, and 14 programs leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. For detailed information regarding graduate programs, degree requirements, and Graduate College regulations and procedures, refer to the Graduate College Catalogue, available from the Graduate Admissions Office, 332 Waterman Building.

UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT FOR GRADUATE CREDIT UVM senior undergraduates may enroll for graduate credit at UVM under the following circumstances: the course must be available for graduate credit; total enrollment including the graduate course must not exceed 12 credit hours in the semester in which the course is taken; the course must not be computed as part of the Bachelor's degree; permission to seek such graduate credit must be requested of the Graduate Dean in writing by the dean or director of the undergraduate college or school prior to enrollment. Such graduate credit is limited to six hours and is not available for transfer to another institution as graduate credit. It can be used only at UVM if the course is judged appropriate by the student's ad\u00ad visor for the particular graduate program. 127 Continuing Education Through Continuing Education the University provides opportunities for for\u00ad mal and informal study to persons who have and have not attended college, who require additional training in their work, or who wish to pursue previously unexplored areas of study. The Summer Session Summer Session offers courses in many subjects at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The offerings are diversified to meet the needs of students who desire courses l eading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Offerings are scheduled to enable students to accelerate their programs or explore new areas of interest. Special courses are developed for school personnel, both administrators and teachers, who desire fundamental or specialized courses or who wish to broaden their knowledge of special subjects. All courses are open to persons interested in study for self-improvement. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont ob\u00ad tain prior approval from his/her academic dean/director for any courses to be taken in the Summer Session. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are ap\u00ad propriate to the degree for which the student is working. The Master's degree in several (but not all) areas may be earned through work in the Sum\u00ad mer Session. Enrollment in courses for graduate credit does not imply admission to the Graduate College. Details about available courses and programs will be sent on request by the Director of Continuing Education. Evening Division The University's Evening Division program extends educational opportunities for adults beyond the daytime schedule. Members of the faculty at the University, and others work\u00ad ing under temporary appointment, offer evening or extension courses in many disciplines both at the Burlington campus and throughout Vermont. To establish Evening Division courses, interested persons should contact the Evening Divi\u00ad sion in Grasse Mount, (802) 656-2085. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Vermont ob\u00ad tain prior approval from his/her academic dean/director of any courses to be taken in the Evening Division to insure such courses are appropriate to the degree for which the student is working. All persons desiring graduate credit must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. 128 CONTINUING EDUCATION | 129 Non-Degree Student Enrollment Non-degree students are persons who have presented minimum credentials and are permit\u00ad ted to undertake evening courses and limited course work in the day program for purposes other than that of earning a degree. Credits earned by non-degree students who later apply and gain admission to a degree program will be evaluated and, if appropriate, will be ac\u00ad cepted toward completion of their degree. Non-degree students may enroll for a maximum of six credits (or two courses) per semester in the day program. Special permission is necessary for a student to exceed the six-credit maximum. Before completing 30 credits of course work through Continuing Education, degree-bound students should consult with an advisor at Continuing Education, submit an application for formal admission to UVM, and then should consult with the appropriate dean/director to structure further courses into a degree program. Graduate students are limited to a total accumulation of nine semester hours. Graduate non-degree students anticipating admission to a graduate degree program should seek advice in the Graduate College, Waterman Building. Selection of courses for those having long-range plans of earning a degree should be made on the basis of information given in this catalogue. Students interested in making a formal application for admission to the University should contact the Office of Admissions, Cle\u00ad ment House. Students presently enrolled and in good standing at another institution may take courses at the University of Vermont to transfer to their institutions. Visiting students are considered non-degree students and should contact Continuing Education for information and registration material. All non-degree students who would like assistance in planning educational programs and selecting courses should contact Continuing Education in Grasse Mount, (802) 656-2085. Conferences and Institutes Conference activity is a rapidly increasing part of University life. Throughout the regular college year and during the summer, many conference groups make use of University classroom and residence halls as well as University auditoria and dining services. Faculty, staff, and external groups interested in arranging for meetings or conferences at the Univer\u00ad sity must contact the Conferences and Institutes Office, Grasse Mount. This office will also plan and coordinate conferences, seminars, short courses, and meetings to be held at off- campus locations. Church Street Center for Community Education The Center, located in the restored Ethan Allen Firehouse on Burlington's Church Street, offers over 100 non-credit mini-courses and workshops each session and operates a pro\u00ad gram of lectures, films, readings, and exhibits. The Center also serves as a clearinghouse for information on University and community educational activities. It draws upon the com\u00ad bined talents and resources of the University and the larger community. Study Abroad The Office of Overseas Programs at B178 Living/Learning Center maintains information about overseas study programs and helps students make ar\u00ad rangements for foreign study. The Office also assists in the evaluation of credits from study abroad. Students intending to study overseas and receive credit from UVM must contact the Office of Overseas Programs and complete the Study Abroad Approval Form prior to departure. This applies even to students intend\u00ad ing to pursue independent study overseas under University of Vermont auspices. In addition to the opportunities for students to participate in hundreds of non- UVM overseas study programs, the University has direct involvement in the following programs: \u2014 The Vermont Overseas Study Program (VOSP) at the University of Nice in France pro\u00ad vides a year of study abroad for a selected group of undergraduates from the University of Vermont and from other colleges and universities. Intended primarily for students concentrating in French, the program is also open to qualified students from other fields, such as the fine arts or the social sciences. Student selection will be based on the following criteria: 1. Junior or senior class standing with a minimum grade-point average of 2.5 (C + ). 2. A good working knowledge of French. 3. An interest in and potential for capitalizing on a year of study abroad. 4. A sound educational program. 5. Creditable personal qualifications. Upon the successful completion of his/her work, the student receives appropriate credit (usually 30 hours) toward his/her degree. For further information about the Vermont Overseas Study Program, an interested student should contact the VOSP Office, Depart\u00ad ment of Romance Languages. \u2014 Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome: Properly qualified students may at\u00ad tend one or two semesters at the Center and receive full credit.

For further information contact Prof. Veronica Richel, Depart\u00ad ment of German and Russian. Courses of Instruction The University reserves the right to change these course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college/school in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course may be permitted to enroll by the instructor. Such students must inform the instructor that they lack the prerequisites, and the instructor will make appropriate efforts to ascertain that they are properly qualified. Courses are divided into three levels: introductory, intermediate, and advanced. Where appropriate, a department may limit enrollment in a particular course. Such limitations, other than class size, must be explicitly stated. Courses numbered from 1- 99 are introductory courses. Introductory courses em\u00ad phasize basic concepts of the discipline. In general, they presuppose no previous college work in the subject. The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in . which there is a two-semester introductory sequence. In such cases, the second semester course may have the first semester course as a prerequisite. Courses numbered from 100-199 are intermediate courses. An intermediate course covers more advanced material than that treated in introductory courses. Students will be expected to be familiar with the basic concepts of the subject and the course will present more difficult ideas. Intermediate courses will generally be more specialized than introductory courses. An intermediate course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study in the discipline or in another specified discipline. Courses numbered from 200-299 are advanced courses. An advanced course presents concepts, results, or arguments which are only accessible to students who have taken courses in the discipline (or, occasionally, in a related discipline) at the introductory and intermediate levels. Prior acquaintance with the basic concepts of the subject and with some special areas of the subject will be assum\u00ad ed. An advanced course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study at the intermediate level in the discipline, or in a related discipline, or some specified equivalent preparation. Some departments make further subdivisions of courses at some levels. Where this applies, an explanation can be found at the beginning of the department's list of courses. Two numerals separated by a comma (as in 17, 18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken independently for credit. Two numerals separated by a hyphen (as in 17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit, and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. In cases where two numerals are separated either by a comma or by a hyphen, the odd-numbered course will be taught in the fall and the even- numbered course in the spring. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course description. For some courses, the course title is followed by a pair of numerals connected by a hyphen and enclosed in parentheses (as in (2-3)); this form indicates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and laboratory. 132 Agricultural and Resource Economics COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Professors Sargent, Sinclair, Tremblay, Webster (Chairperson); Associate Professors Fife, Gilbert, Pelsue; Assistant Professor Schmidt; Extension Professors Bevins, Eddy, Houghaboom; Extension Associate Professor Bigalow, PROGRAM IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS 2 World Food and Population Agricultural development with emphasis on natural and economic phenomena and the effect of food supplies on population trends and policies.

French and Spanish language and literature courses are listed separately below by title and number. The language sequences are designed specifically to train students in the four skills of speaking, comprehension, reading, and writing. The 248 ROMANCE LANGUAGES | 249 total sequence in each language represents a continuum into which a student with previous experience in the language will be placed according to his/her level of achievement, regardless of how many or how few years he/she may have studied it. For placement in advanced language courses (100 or above), first-year students should consult with this department. Those who have already taken courses here should simply follow the levels represented by the number se\u00ad quences, 1-99, 100-199, etc. For convenience, we offer the following guidelines for placement in elementary and intermediate; in all cases of doubt students should seek the advice of this department.

LITERATURE COURSES IN FRENCH AND SPANISH As the language courses offer a continuum for the learning of the four skills, the literature courses provide a sequential study of the development of French and Spanish literatures from the Middle Ages to the present. In addition, they offer both practice and continued training in the four language skills. While the literature courses are divided into centuries, with subcategories of genres, themes, and individual authors, it is not essential to adhere strictly to chronological order. IN GENERAL, A ONE HUNDRED-LEVEL LITERATURE COURSE OR ITS EQUIVALENT IS THE PREREQUISITE FOR ALL OTHER LITERATURE COURSES: EXCEPTIONS ARE REGULARLY MADE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT.
