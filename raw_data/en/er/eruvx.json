September 2011Abstract Complex systems of coupled dynamical units can often be unde rstood as adaptive networks. In such networks the dynamical exchange of inform ation between the local and topological degrees of freedom gives rise to a plet hora of self-organization phenomena. Analytical studies can elucidate the mechanisms behind these phe- nomena. The development of respective approaches, however, is impeded by the necessity to capture both, the dynamical as well as structur al aspects of the network. This work explores a new analytical approach, which combines tools from dynam- ical systems theory with tools from graph theory to account f or the dual nature of adaptive networks. To our knowledge, it is the rst approach that is applicable to continuous networks. We use it to study the mechanisms behin d three emergent phenomena that are prominently discussed in the context of b iological and social sciences: synchronization, spontaneous diversication, and self-organized critical- ity. First, we analyze the relation between structure and dynami cs in a network of cou- pled, synchronized phase oscillators. By constructing a to pological interpretation of Jacobi's signature criterion, we show that synchronizati on can only be achieved if the network obeys specic topological conditions. These c onditions pertain to subgraphs on all scales, pinpointing the impact of mesoscal e topological structures on the collective dynamical state. Second, we study the emergence of social diversication and social coordination in a self-assembled collaboration network. Our model gener alizes the continuous snowdrift game, a paradigmatic model from game theory, to a m ulti-agent setting. In this generalization, the agents can continuously, selec tively, and independently adapt the amount of resources allocated to each of their coll aborations in order to maximize the obtained payoff. We show that both, social coor dination and diversi- cation, are emergent features of the model, and that both ph enomena can be traced back to symmetries of the local pairwise interactions. Third, we examine the ability of adaptive networks to self-or ganize toward dynam- ically critical states. We derive a generic recipe for the co nstruction of local rules that generate self-organized criticality. Our analysis al lows on the one hand side to relate details of the setup of hitherto studied models to par ticular functions within the self-organization process. On the other hand, it can gui de the construction of technical systems featuring the desired critical behavior . the millions of parts in industrial machinery. To f unction they require elab- orate construction and thoughtful assembly. Indeed, it is o ur general experience that systems of many interacting components need organization t o arrive at order and function. All the more fascinating is that in numerous natura l many-body systems order, structure, and function arise without planning and w ithout supervision: An- imals behave collectively in swarms, cells cooperate in fun ctional organs, and water molecules arrange themselves in complex snow crystals, alt hough none of the con- stituent parts has a vision of the global development, much l ess the authority to conduct or dominate it. Systems, in which collective order - be it spatial, temporal , or spatio-temporal - emerges on the basis of local interactions and local informa tion, are called self- organizing [ 1].Self-organization plays a crucial role in biology, but also in our social lives [ 2], and in the economy [ 3,4]. Moreover, it is increasingly considered an attrac- tive paradigm for technical solutions beyond the reach of fu nctional architecture and centralized control [ 5]. Such solutions promise to feature both, scalability and r o- bustness against perturbations and parameter changes. Sca lability results from the locality of interactions: By processing information from o nly few other constituents, each single constituent is insensitive to the system size. Th us, large systems can be realized by increasing only the number, but not the design, o f the constituent parts. Robustness results from the dynamical nature of the self-or ganization: A system that a has evolved into a structured or functional state from unspecic initial con- ditions is likely to reach it again, when it is perturbed by no ise or environmental changes. Every endeavour to approach self-organization, whether to understand the phe- nomenon in real-world systems, or to utilize it in technical applications, leads to either of two sides of one central problem: There neither exis ts a generic algorithm, which would allow to trace system-level phenomena back to th e properties of the 11Introduction individual constituents, nor a recipe for designing the con stituents such that they generate a desired system-level behavior. The non-apparent relationship between local and global prop erties identies self- organization as an emergent feature of a complex system [ 6]. The genesis of such features can be illustrated using the example of a chemical s ubstance. Its solid, fluid, or gaseous phases are not composed of solid, fluid, or gase ous particles but rather differ in the interactions of the constituents. This s uggests that for the analysis of emergent features, such as the aggregate state, the prope rties of the interactions between constituents are at least as important as the proper ties of the constituents themselves. A convenient framework for the mathematical description of a complex, self-organi- zing system is provided by networks. Considering a given sys tem as a network means to reduce it to a set of discrete nodes connected by link s and thus to simplify its constituents, while retaining the complexity of their i nteractions. The formal concept of networks and their terminology mostly o riginate from the mathematical eld of graph theory . Yet, while in graph theory, networks are usu- ally regarded as static objects, the approach from the compl ex-system perspective highlights their dynamical nature. In general, a network model may account for two types of dynam ics: State dy- namics onthe network, and topological changes ofthe network. In many cases, both types of dynamics occur interdependently. Such a netwo rk, in which the local state dynamics are topology-dependent and the link evoluti on is state-dependent, is called an adaptive network [7,8]. Adaptive networks are found in many real-world systems [ 7]. For instance, in social networks, the opinion of an individual may be influence d by its interaction partners, while an individual's choice with whom to interact may depend on the others' opinions [ 9,10]. Further examples include technical [ 11], as well as biological networks [ 12], chemical [ 13], as well as transport networks [ 14]. Due to their ubiquity, adaptive networks provide a framewor k for studying themes from various elds. After simulation studies have opened up a plethora of most interesting phenomena [ 9-29], it is todays's challenge to develop analytical ap- proaches for addressing the underlying principles. Analytical approaches to adaptive networks need to account f or the dual nature of such networks and thus to comprise two different mathemat ical frameworks: While graph theory provides the tools for the description of the network structure, dynamical systems theory lends itself to the description of its dynamics. Combining 2both frameworks causes characteristic difculties. Thus, n etworks are inherently high-dimensional, while dynamical systems theory has prim arily been developed for low-dimensional systems. Many existing approaches solve the problem by describing th e network by coarse- grained variables hence effectively reducing it to a low-di mensional system [ 30-42]. The information about the states of the individual nodes is ty pically cut down to the abundances of nodes with a given state. Similarly, the to pological information is cut down to the abundance of certain subgraphs. These can ei ther be subgraphs that contain one link [ 30,31], subgraphs that contain less than a given number of links [ 32-36], or subgraphs that are star-shaped [ 37-42]. In all cases, the number of subgraphs to be tracked increases combinatorially with t he number of possible node states limiting the approaches to discrete networks, i n which the number of accessible states is low. In all but very specic systems, coarse-graining constitut es an approximation. The validity of this approximation is dependent on the absence o f correlations beyond a certain scale. Thus, the degree of accuracy of coarse-grain ed descriptions varies considerably depending on the model, dynamical phase, and q uestion under con- sideration [ 43]. In this thesis, we explore an analytical approach that is com plementary to coarse- graining. We use the full, high-dimensional descriptions o f different adaptive net- work models to derive exact results about their self-organi zational properties. For capturing the topological information, we complement the t ools of dynamical sys- tems theory with the tools of graph theory. Our approach is ap plicable to continu- ous networks, in which the nodes and the links can assume an in nite number of different states. We use the approach to study three fundamental self-organiz ation phenomena: We rst address the spontaneous synchronization of coupled os cillators, second, the di- versication of an initially homogeneous population into d ifferent node classes, and third, the topological self-organization of adaptive netw orks toward a dynamically critical state. The investigation of the phenomena goes hand in hand with the in- vestigation of the relation between the local, and the globa l, the structural, and the dynamical properties of adaptive networks. In particular, we ask which topological structures support a specic global dynamical state, which topological structures evolve from a given set of local dynamical rules, and which lo cal rules generate a specic global behavior. We start in Chapter 2with a short introduction of the concepts and tool used in thi s work. The chapter focuses on topics from dynamical systems th eory and graph the- 31Introduction ory. In addition, we introduce the concept of a phase transit ion, which we contrast against the concept of a bifurcation in order to employ both a ngles for the analysis in Chapter 5. In Chapter 3, we study the interplay between structure and dynamics in a n et- work of coupled phase oscillators described by the paradigm atic Kuramoto model. Here, the proposed approach can pinpoint specic defects pr ecluding synchroniza- tion. Deriving a topological interpretation of Jacobi's sig nature criterion, we show that synchronization can only be achieved if the coupling ne twork obeys specic topological conditions. These conditions do not only pertai n to the topology of the complete network, but also to its topological building bloc ks. We can thus explore the impact of particular mesoscale structures on the stabil ity of collective dynamical states. In Chapter 4, we study the emergence of social structure in a population o f self- interested agents. Here, our approach allows for studying t he established contin- uous snowdrift game in a multi-agent setting. We propose a mo del that accounts for the ability of agents to maintain different levels of coo peration with different self-chosen partners. All agents continuously, selectivel y, and independently adapt the amount of resources allocated to each of their collabora tions in order to max- imize the obtained payoff, thereby shaping the social netwo rk. We show that the symmetries of the local dynamical rules scale up and are impr inted in non-obvious symmetries in the evolving global structure. The self-organ ized global symmetries imply a high degree of social coordination, while at the same time causing the emergence of privileged topological positions, thus diver sifying the initially homo- geneous population into different social classes. In Chapter 5, we study a class of adaptive network models that evolve towa rd a topological conguration, in which the dynamics on the netw ork become critical. We discuss how the emergence of self-organized criticality (SOC) is linked to the adaptive feedback loop, and argue that in a number of models d isplaying SOC this feedback is implemented according to a certain pattern. Our approach allows to de- termine how, and under which generic conditions the pattern generates SOC. The conceptual understanding enables us on the one hand to relat e details of the setup of exemplary models to particular functions within the self -organization process. On the other hand, it allows us to formulate a generic recipe f or the construction of adaptation rules that give rise to SOC. We demonstrate its ap plicability by construct- ing an adaptive Kuramoto model that self-organizes toward th e onset of collective synchronized behavior. Finally, we summarize our results in Chapter 6. We emphasize that they can feed 4back to both, the fundamental understanding of biological s ystems as well as the innovative design of technological applications. Beside t he results on the studied phenomena, we discuss general aspects of the approach itsel f. In particular, we outline possible extensions of the explored methodology. 52Concepts and Tools The purpose of this work is to develop new analytical approach es that capture the dual nature of dynamical networks by combining tools fro m graph theory, and dynamical systems theory. In this chapter we introduce the r elevant concepts and approaches. The selected topics are elementary, and can be fo und in most textbooks. They are presented here to illustrate the line of reasoning em ployed, rather than to achieve mathematical rigor. In the same spirit, lengthy or t echnical aspects, which substantiate the argumentation but interrupt the line of th ought, are presented in boxes throughout the subsequent chapters. We begin in Section 2.1with dynamical systems. Following a brief denition of the central notions, we focus on two techniques - linear stabili ty analysis and bifurca- tion analysis - to which we will return in the course of the fol lowing chapters. In Section 2.2, we introduce the concept of phase transitions and contrast it against the concept of a bifurcation. Finally, in Section 2.3we review the relevant notions from graph and network theory. 2.1Dynamical systems In many different disciplines, observations of an experime ntal system are described by a set of state variables. The common reading in mathematics and physics inter- prets the values of these variables at any instance tas coordinates in the abstract space of all possible states of the system - the so-called phase space [44-46]. The instantaneous state of a system is thus described by a positi on in phase space. And its evolution is given by a trajectory through phase space. Dynamical models mimic the progression of a physical system s through phase space by formulating a prescription which, for any point in phase s pace, species the points that the system will pass through in the immediate fut ure. Typically, such prescriptions are formulated as differential equations or time discrete maps, which 72Concepts and Tools can then be studied in the framework of dynamical systems the ory. The evolution equations may be stochastic or deterministic. Often, they a renon-linear and param- eter dependent. If they do not explicitly depend on time, the dynamical system is called autonomous [45]. In this work, we consider dynamical systems described by aut onomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs): d dtx/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /equalmathf/parenleftbigx/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath, p1,...,pm/parenrightbig, (1) where the components of the vector eld fare smooth functions depending only on the phase-space coordinates xRn, and onmparameters piR[46]. A function x/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathwhich solves the system of ODEs for a given set of initial cond itions is called a trajectory ororbit . While in many textbooks the emphasis is on the calculation a nd the characterization of individual trajectories (see [ 47,48] and references therein), this work mostly focusses on families of trajectories, and, in particular, on their long-term behavior [ 45,46]. The dynamical systems studied in this work are dissipative . This means that over time the phase space volume spanned by trajectories with dif ferent initial conditions contracts. In such systems, we can distinguish between tran sient and long-term behavior. During the transients, the system approaches cer tain regions in phase space, in which it then remains for all time. One possible type of long-term behavior is stationarity. It corresponds to a steady state xof the system, for which f/parenleftmathx/parenrightmath/equalmath0. Below, we employ the example of a steady state to discuss the concept of stability, and the tec hniques of linear stability analysis. The notion of stability as used in this work can be understood i n terms of the system's reaction to small perturbations. A steady state xof the dynamical system given by Eq. ( 1) is called stable, if all trajectories beginning close to it remain close - that is, if small perturbations from the steady state remai n small. The stronger notion of local asymptotic stability requires that all traj ectories starting close to the steady state eventually converge toward it, i.e., that sma ll perturbations decay. Below, we use the term 'stability' in the sense of local asympt otic stability. In the vicinity of a steady state, the system of ODEs in Eq. 1can be approximated by the linear system d dtx/equalmathJx. 82.1Dynamical systems Here,xdenotes a matrix , dened by Jik/equalmathxi/xk|x. The solutions of the linear system are well known, and can be written in the form x/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /equalmathn/summationdisplay i/equalmath1cieitvi, (3) where the ciare coefcients predened conditions, viare the of Jandithe corresponding eigenvalues [ 45]. Equation ( 3) shows that the stability of xis determined by the spectrum of J: if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian have negative real parts, then all the perturba tionsxdecay, and the steady state is stable. By contrast, if one or more eigenvalu es of the Jacobian have positive real parts, then perturbations in direction of the respective eigenvectors are amplied, and the steady state is unstable. In summary, the linear stability analysis of a dynamical sys tem reduces to an eigen- value problem. If all parameters piare specied, the problem can be solved by using numerical algorithms for calculating the spectrum of high-dimensional ma- trices [ 49]. In many cases, however, it is interesting to study familie s of systems with generic, unspecied parameters. In such cases, the eig envalue problem has to be solved analytically. In particular for high-dimensio nal systems, it is useful to consider that for determining the stability properties, co mplete knowledge of the spectrum of Jis unnecessary; knowledge of the signs alone sufces. Tools for stabil- ity analysis that depart from this point are the method of res ultants [ 50], and Jacobi's signature criterion discussed in Chapter 3and 4. The idea of studying families of dynamical systems, whose mem bers differ with respect to their parameter values pi, leads directly to another important concept, that of bifurcation . In general, two systems with slightly different parameter sets p and phave different but topologically equivalent dynamics, that is, they are identical with respect to the number, and type of their attractors. How ever, there may be parameter sets p, for which there are arbitrarily close sets pexhibiting topologically non-equivalent dynamics. Such parameter sets pdene special parameter space , called bifurcation points [ 45,46]. Crossing a bifurcation point in parameter space induces a structural transition in the phase space. The transition itself is called a bifurcation. If the evolution equations ( 1) are smooth functions, the bifurcation points are not isolated in parameter space, but lie on a manifold [ 45]. The difference between the dimension of the parameter space and the dimension of the bif urcation manifold is referred to as the codimension of the bifurcation. Equivalently, the codimension can be dened as the minimal number of parameters that need to be varied for the 92Concepts and Tools bifurcation to occur. Bifurcation manifolds divide the parameter space in region s of topologically equiv- alent systems. In physics, such regions are often called the phases of a system. Phases and bifurcations represent the observable characte ristics of a dynamical sys- tem, which can be used to compare the theoretical model with t he described exper- imental system. Thus, variations of experimental parameter s within a phase should not qualitatively change the behavior of the experimental s ystem, while already marginal changes close to a bifurcation manifold are expect ed to induce abrupt transitions [ 51-53]. 2.2Phases and phase transitions Many particle systems in equilibrium can often be analyzed o n a macroscopic, phe- nomenological level, the classical example being an ideal g as: Statistical physics relates the microscopic properties of individual particle s, such as location and mo- mentum of atoms and molecules, to macroscopic state variabl es, such as tempera- ture and pressure. The relation between both levels of descri ption is probabilistic. It is based on the assumption that the probability of nding a st ate with given macro- scopic state variables depends on the number of compatible m icroscopic states [ 54]. Generalizing statistical physics to systems far from equil ibrium, considered here, is a persistent challenge. Thus, for example, the fundamental a ssumption on the prob- ability of a given macroscopic state is inherently bound to e quilibrium. Accordingly, we do not use statistical physics for the analysis of the syst ems that we consider in the subsequent chapters. Yet, we do use its terminology to de scribe the featured phenomena on a macroscopic, phenomenological level. In the language of statistical physics, a phase is a region in parameter space, through- out which the macroscopic state variables of a system change smoothly. At a phase boundary, by contrast, small variations of the parameters i nduce qualitative changes in the macroscopic variables. These changes can either be dis continuous, or else be continuous, but non-analytic. Depending on the actual type of changes, we speak of a discontinuous / continuous phase transition respectively [ 55,56]. In this work, we will be concerned only with continuous phase transitions. A system that undergoes such a transitions displays unique features , which are commonly subsumed under the term criticality . In a critical state, the correlation between local properties of the microscopic constituents extend over arb itrarily large distances, limited only by the size of the system [ 56]. Moreover, a number of observables show power-law behavior. 102.3Graphs Continuous phase transitions can in many cases be studied in terms of a so-called order parameter , an observable that it is zero in one phase and non-zero in the other [56]. An order parameter prole associates to every point in parameter space a value of the order parameter. It displays kinks at the points in par ameter space, where the transition occurs. It is worth noticing that specifying an o rder parameter determines the corresponding phase transition, while a phase transiti on can often be described by different order parameters [ 55,57]. In summary, a situation, in which small variations in the par ameters induce quali- tative changes in the behavior of an experimental system, ca n be analyzed in terms of a bifurcation or a phase transition depending the descrip tion that is available for the underlying system. In cases where both description are a vailable, the relation between bifurcations and phase transitions is known [ 58]. For the class of systems described in Chapter 5, the phase-transition treatment is well established; descriptions in terms of bifurcation ana lysis, however, are so far known only for a few special cases [ 59]. Yet, even for systems which have no such descriptions, insights from bifurcation theory can often b e used indirectly. 2.3Graphs In the following chapters, we will use the tools from dynamic al systems to analyze the microscopic dynamics of and on networks, and the concept s from statistical physics to describe the observed macroscopic behavior. The c oncepts of graph the- ory will be used to classify the networks' structure. Let us emphasize that there exist two terminological framew orks for describing the structure of a network: That of graph theory, which it mostly u sed in mathematics, and that of complex network theory, which is more common in ph ysics. Here, we mainly use the terminology of complex network theory. The onl y exception are the terms 'network', and 'network theory', which we replace by the te rms 'graph', and 'graph theory', where we want to make explicit that solely stru ctural aspects are meant. Below, we give a short overview over the central notions of co mplex network / graph theory. Detailed introductions into the eld can be fo und in [ 60,61]. A graph describes the pairwise relations between objects fr om a certain collection. The objects are represented by so-called nodes ; their pairwise relations by so-called links . Every link has two endpoints in the collection of nodes, and is said to con- nect them. Connected nodes are called neighboring oradjacent , the aggregate of all 112Concepts and Tools neighborhood relations denes the topology . Graphs are categorized in different classes depending on th e properties of their links [ 61]. A link that has an orientation, distinguishing one of the c onnected nodes as its origin and the other as its end point, is called directed . Equivalently, a link that has no orientation is called undirected . A link that is associated with a real number is called weighted . A directed/undirected/weighted graph is a graph that cont ains directed/undirected/weighted links. For describing the structure of a graph, one often refers to i ts building blocks. A graphG, whose nodes and links form subsets of the nodes and link of a g iven graph G, is called a subgraph ofG. A subgraph GofGis called a spanning subgraph if it contains all nodes of G. A (simple) path is a subgraph that consists of a set of nodes connected by an un - branched sequence of links; the length of the path is the numb er of links con- tained [ 61]. A cycle is a path that ends at the node it begins. Cycles of length one are called self-loops. A graph is called connected if every pair of nodes is connected by a path, and it is called fully connected if every pair of nodes is connected by a path of length one. A graph that is not connected can be divided into disjoint conn ected subgraphs, called components . A component without cycles is a tree. The complete topology of a graph is captured in the so-called adjacency matrix . This is a square matrix A, whose order is determined by the number of nodes in the graph. An entry AijofAis zero if node iandjare not adjacent, and one if they are. To capture the topology of weighted graphs one can dene a weighted adjacency matrix W. This is an adjacency matrix, whose entries Wijdenote the weight of the link between iandj. Thus,Wijis zero if node iandjare not adjacent, but can usually take any value from a specied interval if they are. Some of the global attributes of graphs dened above map dire ctly to global prop- erties of the adjacency matrix. Thus, for an undirected graph ,Aij/equalmathAji, i.e., the adjacency matrix is symmetric. For a graph without self-loo ps, it has zeroes on the diagonal. Finally, if a graph consists of more than one compo nent, its node can be relabeled such that the adjacency matrix becomes block diag onal [ 61]. In network models that contain a large number of links and nod es, the structure of the underlying graph is often described only on the level o f global topological features. The most prominent among these features are based o n the degree of the nodes. A nodes's degree is dened as the number of links attach ed to it [ 60]. The 122.4Summary degree distribution of a graph captures the relative frequency of nodes with a giv en degree. The mean degree of a graph is the average of the degrees of its nodes and thus proportional to the ratio between links and nodes of the graph. Interestingly, this coarse grained measure already allows some statements concerning the actual topology. Thus, a component with Nnodes and mean degree 2 /parenleftmathN1/parenrightmath/Nmust be a tree, a component with Nnodes and a mean degree greater or equal to 2 must have at least one cycle. Finally, note that the locality of interactions and informa tion, which is fundamen- tal to our denition of self-organization, is topological i n nature. In the context of graphs and networks, locality is usually dened as pertaini ng to direct neighbor- hood relations. For instance, in Chapter 5we call an update rule local if it only depends on the state of a focal node and the states of its topol ogical neighbors. 2.4Summary In this chapter we have reviewed tools and concepts from dyna mical systems the- ory, statistical physics, and graph theory, which are used f or the analysis of self- organization phenomena in network models in the subsequent chapters. In these models, the evolution of the individual microscopic consti tuents are mostly for- mulated in terms of dynamical systems. However, the dimensi on of the systems is typically huge, such that the emergent, system-level phe nomena fall within the scope of the concepts of many particle statistical physics. Finally, the structure of the networks will be described using the concepts from graph theory. 133Topological stability criteria for synchronized states In the multifarious world of emergent collective phenomena , synchronization stands out as one of the most intensively studied [ 62,63]. The term pertains to situations, in which coupled microscopic oscillators acquire a common f requency due to their interactions. This then gives rise to macroscopic oscillati ons. One reason for the prominent role of synchronization is the u niversality of the phe- nomenon. Real world examples of systems, whose periodic mac roscopic behavior can be traced back to collective oscillations of individual microscopic units, are found in many different elds such as biology, ecology, and e ngineering [ 62-65]. They include for instance the beating heart [ 66], populations of flashing reflies [ 67] or radio communication devices [ 68]. Another reason for the extensive study of synchronization is that it is considered a benchmark for the understanding of emergent phenomena as s uch [ 62]. The paradigmatic model proposed by Kuramoto [ 69] has opened the eld for detailed studies of the interplay between collective dynamics and in teraction structure [ 70- 74]. These studies have revealed the influence of various topolog ical measures, such as the clustering coefcient, the diameter, and the degree o r weight distribution, on the propensity to synchronize [ 75-77]. However, recent results [ 64,78,79] indicate that beside global topological measures also details of the exact local conguration can crucially affect synchronization. This highlights sync hronization of phase oscil- lators as a promising example, in which it may be possible to u nderstand the local, global, and mesoscale constraints on stability that severe ly limit the operation of complex technical and institutional systems [ 80,81]. In this chapter, we derive necessary topological condition s for the stability of col- lective synchronized dynamics. While statistical approac hes reveal the influence of global topological features on the propensity to synchroni ze, our approach identies specic topological defects precluding synchronization. These pertain to subgraphs that contain multiple nodes but are smaller than the entire n etwork, thus imposing constraints on the mesoscale. 153Topological stability criteria for synchronized states We start in Sec. 3.1by introducing the Kuramoto-model of heterogeneous coupled phase oscillators. By means of Jacobi's signature criterion we determine necessary algebraic conditions for the stability of phase-locked sol utions. In Sec. 3.2, we in- troduce a graphical notation, on the basis of which the algeb raic stability conditions can be mapped on topological stability criteria (cf. Sec. 3.3). In Sec. 3.4, we show that the results can readily be generalized to other systems than the studied. Finally, we apply our analysis to an adaptive version of the Kuramoto mo del in Sec. 3.5, and discuss our results in Sec. 3.6. 3.1Stability in networks of phase-oscillators Consider a system of Noscillators i, whose time evolution is given by xi/equalmathi/plusmath/summationdisplay jne}ationslash/equalmathiAijsin/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath,i1...N .

Equation ( 4) denes the so-called Kuramoto model, that is today consider ed to be a paradigm for the study of synchronization phenomena in coup led discrete systems [82], and is, therefore, used as the natural benchmark for compa rative evaluations of performances of methods and tools. IfAijne}ationslash/equalmath0, the two oscillators iandjare said to be coupled, if further xi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /equalmathxj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath for allt, they are said to be phase locked . In this chapter, we are interested in com- pletely phase locked states, i.e., in states where xi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /equalmathxj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathfor alli,j. Studied in a reference frame that co-rotates with a frequency /equalmath1/N/summationtextN i/equalmath1i, the phase-locked states correspond to steady states of the governing system o f equations ( 4). The local stability of such states is determined by the eigenval ues of the Jacobian matrix JRN\u00d7Ndened by Jik/equalmathxi/xk(cf. Chapter 2). In systems of symmetrically coupled phase oscillators, the Jacobian Jis symmet- ric and thus admits analysis by Jacobi's signature criterion (JSC). The JSC (also known as Sylvester criterion) states that the number of nega tive eigenvalues of a hermitian or symmetric matrix Jequals the number of changes of sign in the se- quence 1,D1,...,Dr, whereDq:/equalmathdet/parenleftmathJik/parenrightmath,i,k/equalmath1,...,q , is the principal minor of orderq, andris the rank of J[83]. In a stable system, the sequence has to alter- nate in every step. Hence, a necessary and sufcient conditi on for stability is that sgn/parenleftbigDq/parenrightbig/equalmath /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathqfor allq. 163.2Graphical notation Stability analysis by means of JSC is well-known in control t heory [ 83] and has been applied to problems of different elds from fluid- and thermod ynamics to offshore engineering [ 84-86]. However, the applicability of JSC is presently limited to sys- tems with few degrees of freedom. For system with many degree s of freedom the analytical evaluation of JSC is impeded by the growth of both , a) the number of determinants that have to be checked, and b) the number of ter ms in each deter- minant. Dealing with this growth is the central difculty ad dressed in the present chapter. Let us rst consider difculty (a) stated above. Applying the sufcient condi- tion is impracticable for most larger systems. Note, howeve r, that demanding sgn/parenleftbigDq/parenrightbig/equalmath /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathqfor someqalready yields a necessary condition for stability. The necessary stability condition that is found by consideri ng a principal minor of given order qdepends on the ordering of variables, i.e., the ordering of row s and columns in the Jacobian. By considering different ordering s, the number of condi- tions obtained for a given qcan therefore be increased [ 87]. To distinguish minors that are based on different orderings of the variables, we de neS/equalmath/braceleftbigs1,...,sq/bracerightbigas a set ofqindices and Dq,Sas the determinant of the submatrix of J, which is spanned by the variables xs1,...,xsq. Therewith, the conditions for stability read sgn/parenleftbigDq,S/parenrightbig/equalmath /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathq,S, q/equalmath1,...,r. (5) Considering necessary rather than sufcient conditions av oids the difculty (a) mentioned above, which leaves us to deal with difculty (b), i.e., the combinato- rial explosion of terms that are needed to write out the condi tions for increasing q. In the common notation more than 700 terms are necessary for e xpressing the mi- nors of order 6. Although we cannot circumvent this problem co mpletely, progress can be made by employing a graphical notation that captures b asic intuition and allows for expressing the minors in a concise way. 3.2Graphical notation We propose a graphical notation based on a topological readi ng of the minors. We interpret the Jacobian Jas the weight matrix of an undirected, weighted graph G. A Jacobian element Jijthen corresponds to the weight of a link connecting nodes iand j. We can now relate products of the Jacobian elements to subgr aphs ofGspanned by the respective links. For instance JijJjkis interpreted as the path i-j-k,JijJjkJki as a cycle from itojtokand back to i. Thus, the minors of Jcan be expressed as sums over subgraphs of G. 173Topological stability criteria for synchronized states The Leibniz formula for determinants [ 88] implies that (i) a minor Dq,Sis a sum over q! elementary products Ji1j1\u00b7...\u00b7Jiqjq; and that (ii) in each of these products every index siSoccurs exactly twice. In the topological reading this translates to the following statements : Because of property (i), each term of a minor Dq,Scorresponds to a subgraph with qlinks. Because of property (ii), these subgraphs are composed of sets of cycles in G: Every index siSoccurs either with multiplicity two on a diagonal element of J, or, with multiplicity one, on two off- diagonal elements of J. In the former case, the respective factor corresponds to a self-loo p ofG, i.e., to a cycle of length n/equalmath1; in the latter case, there is a set of factors Jijine}ationslash/equalmathj corresponding to a closed path of links, i.e., a cycle of length n>1. Box 1: All minors Dq,Scan be decomposed in the cyclic subgraphs of G. In Box 1we show that every term occurring in a minor Dq,SofJcorresponds to a subgraph that can be decomposed in cycles of G. This allows expressing the index structure of every term by a combination of symbols den oting cycles of a given length. The idea is now to supplement the basis of symbol s with a summa- tion convention; This convention is designed such that all al gebraic terms that are structurally identical and only differ by index permutatio ns can be captured in one symbolic term, which drastically reduces the complexity of the minors. Below, we use the following denitions: The basis of symbols i s given by \u00d7,|,,/Box,... denoting cycles of length n/equalmath1,2,3,4,.... The summation convention stipulates that in a minor Dq,S, every product of symbols denotes the sum over all non-equiv alent possibilities to build the depicted subgraph with the qnodess1,...,sq. With these conventions the rst 4 principal minors can be written symbols with/summationdisplay n/equalmathq/parenrightig , (7) where symbols with n > 2 appear with a factor 2 that reflects the two possible orientations in which the corresponding subgraphs can be pa ced out. Symbols with \u00b7 = - \u00b7\u00b7 +2\u00b7- - - - + 2\u00b7 Figure 1: Example for the graphical notation. Shown are the minors of the matrix ( 8) in alge- braic, and graphical notation, and, for each term, the corre sponding subgraph of a three-node graph G. Here, as well as in the next gures, lled symbols correspond to nodes S, open symbols to nodes /S. an even (odd) number of links carry a negative (positive) sig n related to the sign of the respective index permutation in the Leibniz formula for determinants [ 88]. An example for the graphical notation is presented in Fig. 1. The gure displays the three principal minors of the symmetric 3 \u00d73 matrix J/equalmath J11J12J13 J12J22J23 J13J23J33 (8) in algebraic, and graphical notation. Moreover, it display s for each term the corre- sponding subgraph of a three-node graph G. In many systems, including the standard Kuramoto model, fund amental conserva- tion laws impose a zero-row-sum condition, such that Jii/equalmath/summationtext jne}ationslash/equalmathiJij. Using this relation we can remove all occurrences of elements Jiifrom the Jacobian and its mi- nors. In the topological reading this substitution changes the graph Gby replacing a self-loop at a node iby the negative sum over all links that connect to i. The simplication of the minors due to the zero-row-sum condi tion can be under- stood using the example of the Eqs. ( 6). Replacing the self-loops, the rst term of every minor Dq,S,\u00d7q, is/parenleftmath1/parenrightmathqtimes the sum over all subgraphs meeting the follow- ing conditions: (i) the subgraph contains exactly qlinks; (ii) there is at least one link 193Topological stability criteria for synchronized states connecting to every node S; and (iii) every link connects to at least one node S. By means of elementary combinatorics it can be veried that a ll other terms of Dq,S cancel exactly those subgraphs in \u00d7qthat contain cycles. This enables us to express the minors in another way: Dening q,S/equalmath/summationdisplay all acyclic subgraphs /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathqq,S. (10) We remark that Kirchhoff's Theorem [ 89], which has previously been used for the analysis of dynamical systems [ 90,91], appears as the special case of Eq. ( 10), in whichq/equalmathN1. The simplication of the minors due to the zero-row-sum condi tion as well as the relation between the Dq,Sand their topological equivalents q,Scan be illustrated by means of a simple example. Consider the symmetric 6 \u00d76 matrix J/equalmath /parenleftmathJ12/plusmathJ13/parenrightmathJ12 J13 0 0 0 J12/parenleftmathJ12/plusmathJ23/parenrightmathJ23 0 0 J13 J23/parenleftmathJ13/plusmathJ23/plusmathJ34/parenrightmathJ34 0 0 0 0 J34 /parenleftmathJ34/plusmathJ45/parenrightmathJ45 0 0 0 0 J45/parenleftmathJ45/plusmathJ56/parenrightmathJ56 0 0 0 0 J56J56 (11) which obeys the zero-row-sum condition. In Fig. 2, we calculate the minor D4,S/equalmath{1,...,4} in terms of the subgraphs of the corresponding graph G. The calculation illustrates the reasoning that lead to the Eqs. ( 9) and ( 10). The complete sequence of minors Dq,S,q/equalmath1,...,r can zero-row-sum condition. On the other hand, we can use the denition ( 9) to construct the sequence q,S, q/equalmath1,...,r , directly from the graph G(cf. Fig. 3). A comparison of both, the alge- braic and the topological results, reproduces Eq. ( 10). Note that labeling the nodes in different order would have yielded different algebraic a s well as topological ex- pressions. 203.2Graphical notation A B D C+ + + ++ + ++ + + ++ + + ++ + + node node 1 23 4 5 6 Figure 2: Symbolic calculation of a minor using the zero-row-sum con dition.

The topologi cal reading of determinants maps a symmetric Jacobian Jwith zero row sum onto a graph G, whose weighted adjacency matrix is given by the off-diagonal part of J. The minors ofJcan then be interpreted as sums over values associated with s ubgraphs of G. Combining the Eqs. ( 5) and ( 10), the algebraic stability constraints on the minors of Jtranslate into q,S>0,S, q/equalmath1,...,r. (12) We emphasize that the graph Gis not an abstract construction, but combines in- formation about the physical interaction topology and the d ynamical units. For example, if a graph Ghas disconnected components, there is a reordering of the variablesxi, such that Jis block diagonal. This implies that the spectra of different topological components of Gdecouple and can thus be treated independently. From Eq. ( 12) we can immediately read off a weak sufcient condition for stability: Asq,Sis a sum over products of the Jij, a Jacobian with Jij0i,jis a solution to Eq. ( 12) irrespective of the specic structure of G(for the specic case of the Kuramoto model known as Ermentrout theorem [ 92,93]). By contrast, if Jij<0 for somei,j, then the existence of solutions of Eq. ( 12) is dependent on the topology. In the following, we investigate which combinations of negati veJijin a graph Glead to the violation of at least one of the Eqs. ( 12). For this purpose, we rst explore the restrictions that Eq. ( 12) imposes on simple topological building blocks. Thereafter , we piece the results for the different example topologies to gether to formulate a conjecture for stability conditions in complex topologies . In Fig. 4, we illustrate that if Gis a tree, then Jij0i,jis not only a sufcient but also a necessary condition for stability. The reasoning i n the gure translates one-to-one to any tree-like subgraph of a general graph Gthat is not part of a cycle ofG. More precisely: Stability requires that all links of Gthat are not part of a cycle correspond to positive entries of the Jacobian. Conversely , links corresponding to negative entries can only appear in cyclic parts of the graph . In Fig. 5, we summarize results for different cyclic example graphs, which we ob- tained by the calculations sketched in Box 2. The gures show that stability restricts the maximum number of links corresponding to negative eleme nts, as well as their position, and their strength. The maximum number of negative links that can be reconciled with stability is one less than the number of inde pendent cycles. Further, the negative links must be placed such that the graph that is o btained by removing the negative links is still connected. 223.3Topological stability conditions Figure 4: Necessary stability condition for trees. (a,b) If Gis a tree,N1,Shas only one term, Gitself (nodes /Sare represented by open symbols). The condition N1,S>0 then allows for an even number of negative links in G. If the number of negative links is>0 (e.g. 2), we can nd a pair of nodes i,jconnected by a negative link and choose S/equalmath/braceleftbigk|kne}ationslash/equalmathi,j/bracerightbigsuch thatN2,S/equalmathN1,S/Jij<0 (c). It follows that if Gis a tree, stability requires that all links are positive. a b c Figure 5: Necessary stability conditions for cyclic example topolo gies. (a) If Gis a cycle, it can have at most one negative link whose strength ||is bounded by a cycle-length dependent relation (cf. Box 2). (b) IfGis composed of two cycles that share one node, each of these cycles can have at most one negative link o f bounded strength. (c) IfGis composed of two cycles that share a sequence of links, ever y unbranched sequence of links (red, violet, blue), can at most have one ne gative link, while the total number of negative links may not exceed 2. Removing the maximum number of negative links from the example topologies reveals that t he permissible graph is still connected (lower panels). 233Topological stability criteria for synchronized states LetGbe a cycle of length N, whose nodes are numbered such that the indices occur in increasing order, when the cycle is paced out. To evaluate the stab ility restrictions on G, we will below apply the stability condition Eq. (12)successively to different sectors ofG. We start with q/equalmath1,S/equalmath{1}, and expand Sin each step by one node q/plusmath1, thereby incrementally increasing the length of the considered sector. The rst element in the sequence of restrictions stipulates that 1,S/equalmath1/equalmathJN1/plusmathJ12>0, which implies that two neighboring links cannot both have negative sign. To derive further constraints on the maximum number and possible positions of neg ative links, we will below assume that JN1is negative. Note that this done without loss of generality as the numbering of the nodes is arbitrary. The second element in the sequence stipulates that 2,S/equalmath{1,2}/equalmathJN1/parenleftmathJ12/plusmathJ23/parenrightmath/plusmathJ12J23> 0, which modies the upper bound on the absolute value of the negative lin k as per JN1< J 12J23//parenleftmathJ12/plusmathJ23/parenrightmath. Let us next ask, if there can be further negative links in the chainJN1J12J23. As seen before, JN1,J12<0is excluded by the 1,S/equalmath1criterion; To see thatJN1,J23<0, too, violates stability, consider that condition 2,S/equalmath{1,2}can be rewritten as /parenleftmathJN1/plusmathJ23/parenrightmath</parenleftmathJN1/parenrightmath/parenleftmathJ23/parenrightmath/J12. Due to the 1,S/equalmath2criterionJ23<J12, such that the right hand side of the inequality is bounded above by JN1. It follows that /parenleftmathJN1/plusmathJ23/parenrightmath<JN1, which excludes JN1,J23<0. Hence, no two links in Gthat are separated by one link can simultaneously have negative sign. Along to the sketched line, we can iteratively calculate the whole sequ ence of restrictions. The maximum qthat has to be considered is N1, which results from Grepresenting a Jacobian, whose rank is decient due to the zero row sum condition. E very element q,S of the sequence 1,S,...,N1,Sprohibits the existence of a second negative link and modies the upper bound on JN1as per JN1<J12\u00b7...\u00b7Jqq/plusmath1/summationtextall distinct products of /parenleftmathq1/parenrightmathfactorsJij,i,j/braceleftbigSq/plusmath1/bracerightbig. (13) The right hand side of Eq. (13)is monotonously decreasing with increasing q. We can thus conclude that Gcan have at most one link, whose absolute value is bounded above by <J12\u00b7...\u00b7JN1N/summationtextall distinct products of /parenleftmathN2/parenrightmathfactorsJij,i,j{1,...,N}. (14) IfGconsists of two cycles sharing one node, all connected sectors q,Sthat do not contain the branching node can be treated in perfect analogy to the above discussed case of an isolated cycle. More precisely, if AandBare sets of node indices, which can uniquely be associated to one of the two cycles, and if further l/parenleftmathX/parenrightmathis the number of elements in set X/equalmathA,B , then allq,Swithql/parenleftmathX/parenrightmathandSXare positive, if both 243.3Topological stability conditions cycles have at most one negative link, whose absolute value is restrict ed by Eq. (14) evaluated at N/equalmathl/parenleftmathX/parenrightmath. Moreover, all q,Swithl/parenleftmathX/parenrightmath< ql/parenleftmathA/parenrightmath/plusmathl/parenleftmathB/parenrightmath factorized in those q,Swithql/parenleftmathX/parenrightmathand SX, and thus do not yield further restrictions. IfGconsists of two cycles sharing a number of links, the proceeding as we ll as the naming conventions can be adopted from the case of two cycles sharin g one node. Hence, allq,Swithql/parenleftmathX/parenrightmathandSXare positive, if every unbranched sector, A,B, and C, has at most one negative link, whose absolute value satises Eq. (14). Like above, Ccan be factorized in the q,Swithql/parenleftmathX/parenrightmathandSX, and thus yield no further restrictions. Note, though, that due to the presence of two bran ching points, which do not belong to any of the sets X, the highest qthat can be addressed in this way l/parenleftmathA/parenrightmath/plusmathl/parenleftmathB/parenrightmath/plusmathl/parenleftmathC/parenrightmath /equalmathN2, whereNdenotes the number of nodes in G. As the rank of the Jacobian associated to GequalsN1, we have to address one additional criterion. It can be written as N1,S/equalmathl/parenleftmathA/parenrightmath,Al/parenleftmathB/parenrightmath,BC/plusmathl/parenleftmathC/parenrightmath,Cl/parenleftmathB/parenrightmath,BA/plusmathl/parenleftmathA/parenrightmath,Al/parenleftmathC/parenrightmath,CB>0 where,Xdenotes the product of all links in sector X. If all three sectors have one negative link, whose strength does not exceed the respective upp er bounds, all l/parenleftmathX/parenrightmath,X> 0, but allX<0. Thus, the condition N1,S>0restricts the total number of possible negative links to maximally two. Note that the presented analysis can readily be generalized to cases , where cyclic struc- tures of the discussed types do not appear isolated, but are conn ected by treelike struc- tures, and thus constitute subgraphs of a more general graph G. In this case, the restric- tions concerning the maximum number and location of negative links remain u nchanged, while the restriction Eq. (14)on the absolute value of possible negative links is affected by the weight of links from adjacent treelike subgraphs. Box 2: Stability restrictions on cyclic graphs G: Calculations The results from the examples considered so far can be summari zed by saying that stability of the synchronized state requires the existence of a spanning tree in which every link corresponds to a positive element of the Jacobian . We conjecture that this result holds also in the general case, so that stability in an y network requires that the graph Gmust have a spanning tree of positive links, i.e., if all negati ve links are removed from G, the remaining graph must still be connected. In order to check the conjecture stated above numerically, w e generated ensembles 253Topological stability criteria for synchronized states 0.0005 0.0010 0.0015 0.0020 0.0025 0.0030 0.0035 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 fraction of unstable samples Figure 6: Numerical test of the hypothesized stability condition.

In each graph, we assigned a negative weight to all butN1 randomly chosen links. The re- maining links were assigned weight 1. We then checked for eac h graph, whether the graph had a positive spanning tree and calculated the larges t non-trivial eigenvalue of the corresponding Jacobian. The procedure was repeated fo r different values of. Among the 109generated test graphs, more than 98% did not contain a positive spanning tree. Of these networks, none were found to be stabl e, which corroborates the conjecture. Among the approximately 107graphs that did contain a positive spanning tree, stability depended on the specic topology a nd the value of (cf. Fig. 6). As expected from Box 2, the fraction of networks that are unstable although they obey the necessary condition increases with increasin g. Applied to the Kuramoto model dened in Eq. ( 4), the topological stability crite- rion reveals common properties of the conguration of all po ssible phase-locked systems. In a phase-locked state, Jij/equalmathAijcos/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath, wherexjxiis the stationary phase difference between oscillator jandi. Given that all link weights Aij0, sta- bility of the phase-locked state requires that the coupling network has a spanning tree of oscillators obeying |xjxi|</ 2. In case the spanning tree is disconnected by a negative link w ith|xjxi|>/ 2, the topological stability criterion indicates two interve ntions that may resolve the instability of the phase-locked state. Consider that the st ationary phase difference 263.4Other applications between the oscillators kne}ationslash/equalmathi,jAiksin/parenleftmathxkxi/parenrightmath/parenrightbig , (15) where/equalmath1/N/summationtextN i/equalmath1i. The absolute value of the left hand side decreases with decreasing argument of the arcsin-function. For achieving |xjxi|< / 2, we can therefore either increase the coupling Aijor shift the intrinsic frequencies i, j toward the mean frequency . 3.4Other applications Although we have so far focused on the Kuramoto model as an examp le, the topo- logical interpretation of the JSC only requires a hermitian Jacobian. Further, the simplication leading up to the spanning tree criterion is p ossible whenever the Jacobian has zero row sums. This condition is satised for ins tance by all systems of the form xi/equalmathCi/plusmath/summationdisplay jne}ationslash/equalmathiAij\u00b7Oij/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath,i1...N (16) where the Aijare the weights of a symmetric interaction network and the Oijodd functions. We emphasize that the approach remains applicab le in heterogeneous networks containing different link strengths Aij, coupling functions Oijor intrinsic parameters Ci. The class of systems, to which the present results are directl y applicable, thus includes general networks of phase oscillators as well as ot her models such as continuous-time variants of the Deffuant model of opinion f ormation [ 94]. In the context of this model, the xidenote opinions held by a networked community of agents. The criteria derived here then constrain the distrib ution of opinions that can be sustained in stationarity. Although the specic criteria derived above are contingent o n the zero-row sum condition, it can be expected that the general approach prop osed here is also appli- cable to situations where this condition is violated, such a s in the model of coopera- tion among interacting agents studied in [ 87]. A simple extension of Eq. ( 16), which violates the zero row sum condition, is found by replacing Ciby a function of xi. Such an extension can account for the dynamical retuning of t he intrinsic frequency, e.g., for modeling homeostatic feedback in neural networks. F or illustrating the ap- plication of the proposed method to models, in which the zero row sum condition 273Topological stability criteria for synchronized states is violated in some rows, we consider another model inspired by neuroscience in the subsequent section. Before we address our nal example, let us emphasize that the graphical notation proposed here may also be useful for problems not concerning stability analysis. For instance, it allows exploring the isospectrality of her mitian or symmetric ma- trices [ 95,96], which differ with respect to the signs of some off-diagona l entries: The characteristic polynomial of a hermitian matrix ACn\u00d7ncan be expressed as /parenleftmath/parenrightmath /equalmathDn/parenleftmathAI/parenrightmath. Considering the structure of the graph Gassociated to AI, allows to determine which symbols contribute to . On this basis, we can then address the isospectrality of matrices that are generated f rom Aby a mapping R:Aij Aij, Aji Aji, which changes the sign of an arbitrary number of off- diagonal entries while preserving hermiticity. A map Rthat leaves all symbols in Dn/parenleftmathAI/parenrightmathinvariant leaves the characteristic polynomial and thus th e spectrum invariant. That is, we may evaluate the global impact of an ope rationRby only regarding its effect on the mesoscale structures, to which i t directly contributes. As an example, consider a hermitian matrix AI, whose corresponding graph G is a tree. The only symbols that contribute to the characteris tic polynomial are the symbols \u00d7and|. Symbols \u00d7correspond to factors /parenleftmathAii/parenrightmathin, symbols |to factorsAijAji/equalmath|Aij|2. Both are invariant under R. Hence, the spectrum of matrices A, whose corresponding graphs Gis a tree, is invariant under any operation that changes the sign of a pair of off-diagonal entries. Along the same line, we can infer isospectrality relations fo r matrices A, whose corresponding graphs Gare composed only of tree-like subgraphs and isolated cy- cles. For such matrices, the spectrum is invariant under her miticity preserving sign changes of 1. an arbitrary number of off-diagonal entries that do not bel ong to cyclic sub- graphs of G. 2. an even number of off-diagonal entries that belong to the sa me cyclic subgraph ofG. 3.5Adaptive Kuramoto model We now apply the proposed approach to an example, in which the topology of the interaction network coevolves with the dynamics of the osci llators [ 7,17,23]. In the context of the Kuramoto model, adaptive coupling has rece ntly attracted keen interest as it allowed to show that the appearance of synchro nous motion can be 283.5Adaptive Kuramoto model intimately related to a selection mechanism of specic netw ork topologies [ 97], and to the identication of complex hierarchical structures in the graph connectivity [23,98]. We consider a system of Nphase oscillators that evolve according to Eq. ( 4), while the coupling strength Aijevolves according to d dtAij/equalmathcos/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmathb\u00b7Aij. (17) The rst term in Eq. ( 17) states that the more similar the phases of two nodes the stronger reinforced is their connection, the second term gu arantees convergence. In a stationary, phase-locked state state, Aij/equalmathcos/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath/band all oscillators oscillate with a common frequency /equalmath1 N/summationtext ii. The stability of this state is governed by a symmetric Jacobian J/equalmath b0 have chosen N/equalmath3 for illustration. The marked partitioning separates two bl ocks on the diago- nal. The upper one is a diagonal submatrix of size L\u00d7L,L:/equalmathN/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmath/2, the lower one is aN\u00d7Nsymmetric submatrix with zero row sum, which we denote as j. Let us start our analysis by focusing on the upper left block o fJ. In the chosen ordering of variables the rst LminorsDqsatisfy the stability condition Eq. ( 5) iff b > 0. Concerning the minors of order q > L , the following conventions prove advantageous: We dene DL/plusmathn,Sas the determinant of the submatrix of J, which is spanned by all variables Aijand thenvariablesxsi. Further,D0/plusmathn,Sdenotes the determinant of the submatrix of j, which is solely spanned by the nvariablesxsi. We nd that DL/plusmathn,S/equalmath /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathLbLn\u00b7F/parenleftmathD0/plusmathn,S/parenrightmath, (19) whereFis the linear mapping F:oijcos/parenleftmath2/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath/parenrightmath. As the submatrix jis sym- metric and has a zero row sum, its minors, D0/plusmathn,S, can be rewritten using Eq.

As the necessary stability condition b>0 impliesbLn>0, it follows that in a stable system F/parenleftmathn,S/parenrightmath>0,S,n/equalmath1...r. (21) Comparison with Eq. 12reveals that a necessary condition for stability is that the graphF/parenleftmathG/parenrightmathhas a positive spanning tree. Revisiting the denitions of t he linear mapFand the graph G, we nd that the weight of a link ijofF/parenleftmathG/parenrightmathis given by cos/parenleftmath2/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath/parenrightmath. Hence,F/parenleftmathG/parenrightmathhas a positive spanning tree iff the adaptive coupling network has a spanning tree of oscillators obeying |xjxi|</ 4. The restriction on the stationary phase-differences in a stable, phase-locke d state are thus more strict in the adaptive than in the non-adaptive case. 3.6Discussion In the present chapter, we analyzed necessary conditions fo r local asymptotic stabil- ity of stationary and phase-locked states in networks of pha se oscillators. Using a graphical interpretation of Jacobi's signature criterion w e rst formulated conditions for the stability of small subgraphs. Piecing the results to gether, we formulated a conjecture stating that stability requires the existence o f a spanning tree, in which every link corresponds to a positive element of the Jacobian matrix. Our results provide an analytical angle that is complementa ry to statistical analysis of network synchronizability. Where statistical approach es reveal global features impinging on the propensity to synchronize, our approach ca n pinpoint specic de- fects precluding synchronization. We note that such defect s can occur on all scales, corresponding to the violation of the signature criterion i n subgraphs of different size. This highlights synchronization of phase oscillators as a simple example, in which instabilities can arise from local, global or mesosca le structures. Testing the conditions identied here in real-world system s requires information on the stationary phase prole. This limits the applicabilit y of our approach for synchronizing systems that do not synchronize naturally. H owever, we note that even in such systems it may be possible to stabilize an existi ng unstable phase- locked state, e.g. by delayed-feedback control [ 99]. Based on the observed phase prole in the stabilized state, one can then use the identie d conditions to search for structures that preclude synchronization when the cont roller is turned off. A more direct application of the present results is possible i n networks with designed phase proles [ 100]. Given a coupling topology and a desired phase prole, it is 303.6Discussion often relatively easy to nd a set of natural frequencies for which the phase pro- le is stationary but not necessarily stable. Here, the nece ssary stability conditions provide constrains on the stable proles that may be realize d in a given coupling topology. Further, we note that the proposed criteria can be applied even with- out knowing the underlying dynamical equations if the Jacob ian is accessible, for instance from data analysis [ 101] or generalized modeling [ 102]. The present results demonstrate the applicability of Jacobi 's signature criterion to large networks. In principle, the criterion can be applied t o all systems in which the Jacobian is a hermitian matrix. In the present chapter, we ad ditionally assumed that the Jacobian has zero row sums. An example of the application o f Jacobi's signature criterion in a large system, in which the zero row sum conditi on is violated, is presented in the next chapter. 314Patterns of cooperation As the last, also the present chapter revolves around the inte rplay of structure and dynamics in a complex, self-organizing system. In this chap ter, however, the system under consideration is a social system. Social structure and social dynamics are commonly studied u sing the example of cooperation networks. Cooperation builds the basis for man y institutions that shape our lives on different scales [ 103,104]: Thus, humans cooperate in communities, companies, ethnies and nations [ 105-107]. Thereby, the collaborative behavior of the individuals is strongly influenced by the embedding socia l structure, while the social structure itself evolves in response to the individu als' collaborative behavior [108]. The adaptive interplay is implicated in a variety of emerge nt phenomena [ 109, 110]. In this chapter, we investigate its role for the emergence of social coordination, diversication, and for the rise of leaders that hold distin guished social positions. The interplay between collaborative behavior and social str ucture has rst been ex- plored in evolutionary game theory [ 111]. The intense research in this eld has iden- tied several mechanism allowing for the evolution and pers istence of cooperation despite the often high costs incurred by an cooperating agen t [112]. In particular, the emergence of cooperation is promoted if the interacting agents are distributed in some (potentially abstract) space, so that only certain a gents can interact at any given time [ 113-115]. In the context of social cooperation, spatial structure c an be appropriately modeled by a complex network, in which nodes r epresent agents, while the links correspond to collaborations. The topology o f this network has been shown to be of central importance for the level of cooperatio n that evolves [ 116-119]. In social networks, the topology is not static, but reacts to the behaviour of the agents [ 120-125]. Adaptive network models, which account for the dynamical i n- terplay, have been studied for some time in the social litera ture (e.g. [ 125-127]), while pioneering work [ 128,129] only recently triggered a wave of detailed dynam- ical investigations in physics [ 130]. Recent publications discuss simple cooperative games such as the one-shot prisoner's dilemma [ 131-141], the iterated prisoner's 334Patterns of cooperation dilemma [ 142,143], and the snowdrift game [ 144-146] on adaptive networks. They showed numerically and analytically that a signicantly in creased level of coopera- tion can be achieved if individuals are able rewire their lin ks [131-136,146-148], if links are formed and broken [ 137,138,144,145,147,149], or if new agents are added to the network [ 140,141]. Moreover, it has been shown that the adaptive interplay between the agents' strategies and the network topology can lead to the emergence of distinguished agents from an initially homogeneous popu lation [ 129,131-133]. While important progress has been made in the investigation of games on adaptive networks, it is mostly limited to discrete networks, in whic h the agents can only assume a small number of different states, say, uncondition al cooperation with all neighbors or unconditional defection. Most current models therefore neglect the ability of intelligent agents to maintain different levels of cooperation with different self-chosen partners [ 150]. In this chapter, we analyze a weighted and directed adaptive network model, in which agents continuously and selectively reinforce advan tageous collaborations. After a brief description of the model, we show in Sec. 4.3that the network gener- ally approaches a state in which all agents make the same tota l cooperative invest- ment and every reciprocated investment yields the same bene t. Despite the emer- gence of this high degree of coordination, the evolved netwo rks are far from ho- mogeneous. Typically, the agents distribute their total in vestment heterogeneously among their collaborations, and each collaborations recei ves different investments from the partners. In Sec. 4.5, we show that this heterogeneity enables resource fluxes across the network, which allow agents holding disting uished topological positions to extract high payoffs. Thereafter, in Sec. 4.6, we investigate further topo- logical properties of the evolved networks and identify the transition in which large cooperating components are formed. In Sec. 4.7, we then focus on the appearance of unidirectional (unreciprocated) investments. Specical ly, we identify three distinct scenarios in which unidirectional collaborations can aris e and discuss their implica- tions for the interaction topology. Finally, in Sec. 4.8, we discuss a possible extension of the model which accounts for a player's success feeding bac k on his cooperative investment Our conclusions are summarized in Sec. 4.9. 4.1The Model We consider a population of Nagents, representing for instance people, rms or na- tions, engaged in bilateral collaborative interactions. E ach interaction is described by a continuous snowdrift game [ 104], one of the fundamental models of game the- 344.1The Model ory. In this game, an agent ican invest an amount of time/money/effort eijR/plusmath 0 into the collaboration with another agent j. Cooperative investments accrue equal benetsBto both partners, but create a cost Cfor the investing agent. Assuming that investments from both agents contribute additively to the creation of the ben- et, the payoff received by agent ifrom an interaction with an agent jcan then be written as Pij/equalmathB/parenleftbigeij/plusmatheji/parenrightbigC/parenleftbigeij/parenrightbig. (22) The game thus describes the generic situation, in which agent s invest their personal resources to create a common good shared with the partner. As an example of the snowdrift game, the reader may think of a sc ientic collabora- tion where two researchers invest their personal time in a pr oject, while the benet of the publication is shared between them. This example makes clear that the benet of the collaboration must saturate when an extensive amount of effort is invested, whereas the costs faced by an agent, measured for instance in terms of personal well-being, clearly grows superlinearly once the personal investment exceeds some hours per day. In the following, we do not restrict the cost- and the benet- functions, BandC, to specic functional forms, except in the numerical invest igations. However, we assume that both are differentiable and, moreover, that Bis sigmoidal and Cis su- perlinear (cf. Fig. 9). These assumptions capture basic features of real-world sy stems such as inefciency of small investments, saturation of ben ets at high investments, as well as additional costs incurred by overexertion of pers onal resources and are widely used in the sociological and economic literature [ 151,152]. To account for multiple collaborations per agent, we assume that the benets re- ceived from collaborations add linearly, whereas the costs are a function of the sum of investments made by an agent, such that the total payoff re ceived by an agent i is given by Pi/equalmath/summationdisplay jne}ationslash/equalmathiB/parenleftbigij/parenrightbigC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath. (23) wherei:/equalmath/summationtextN j/equalmath1eijdenotes the total investment of the agent iwhileij:/equalmatheij/plusmatheji denotes the total investment made in the collaboration ij. This is motivated by considering that benets from different collaborations, s ay different publications, are often obtained independently of each other, whereas the costs generated by different collaborations stress the same pool of personal r esources. Let us emphasize that we do not restrict the investment of an a gent further. While investments cannot be negative, no upper limit on the invest ments is imposed. Fur- 354Patterns of cooperation thermore, the agents are free to make different investments in collaborations with different partners. Thus, to optimize its payoff, an agent ca n reallocate investments among its potential partners as well as change the total amou nt of resources in- vested. For specifying the dynamics of the network, we assume the age nts to be selsh, trying to increase their total payoff Piby a downhill-gradient optimization d dteij/equalmath eijPi. (24) Every agent can cooperate with every other agent. Thus, the ne twork of potential collaborations is fully connected and the deterministic ti me-evolution of the model system is given by a system of N/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmathordinary differential equations of the form of Eq. 24. The network dynamics, considered in the following, is there fore only the shifting of link weights eij. Note, however, that already the weight dynamics constitutes a topological change. As will be shown in the foll owing, the agents typ- ically reduce their investment in the majority of potential collaborations to zero, so that a sparse and sometimes disconnected network of non-van ishing collaborations is formed. Therefore the terminology of graph theory is usefu l for characterizing the state that the system approaches. Below, we use the term link to denote only those collaborations that receive a non-vanishing investm entij. A link is said to be bidirectional if non-vanishing investments are contributed by both conne cted agents, while it is said to be unidirectional if one agent makes a non-vanishing investment without reciprocation by the partner. Likewise, we use the t erm neighbors to denote those agents that are connected to a focal agent by non-vanis hing collaborations and the term the of non-vanishing collaborations, in wh ich a focal agent participates. 4.2Numerical investigation In the following, the properties of the model are investigat ed mostly by analytical computations that do not require further specications. On ly for the purpose of verication and illustration we resort to numerical integr ation of the ODE system. For these we use the functions B/parenleftbigij/parenrightbig/equalmath2/radicalig /plusmath2/plusmath2/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath /radicalig /plusmath/parenleftbigij/parenrightbig2, C/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath/equalmath\u00b5/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath2. 364.3Coordination of investments Figure 7: Network of collaborations in the nal state. The nodes represent agents, links correspond to collaborations receiving non-vanishing in- vestments ij. The small dash on every link ij is a fairness indicator: the further it is shifted toward one agent i, the lower the fraction, eij/ij, of the investment agent icontributes to the link. Agents extracting more payoff are shown in darker colour and are placed toward the center of the community. The size of a dot indicates the agent's total invest- menti. In the nal conguration, the net- work exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity. Nevertheless, all agents make the same total investment and all collaborations receive the same total investment. (Parameters: /equalmath0.65, /equalmath0.1,\u00b5/equalmath1.5) For studying the time-evolution of exemplary model realiza tions by numerical in- tegration, all variables eijare assigned random initial values drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution with expectation value 1 and st andard deviation 1014, constituting a homogeneous state plus small fluctuations. The system of differen- tial equations is then integrated using Euler's method with v ariable step size h. In every timestep, his chosen such that no variable is reduced by more than half of its value in the step. If in a given timestep a variable eijfalls below a threshold << 1 and the corresponding time derivative is negative, then d eij/dt is set to zero for one step to avoid very small time steps. We emphasize that introd ucing the threshold is done purely to speed up numerical integration and does not affect the results or their interpretation. In particular, we conrmed numeri cally that, the exact value ofdoes not influence the nal conguration that is approached. I n all numerical results shown below, /equalmath105was used. 4.3Coordination of investments The numerical exploration of the system reveals frustrated, glass-like behavior; starting from a homogeneous conguration as described abov e, it approaches ei- ther one of a large number of different nal congurations, w hich are local maxima of the total payoff. 374Patterns of cooperation ba Figure 8: Time evolution of example networks from a homogeneous stat e. The different frames show snapshots of the network of collaborations at di fferent times. a) In small systems the network sometimes self-organizes to homo geneous topologies in which all players extract the same payoff. b) If a player (ar row) tries to main- tain too many links at too low investment, his partners will c ease reciprocating investments, leading sometimes to unidirectional links. A representative example of an evolved network, and snapsho ts from the time- evolution of two smaller example networks are shown in Figs. 7,8, respectively. In the example networks only those links are shown that receive a non-vanishing (i.e. above-threshold) investment. Most of these non-vanishing links are bidirectional , receiving investments from both of the agents they connect. Only rarely, unidirec- tional links appear, which are maintained by one agent without reci procation by the partner. For further investigations, it is useful to dene a bidirectionally connected component (BCC) as a set of agents and the bidirectional links connecti ng them, such that, starting from one agent in the set, every other agent in the se t can be reached by following a sequence of bidirectional links. In the numeric al investigations, we observe that all bidirectional links within a BCC receive th e same total investment in the nal state. However, the investment ijmade in every given link is in general not split equally among the two connected agents. Furthermo re, all agents within a BCC make the same total cooperative investment iin the nal state. However, the investments eijof one agent in different collaborations are in general diff erent. The coordination of total investments ij,itherefore arises although no agent has 384.3Coordination of investments sufcient information to compute the total investment made by any other agent. We emphasize that the level of investments, which the agents ap proach is not set rigidly by external constraints, but instead depends on the topolog y of the network of collaborations that is formed dynamically. This is evident f or instance in differences of up to 20% between the level of investment that is reached in differen t BCCs of the same network. To understand how coordination of investment arises, we now formalize the obser- vations made above. We claim that in our model in the nal stat e the following holds: Within a BCC (i) every agent makes the same total inves tment, and (ii) ei- ther all bidirectional links receive the same total investm ent or there are exactly two different levels of total investment received by bidirecti onal links. For reasons de- scribed below, the case of two different levels of total inve stment per link is only very rarely encountered. In this case, every agent can have a t most one bidirectional link that is maintained at the lower level of investment. We rst focus on property (i). This property is a direct conseq uence of the station- arity of the nal state. Consider a single link ij. Since both investments, eijandeji, enter symmetrically into ij, the derivative of the benet with respect to either in- vestment is B/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath/eij/equalmathB/parenleftmathji/parenrightmath/eji/equalmath:B/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath. Thus, ifeij,eji>0, the stationarity conditions (25) Equation ( 25) impliesC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath /equalmathC/parenleftmathj/parenrightmath. As we assumed Cto be superlinear, Cis injective and it follows that i/equalmathj/equalmath:, such that iandj, are at a point of identical total investment. Iterating this argument along a sequence of bidirectional links yields (i). Let us remark that the stationarity of vanishing investment s may be xed due to the external constraint that investments have to remain non-ne gative. The stationarity condition for vanishing and uni-directional links, analog ous to Eq. ( 25), is therefore eijC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmathB/parenleftbigij/parenrightbig ejiC/parenleftbigj/parenrightbig. (26) Because of the inequalities that appear in this equation, th e argument given above does not restrict the levels of total investment found in dif ferent components. For similar reasons agents that are only connected by unidirect ional links can sustain different levels of investment, which is discussed in Sec. 4.7. 394Patterns of cooperation 1 221 12 23 32 1212 21 32 Player1 Figure 9: are the perceived cost fun ctionsCand benet functionsB(insets) for the example of an agent 1of degree one interacting with an agent 2of degree two (sketched). The function Bdepends on the sum of both agents' investments into the interaction while Cdepends on the sum of all investments of one agent. In every equilibrium (SE or UE) stat ionarity demands that the slope of these functions is identical. This require s that the agents make identical total investments. In stable equilibria (SE), the operating point lies in general above the inflection point (IP) of B, whereas equilibria found below the IP are in general unstable (UE). Therefore, in a stable equilib rium both links produce the same benet and both agents make the same total investmen t. We note that, although the network of potential interaction s is fully connected, no information is transfered along vanishing links. Therefore , the equation of motion, Eq.24, should be considered as a local update rule, in the sense tha t it only depends on the state of the focal agent and on investments received fr om a small number of direct neighbors. In order to understand property (ii), we consider multiple l inks connecting to a single agent i. In an equilibrium, the investment into each of the links has to be such that the slope of the benet function of each link is iden tical. Otherwise, the payoff could be increased by shifting investments from one l ink to the other. Since the benet function is sigmoidal, a given slope can be found i n at most two points along the curve: one above and one below the inflection point (I P). By iteration, this implies that if a stationary level of investment is obse rved in one link, then the investment of all other links of the same BCC is restricted to one of two values, which amounts to the rst sentence of (ii). For understandin g why the case of 404.4Stability conditions two different levels of investments is rarely encountered, the stability of steady states has to be taken into account. A local stability analys is, based on linearisation and subsequent application of Jacobi's signature criterion , is the subject of the next section. 4.4Stability conditions To determine the local asymptotic stability of the steady st ates, we study the Jaco- bian matrix JRN/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmath\u00d7N/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmathdened by J/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath/parenleftmathkl/parenrightmath/equalmatheij/ekl. The terms contained in this matrix can be grouped into three different types Aij:/equalmatheij eijC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath (29) albeit evaluated at different points. For reasons of symmet ry variables according to the mapping M:N\u00d7NN;/parenleftmathi,j/parenrightmathN/parenleftmathi1/parenrightmath/plusmathjthe Jacobian can be written in the form J/equalmath A12K1P12 0 0 0 K1A13 0 0 P13 0A21K2 0 0 0 0 K2A23 0 0 A31K3 0 0 0 P23K3A32 , (30) which is shown here for N/equalmath3. As each cooperation ijis determined by a pair of variables/parenleftbigeij,eji/parenrightbig, eachPijoccurs twice forming quadratic subunits with the corre- sponding AijandAji. Subsequently, we restrict ourselves to the submatrix JsofJ, which only captures variables eijbelonging to 'non-vanishing' links. As 414Patterns of cooperation argued before, 'vanishing links', i.e. links with ij/equalmath0, are subject to stationarity condition ( 26). IfC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath> B/parenleftmath0/parenrightmath, their stability is due to the boundary condition eij0 and is independent of the second derivatives of CandB. Hence, they can be omitted from the subsequent analysis. This means in particul ar that the spectra of different topological components of the network decouple a nd can thus be treated independently. The Jacobian Jsis symmetric and can hence be analyzed by means of Jacobi's sig na- ture criterion [ 154] introduced in Chapter 3. Thus, the system is stable if all minors DqofJssatisfy sgn/parenleftbigDq/parenrightbig/equalmath /parenleftmath1/parenrightmathqforq/equalmath1,...,N/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmath. In chapter 3, we countered the high number of algebraic stability conditions by summar izing them in few ef- fective topological conditions. Unfortunately, the result s cannot readily be applied to the system considered here, as the Jacobian Jsdoes not obey a zero-row sum con- dition. However, we show below that evaluating the conditio ns for different minors of orderq/equalmath1,2 already sufces to understand property (ii). By means of an even number of column and row interchanges the a bove stated form ofJscan always be transformed such that the rst 2 \u00d72 block reads /parenleftigg AijPij PijAji/parenrightigg . Since we assume that ijis a non-vanishing link, and, hence, iandjto be in the same component, both agents make the same total investment . It follows from denition ( 29) thatKi/equalmathKj/equalmath:Kand therewith that Thus, the sequence if D1/equalmathPij/plusmathK< 0 (31) D2/equalmath/parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbigK> 0. (32) Equation ( 32) stipulates that Kand/parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbighave the same sign. Of the two possible scenarios /parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbig,K< 0 and/parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbig,K> 0 ( 33) the second is ruled out by Eq. ( 31): IfK> 0, it follows from Eq. ( 31) thatPij<K< 0, which contradicts/parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbig>0. Hence, the necessary conditions for stability, Eqs. ( 31), (32), require K< 0/parenleftbig2Pij/plusmathK/parenrightbig<0. (34) If either agent ior agentjhas another bilateral link, say ik, it is furthermore possible to transform Jsby an even number of row and line interchanges such that the r st 424.4Stability conditions 2\u00d72 block reads /parenleftigg AijK K Aik/parenrightigg . (35) In this representation the sequence 1 ,D1,D2alternates if D1/equalmathAij/equalmathPij/plusmathK< 0 ( 36) D2/equalmathPikPij/plusmath/parenleftbigPik/plusmathPij/parenrightbigK> 0. (37) Condition ( 37) can then be written as PikPij>K/parenleftbigPik/plusmathPij/parenrightbig. (38) Inserting the denitions Eqs.( 27)-(29) in Eqs. ( 34) and ( 38) reveals that for a pair of agentsijconnected by a bidirectional link, stability requires C/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath>02B/parenleftmathij/parenrightmathC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath<0, (39) and every pair of links ijandikconnecting to the same agent ihas to satisfy B/parenleftmathik/parenrightmathB/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath>C/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright >0/parenleftbigB/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath/plusmathB/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath/parenrightbig. (40) Note that Eq. ( 39) implies 2 B/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath<C/parenleftmathi/parenrightmath>0, but does not stipulate the sign of B/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath. As Eq. ( 39) pertains also to the link ik, the same holds for B/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath. We therefore have to consider three different cases when testi ng the compatibility above the andB/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath>0, (both investments below the IP) c)B/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath>0 andB/parenleftmathij/parenrightmath<0 (one investment above and one below the IP). In case a), Eq. ( 40) is trivially fullled as the left hand side has positive and the right hand side negative sign. In case b), Eq. ( 40) and Eq. ( 39) are incompatible: estimating the lower bound of the right hand side of ( 40) using the relation C/parenleftmath/parenrightmath> 434Patterns of cooperation This shows that in a stable stationary state, every agent can a t most have one link receiving investments below the IP . In case c), Eq. ( 40) can in principle be satised. However, the equation still imposes a rather strong restric tion on a positive B/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath requiring high curvature of the benet function close to sat uration. The restriction becomes stronger, when the degree of agent iincreases. This can be shown by taking determinants Dqwithq>2 into account. Bilateral links with investments below the IP can be exclude d entirely, if the bene- t function approaches saturation softly, so that the curva ture above the inflection point remains lower or equal than the maximum curvature belo w the inflection point. For such functions, every pair ik<ijof solutions to the stationarity condi- tionB/parenleftbigij/parenrightbig/equalmathB/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath/equalmathC/parenleftmathi/parenrightmathyields a pair of coefcients B/parenleftmathik/parenrightmath>0, B/parenleftbigij/parenrightbig<0 violating ( 40). In this case, only congurations in which all links receiv e invest- ments above the IP can be stable and hence all links produce th e same benet in the stable stationary states. This explains why the case of tw o different levels of co- operation is generally not observed in numerical investiga tions if realistic cost and benet functions are used. For understanding the central role of the IP for stability, c onsider that in the IP the slope ofBis maximal. Therefore, links close to the IP make attractive t argets for investments. If the total investment into one link is below t he IP , a disturbance that raises (lowers) the investment increases (decreases) the slope, thus making the link more (less) attractive for investments. Hence, below t he IP , a withdrawal of resources by one of the partners, no matter how slight, will m ake the collabora- tion less attractive, causing a withdrawal by the other part ner and thereby launch- ing the interaction into a downward spiral. Conversely, for links above the IP the gradual withdrawal of resources by one partner increases th e attractiveness of the collaboration and is therefore compensated by increased in vestment from the other partner. In psychology both responses to withdrawal from a r elationship are well known [ 153]. The proposed model can therefore provide a rational for the ir obser- vation that does not require explicit reference to long term memory, planning, or irrational emotional attachment. For our further analysis, property (ii) is useful as it impli es that, although our model is in essence a dynamical system, the BCCs found in the steady states of this sys- tem can be analyzed with the tools of graph theory for undirec ted graphs. In the Secs. 4.5,4.6we go one step further and treat not only the BCC but the whole network as an undirected graph. We thereby ignore the differ ences between di- rected and undirected links in order to study properties suc h as the degree- and component-size distributions before we continue in Sec. 4.7with a more detailed 444.5Distinguished topological positions kpk 10 15 20 250 0.1 0.2 0.3Figure 10: Degree heterogeneity in self-organized networks of collaborations.

Results are averaged over 100networks of size N/equalmath100. investigation of directed links and their topological impl ications. 4.5Distinguished topological positions Despite the coordination described above, the payoff extra cted by agents in the nal state can differ signicantly. This is remarkable because th e agents follow identical rules and the network of collaborations is initially almost homogeneous with respect to degree, link weights, and neighborhood. Because all bidirectional links in a BCC produce the same ben et, the total benet an agent receives is proportional to the degree of the agent. By contrast, the cost incurred by an agent does not scale with the degree, but is ide ntical for all agents in the BCC, because agents of high degree invest a proportion ally smaller amount into their collaborations. Topological positions of high d egree thus allow agents to extract signicantly higher benets without requiring mor e investment. The payoff distribution in the population is governed by the d egree distribution pk describing the relative frequency of agents with degree k. Figure 10shows a rep- resentative degree distribution of an evolved networks in t he nal state. While the nite width of the distribution indicates heterogeneity, t he distribution is narrower, and therefore fairer, than that of an Erd os-R\u00e9nyi random gr aph, which constitutes a null-model for randomly assembled network topologies. We v eried that the vari- ance of the evolved network is below the variance of a random g raph for the whole range of admissible mean degree \u00afkin a network of given size. Although the snowdrift game is not a zero-sum game, payoffs ca nnot be generated arbitrarily. In order to sustain the extraction of high payo ffs by agents of high 454Patterns of cooperation degree, investments have to be redistributed across the net work. In the denition of our model, we did not include the transport of resources di rectly. Nevertheless, a redistribution of investments arises indirectly from the asymmetry of the agents' investments. This is illustrated in Fig. 11. Consider for instance an agent of degree 1. This agent necessarily focuses his entire investment on a si ngle collaboration. Therefore, the partner participating in this collaboration only needs to make a small investment to make the collaboration protable. He is thus f ree to invest a large portion of his total investment into links to other agents of possibly higher degree. In this way, investments flow toward the regions of high degree where high payoffs are extracted (cf. Fig. 11). 4.6Formation of large components To explore the topological properties of the networks of col laborations in the nal state further, we performed an extensive series of numerica l integrations runs, in which we varied all parameters in a wide range. These revealed that an important determinant of the topology is the mean degree \u00afk/equalmath2L/N , whereLdenotes the number of links and Nthe number of agents in the network. Given two evolved networks with similar \u00afk, one nds that the networks are also similar in other prop- erties such as the component-size distribution, clusterin g frac- tion of that are unidirectional. We therefo re discuss the topological properties of the evolved networks as a function of \u00afk, instead of the original model parameters. We rst consider the expected size an}bracketle{tsan}bracketri}htof a network component to which a randomly chosen agent belongs. In contrast to the BCCs discussed abov e, unidirectional col- laborations are now taken into account in the computation of component sizes. The value of an}bracketle{tsan}bracketri}htin the evolved network as a function of \u00afkis shown in Fig. 12a. The gure reveals that large components begin to appear slightl y below \u00afk/equalmath2. Because of the difculties related to integrating N/parenleftmathN1/parenrightmathdifferential equations, our numer- ical investigations are limited to networks of up to 100agents. While it is therefore debatable whether the observed behaviour qualies as a phas e transition, it can be Figure 11: Redistribution of investments. Even in small networks investments flow to- ward agents of high connectivity. This flow is apparent in the position of the fairness indicators on the links, cf.

In the giant component transition, a component is formed tha t scales linearly with network size. In the absence of higher correlations, the tra nsition occurs at \u00af q/equalmath1 [155], where \u00afqis the mean excess degree of the network, i.e., the number of ad- ditional links found connected to a agent that is reached by f ollowing a random link. In Erd os-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, \u00af q/equalmath\u00afk, therefore the giant component transition takes place at \u00afk/equalmath1. In the present model, the transition in an}bracketle{tsan}bracketri}htis shifted to higher values of \u00afkbecause of the nature of the underlying snowdrift game: The sn owdrift game favors cooperation in the sense that for an agent of degr ee zero it is always advantageous to initiate an interaction. Therefore \u00afk/equalmath1 is the lowest possible value that can be observed in evolved networks. Further, any evolv ed network with \u00afk/equalmath1 invariably consists of isolated pairs, which precludes the existence of a giant com- ponent. Finally, the relatively narrow degree distributio n of the evolved networks implies \u00afq<\u00afkand therefore \u00afk>1 at the transition. To estimate an upper limit for the connectivity at which the g iant component tran- sition occurs, it is useful to consider degree homogeneous n etworks. In these net- works, the degree distribution is a delta function and \u00af q/equalmath\u00afk1, so that the transition occurs at \u00afk/equalmath2. In the networks evolved in the proposed model, we can there fore expect a critical value of \u00afkbetween one and two. Based on numerical results, we estimate that the giant component transition in the present model occurs at \u00afk1.91 474Patterns of cooperation (Fig. 12). At this value, a power-law distribution of component sizes , which is a hallmark of the giant-component transition, begins to sho w already in relative small networks with N/equalmath100. 4.7Unreciprocated collaborative investments While in Sec. 4.3we have mainly considered bidirectional links, and in Sec. 4.5and 4.6only distinguished between vanishing and non-vanishing li nks, we will now focus on unidirectional links, which one partner maintains without reciprocation by the other. The presence of such links in collaboration netw orks was recently discussed in detail by [ 156]. For the discussion below, it is advantageous to consider the mean degree of agents in a connected component an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath2l/n, wherenandlare the number of agents and links in the component. Note that in large components an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht \u00afk, while the two properties can be signicantly different in small compo nents. In contrast to \u00afk, us to infer global properties: Componen ts withan}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2 are trees. Components with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath2 contain exactly one cycle, to which trees might be attached. And, components with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht>2 contain more than one cycle, potentially with trees attached. As in the previous section, the term comp onent refers to max- imal subgraphs which are connected by bidirectional and/or unidirectional links. According to this denition, a component may, beside one or mo re BCCs, contain agents, which only have unidirectional links. In the follow ing, we denote the set of these agents as the non-BCC part of the component (nBCC). For the sake of simplic- ity, we focus on components which contain only one BCC, but no te that the case of multiple BCCs can be treated analogously. Unlike the BCC, the nBCC is not a subcomponent but only a set of a gents which are not necessarily connected. Nevertheless, numerical re sults show that (i*) all nBCC agents make the same total investment nand (ii*) all unidirectional links maintained by nBCC agents receive the same total investment n. While property (ii*) can be understood analogously to property (ii) of BCCs , property (i*) cannot be ascribed to stationarity or stability conditions, but seem s to result from optimality restrictions. As a consequence of the properties (i*) and (ii *), the number of outgoing linksm:/equalmathn/nis identical for all agents in the nBCC. So far we have decomposed a component into the BCC and the nBCC . Within each subset, all agents make the same total investment, and all li nks receive the same total investment, therefore each subset can be characteriz ed by two parameters, b, bfor the BCC and n, nfor the nBCC.

It corresponds to components with 3agents and 2links, one of which can be unidirectional. properties of the whole component, we need to study the relat ion between these four parameters. The central question guiding our exploration is why do agents not start to recip- rocate the unidirectional investments. The lack of reciproc ation implies that the unidirectional links are either less attractive or just as a ttractive as bidirectional links. We distinguish the two scenarios a)B/parenleftmathb/parenrightmath /equalmathB/parenleftmathn/parenrightmath, b)B/parenleftmathb/parenrightmath>B/parenleftmathn/parenrightmath. In case a) the unidirectional collaborations are as attract ive as targets for invest- ments as bidirectional collaborations. In typical network s, where all remaining links 494Patterns of cooperation a b Figure 14: Topological arrangement of unidirectional links (shown i n red).

Furthermore, in case a) the stationarity condition, Eq. ( 25), requires that C/parenleftmathb/parenrightmath /equalmathC/parenleftmathn/parenrightmath, which stipulates b/equalmathn/equalmath:. Therefore the whole component consists of agents making an i nvest- mentand links receiving an investment . Conservation of investments within a component implies l/equalmathnand hence an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath2l n/equalmath2 . (41) We know further that //equalmathn/n/equalmathmN, wheremis the number of outgoing links of an agent in the nBCC. Inserting //equalmathmin Eq.( 41) yields an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath2m, showing that unidirectional links that are as attractive as bidirectional links can only occur in components, in which the mean degree an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}htis an integer multiple of 2. This matches the numerical data displayed in Fig. 13a, which shows that n/b/equalmath1 is observed in components with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath2 andan}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht/equalmath4. It is remarkable that observing n/equalmathbin a pair of collaborations is sufcient to determine the mean degree of the whole component. Moreover, components in which the mean degree is exactly 2 have to consist of a single c ycle potentially with trees attached. In the numerical investigations, we mo stly observe cycles of bidirectional links to which trees of unidirectional links are attached, as shown in Fig. 14b. In case b) the bidirectional links are more attractive targe ts for investments than unidirectional links. In typical networks with b,nIP, this implies b< n, and 504.8Extension of the model thus that unidirectional links receive a higher investment than bidirectional links. Now, the stationarity condition Eq. ( 25) demands that C/parenleftmathb/parenrightmath> C/parenleftmathn/parenrightmath, and thus that b< nn< b. (42) Hence, the total investment made by an agent investing in bid irectional links is higher than the one made by agents investing in unidirection al links. This relation- ship restricts the connectivity in the BCC to an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}htBCC :/equalmath2b/b>2, which implies an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht>2, because the mean degree of the component cannot be smaller than 2if a subcomponent already has a degree greater than 2. Therefore, we nd that unidi- rectional links that are less attractive than bidirectiona l links only occur in compo- nents, in which the mean degree is larger than 2, but not an int eger multiple of 2(cf. Fig. 13a). As such links are only found at \u00afkbeyond the giant component transition, they occur typically in large components as shown in Fig. 7. In numerical investigations, we also observe some unidirec tional links in compo- nents with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2 (cf. Fig. 13b). To explain these, we have to consider case b) but relax the assumption that both, nandbare above the IP . Thus, we obtain case c), about which we know that the unidirectional links are les s attractive than bidi- rectional links, n< b, and that the unidirectional link only receives investment s from one agent, i.e., nn. Moreover, an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2 implies an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}htBCC<2 and therefore b< b. Therefore nn< b< b, (43) which shows that unidirectional links can only appear in com ponents with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2 if the investment received by unidirectional links is small er than the investment re- ceived by bidirectional links. Satisfying simultaneously n< bandB/parenleftmathn/parenrightmath<B/parenleftmathb/parenrightmath requiresn< IP. The components with an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2, in which such links are found, are trees formed by a core of bidirectional links, to which in dividual agents are at- tached by unidirectional links (Fig. 14a). Chains of unidirectional links, as we have observed in case a), cannot appear for an}bracketle{tkan}bracketri}ht<2: Such a scenario would necessitate that some agents have one incoming and one outgoing link belo w the IP , which is ruled out by a trivial extension of the reasoning from Sec. 4.3. 4.8Extension of the model Below, we consider an extension of the studied model, in whic h a player's success feeds back on his cooperative investment. In reality, such f eedbacks arise for in- stance because interest rates for loans may be lower for play ers, who receive a high 514Patterns of cooperation Figure 15: Example of communities formed in the adaptive model with 100 players. The communities are dominated by leaders, which are characterized by high degree and high payoff. The size of a node indicates an agent's total invest- menti.

Simulations and analytical reasoning show that for the adaptive model property (ii) still holds wh ile property (i) needs to be modied: The total amount of investment differs among pl ayers within a BCC as investments for players of high degree become cheaper (Fig. 15). However, we nd that players of the same degree approach the same level of investment. Consequently distinct classes of players arise which diffe r both in investment and in payoff. Surprisingly, higher investments by players of high degree do not lead to fairer interactions with players of low degree. The additional inve stments made by high- degree players are used to a large extend to establish additi onal links and thereby increase their own benet. However, although broader than i n the non-adaptive case, the degree distribution obtained for moderate reduct ion of costs is still rela- tively narrow compared to a random graph, and hence relative ly fair. 4.9Discussion In this chapter, we have analyzed a model for the formation of complex collabora- tion networks between self-interested agents. In this mode l, the evolving network is 524.9Discussion described by a large system of deterministic differential e quations allowing agents to maintain different levels of cooperation with different partners. We showed analytically that bidirectionally communities a re formed, in which every agent makes the same total investment and every collaborati on provides the same benet. In contrast to models for cooperation on discrete ne tworks, the present model thereby exhibits a high degree of coordination which c an be interpreted as a precursor of a social norm. We emphasized that coordination is generally achieved although single agents possess insufcient information fo r computing the total in- vestment made by any other agent and although the level of coo peration that is reached in a community is not xed rigidly by external constr aints. Despite the high degree of coordination, we observed the app earance of privileged agents, reminiscent of the leaders emerging in [ 129]. In the model proposed in the present chapter, the privileged agents hold distinguis hed topological positions of high degree centrality allowing them to extract much high er payoffs than other agents, while making the same cooperative investment. Howe ver, we found that in the absence of further mechanism reinforcing differences t he assembled topologies were fairer than random graphs. Although our primary aim was to investigate the formation of s ocial networks, some aspects of the behavior of social agents are reminiscen t of results reported in psychology. For instance, our investigation showed that agents can react to the withdrawal of investment by a partner either by mutual withd rawal of resources or by reinforcing the collaboration with increased investmen t. Our analysis provides a rational which links the expected response to the withdraw al of resources to an inflection point of an assumed benet function. Furthermore, we investigated under which conditions non-r eciprocated collabora- tions appear. Here, our analysis revealed that such unidire ctional collaborations can appear in three distinct scenarios, which can be linked to to pological properties of the evolving networks. In particular, exploited agents who se investments are not reciprocated invest less than the average amount of resourc es in their links when occurring in small components, but more than the average amo unt, when integrated in large components. The results reported here can be veried in laboratory experi ments, in which hu- mans interact via a computer network. Inspired by our model, Fehl et al. ran an experiment, in which the players could adopt different beha vioral options toward different, self-chosen partners [ 150]. In contrast to our model, however, the behav- ioral options in the experiment are discrete; players can ei ther cooperate or refuse 534Patterns of cooperation to cooperate with a given partner. We believe that an experim ent with continuous behavioral options may conrm the topological properties o f the self-organized net- works reported here. Additionally, it may provide insights i nto the perceived cost and benet functions that humans attach to social interacti ons. Furthermore, results of the proposed model may be veried by comparison with data on collaboration networks between people, rms or nati ons. This comparison may necessitate modications of the model to allow for insta nce for slightly different cost functions for the players. Most of these extensions are straight forward and should not alter the predictions of the model qualitatively . For instance in the case of heterogeneous cost functions, players will make different total investments, but will still approach an operating point in which the slope of their cost function is identical. Further, coordination should persist even if the network of potential collaborations is not fully connected. Finally, but perhaps most important ly, our analytical results do not rely heavily on the assumption that only two agents par ticipate in each collaboration. Most of the results can therefore be straigh t-forwardly extended to the case of multi-agent collaborations. Our analytical treatment suggests that the central assumpt ion responsible for the emergence of coordination is that the benet of a collaborat ion is shared between the collaborating agents, but is independent of their other collaborations, whereas the cost incurred by an agent's investment depends on the sum o f all of an agent's investments. Because this assumption seems to hold in a rela tively large range of applications we believe that also the emergence of coordina tion and leaders by the mechanisms described here should be observable in a wide ran ge of systems. 545Self-organized criticality The emergent, collective phenomena addressed in the last cha pters were dynamical and structural in nature. In this chapter, we consider the se lf-organization into a functional state. To approach the topic, recall that a system, which depends on external parame- ters, may have different phases distinguished by qualitati vely different dynamics. Particularly in biology, however, dynamics are intimately related to function. One may thus ask, if a biological system has to operate in a certai n phase for optimiz- ing its functionality. Central in this eld is the so-called criticality hypothesis [ 157], according to which critical dynamics close to a phase transi tion provide particular functional gains. Early evidence for the criticality hypothesis came from the eld of cellular automata [158]. In these systems, the tuning of a control parameter common ly changes the macroscopic behavior from highly ordered to chaotic. The tra nsition between the respective dynamical phases occurs in a narrow parameter re gime, sometimes called the edge of chaos, in which the cellular automata display opt imal adaptation and information-processing properties [ 158]. A number of recent papers have yielded a comprehensive pictu re of the relation between critical dynamics and computational properties [ 159,160]. The investiga- tions are based on different model systems and achieve a high level of generality by linking fundamental characteristics of critical states to fundamental aspects of information theory. Information is generally assumed to be coded in the dynam- ical attractor that is reached in response to an input. Thus, t he maximal number of attractors at criticality has been associated with maxim al information storage ca- pacity [ 161,162], and the diverging correlation length at criticality with maximal information transmission [ 163]. It has been emphasized that the scale invariance of observables bears the potential to code information over se veral orders of magni- tude [ 164]. And nally, it has been shown that fluctuations and spontaneo us activity 555Self-organized criticality can assist the processing of stimulus-evoked activity and t hus broaden the range of processable inputs [ 165]. On the background of the sketched results, it is plausible to assume that our brain may operate at a critical point. Indeed, scale invariance of observables - the hall- mark of criticality - was found in different experiments ran ging from EEG measure- ments in humans to direct activity measurements in slices of rat cortex [ 163,166- 169]. Considering that the brain is subject to ongoing changes t hroughout develop- ment, through aging and damage, it is an interesting questio n how it preserve the operating parameters prerequisite for criticality. One po ssible explanation is that the observed criticality is achieved and maintained in a dyn amical self-organization process. The concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) was rst pro posed by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld. In their seminal work [ 170], the authors presented a simple cellular automaton, which evolves into a state that features several characteristics of natural critical systems, such as fractal geometry, 1 /fnoise, and scale invariance. The critical state is reached due to the intrinsic dynamics of th e system, independently of the value of any model parameter. In recent years, it has been shown that beside cellular autom ata, also adaptive net- works have the ability to self-organize toward a critical st ate [ 142,143,171-180]. Indeed, it was found that SOC is not only a generic, but also a r obust feature of the latter model class. Today, adaptive SOC is studied with diff erent perspectives: The hope is that understanding the phenomenon in simple models w ill help to compre- hend SOC in biological systems, as well as to implement SOC in technical systems. One step in the latter direction shall be made in the present c hapter. We begin in Sec. 5.1with a short overview of the rst generation of SOC mod- els, and describe the common mechanism which has been found t o underlie them. Then, in Sec. 5.2, we contrast these models with the later models based on adap tive networks. Condensing the latter to their common core reveal s that on an abstract level the genesis of SOC in adaptive networks is linked to the adaptive feedback loop. In Sec. 5.3, we shortly review four exemplary models showing adaptive S OC. We highlight both, the conceptual similarities in the basic design, as well as the specic differences in their concrete rules. In Sec. 5.4, we derive a generic recipe for the construction of rules that generate SOC. Finally, in Sec .5.5, we use the recipe to design an adaptive network of heterogeneous phase oscillat ors that self-organizes toward the onset of synchronization. 565.1SOC models of the rst generation 5.1SOC models of the rst generation Initiated by [ 170], a wave of cellular automata models have been studied under the paradigm of SOC (cf. [ 181-185] and references therein). They all consider non- equilibrium systems, in which constant microscopic drivin g leads to series of macro- scopic events, so-called avalanches, whose frequency and s ize follow power-law distributions [ 185]. By way of illustration, consider the sandpile model studied in [170]. In this model, grains of sand are placed onto random sites of a lattice. The so -dened microscopic driving builds up the slope of the pile. When the slope at a sit e exceeds a certain threshold, it transfers sand to the adjacent sites. This pote ntially causes cascading reactions, i.e., avalanches, which are found to obey power-la w statistics. According to [ 186], SOC in the studied models can generically be traced back to the systems' approaching a conguration at a continuous absorb ing-state phase tran- sition. Below, we describe the mechanism through which this is achieved on an intuitive level without addressing the mathematical subtl eties of the argument. Consider a cellular automaton, whose sites are either activ e or passive with respect to a local dynamical rule, which we call the avalanche rule. Th e density of active sites,, is an order parameter of an absorbing-state phase transiti on. It is zero in states where no avalanche can occur (frozen regime), and non -zero otherwise (active regime). The avalanche rule dynamically changes ; Active site are dissipated in avalanches, such that in the active regime the system is driv en toward the frozen regime. To achieve SOC, a second dynamical rule is needed, wh ich dominates in the frozen regime and drives the system back toward the active re gime. One possible realization of this is a slow driving that increases the dens ity of active sites. In summary, the genesis of SOC in cellular automata builds on two ingredients: An absorbing phase transition and two contrary dynamical rule s effecting <0 if>0 >0 if/equalmath0, (44) such that the order parameter is tuned to a critical point, where its value changes from zero to nite. Note that the tuning parameter in Eq. ( 44) is identical to the order parameter. The system has no autonomous parameter by means of which it could be tuned from the frozen to the active phase. Hence, although the critical con guration approached can be associated to a phase transition, it is not possible to draw an order parameter prole. 575Self-organized criticality 5.2SOC in adaptive network models In1998 , the rst-time observation of SOC in an adaptive network mod el [171] trig- gered the interest in adaptive networks. Since then, a numbe r of simulation stud- ies have revealed that the ability to self-organize into a cr itical state is not only a frequent feature of adaptive network models, but also a sur prisingly resilient one [ 142,143,172-180]. Thus, in contrast to the SOC models of the rst generation, SOC in adaptive network models is very robust to noise, and in many cases even to changes in the modeling setup. In Sec. 5.3, we address the robustness of adaptive SOC by means of four ex emplary models. Before, however, let us shortly focus on the general denition of the phe- nomenon, its relation to SOC in cellular automata, and to the adaptive feedback loop. Prerequisite to adaptive SOC is a network, whose local state dynamics shows differ- ent dynamical phases depending on the underlying topologic al conguration. We speak of SOC if the dynamics ofthe network adjust the topological variables such that the dynamics onthe network become critical. The denition of adaptive SOC reveals the differences to SOC i n cellular automata. While in the rst-generation SOC models the tuning and the or der parameter are identical, they are clearly distinguished in adaptive netw ork models: The tuning pa- rameters are the variables of the topological evolution, i.e ., the link states. The order parameter, by contrast, characterizes the local evolution on the network, and is thus related to the node states. By tuning the topological variab les, the phases to both sides of the approached transition can actually be scanned, and order parameter proles can be generated. We can now pinpoint the role of the adaptive feedback loop for the genesis of SOC. Due to the feedback from the topology to the local dynamics, t he local dynamics are parametrized by the topological conguration. Due to th e feedback from the local states to the topological dynamics, however, the chan ge of the topological conguration is sensitive to order-parameter related info rmation. Thus, the space of topological congurations, i.e., the parameter space of th e local dynamics, can be navigated in a phase-sensitive manner to nd points which lie on the phase boundary. In the next section, we illustrate the typical implementati on of the adaptive feed- back by means of four models showing adaptive SOC. Though rela ted, the models display considerable differences in their specic rules th us providing an example for the robustness of the phenomenon against variations of t he actual setup. 585.3Four examples for adaptive SOC 5.3Four examples for adaptive SOC The most prominent model system for adaptive SOC is the brain. Its activity shows signatures of criticality, although the underlying synapt ic connectivity is too com- plex to possibly be hard coded in the genome [ 189]. Indications for the decentralized shaping of neural connections based on local, activity-dep endent mechanisms have been found in various experimental settings [ 190-192]. Two of the proposed mech- anisms 193] and spike-time-dependent plasticity [ 194] - were subsequently studied in AN models. These models revealed that homeostatic plasticity tunes a system toward the onset of self-sustaine d activity [ 173-176,178], and spike time dependent plasticity toward the onset of sync hronous activity [ 179]. Below, we briefly review four models which address the self-or ganization of neu- ral networks under the action of homeostatic plasticity. We begin our discussion with two models studied by Levina, Hermann and Geisel [ 175], and Meisel respec- tively [ 178]. Both models consider an adaptive network, whose links cor respond to synapses and whose nodes are modeled as integrate-and-r e neurons: The node state, corresponding to the neuron's membrane voltage, is re presented by a continu- ous variable xi. The state variable is incremented, if the node perceives an i ncoming spike. Once it exceeds a threshold, the node itself emits a sp ike. Meisel additionally includes a leakage term, according to which the state variab le decays, if a node does not receive an incoming spike. When simulated on static topologies, the described dynamic al rules give rise to qualitatively different long-time behaviors, in which the spiking activity is either sustained (active phase) or suppressed (frozen phase). The p robability of observ- ing persisting macroscopic activity depends on the topolog ical conguration of the underlying network. It increases rapidly, if the average co nnectivity of the network exceeds a critical value [ 195]. In the two models under consideration, the topological con guration is dynamically tuned. The tuning results in both cases in critical congurat ions at the transition between the frozen and the active phase, although it is imple mented in different ways: Levina et al. consider directed links with continuous weights. If a node spikes, the weight of all outgoing links is decreased; if it d oes not spike, the link weights slowly regain their default strength [ 175]. By contrast, Meisel considers directed links with discrete weights \u00b1gc. If a node spikes, it looses all outgoing links; if not, it gets a new link from a randomly chosen node [ 178]. The two models of Levina et al., Meisel respectively, provide a rst example for the robustness of adaptive SOC against variations in the mod eling setups: Their 595Self-organized criticality differences, manifest in the rescaling of the weights of xe d connections compared to the reformation of connections with binary values, does n ot affect the genesis of SOC. The two models we want to address next are not as closely patter ned on neuronal systems as the afore-discussed, but can nevertheless be con sidered to map the ac- tion of homeostatic plasticity in the brain. In the adaptive networks considered by Bornholdt and Rohlf [ 173], and Bornholdt and R\u00f6hl [ 174], the node evolution is determined by boolean threshold dynamics. Thus, in [ 173], nodes and links can adopt binary states xi/equalmath\u00b11,Aij\u00b11 respectively. In every timestep t, every node i sums over the inputs Ajixj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathit receives from its neighbors j. If the result is smaller (larger) than a threshold h, it adopts state xi/equalmath /plusmath1 (xi/equalmath1) in the next timestep. Just as the integrate-and-re neuron model, the boolean thr eshold model has a phase transition from a frozen to an active phase, depending on the underlying topological conguration. And just as the neuron model, the t hreshold model can self-organize toward a critical conguration if run in an ad aptive scenario. In [ 173], Bornholdt and Rohlf introduce adaptivity by prescribing th e repeated application of the following topological update rule: The local dynamics of the system are sim- ulated on a static topology until a dynamical attractor such as a limit cycle has been reached. Then, a randomly chosen node changes its topologica l environment in one of two possible ways depending on a local activity measur e: If the node has changed its state at least once over the course of the attract or, it deletes an incoming link, if not, it gets a new incoming link from a random node. The model studied by Bornhold and R\u00f6hl [ 174] is a variation of [ 173]. Main mod- ications concern the introduction of continuous link stat esAij/bracketleftmath1,1/bracketrightmath, and of stochasticity in the node dynamics. Finally, the topologic al update rule considers not only one randomly chosen node i, but a pair of randomly chosen nodes iandj. The absolute correlation Cij/equalmath/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1 /summationtextto/plusmath t/equalmathtoxi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathxj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleofiandj, averaged over a xed, long period , serves as a criterion for ito opt between the two modes of topological adaptation: If Cijis larger than a given threshold, ireceives a new link from node j, if it is smaller, the link between iandjis deleted. Here, as above, the differences in the setup do not affect the genesis of SOC: Both models, as well as a number of other variations described in [ 174], show robust self-organization toward a critical state. In all four models, the topological update rule captures two opposing processes, e.g., link building and link deletion, which are applied depen ding on some local measure that relates to the node state dynamics. Below, we ex pand this pattern 605.4Engineering adaptive SOC for formulating a generic recipe for the construction of top ological update rules that give rise to SOC. While the recipe highlights on the one s ide common design principles, it classies on the other hand the possibilitie s to modify the concrete setup without affecting SOC. 5.4Engineering adaptive SOC Below, we consider the following abstract scenario: Given a local update rule that gives rise to distinct macroscopic phases when run on differ ent static topologies, can we construct a topological adaptation rule such that the res ulting adaptive network exhibits SOC? We start our considerations by specifying thr ee conditions, which the adaption rule shall meet beyond generating SOC. These condit ions are imposed to account for the above given denition of self-organization . Firstly, the adaptation rule shall act on local topological variables . That is, the adapta- tion pertains either to single links, or to a set of links conn ected to a focal node. For the moment, we only consider the case of continuous variable s. Possible choices for a continuous and local topological variable include the weight of a single link, or the total weight of all links of a focal node. Below, the num ber of topological variables in the network will be denoted by d, and the variables themselves by Ti, i/equalmath1,...,d . Secondly, the adaptation of the topological variables shal l occur solely on the basis oflocal information . This concerns the implementation of the feedback from the node states to the topological dynamics. Local information about the dynamics on the network is information, that a focal node can gather by mo nitoring its own state and / or the influences it experiences from its direct nei ghbors. Below, such information will be denoted by Oiif accessible to a node i. Thirdly, all topological variables shall be subject to the same adaptation rule. This is done to account for the idea that the constituents of a self -organizing system are structurally identical. By way of illustration, consider t he model of Bornholdt and Rohlf described above [ 173]. In this model, the topological update rule is the same for all nodes, while the topological variable, to which it is applied, and the local information, on which it depends, are node specic. In Sec. 5.3, we have seen four examples for topological adaptation rule s that meet the imposed conditions. They all follow a pattern according t o which a local topo- logical variable Tiis changed in one of two possible ways depending on some local measureOi. Below, we rst ask which underlying principles make this pa ttern tune 615Self-organized criticality a system toward a critical conguration. Then, we analyze whi ch properties of the Oiand theTiare necessary for the pattern to work. This nally allows us to expand the pattern to a generic recipe for the construction of adapt ation rules generating SOC. How and under which conditions does the alternative applica tion of two opposing processes tune a system toward a critical conguration? For the sake of simplicity, we approach the question in a discrete time scenario. As a star ting point, we use the generic properties of the prerequisite phase transition of the local state dynamics. We may generically assume that it can be observed in ensemble s of random graphs, which differ in the macroscopic parameter T/equalmath1 dd/summationdisplay i/equalmath1Ti (45) that subsumes all adaptable degrees of freedom (cf. Fig. 16a-c). In this case, the two phases can uniquely be described as low- T, high-Tphase respectively (cf. Fig. 16d). Depending on the denition of the Ti,Tmay for instance denote the average cou- pling strength in the network. The codimension of a transition that can directly be observed , and thus the minimal number of degrees of freedom that need to be adapted for arriv ing at the phase boundary Mcis one. Hence, it is convenient to determine that in every ste p of the topological evolution only one randomly chosen variable Tiis updated, while all others (although in principle dynamic) are kept constant. I n the literature, this is often called a sequential update . The sequential update decomposes the process, which navigat es thed-dimensional space of topological congurations, in a series of processe s that are one-dimensional; in each evolutionary step, the randomly chosen variable Tican only be increased or decreased. Depending on the values of the xed variables Tj,jne}ationslash/equalmathi, the updated variableTican have a critical value /parenleftmathTi/parenrightmathc, which geometrically corresponds to an intersection point of the /parenleftmathd1/parenrightmath-parameter family TiandMc(cf. Fig. 16e). If/parenleftmathTi/parenrightmathc exists, it can be approached, by increasing (decreasing) Ti, if the system is in the low (high) Tphase. If /parenleftmathTi/parenrightmathcdoes not exist, the application of same rule increases the probability that in the next evolutionary step, when a di fferent variable Tkis updated, it nds parameters Tj,jne}ationslash/equalmathk, such that /parenleftmathTk/parenrightmathcexists. Let us shortly summarize. The above reasoning illustrates ho w thed-dimensional space of topological congurations can be steered by means o f a sequential update rule that prescribes the phase-dependent application of tw o opposing processes. It 625.4Engineering adaptive SOC Figure 16: Steering the space of topological congurations: Schemat ic illustration using an example with d/equalmath2. (a) Shown is the two-dimensional space of topological con - gurations spanned by the variables T1/equalmathxandT2/equalmathy. The order parameter prole, coded in the coloring of the plane, divides the space of topological con- gurations in two different phases.

Geometrically, this means that a hypersurface characteri zed byT/equalmathconst., is projected onto one point. The gure shows three hyp ersurfaces (dashed red lines), and the projection manifold T(solid red line). The statistical analysis of the ensemble data associates to every value of tithe average value of the order parameter an}bracketle{tOan}bracketri}ht. (c) Plotted is the resulting one-dimensional order- parameter prole. The minimal t, for which the phase transition is observed (here t2), is usually referred to as critical value tc, at which the transition occurs. Note, however, that the terminology is misleading, as T/parenleftmathx,y/parenrightmath /equalmathtccannot be viewed as a universal characteristic of all critical congurations. ( d) The statistical projection of (c) can be used to distinguish a high- T, and a low- Tphase. (e) In a sequential update, only one degree of freedom is updated in every given a daption step, and all others are kept constant. Sketched is a situation, in whi chyis tuned, while x is xed at x/equalmathx1. By tuning y, the conguration /parenleftmathx,y/parenrightmathmay be shifted along the red line. The intersection point yc/parenleftmathx1/parenrightmathof this line and Mcis approached if yis increased (decreased) when the system is in the high (low) Tphase. 635Self-organized criticality One example for an order parameter Eq. (47)is the order parameter Othat Bornholdt and Rohlf use to characterize the absorbing phase tran sition of the threshold model [ 173]. In this paper, Ois dened as the fraction of nodes that has not changed state over the course of an attractor. This is equivalent to the po pulation average over a local measure Oi, which is 1if a nodeihas not changed state, and 0if it has. Another example is the order parameter that Meisel and Gross use to characterize the synchronization transition of the integrate-and-re neuron model [179]. In this paper, the denition of Ois based on a local measure Cij/parenleftmath/parenrightmath, which denotes the correlation between the state of node iand nodejover a period . The order parameter Ois the mean value of Cij/parenleftmath/parenrightmathaverage over all pairs i,j. One example for an order parameter, which cannot be understood as po pulation average over a local measure, is the order parameter commonly used to characte rize the synchro- nization transition of the Kuramoto model. It is dened as the norm Rof the vector describing the centroid of the population of phase oscillators, and c j, and/equalmath1/N/summationtextN j/equalmath1jis the mean of the intrinsic frequencies. Inserting the dening relation of , the coordinates of the centroid can be rewritten as population average over a local measure accessible to e very nodej. However, the norm of the vector cannot be rewritten as average over locally computable quantities. Box 3: Global order parameters are often population averages ove r local measures. further reveals that the variables Tiand the local measure Oiemployed by such a rule have to meet the following requirements: The topologica l variables Tihave to be chosen such that the phases can be uniquely be described as high-Tphase, low- T phase respectively. The local measure Oihas to allow for the detection of the global phase such that it can be used as local criterion for the phase -specic application of the opposing processes. As the condition on the Tiis rather mild, we below concentrate on the task of nding local measures Oi, by means of which the global phase can be detected. Consider a local measure Oi, whose global average is an order parameter Oof the phase transition. Finding such a measure Oiis typically easy, as standard order parameters can often be rewritten as O /summationdisplay iOi. (47) 645.4Engineering adaptive SOC To demonstrate the application of the homogeneity denition Eq. (48), we again use the example of the absorbing phase transition of the threshold model [ 173]. In particular, the example shall illustrate that homogeneity is not a property that perta ins to a phase as such, but a property that depends on both, the phase and the ex act denition of the Oi. We begin with dening the local measure Oias the number of times a node ihas changed state over a period ;O/equalmath/summationtext iOiis an order parameter of the phase transition and is zero in the frozen and non-zero in the active phase. The denition of the frozen phase requires that in this phase all nodes imeasure Oi/equalmath0/equalmathO. Hence, the frozen phase is homogeneous. The denition of the active p hase requires that in this phase at least some nodes measure Oine}ationslash/equalmath0. We show below that the number of nodes measuring Oine}ationslash/equalmath0, and therewith the homogeneity or inhomogeneity of the active phase, depends on the particular value of . In the active phase, the local threshold dynamics are ergodic [ 196,197]. This implies that in this phase a randomly chosen node changes state with probability on e if monitored over an innite period of time, and with a probability close to one, if monitor ed over an nite but long period . Thus, ifis chosen sufciently large, all nodes imeasureOine}ationslash/equalmath0 in the active phase. In this case the active phase is homogeneous. On the other hand, the probability of nding one or more nodes imeasuring Oi/equalmath0 increases with decreasing . Thus, ifis chosen sufciently small, the active phase is inhomogeneous. Box 4: The homogeneity of a phase depends on the exact denition of Oi. For examples we refer to Box 3. Next, we have to ask under which conditions the localOi, as the global O, contain information about the global phase. For addressin g this question, it will prove convenient to introduce the fol lowing conventions: If for a given phase and a given order parameter of the form ( 47) holds O/equalmath0Oi/equalmath0i, (48a) O the phase homogeneous in theOi. Analogously, if the applicable relation is violated, the phase is called inhomogeneous (cf. Box 4). We can now distinguish three different cases: Case (a), in wh ich both phases of a system are homogeneous, case (b), in which both phases of a s ystem are inho- mogeneous, and case (c), in which one phase is homogeneous, w hile the other is inhomogeneous. 655Self-organized criticality In case (a), the local observation Oiis unconditionally equivalent to the global ob- servation O. Hence, the complete information about the global phase is l ocally accessible by all nodes and in both phases. In case (b), there is no local observation Oithat could reliably be linked to a global observation O. Thus, the information about the global phase cannot locally be accessed via Oi. Finally, in case (c), only one of the two possible local obser vationsOican reliably be linked to a global observation O: The local observation Ohomthat is made by all nodes in the homogeneous phase is measured also by some nodes in the inhomo- geneous phase. Thus, it does not convey information about the global phase. By contrast, the local observation Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhomconveys that the system is in the inhomo- geneous phase. Hence, the global phase can locally be detect ed viaOi, albeit the detection is restricted to the inhomogeneous phase, and, wi thin this phase, to nodes measuring Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhom. It is worth noticing that the fraction fof nodes that measure Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhomis an order parameter of the transition. We can now summarize the conditions under which the alternat ive application of two opposing processes tunes a system toward a critical con guration: Our analysis revealed that it is convenient to implement the update rule a s a sequential rule, and that it is necessary to make the application of the opposing p rocesses phase-specic. We found that the topological variables Tishould allow for the unique denition of a low-Tand a high- Tphase, and that the process that prevails in the high- T(low-T) phase should decrease (increase) Ti. We found further that a local phase-detecting criterionOishould have a global mean that is an order parameter of the tra nsition, and lastly that it is necessary to dene Oisuch that at least one of the phases is homogeneous. Below, we nally adopt the engineering viewpo int and translate the conditions on the Ti,Oi, and the opposing processes into a recipe for their construction. To dene a local measure Oithat is a suitable criterion for the phase-specic ap- plication of the two opposing processes, we can proceed as fo llows: First, we have to nd a measure Oi, whose global mean O /summationtext iOiis an order parameter of the transition. Second, we have to check for each phase whether i t is homogeneous or inhomogeneous in Oi. Third, if either one, or both phases are homogeneous in Oi, the measure can be applied as a switching criterion between t he opposing processes: In case both phases are homogeneous, the two possible measur ementsOi/equalmath0 and Oine}ationslash/equalmath0 can uniquely be related to the high- Tphase, low- Tphase respectively. On this basis, we can then specify whether a given topological d egree of freedom Ti shall be increased or decreased depending on the value of Oi. 665.4Engineering adaptive SOC Given a system, whose local state dynamics have two different dynamical phases depend- ing on the underlying topological conguration, 1. Find a local measure Oi, whose global mean O /summationtext iOiis an order parameter of the transition. 2. Check for each phase whether it is homogeneous or inhomogeneous in Oi. If at least one phase is homogeneous, proceed. 3. Dene local topological variables Ti. If the local measure Oipertains to a node i(a linki),Tishould capture the weights of the links of a node i(the weight of a link i). 4. Sample random graphs with different T/equalmath/summationtext iTiand measure Oto determine high-T/ low-Tphase. 5. Relate local measurements Oi/equalmath0andOine}ationslash/equalmath0to high-T/ low-Tphase. 6. Stipulate that in every step of the topological evolution, one Tiis chosen at random. It is decreased by (increased by ) ifOiindicates that the system is in the high- T(low-T) phase. 7. If one of the phases is inhomogeneous, choose the rate of change of the process applied forOine}ationslash/equalmathOhomlarger than the rate of the process applied for Oi/equalmathOhom. Box 5: Recipe for a topological update rule generating adaptive S OC In case one phase is inhomogeneous, only the measurement Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhomis a reliable indicator of the global phase and can uniquely be related to e ither the high- Tor the low-Tphase. The bounded information content of the measurement Oi/equalmathOhom can be compensated if the opposing topological processes ar e implemented with different rates of change. Thereby, the process that is appli ed forOine}ationslash/equalmathOhomshould have a larger rate of change than the process that is applied f orOi/equalmathOhom. In Box 5, we summarize the above considerations in a recipe for the co nstruction of a topological update rule generating SOC. To evaluate the ef fect of such a rule, we below study one scenario quantitatively. Consider a system, whose local state dynamics have two diffe rent phases depending on the topological conguration. Consider further a local m easureOi, with respect to which one the phases is homogeneous, the other inhomogene ous, and a set of local variables Tisuch that the homogeneous phase is the low- Tphase. Let us next deneandas rates of change of the processes applied for Oi/equalmathOhom,Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhom 675Self-organized criticality respectively. If we moreover adopt a continuous time pictur e, the balance equation for each topological variable can be written as differentia l equation d dtTi/equalmath 1 d\u00b7 in the homogeneous 1 the the topological while f/parenleftmathT/parenrightmathdenotes conguration-dependent fraction of nodes measuring Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhom. The term1 dcorresponds to the probability that the variable Ti is chosen for an update. With probability f/parenleftmathT/parenrightmath, the chosen node measures Oine}ationslash/equalmathOhom and thus decreases Tiby, with probability 1 f/parenleftmathT/parenrightmath, it measures Oi/equalmathOhomand thus increases Tiby. We can immediately read off the implicit function dening th e stationary points T of Eq. ( 49) f/parenleftmathT/parenrightmath /equalmath /parenleftmath/plusmath/parenrightmath. (50) The left hand side denotes the value of the order parameter fin a stationary topo- logical conguration. The right hand side may in the continuo us time picture be considered as a measure for the timescale separation betwee n the topological pro- cesses. As the right hand side of Eq. ( 50) is non-zero for nite ,, all stationary congurations lie in the inhomogeneous phase. Assuming that , in this phase, fin- creases with increasing distance to the phase boundary, we c an infer that the steeper fand the larger the separation between the two timescales of t he topological evo- lution, the closer the xpoints Tlie to the phase boundary. Further, it follows from the same assumption that all stationary congurations Tare stable, and, thus, that the system converges to one of them. Equation ( 50) reveals that the influence of the parameters , andon the assem- bled topological conguration is the smaller, the sharper t he transition of the order parameter f. In particular, the solution Tof the stationarity condition ( 50) becomes independent of the right hand side if the fraction of nodes me asuringOine}ationslash/equalmathOhom jumps sharply from 0 to 1 at the transition. This corresponds t o the limit, in which the inhomogeneous phase becomes homogeneous, i.e., to the lim it, in which case (c) becomes case (a). As shown above, the transition from case (c) to case (a) is related to the long-term accumulation of the local measure Oiif the dynamics in the inhomogeneous phase are ergodic [ 173,174]. We may thus say that in this case the timescale separation between the local and the topological dynamics substitutes the timescale separation between the two topological processe s. 685.4Engineering adaptive SOC The two different modes of implementing the timescale separa tion may be illus- trated using the examples given in Sec. 5.3: In the models of Levina et al., and Meisel, the accumulation time of the local activity measure is comparably short [175,178] such that the active phase is inhomogeneous. Indeed, in acc ordance with Eq. ( 50), the rate of change in the inhomogeneous, active phase exce eds in both models the rate of change in the homogeneous, frozen phase. In the models of Bornholdt and Rohlf, Bornholdt and Roehl res pectively, the ac- cumulation time of the local activity measure is long: In [ 174], it exceeds the timescale of the local threshold dynamics by a factor of 100. In [173], it is given by the variable length of an attractor. Being one in the frozen p hase, the attractor length diverges in the active phase [ 198], such that in [ 173], too, the topological dynamics in the active phase are much slower than the local dynamics. Th us, in [ 173,174] both phases are homogeneous; the opposing topological proc esses have the same rate of change: Links are deleted and created at the rate of on e link per update. Note that in the strict sense the topological congurations assembled by our rule are not critical: Due to Eq. ( 50), the xpoints Tlie close to the phase boundary, but not on it. Moreover, due to the statistical nature of Eq. ( 49), a given realization of the process might not converge to a xpoint T, but fluctuate around it. As argued by Bonachela and Mu\u00f1oz, the difference between conguratio ns that are critical in the strict sense and so-called pseudo-critical congurati ons is conceptually consid- erable [ 188]. However, they also show that it dislimns if primarily the g enerated phenomenology in nite systems is considered. As we are inter ested in the latter, we may stick with our terminology. Thus, in our context a syste m is termed critical if close, but not necessarily arbitrarily close congurati ons give rise to qualitatively different dynamics. If we adopt this more qualitative picture, the above argumen tation can readily be transferred to the case of discrete topological variables. In this case, the parame- ter space is not continuous and the concept of the phase bound ary looses validity. However, the closeness of congurations can still be dened , for example as mini- mal number of changes necessary to arrive from one to the othe r. Hence, systems with discrete topological variables, too, can self-organi ze toward congurations that are critical in the sense of the denition given above. This ap plies in particular in the limit of large system sizes. Let us emphasize that - in contrast to the underlying mechani sm of the rst gener- ation of SOC models, which we discussed in Sec. 5.1- the construction principles determined in this section are not bound to a certain type of p hase transition. For demonstration, we use them in Sec. 5.5to construct a model that self-organizes 695Self-organized criticality toward a synchronization transition. 5.5Engineering SOC in a model system In this section, we use the recipe derived in Sec. 5.4to construct an adaptive network model that shows SOC. Starting point for our construction is a network, whose local state dynamics are determined by the Kuramoto model. Our adap tive model shall self-organize toward the onset of synchronization. Let us briefly recall the conventions used. We consider a netwo rk ofNoscillators i, whose local state evolution is given by xi/equalmathi/plusmath/summationdisplay jne}ationslash/equalmathiAijsin/parenleftmathxjxi/parenrightmath,i1...N . (51) As above, xiandidenote the phase and the intrinsic frequency of oscillator i, whileAij/equalmathAjidenotes the weight of the link between two oscillators iandj. If Aijne}ationslash/equalmath0, the oscillators are if further xi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath /equalmath xj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathfor allt, they are said to be phase locked. The local, pairwise criterion for phase locking reveals that the Kuramoto model has not only two, but three different phases: The completely d isordered phase, where no two oscillators are phase locked, the partially syn chronized phase where some oscillators are phase locked, and the complete synchro nized phase, where all oscillators are phase locked [ 199]. The denition of the global phases through the local phase-lo cking criterion pro- vides an ideal starting point for the construction of our rul e. According to Box 5, we rst have to nd a local measure Oi, whose global mean is an order parameter. This is obviously fullled by the measure Cij/equalmath1 /integraldisplayto/plusmath t/equalmatht0/bracketleftbigxi/parenleftmatht/parenrightmathxj/parenleftmatht/parenrightmath/bracketrightbigdt, (52) which is zero if two oscillators iandjare phase locked, and non-zero if they are not. In step 2, we have to compare the local phase-locking criterion Cijwith the de- nition of the global phase. The comparison reveals that the co mpletely disordered and the completely synchronized phase are homogeneous in Cij, while the partially 705.5Engineering SOC in a model system synchronized phase is inhomogeneous: Cij ne}ationslash/equalmath0 for alli,j in the disordered phase /equalmath0 some i,jin the partially synchronized phase /equalmath0 for alli,j in the completely synchronized phase .(53) Both phase transitions, the lower transition between the di sordered and partially synchronized phase, and the upper transition between the pa rtially and the com- pletely synchronized phase, separate one homogeneous and o ne inhomogeneous phase. Thus, Cijcan be employed as a local, phase-detecting criterion Oifor a topological update rule that tunes the system toward either of them. In step 3, we have to dene the topological variables that shall be ada pted by our rule. As the chosen local measure Oi/equalmathCjkpertains to a single link, it is conve- nient to let the adaptation processes, too, act on a single li nk. Thus, we dene the variablesTias link weights Ajk. If the average coupling strength T/equalmath1/d/summationtext iTiof a network is incrementally in- creased, the three phases are observed in the order of Eq. ( 53) [199]. Hence, the dis- ordered phase is the low- Tphase, the partially synchronized phase the intermediate- T phase, and the completely synchronized phase the high- Tphase of our system. Next, we have to prescribe which of the opposing processes - i ncreasing or decreas- ingAij- shall be applied for which values of Cij. For this purpose consider that irrespective of the regarded phase transition, the local me asureCij/equalmath0 is character- istic for the phase with higher T. Thus, we stipulate that for Cij/equalmath0 the link weight is decreased by an amount , while for Cijne}ationslash/equalmath0 it is increased by an amount . Finally, we have to specify the rates ,thereby accounting for the inhomogeneity of the partially synchronized phase. According to step 7of the recipe, the rate of change of the process applied for Cijne}ationslash/equalmathChomhas to be larger than the rate of change of the process applied for Cij/equalmathChom. In case of the upper transition Chom/equalmath0, as the homogeneous of the two abutting phases is the completely synchronized one (cf. Eq. ( 53)). For tuning toward this transition, we thus have to choose << . In case of the lower transition Chomne}ationslash/equalmath0, as the homogeneous of the two abutting phases is the disordered one. For tuning toward this transit ion, we have to choose <<. In summary, our topological update rule stipulates that in e very evolutionary step one linkijis chosen at random, and the measure Cijis evaluated over a period . IfCij/equalmath0,Aijis decreased by an amount ; ifCijne}ationslash/equalmath0, it is increased by an 715Self-organized criticality 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.20.00.20.40.60.81.0 cfa b 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 f 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 c Figure 17: One-dimensional order parameter scans around evolved net work congurations.

Every data point is averaged over 300 integration runs with different initial phases xi. In each of these runs, the phase locking criterion Cij was measured over 1000 integration steps. The evolved cong uration, marked by the dashed line at c/equalmath1, lies close to the lower (upper) transition in case (a), (b) respectively. It results in both cases from 104iterations with the following parameters: /parenleftmathAini,,/parenrightmath/equalmath /parenleftmath0.005,0.01,0.001/parenrightmathfor (a), and /parenleftmath0.01,0.001,0.01/parenrightmathfor (b). amount. For approaching the lower transition, we choose << ; by contrast, for approaching the upper transition, we choose <<. To evaluate the dened topological update rule, we study exe mplary realizations of the adaptive network model in numerical simulations. In the se, we substitute the local measure Cijdened by Eq. ( 52) with a different measure, which can be tracked with less computational effort and has further the advantag e of yielding a discrete phase-detecting criterion. Thus, we dene Cijas the number of changes of sign that the coupling term sin /parenleftmathxixj/parenrightmathdisplays during a tracked period . We veried that ifis chosen sufciently large, both described criteria coinc ide qualitatively. Our simulations are run on networks of N/equalmath50 oscillators, whose intrinsic fre- quencies are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean ze ro and variance 2/equalmath0.01. We assume that the network of potential interactions is E rd\u00f6s-Renyi random graph [ 200] with mean degree k/equalmath10. All links are initially assigned a weightAini. Between any two topological updates, we integrate the syste m of equations ( 51) on a static topology for /equalmath500 time units using a Taylor series method [ 201].

Note that in accordance with Eq. 50, the evolved network congurations ( c/equalmath1) lie in both cases slightly in the inhomogeneous phase. Figure 18shows that the change of the order parameter around the evolv ed cong- 735Self-organized criticality uration is the steeper, the longer the topology is evolved. Th is can be understood as follows: Consider a conguration Tevolved at the boundary of the disordered phase. The change of faround Tevolved is a measure for the number of links ij, for which the phase-locking criterion Cijchanges from Cijne}ationslash/equalmath0 toCij/equalmath0, if allAij/parenleftmath1/plusmath/parenrightmathAij. As by assumption Tevolved lies at the phase boundary, the number is at least one. However, there may be points at the boundary, where it is much higher. Let us now come back to Fig. 18. It reveals that the phase boundary is reached after 3000 4000 iterations of the topological evolution. The topologic al evolution toward the phase boundary, however, is followed by a topolog ical evolution along the phase boundary, in the course of which more and more link w eights are tuned to critical values. This is a direct consequence of the sequenti al update rule, according to which topological variables are chosen in an ongoing mann er and gradually tuned. Thus, it leads to a conguration which is not only local ly distinguished by the proximity to the transition of the order parameter, bu t also globally by the maximal steepness thereof. 5.6Discussion In this chapter, we have analyzed a pattern commonly found in the adaptation rules of heuristic SOC models. By determining the functiona l principles behind this pattern, we found a generic mechanism that generates SOC. Co mparing the specic models with the mechanism allows to analyze the former on an a bstract level and to relate the details of their setup to particular functions within the self-organization process. Moreover, the abstract mechanism explains the rob ustness of SOC against variations in the modeling setup. Thus, it may be considered a s set of requirements on the two central entities, TiandOi. Within the bounds of these requirements, however, the entities can freely be chosen without affectin g the genesis of SOC. We have shown that the recipe allows to construct systems tha t self-organize to- ward criticality. We believe that this engineering viewpoi nt on SOC will become particularly important in the future. Thus, for example, as p art of the development of nano computing elements the targeted placement of conduc ting paths gets in- creasingly demanding. A new and promising approach to this p roblem is to abstain from targeted placement, put conducting paths at random and implement a neuro- mimetic self-organization process for achieving a functio nally connected state. As a positive side effect, such a state can be assumed to feature t he favorable information processing properties that we described above. 745.6Discussion Engineering solutions that rely on SOC can benet from the de centralized opti- mization of computational, but also of structural properti es: Thus, as shown in the example of the Kuramoto model, the self-organization proces s can tune the sys- tem toward a state, which is able to support a predened task, while reducing the required connectivity. In all models discussed here, the topological update rules t une the total coupling strength and/or the connectivity of the network. However, t he analysis of Sec. 5.4 reveals that SOC can equally be achieved by means of a rule, wh ich acts on other topological structures, for example on the number of triang les. In fact, for the self-organization toward a phase boundary of codimension o ne, the choice of the topological tuning parameters Tiis quasi unrestricted. Note however that different choices may result in topologically different, albeit dyna mically equivalent congu- rations. The above reasoning suggests that it is possible to implement systems, that simulta- neously self-organize toward more than one phase transitio n: Consider a dynamical system which features m<d phase transitions, with non-parallel phase boundaries of codimension one. Consider moreover mtopological rules, each of which fullls the criteria derived in Sec. 5.4and depends on a local measure sensitive to one of the considered phase transitions. If the topological updat e rules steer the parameter space in a non-parallel way, i.e., if they act on different topo logical structures Ti, it is assured that the individual self-organization processe s do not conflict with each other. Hence, their simultaneous application should drive the system to a cong- uration that lies on the intersection of the mphase boundaries and which is thus critical with respect to all mphase transitions. 756Conclusions In this work, we proposed new analytical approaches to adapt ive self-organization. These approaches are applicable to continuous networks and a llow to address the mechanisms behind emergent phenomena that are prominently discussed in the context of biological systems. In Chapter 3, we studied the relation between structure and synchronize d behavior in a system of coupled oscillators. We introduced a graphica l notation, which allows writing the minors of a hermitian Jacobian matrix in a concis e way. Imposing a zero-row-sum condition, we reformulated the algebraic sta bility conditions from Jacobi's signature criterion as topological restrictions o n a simple graph G. The topological stability criteria pertain to structures on al l scales and provide a rapid test for whether a interaction topology can support stable s teady states. In cases where it is violated it allows to determine those interactio ns that presumably cause the instability. In Chapter 4, we examined the spontaneous diversication of an initiall y homoge- neous population of interacting agents. Our analysis of the continuous, directed, multi-agent snowdrift game, revealed that the symmetries o f the local dynamical rules scale up and are imprinted in non-obvious symmetries i n the evolving global structure. These global symmetries imply a high degree of soc ial coordination. However, at the same time they cause the emergence of privile ged topological po- sitions, thus diversifying the population into different c lasses. In Chapter 5, we addressed the ability of adaptive networks to self-orga nize toward dynamically critical states. We identied a common pattern in the setup of exem- plary SOC models, and laid out how and under which conditions it generates SOC. By expanding the pattern to an abstract mechanism, we were ab le to explain the robustness of SOC against variations in the modeling setup. Moreover, we were able to formulate a generic recipe for the construction of lo cal rules that give rise to self-organized critical behavior. We demonstrated the app licability of this recipe by 776Conclusions engineering an adaptive network of phase oscillators that s elf-organize toward the onset of synchronization. The results presented in this work can feed back to both, the ex perimental explo- ration of biological systems as well as the design of technol ogical applications. For example, knowing the role of cyclic interaction structures for synchronization gives a hint what to look for in experimental data to explain synchr onized behavior, but also what to built in technical devices to achieve it. The central theme of this work is the analytical treatment of c ontinuous network models. While analytical approaches for discrete networks are well-studied, con- tinuous networks have so far received considerably less att ention. Below, we want to contrast both classes of networks, discuss the character istic difculties associated with the analysis of continuous networks, and highlight pos sible approaches. The dynamics of both, discrete as well as continuous networks , are usually analyzed with the tools of dynamical systems theory. However, the res pective dynamical sys- tems are qualitatively different. To see this, consider tha t in a continuous network, the dynamics of the link and node states can often be describe d by deterministic differential equations. Thus, the microscopic dynamics of a continuous network directly constitute a deterministic dynamical system. By c ontrast, describing the dynamics of a discrete network in a dynamical system necessi tates a detour: Usu- ally, the dynamics of the discrete link and node states are as sumed to be stochastic. Then, the system is described by continuous, coarse-grained variables, whose bal- ance equations are formulated as differential equations. In summary, a dynamical system description of a discrete net work typically pertains to the approximate dynamics of macroscopic variables, whil e a dynamical system description of a continuous network pertains to the exact dy namics of the micro- scopic variables. This means that the dynamical system is low -dimensional in case of a discrete network, but high-dimensional in case of a cont inuous network. More- over, it implies that the analysis reveals macroscopic prop erties in the discrete case, but microscopic properties in the continuous case. Thus, stu dying self-organization in continuous instead of discrete networks imposes two prob lems: It necessitates to deal with high-dimensional dynamical systems, and to infer the macroscopic prop- erties of interest from the microscopic result of the analys is. The results presented in this work show that the problems inhe rent in the analytical treatment of continuous networks can be overcome. Hence, ou r analysis started in all cases with the consideration of the full, high-dimensio nal systems. However, we were able to determine in each case model-inherent properti es that allowed for the 78reduction of the dimensionality. Thus, in Chapter 3, the symmetry of the minors with respect to permutations of the index set Sdisclosed that the cycles of the graphGcan serve as a basis for the graphical notation and calculus. In Sec. 4, the linear stability analysis revealed that any topological co mponent in the equilibrated network can be characterized by at most four variables. Fina lly, in Chapter 5, the sequential update rule implied that the process of steering the high-dimensional parameter space can be decomposed in a sequence of one-dimen sional processes. For inferring macroscopic properties from the microscopic -level descriptions we used upscaling procedures. Hence, in Chapter 4, the stationarity and stability con- ditions rst and foremost equated the investments of two lin ks connected by one node, two nodes connected by one link respectively. To scale up the symmetry rela- tions to whole components, we iterated the argument along a s equence of neighbors. In Chapter 3, the analysis followed a similar pattern. Thus, we considere d sequences of incrementally growing link chains to derive the topologi cal stability conditions for cyclic subgraphs. Considering multiple subgraphs in tu rn led to the conjecture of the positive spanning tree criterion. Finally, in Chapte r5, we asked for the pre- requisites for an upscaling procedure: We determined under which conditions the value of a microscopic measure Oiallows inferring the value of macroscopic order parameter O. The challenges associated with the analysis of continuous ne tworks are compen- sated by certain advantages. Thus, the dynamical system desc ription of a continu- ous network captures the full topological information and t hus allows to study the interplay between structure and dynamics in detail. To desc ribe the structural de- tails of the network on all scales, we complemented the metho ds from the theory of dynamical systems with methods from graph theory. We interl ocked the two toolk- its in different ways, usually however by a translation step , in which information about the system is transferred from one framework to the oth er. To illustrate this point, let us shortly summarize for each project the tie poin ts between the toolkits and the benets of their interlocking. In Chapter 3, we interpreted the dynamics related information of the Jac obian Jas adjacency information of a graph G, which allowed to translate the algebraic sta- bility conditions into topological stability conditions. Beside this, the topological interpretation allowed to overcome a technical challenge: For evaluating the neces- sary algebraic stability conditions the index structure of the terms in a minor was found to be decisive. Describing this structure is intricat e in the algebraic frame- work, but practicable in the graph theoretical framework, w hich provides suitable concepts and terms such as subgraphs, trees, and cycles. 796Conclusions In Chapter 4, translation between the frameworks allowed to interpret t he algebraic conditions for the stationarity and stability of the cooper ative investments as topo- logical characteristics of the evolving networks. The tools from dynamical systems side revealed that in equilibrium any topological componen t can be characterized by at most four variables, which - for stationarity to be obse rved - additionally have to satisfy one of three possible relations. Arguments fr om graph theory then revealed that the relations dene topologically distinct s cenarios, which differ with respect to the average degree in a component as well as to the e xpected topological arrangements of unidirectional links. In Chapter 5, nally, the translation step was carried at the very beginn ing of the considerations, when we mapped a topological structure ont o a scalar variable Ti. Therewith, we were able to study the topological self-tuning of the network from the dynamical systems perspective. In summary, the analytical treatment of continuous network models is in itself more difcult than the analysis of discrete network models. Howe ver, it provides results which are exact and account for the detailed topological con guration. The meth- ods derived in this work show ways of overcoming the technica l challenges. In the future, it would be desirable to extend them, for example by generalizing the assumptions under which the topological stability analysi s introduced in Chapter 3 can be applied. Our hope is that by opening up continuous netw orks to analyt- ical treatment our methods may contribute to future steps to ward a conceptional understanding of adaptive self-organization. 80Bibliography [1] S.

First and foremost, I wish to thank my supervisor Dr. Thilo Gro ss. Initiating this work and accompanying all of its stages, he always let me bene t from his great experience and knowledge. In many hours of discussions, I pr oted from Thilo's stunning overview over a whole lot of topics and from the proj ect ideas that he generates at high frequency. And I am very grateful that he had the patience to try passing on his admirably structured way of thinking, presen ting and writing. I would like to thank Prof. Bernd Blasius for mentoring me and my thesis from Oldenburg. It is a great opportunity to defend this work in th e many-sided and interdisciplinary environment of the faculty of mathemati cs and sciences at the Carl von Ossietzky University. I am very grateful that Prof. Stefan Bornhold, one of the adap tive network pioneers, accepted to review this thesis. It meant a great support. Than ks. I am indebted to Prof. Frank J\u00fclicher, who hosted me in the Bio logical Physics Department of Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Comple x Systems. I beneted a lot from the inspiring atmosphere at the institute, enjoye d the chance to meet many interesting people, and could always be sure that for whatev er question I could have there was an expert nearby. Many thanks to the members of the junior research group on Dyn amics of Biological Networks. In particular, I would like to thank my ofce mates Lars and Martin. It is great fun to be around you, guys.Selbst\u00e4ndigkeitserkl\u00e4rung Hiermit versichere e n s l a u f Pers\u00f6nliche Angaben A n n e \u00ad L y Do e x a m i n i e r t e M u s i k e r i n \u00b7 Di p l o m \u00ad P h y s i k e r i n G e b u r t s d a t u m : 8 .
