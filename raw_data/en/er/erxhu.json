This was sometimes combined with car maintenance workshops and/oropportunities to drive fast legally. cOf the 1,087 offenders on the projects 89% were male and 95% had previousconvictions. cNearly 80% of offenders were reconvicted within two years of being sentenced of \u00d4any\u00d5offence \u00d0 of these, three-quarters were reconvicted for a motoring offence. cOverall, actual reconviction rates were higher than predicted with particularly poorresults for \u00d4racing\u00d5 projects. The worst results were for young offenders but for the oldergroup actual reconviction (56%) was lower than the prediction (62%). cOffenders who did not complete the projects were reconvicted at much higher ratesthan their age and criminal histories would suggest.The findings reported here are from an evaluation of 42 schemes designed to deal withmotoring offences. Reconviction rates after two years were examined for 1,087 offenders whoattended projects between 1989 and 1993. A survey of motor projects (Martin and Webster, 1994) showed that in England and Wales, by the endof 1992, 32 of the (then) 55 probation areas ranabout 60 projects. This study reports on reconvictionsafter two years for 1,087 offenders who attended 42of these projects between 1989 and 1993. Two-thirdsof the 42 projects were run exclusively by probationservices and the remainder in partnership with otheragencies. The evaluation examined: \u00a5 types of techniques used by the projects\u00a5 the age, sex, previous offending and sentencing histories of offenders referred \u00a5 offenders\u00d5 expected rate of reoffending compared with actual reconviction rates. The projects used a variety of techniques including: \u00a5 challenging offenders\u00d5 attitudes and behaviour \u00d0 by making them think about the consequences of their actions both forthemselves and their victims and so to act lessimpulsively (cognitive behavioural techniques)\u00a5racing \u00d0 to provide offenders with the opportunity to drive fast legally \u00a5car maintenance workshops \u00d0 to increase offenders\u00d5 knowledge of cars and encouragemore responsible driving. Many projects combined two or more techniques \u00d0 the different approaches used with offenders areshown in Table 1. Confidence in the power of cognitive behavioural techniques to change offenders\u00d5 attitudes andultimately their reoffending has grown in recent years(see Vennard, Hedderman and Sugg, 1997 for anoverview of the literature). It is not clear to whatextent these techniques were actually employed inthe projects examined in this study but, as can beseen in Table 1, nearly all offenders attendedprojects which included some elements aimed atchallenging offenders\u00d5 behaviour. For just over halfthe sample, these were the only approaches used. 2RESEARCH FINDINGS No. 81 WHO ATTENDED THESE MOTOR PROJECTS? The staff interviewed in the Martin and Webster survey of probation-run motor projects identified twogroups of offenders: \u00a5 a large group comprising young \u00d4twockers\u00d5 (so called because many have convictionsfor \u00d4taking a vehicle without owner\u00d5s consent\u00d5) \u00a5 a smaller group of older offenders who have failed to comply with lengthy periods ofdisqualification built up over a long period. This age structure is confirmed in Table 2. Nearly nine out of ten offenders were male and 81% were on the projects as a result of a court order, 12%attended voluntarily. Despite the relative youth of thesample many offenders had extensive criminalhistories as follows: \u00a5 more than ten previous convictions (26%)\u00a5 six to ten previous convictions (30%)\u00a5 one to five previous convictions (39%)\u00a5 no previous convictions (5%). The frequency of past offending probably explains the high proportion of offenders with experience ofcustody and probation. Nearly six out of tenoffenders had previously experienced a custodialsentence and three-quarters had served some formof community sentence. The most common offences for which offenders were referred to motor projects (see Table 3) were: \u00a5 driving whilst disqualified\u00a5 taking a vehicle without consent\u00a5 driving without insurance. Just over a quarter of offenders were referred to theprojects for one of these offences only. Nearly nine out often offenders also had at least one previous convictionfor one of these offences. Eleven offenders had previousconvictions for the more serious offences of causingdeath by careless driving or aggravated vehicle taking.No significant differences were found between thecriminal histories of offenders on racing and/or workshop projects and those on projects exclusivelyaimed at challenging offending behaviour, nor werethere any such differences with respect to age andcurrent offending. Opinion is divided on whether offenders who attend motor projects specialise in car crime but Wilkinson(1997) notes that most projects are based on thisassumption (for differing views see Light et al., 1993and Wilkinson). However, this study suggests that themotoring offenders on these programmes were notspecialists, as they had had previous convictions for: \u00a5 theft (75%)\u00a5 burglary (60%)\u00a5 offences of violence against the person (30%). EFFECT ON RECONVICTION RATES Nearly 80% of offenders were reconvicted for an offence of some sort within two years of beingsentenced (see Table 4). Three-quarters of thesewere reconvicted for a motoring offence.Reconviction figures were marginally lower for thegroup of offenders who only received \u00d4challengingoffending behaviour\u00d5 sessions and for the smallnumber of offenders who only went through Table 2 Characteristics of those who attended the projects Under 21 61% Male 89% Over 21 39% Female 2% No information 9% Attendance on project: As a condition of court order 81%Voluntary 12% No information 7% Total N = 1,087Table 1 Project components Number of offenders Challenging offending behaviour only 51% Challenging offending behaviour combined with workshop and/or racing 45% Workshop and/or racing only 2% Missing 2%Total N = 1,087Table 3 Current and previous offences Current Previous Motoring Driving whilst disqualified 59% 63%Taking a vehicle without consent 38% 65% Table 4 Reconvictions within two years by offence type Type of project Any Any offence motoring offence Challenging offending behaviour only (n=551) 77% 60% Workshop and/or racing only (n=25) with workshopand/or racing 1,087) 79% 63% Note: Offenders may have been convicted more than once within the two-year period.3RESEARCH FINDINGS No. 81 workshop or racing-based projects. The most common reconvictions were: \u00a5 driving whilst disqualified (49%)\u00a5 driving without insurance (48%)\u00a5 taking a vehicle without consent (21%). The most common non-motoring offences were theft (39%), burglary (25%) and violence against theperson (15%). Given the sample\u00d5s relative youth and extensive criminal careers, such a high level of reconviction maynot be surprising. In Table 5 the actual reconvictionfigures are compared with the predicted rates,calculated using the Offender Group ReconvictionScale (OGRS), i.e. taking age, previous offending andexperience of youth custody into account. Overall, the actual reconviction rates are higher than the predicted rates (69% compared with 65%). Forthe small number of offenders who only went throughworkshop and/or racing projects the difference wasquite substantial (+9 points). The largest differenceswere for the actual and predicted scores for 224offenders who went through racing projects, whetheror not this was in combination with other approaches(75% compared with an expected rate of 63.5%, adifference of 11.5 percentage points). Since OGRS is known to under-predict reconviction for young offenders, who make up over half thesample, Table 6 shows the differences in actual andpredicted rates for the young offenders and thoseover 21 separately. For the older group the actualreconviction rate was six percentage points lower thanpredicted. This improvement with age was apparentwhatever approaches were used with offenders. SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE COURSE Previous research in different areas has shown that those who do not complete programmes fare worsethan either those who have completed or those in control groups. Sufficient information was availableon whether offenders had successfully completed orfailed to complete their projects for 309 offenders inthis evaluation. The remaining offenders were eitherstill engaged on the projects or information was notavailable to calculate predicted scores. Of the 309,the reconviction rates were: \u00a5 two percentage points lower than the predicted rate for the 129 offenders whosuccessfully completed projects (actualreconviction rate of 65% compared with 67%) \u00a5 ten percentage points higher than the predicted rate for the 180 offenders who hadnot completed the projects (actual reconvictionrate of 82% compared with 72%). These findings should be interpreted with caution. Some of the difference may be because those whodid not complete the project were likely to beyounger (for offenders under 21 the completion ratewas 32% compared with 52% for older offenders).As discussed earlier, OGRS under-predicts re-offending for young offenders so there could be acorresponding under-prediction for many non-completers. It is also possible that there are otherfactors, not accounted for in prediction, that areassociated with non-completion and are related tosubsequent reconviction. DISCUSSION There is some evidence to suggest that motor projects may help older offenders to move awayfrom car crime, particularly if the projects arecompleted. Overall, however, these results are notencouraging \u00d0 they indicate that the motor projectsin operation between 1989 and 1993 had littlepositive impact on offending behaviour. Althoughsome recent research (such as Wilkinson,1997) hasTable 5 Predicted versus actual reconvictions1 Predicted rate Actual reconviction Difference rate Challenging offending behaviour only (n=503) 65% 68% +3Challenging offending behaviour with workshop and/or +4 Note: 1. To ensure compatibility with the predicted scores the actual rates exclude convictions for many summary offences, including some minor motoring offences. 2. Actual/predicted scores are not given as no information wasavailable on sex (95), or on standard list offences (16), or on the projects\u00d5 components (23) for these offenders. Table 6 Reconviction by age Age group Predicted reconviction rate Actual reconviction rate Difference reconviction for young offenders as the young offenders in the original sample used to construct the predictor had relatively few convictions and therefore less criminal history to draw on.As in Table 5 scores could not be calculated for some offenders (111).4 Research Development and Statistics Directorate 1998RESEARCH FINDINGS No. 81 \u00d4Research Findings\u00d5 are produced by the Research Development and Statistics Directorate.

The difference between actual and predicted rates was marginally smaller for offenders who only wentthrough projects which were aimed at challengingoffending behaviour but actual offending was stillworse than predicted. There may be a number ofreasons for this: \u00a5the OGRS prediction model may not takeinto account important factors that causemotor offenders to have higher thanpredicted rates (e.g. impulsiveness) \u00a5staff who ran programmes in 1996 aimed atchallenging offending behaviour had rarelyreceived proper training in the relevantpsychological theories and techniques (seeHedderman and Sugg, 1997). During theearlier 1990s training was even less likely \u00a5Martin and Webster (1994) found that theoffending behaviour aspects of motorprojects were adapted by probation stafffrom other projects. As Hedderman and Sugg noted, such adaptations, if carried outby untrained staff, may seriously reduceprogramme efficacy \u00a5motor offenders are a high risk group whohave in the past failed to respond to mostcriminal sanctions \u00a5only limited information could be provided byservices on the projects undertaken byoffenders. For example, although it is knownwhether an offender attended a project whichincluded racing, car maintenance or anymodules aimed at challenging offenders\u00d5attitudes, information is not available on: cthe precise nature of these approaches for specific projects cthe proportion of each project dedicated toeach approach chow far they were run in line with \u00d4whatworks\u00d5 principles.

It was possible to match this information with that ofcriminal records held by the National Identification Service at Scotland Yard for 1,087 offenders (55% ofthe original sample). Non-matches occurred because identification details were too vague or too common(e.g. too many Smiths born the same day). There is no evidence that this has created "}
