In cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),APIC offers this Bioterrorism Readiness Plan to serve as a reference document and initial template to facilitate preparation of bioterrorism readiness plans for individual institutions. This document is not intended to provide an exhaustive reference on the topic of bioterrorism. Rather it is intended to serve as a tool for infection control (IC) professionals andhealthcare epidemiologists to guide the development of practical and realistic response plans for their institutions in preparation for a real or suspected bioterrorism attack. Institution-specific response-plans should be prepared in partnership with local and state health departments. Manyof the facility bioterrorism planning components may be incorporated into existing disasterpreparedness and other emergency management plans. These components may also be useful for identifying and responding to other infectious disease outbreaks in the community. Individual facilities should determine the extent of their bioterrorism readiness needs, which may rangefrom notification of local emergency networks (i.e. calling 911) and transfer of affected patients to appropriate acute care facilities, to activation of large, comprehensive communication and management networks. Hospitals and clinics may have the first opportunity to recognize and initiate a response to a bioterrorism-related outbreak. Healthcare facilities should have IC policies in place authorizing the healthcare epidemiologist, IC committee chairman, or designee to rapidly implement prevention and control measures in response to a suspected outbreak. Should abioterrorism event be suspected, a network of communication must be activated to involve ICpersonnel, healthcare administration, local and state health departments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field office, and CDC (see Reporting Requirements and Contact Information below). Existing local emergency plans should be reviewed, and a multidisciplinary approachoutlined that includes local emergency medical services (EMS), police and fire departments, andmedia relations in addition to healthcare providers and IC professionals. Annual disaster preparedness drills held at many facilities can improve response capacity by incorporating a bioterrorism scenario to test and refine Bioterrorism Readiness Plans at each individual facility. Section I: General Categorical Recommendations for Any Suspected Bioterrorism Event A.Reporting Requirements and Contact Information Healthcare facilities may be the initial site of recognition and response to bioterrorism events. If a bioterrorism event is suspected, local emergency response systems should be activated. Notification should immediately include local infection control personnel and the healthcare facility administration, and prompt communication with the local and state healthdepartments, FBI field office, local police, CDC, and medical emergency services. Each health care facility should include a list containing the following telephone notification numbers in its readiness plan :4/13/99 4INTERNAL CONTACTS: INFECTION CONTROL ___-____ EPIDEMIOLOGIST ___-____ADMINISTRATION/PUBLIC AFFAIRS ___-____ CONTACTS: LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ___-____ STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT 1-___/___-____ * FBI FIELD OFFICE 1-___/___-____ * BIOTERRORISM EMERGENCY NUMBER, CDC Emergency Response Office 770/488-7100 CDC HOSPITAL INFECTIONS PROGRAM 404/639-6413 * Telephone numbers for FBI field offices and State health departments are listed in Appendix 1 and 2. B. Potential Agents Four diseases with recognized bioterrorism potential (anthrax, botulism, plague, and smallpox) and the agents responsible for them are described in Section II of this document. TheCDC does not prioritize these agents in any order of importance or likelihood of use. Subsequent installments of this document will address additional agents with bioterrorism potential, including those that cause tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers,and viral encephalitis, and disease associated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B. C. Detection of Outbreaks Caused by Agents of Bioterrorism Bioterrorism may occur as covert events, in which persons are unknowingly exposed and an outbreak is suspected only upon recognition of unusual disease clusters or symptoms. Bioterrorism may also occur as announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred. A number of announced bioterrorism events have occurred in the United Statesduring 1998-1999, but these were determined to have been \"hoaxes;\" that is, there were no trueexposures to bioterrorism agents 1. A healthcare facility's Bioterrorism Readiness Plan should include details for management of both types of scenarios: suspicion of a bioterrorism outbreak potentially associated with a covert event and announced bioterrorism events or threats. Thepossibility of a bioterrorism event should be ruled out with the assistance of the FBI and statehealth officials. 1. Syndrome-based criteria Rapid response to a bioterrorism-related outbreak requires prompt identification of its onset. Because of the rapid progression to illness and potential for dissemination of some of these agents, it may not be practical to await diagnostic laboratory confirmation. Instead, it will be necessary to initiate a response based on the recognition of high-risk syndromes. Each of theagent-specific plans in Section II includes a syndrome description (i.e., typical combination ofclinical features of the illness at presentation), that should alert healthcare practitioners to the possibility of a bioterrorism-related outbreak.4/13/99 52.Epidemiologic features Epidemiologic principles must be used to assess whether a patient's presentation is typical of an endemic disease or is an unusual event that should raise concern. Features thatshould alert healthcare providers to the possibility of a bioterrorism-related outbreak include: A rapidly increasing disease incidence (e.g., within hours or days) in a normally healthy population. An epidemic curve that rises and falls during a short period of time. An unusual increase in the number of people seeking care, especially with fever, respiratory, or gastrointestinal complaints. An endemic disease rapidly emerging at an uncharacteristic time or in an unusual pattern. Lower attack rates among people who had been indoors, especially in areas with filtered air or closed ventilation systems, compared with people who had been outdoors. Clusters of patients arriving from a single locale. Large numbers of rapidly fatal cases .2 Any patient presenting with a disease that is relatively uncommon and has bioterrorism potential (e.g., pulmonary anthrax, tularemia, or plague).3 D.Infection Control Practices for Patient Management The management of patients following suspected or confirmed bioterrorism events must be well organized and rehearsed. Strong leadership and effective communication are paramount. 1. Isolation precautions Agents of bioterrorism are generally not transmitted from person to person; re-aerosolization of these agents is unlikely4.All patients in healthcare facilities, including symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed bioterrorism-related illnesses, should bemanaged utilizing Standard Precautions . Standard Precautions are designed to reduce transmission from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in healthcare facilities, and are recommended for all patients receiving care, regardless of their diagnosis or presumedinfection status 5.For certain diseases or syndromes (e.g., smallpox and pneumonic plague), additional precautions may be needed to reduce the likelihood for transmission. See Section II for specific diseases and requirements for additional isolation precautions. Standard Precautions prevent direct contact with all body fluids (including blood), secretions, excretions, nonintact skin (including rashes), and practiced by healthcare providers include: Handwashing Hands are washed after touching blood, body fluids, excretions, secretions, or items contaminated with such body fluids, whether or not gloves are worn. Hands are washed immediately after gloves are removed, between patient contacts, and as appropriate to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients and the environment. Either plain orantimicrobial-containing soaps may be used according to facility policy. Gloves Clean, non-sterile gloves are worn when touching blood, body fluids, excretions, secretions, or items contaminated with such body fluids. Clean gloves are put on just beforetouching mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Gloves are changed between tasks and between procedures on the same patient if contact occurs with contaminated material. Hands are washed promptly after removing gloves and before leaving a patient care area.4/13/99 6Masks/Eye Protection or Face Shields A mask and eye protection (or face shield) are worn to protect mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth while performing procedures and patient care activities that maycause splashes of blood, body fluids, excretions, or secretions. Gowns A gown is worn to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing during procedures and patient-care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids,excretions, or secretions. Selection of gowns and gown materials should be suitable for the activity and amount of body fluid likely to be encountered. Soiled gowns are removed promptly and hands are washed to avoid transfer of microorganisms to other patients andenvironments. 2. Patient placement In small-scale events, routine facility patient placement and infection control practices should be followed. However, when the number of patients presenting to a healthcare facility istoo large to allow routine triage and isolation strategies (if required), it will be necessary to apply practical alternatives. These may include cohorting patients who present with similar syndromes, i.e., grouping affected patients into a designated section of a clinic or emergencydepartment, or a designated ward or floor of a facility, or even setting up a response center at aseparate building. Designated cohorting sites should be chosen in advance by the IC Committee (or other appropriate decision-making body), in consultation with facility engineering staff, based on patterns of airflow and ventilation, availability of adequate plumbing and wastedisposal, and capacity to safely hold potentially large numbers of patients. The triage or cohortsite should have controlled entry to minimize the possibility for transmission to other patients at the facility and to staff members not directly involved in managing the outbreak. At the same time, reasonable access to vital diagnostic services, e.g., radiography departments, should bemaintained. 3. Patient transport Most infections associated with bioterrorism agents cannot be transmitted from patient- to-patient. Patient transport requirements for specific potential agents of bioterrorism are listedin Section II. In general, the transport and movement of patients with bioterrorism-related infections, as for patients with any epidemiologically important infections (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis, chickenpox, measles), should be limited to movement that is essential to providepatient care, thus reducing the opportunities for transmission of microorganisms withinhealthcare facilities. 4. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and environment Principles of Standard Precautions should be generally applied for the management of patient-care equipment and environmental control. Each facility should have in place adequate procedures for the routine care, cleaning, and disinfection of environmental surfaces, beds, bedrails, bedside equipment, and otherfrequently touched surfaces and equipment, and should ensure that these procedures are being followed. Facility-approved germicidal cleaning agents should be available in patient care areas to use for cleaning spills of contaminated material and disinfecting non-critical equipment.4/13/99 7Used patient-care equipment soiled or potentially contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions should be handled in a manner that prevents exposures to skin and mucous membranes, avoids contamination of clothing, and minimizes the likelihoodof transfer of microbes to other patients and environments. Policies should be in place to ensure that reusable equipment is not used for the care of another patient until it has been appropriately cleaned and reprocessed, and to ensure thatsingle-use patient items are appropriately discarded. Sterilization is required for all instruments or equipment that enter normally sterile tissues or through which blood flows. Rooms and bedside equipment of patients with bioterrorism-related infections should be cleaned using the same procedures that are used for all patients as a component of Standard Precautions, unless the infecting microorganism and the amount ofenvironmental contamination indicates special cleaning. In addition to adequate cleaning,thorough disinfection of bedside equipment and environmental surfaces may be indicated for certain organisms that can survive in the inanimate environment for extended periods of time. The methods and frequency of cleaning and the products used are determined byfacility policy. Patient linen should be handled in accordance with Standard Precautions. Although linen may be contaminated, the risk of disease transmission is negligible if it is handled,transported, and laundered in a manner that avoids transfer of microorganisms to otherpatients, personnel and environments. Facility policy and local/state regulations should determine the methods for handling, transporting, and laundering soiled linen. Contaminated waste should be sorted and discarded in accordance with federal, state and local regulations. Policies for the prevention of occupational injury and exposure to bloodborne pathogens in accordance with Standard Precautions and Universal Precautions should be in placewithin each healthcare facility. 5 5. Discharge management Ideally, patients with bioterrorism-related infections will not be discharged from the facility until they are deemed noninfectious. However, consideration should be given to developing home-care instructions in the event that large numbers of persons exposed may preclude admission of all infected patients. Depending on the exposure and illness, home careinstructions may include recommendations for the use of appropriate barrier precautions,handwashing, waste management, and cleaning and disinfection of the environment and patient- care items. 6. Post-mortem care Pathology departments and clinical laboratories should be informed of a potentially infectious outbreak prior to submitting any specimens for examination or disposal. All autopsies should be performed carefully using all personal protective equipment and standards of practicein accordance with Standard Precautions, including the use of masks and eye protectionwhenever the generation of aerosols or splatter of body fluids is anticipated. Instructions for funeral directors should be developed and incorporated into the Bioterrorism Readiness Plan for communication. 54/13/99 8E. Post Exposure Management 1.Decontamination of Patients and Environment The need for decontamination depends on the suspected exposure and in most cases will not be necessary. The goal of decontamination after a potential exposure to a bioterrorism agent is to reduce the extent of external contamination of the patient and contain the contamination toprevent further spread. Decontamination should only be considered in instances of grosscontamination. Decisions regarding the need for decontamination should be made in consultation with state and local health departments. Decontamination of exposed individuals prior to receiving them in the healthcare facility may be necessary to ensure the safety of patientsand staff while providing care. When developing Bioterrorism Readiness Plans, facilities shouldconsider available locations and procedures for patient decontamination prior to facility entry. Depending on the agent, the likelihood for re-aerosolization, or a risk associated with cutaneous exposure, clothing of exposed persons may need to be removed. After removal ofcontaminated clothing, patients should be instructed (or assisted if necessary) to immediatelyshower with soap and water. Potentially harmful practices, such as bathing patients with bleach solutions, are unnecessary and should be avoided . Clean water, saline solution, or commercial ophthalmic solutions are recommended for rinsing eyes. If indicated, after removalat the decontamination site, patient clothing should be handled only by personnel wearingappropriate personal protective equipment, and placed in an impervious bag to prevent further environmental contamination. Decontamination requirements for specific potential agents of bioterrorism are listed in Section II. 6 Development of Bioterrorism Readiness Plans should include coordination with the FBI field office. The FBI may require collection of exposed clothing and other potential evidence for submission to FBI or Department of Defense laboratories to assist in exposure investigations. 2. Prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization Recommendations for prophylaxis are subject to change. Current recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis and immunization are provided in Section II for relevant potential bioterrorism agents. However, up-to-date recommendations should be obtained in consultationwith local and state health departments and CDC. Facilities should ensure that policies are inplace to identify and manage health care workers exposed to infectious patients. In general, maintenance of accurate occupational health records will facilitate identification, contact, assessment, and delivery of post-exposure care to potentially exposed healthcare workers. 3. Triage and management of large scale exposures and suspected exposures Each healthcare facility, with the involvement of the IC committee, administration, building engineering staff, emergency department, laboratory directors and nursing directors,should clarify in advance how they will best be able to deliver care in the event of a large scale exposure. Facilities should incorporate into their Bioterrorism Readiness Plan processes for triage and safe housing and care for potentially large numbers of affected individuals. Facilityneeds will vary with the size of the regional population served and the proximity to otherhealthcare facilities and external assistance. Triage and management planning for large-scale events may include: Establishing networks of communication and lines of authority required to coordinate on- site care.4/13/99 9Planning for cancellation of non-emergency services and procedures. Identifying sources able to supply available vaccines, immune globulin, antibiotics, and botulinum anti-toxin (with assistance from local and state health departments). Planning for the efficient evaluation and discharge of patients. Developing discharge instructions for patients determined to be non-contagious or in need of additional on-site care, including details regarding if and when they should return for care or if they should seek medical follow-up. Determining availability and sources for additional medical equipment and supplies (e.g., ventilators) that may be needed for urgent large-scale care. Planning for the allocation or re-allocation of scarce equipment in the event of a large- scale event (e.g., duration of ventilator support of terminally afflicted individuals). With assistance from the Pathology service, identifying the institution's ability to manage a sudden increase in the number of cadavers on site. 3,7 4.Psychological aspects of bioterrorism Following a bioterrorism-related event, fear and panic can be expected from both patients and healthcare providers. Psychological responses following a bioterrorism event may include horror, anger, panic, unrealistic concerns about infection, fear of contagion, paranoia, socialisolation, or demoralization. IC professionals should develop prior working relationships withmental health support personnel (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, clergy, and volunteer groups) and assist in their collaboration with emergency response agencies and the media. Local, state, and federal media experts can provide assistance with communicationsneeds. When developing the facility Bioterrorism Readiness Plan, consider the following to address patient and general public fears: Minimize panic by clearly explaining risks, offering careful but rapid medical evaluation/treatment, and avoiding unnecessary isolation or quarantine. Treat anxiety in unexposed persons who are experiencing somatic symptoms (e.g., with reassurance, or diazepam-like anxiolytics as indicated for acute relief of those who do notrespond to reassurance). Consider the following to address healthcare worker fears: Provide bioterrorism readiness education, including frank discussions of potential risks and plans for protecting healthcare providers. Invite active, voluntary involvement in the bioterrorism readiness planning process. Encourage participation in disaster drills. Fearful or anxious healthcare workers may benefit from their usual sources of social support, or by being asked to fulfill a useful role (e.g., as a volunteer at the triage site). 8 F.Laboratory Support and Confirmation This part of the document is subject to updates due to current work underway to improve the diagnostic capacity of laboratories to isolate and identify these agents. Facilities should workwith local, state and federal public health services to tailor diagnostic strategies to specific events. Currently the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at CDC is at the Emergency Response Office, NCEH, 770/488-7100 . 1. Obtaining diagnostic samples4/13/99 10See specific recommendations for diagnostic sampling for each agent. Sampling should be performed in accordance with Standard Precautions. In all cases of suspected bioterrorism, collect an acute phase serum sample to be analyzed, aliquotted, and saved for comparison to alater convalescent serum sample. 2. Laboratory criteria for processing potential bioterrorism agents To evaluate laboratory capacity in the United States, a proposal is being made to group laboratories into one of four levels, according to their ability to support the diagnostic needspresented by an event. The proposed laboratory levels in the planning stages are: Level A: Clinical laboratories - minimal identification of agents Level B: County/ State/ other laboratories - identification, confirmation, susceptibility testing Level C: State and other large facility laboratories with advanced capacity for testing - some molecular technologies Level D: CDC or select Department of Defense laboratories, such as U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) - BioSafety Level (BSL) 3 and 4 labs with special surge capacity and advancedmolecular typing techniques. 3.Transport requirements Specimen packaging and transport must be coordinated with local and state health departments, and the FBI. A chain of custody document should accompany the specimen from the moment of collection. For specific instructions, contact the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100 . Advance planning may include identification of appropriate packaging materials and transport media in collaborationwith the clinical laboratory at individual facilities. G. Patient, Visitor, and Public Information Clear, consistent, understandable information should be provided (e.g., via fact sheets) to patients, visitors, and the general public. During bioterrorism-related outbreaks, visitors may be strictly limited. A well-designed healthcare facility Bioterrorism Readiness Plan should clarify the lines of authority and flow of communication. To minimize the anticipated responses of fear,confusion and anger, healthcare facilities should plan in advance the methods and channels ofcommunications to be used to inform the public. IC professionals working with the IC committee and administration should coordinate in advance with state and local health agencies, local emergency services, and local broadcast media systems to decide how communication and actionacross agencies will be accomplished. Failure to provide a public forum for informationexchange may increase anxiety and misunderstanding, increasing fear among individuals who attribute non-specific symptoms to exposure to the bioterrorism agent.4/13/99 11Section II: Agent-Specific Recommendations A. Anthrax 1. Description of Agent / Syndrome a. Etiology Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore forming, gram-positive bacillus. Associated disease occurs most frequently in sheep, goats, and cattle, which acquire spores through ingestion of contaminated soil. Humans can become infectedthrough skin contact, ingestion, or inhalation of B. anthracis spores from infected animals or animal products (as in \"woolsorter's disease\" from exposure to goat hair). Person-to-person transmission of inhalational disease does not occur. Direct exposure to vesicle secretions of cutaneous anthrax lesions may result in secondary cutaneous infection. 1 b. Clinical features Human anthrax infection can occur in three forms: pulmonary, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal, depending on the route of exposure. Of these forms, pulmonary anthrax is associated with bioterrorism exposure to aerosolized spores.9 Clinical features for each form of anthrax include: Pulmonary Non-specific prodrome of flu-like symptoms follows inhalation of infectious spores. Possible brief interim improvement. Two to four days after initial symptoms, abrupt onset of respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse, possibly accompanied by thoracic edema and a widened on blood culture, usually after the first two or three days of illness. Treatable in early prodromal stage. Mortality remains extremely high despite antibiotic treatment if it is initiated after onset of respiratory symptoms. Cutaneous Local skin involvement after direct contact with spores or bacilli. Commonly seen on the head, forearms or hands. Localized itching, followed by a papular lesion th at turns vesicular, and within 2-6 days develops into a depressed black eschar. Usually non-fatal if treated with antibiotics. Gastro-intestinal Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever following ingestion of contaminated food, usually meat. Bloody diarrhea, hematemesis. Gram-positive bacilli on blood culture, usually after the first two or three days of illness. Usually fatal after progression to toxemia and sepsis.10 c. Modes of transmission The spore form of B. anthracis is durable. As a bioterrorism agent, it could be delivered as an aerosol. The modes of transmission for anthrax include: Inhalation of spores.4/13/99 12Cutaneous contact with spores or spore-contaminated materials. Ingestion of contaminated food.1 d. Incubation period The incubation period following exposure to B. anthracis ranges from 1day to 8 weeks (average 5days), depending on the exposure route and dose: 2-60 days following pulmonary exposure. 1-7 days following cutaneous exposure. 1-7 days following ingestion. e. Period of communicability Transmission of anthrax infections from person to person is unlikely. Airborne transmission does not occur, but direct contact with skin lesions may result in cutaneousinfection. 6 2. Preventive Measures a. Vaccine availability Inactivated, cell-free anthrax vaccine (Bioport Corporation 517/327-1500, formerly Michigan Biologic Products Institute*) - limited availability. *Use of trade names and commercial sources is for identification only and does not constitute endorsement by CDC or the U.S. De partment of Health and Human Services b. Immunization recommendations Routinely administered to military personnel. Routine vaccination of civilian populations not recommended.1,10-12 3.Infection Control Practices for Patient Management Symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed infections with B. anthracis should be managed according to current guidelines specific to their disease state. Recommendations for chemotherapy are beyond the scope of this document. For up-to-date information and recommendations for therapy, contact the local and state health department and the BioterrorismEmergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100.a. Isolation precautions Standard Precautions are used for the care of patients with infections associated with B. anthracis. Standard Precautions include the routine use of gloves for contact with nonintact skin, including rashes and skin lesions.b. Patient placement Private room placement for patients with anthrax is not necessary. Airborne transmission of anthrax does not occur. Skin lesions may be infectious, but requires direct skin contact only. c. Patient transport Standard Precautions should be used for transport and movement of patients with B. anthracis infections. d. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and environment Principles of Standard Precautions should be generally applied for the management of patient-care equipment and for environmental control (see Section I for more detail). e. Discharge management4/13/99 13No special discharge instructions are indicated. Home care providers should be taught to use Standard Precautions for all patient care (e.g., dressing changes). f. Post-mortem care Standard Precautions should be used for post-mortem care. Standard Precautions include wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including masks and eye protection, when generation of aerosols or splatter of body fluids is anticipated.5 4.Post Exposure Management a. Decontamination of patients / environment The risk for re-aerosolization of B. anthracis spores appears to be extremely low in settings where spores were released intentionally or were present at low or high levels. Insituations where the threat of gross exposure to B. anthracis spores exists, cleansing of skin and potentially contaminated fomites (e.g. clothing or environmental surfaces) may be considered to reduce the risk for cutaneous and gastrointestinal forms of disease. The plan for decontaminating patients exposed to anthrax may include the following: Instructing patients to remove contaminated clothing and store in labeled, plastic bags. Handling clothing minimally to avoid agitation. Instructing patients to shower thoroughly with soap and water (and providing assistance if necessary). Instructing personnel regarding Standard Precautions and wearing appropriate barriers (e.g. gloves, gown, and respiratory protection) when handling contaminated clothing orother contaminated fomites. Decontaminating environmental 0.5% hypochlorite solution (one to nine parts water). 5,6 b. Prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization Recommendations for prophylaxis are subject to change. Up-to-date recommendations should be obtained in consultation with local and state health departments and CDC. Prophylaxis should be initiated upon confirmation of an anthrax exposure (Table 1).4/13/99 14Table 1. Recommended post-exposure prophylaxis for exposure Antimicrobial agent following: Ciprofloxacin Levofloxacin Ofloxacin500 mg twice daily 500 mg once daily 400 mg twice daily20-30 mg per kg of body mass daily, divided into two doses Not recommended Not recommended If fluoroquinolones are not available or are contraindicated Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily 5 mg per kg of body mass per day divided into two doses \u00a7 Pediatric use of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines is associated with adverse effects that must be weighed against the risk of developing a lethal disease. If B. anthracis exposure is confirmed, the organism must be tested for penicillin susceptibility. If susceptible, exposed children may be treated with oral amoxicillin 40mg per kg of body mass per day divided every 8 hours (not toexceed 500mg, three times daily). Prophylaxis should continue until B. anthracis exposure has been excluded. If exposure is confirmed, prophylaxis should continue for 8 weeks. In addition to prophylaxis, post-exposureimmunization with an inactivated, cell-free anthrax vaccine is also indicated following anthraxexposure. If available, post-exposure vaccination consists of three doses of vaccine at 0, 2 and 4 weeks after exposure. With vaccination, post-exposure antimicrobial prophylaxis can be reduced to 4 weeks. 1 c. Triage and management of large scale exposures / potential exposures Advance planning should include identification of: Sources of prophylactic antibiotics and planning for acquisition on short notice. Locations, personnel needs and protocols for administering prophylactic post-exposure care to large numbers of potentially exposed individuals. Means for providing telephone follow-up information and other public communications services. Intensive care unit managers will need to consider in advance: How limited numbers of ventilators will be distributed in the event of a large number of patients arriving with abrupt pulmonary decompensation. How additional ventilators can be obtained.4/13/99 15In the event of severely limited ventilator availability, whether and when ventilator support will be discontinued for a terminally ill individual.3,10,11 See Section I for additional general details regarding planning for large-scale patient management. 5. Laboratory Support and Confirmation Diagnosis of anthrax is confirmed by aerobic culture performed in a BSL -2 laboratory.1 a. Diagnostic samples Diagnostic samples to obtain include: Blood cultures. Acute serum for frozen storage. Stool culture if gastrointestinal disease is suspected. b. Laboratory selection Handling of clinical specimens should be coordinated with local and state health departments, and undertaken in BSL -2 or -3 laboratories. The FBI will coordinate collection of evidence and delivery of forensic specimens to FBI or Department of Defense laboratories.c. Transport requirements Specimen packaging and transport must be coordinated with local and state health departments, and the FBI. A chain of custody document should accompany the specimen from the moment of collection. For specific instructions, contact the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100 . Advance planning may include identification of appropriate packaging materials and transport media in collaboration with the clinical laboratory at individual facilities. 6. Patient, Visitor, and Public Information Fact sheets for distribution should be prepared, including explanation that people recently exposed to B. anthracis are not contagious, and antibiotics are available for prophylactic therapy along with the anthrax vaccine. Dosing information and potential side effects should be explained clearly. Decontamination procedures, i.e., showering thoroughly with soap and water;and environmental cleaning, i.e., with 0.5% hypochlorite solution (one part household bleach added to nine parts water), can be described.4/13/99 16B. Botulism 1. Description of Agent / Syndrome a. Etiology Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic gram-positive bacillus that produces a potent neurotoxin, botulinum toxin. In humans, botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine, resulting in characteristic flaccid paralysis. C. botulinum produces spores that are present in soil and marine sediment throughout the world. Foodborne botulism is the most common form ofdisease in adults. An inhalational form of botulism is also possible 13. Botulinum toxin exposure may occur in both forms as agents of bioterrorism. b. Clinical features Foodborne botulism is accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Inhalational botulism and foodborne botulism are likely to share other symptoms including: Responsive patient with absence of fever. Symmetric cranial neuropathies (drooping eyelids, weakened jaw clench, difficulty swallowing or speaking). Blurred vision and diplopia due to extra-ocular muscle palsies. Symmetric descending weakness in a proximal to distal pattern (paralysis of arms first, followed by respiratory muscles, then legs). Respiratory dysfunction from respiratory muscle paralysis or upper airway obstruction due to weakened glottis. No sensory deficits. c. Mode of transmission Botulinum toxin is generally transmitted by ingestion of toxin-contaminated food6. Aerosolization of botulinum toxin has been described and may be a mechanism for bioterrorismexposure 11. d. Incubation period Neurologic symptoms of foodborne botulism begin 12 - 36 hours after ingestion. Neurologic symptoms of inhalational botulism begin 24- 72 hours after aerosol exposure. e. Period of communicability Botulism is not transmitted from person to person.10 2. Preventive Measuresa. Vaccine availability A pentavalent toxoid vaccine has been developed by the Department of Defense. This vaccine is available as an investigational new drug (contact USAMRIID, 301/619-2833).Completion of a recommended schedule (0, 2, 12 weeks) has been shown to induce protectiveantitoxin levels detectable at 1-year post vaccination. b. Immunization recommendations Routine immunization of the public, including healthcare workers, is not recommended. 11 3. Infection Control Practices for Patient Management Symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed botulism should be managed according to current guidelines.14 Recommendations for therapy are beyond the scope of this document. For up-to-date information and recommendations for therapy, contact CDC or statehealth department.4/13/99 17a. Isolation precautions Standard Precautions are used for the care of patients with botulism. b. Patient placement Patient-to-patient transmission of botulism does not occur. Patient room selection and care should be consistent with facility policy. c. Patient transport Standard Precautions should be used for transport and movement of patients with botulism.d. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and environment Principles of Standard Precautions should be generally applied to the management of patient-care equipment and environmental control (see Section I for more detail).e. Discharge management No special discharge instructions are indicated. f. Post-mortem care Standard Precautions should be used for post-mortem care. 5 4. Post Exposure Management Suspicion of even single cases of botulism should immediately raise concerns of an outbreak potentially associated with shared contaminated food. In collaboration with CDC andlocal /state health departments, attempts should be made to locate the contaminated food sourceand identify other persons who may have been exposed. 13 Any individuals suspected to have been exposed to botulinum toxin should be carefully monitored for evidence of respiratory compromise.14 a. Decontamination of patients / environment Contamination with botulinum toxin does not place persons at risk for dermal exposure or risk associated with re-aerosolization. Therefore, decontamination of patients is not required. b. Prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization Trivalent botulinum antitoxin is available by contacting state health departments or by contacting CDC (404/639-2206 during office hours, 404/639-2888 after hours). This horse serum product has a <9% percent rate of hypersensitivity reactions. Skin testing should be performed according to the package insert prior to administration.14 c. Triage and management of large scale exposures / potential exposures Patients affected by botulinum toxin are at risk for respiratory dysfunction that may necessitate mechanical ventilation. Ventilatory support is required, on average, for 2 to 3 months before neuromuscular recovery allows unassisted breathing. Large-scale exposures to botulinumtoxin may overwhelm an institution's available resources for mechanical ventilation. Sources ofauxiliary support and means to transport patients to auxiliary sites, if necessary should be planned in advance with coordination among neighboring facilities. 6,10 See Section I for additional general details regarding planning for large-scale patient management. 5. Laboratory Support and Confirmation a. Obtaining diagnostic samples Routine laboratory tests are of limited value in the diagnosis of botulism. Detection of toxin is possible from serum, stool samples, or gastric secretions. For advice regarding the4/13/99 18appropriate diagnostic specimens to obtain, contact state health authorities or CDC (Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch, 404/639-2888). b. Laboratory selection Handling of clinical specimens should be coordinated with local and state health departments. The FBI will coordinate collection of evidence and delivery of forensic specimens to FBI or Department of Defense laboratories. c. Transport requirements Specimen packaging and transport must be coordinated with local and state health departments, and the FBI. A chain of custody document should accompany the specimen from the moment of collection. For specific instructions, contact the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100 . Advance planning may include identification of appropriate packaging materials and transport media in collaborationwith the clinical laboratory at individual facilities. 6. Patient, Visitor, and Public Information Fact sheets for distribution should be prepared, including explanation that people exposed to botulinum toxin are not contagious. A clear description of symptoms including blurred vision, drooping eyelids, and shortness of breath should be provided with instructions to report for evaluation and care if such symptoms develop.4/13/99 19C. Plague 1.Description of Agent / Syndrome a. Etiology Plague is an acute bacterial disease caused by the gram-negative bacillus Yersinia pestis, which is usually transmitted by infected fleas, resulting in lymphatic and blood infections (bubonic and septicemia plague). A bioterrorism-related outbreak may be expected to beairborne, causing a pulmonary variant, pneumonic plague. 3,10 b. Clinical features Clinical features of pneumonic plague include: Fever, cough, chest pain. Hemoptysis. Muco-purulent or watery sputum with gram-negative rods on gram stain. Radiographic evidence of bronchopneumonia.10 c. Modes of transmission Plague is normally transmitted from an infected rodent to man by infected fleas. Bioterrorism-related outbreaks are likely to be transmitted through dispersion of an aerosol. Person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague is possible via large aerosol droplets.6 d. Incubation period The incubation period for plague is normally 2 - 8 days if due to fleaborne transmission. The incubation period may be shorter for pulmonary exposure (1-3 days).10 e. Period of communicability Patients with pneumonic plague may have coughs productive of infectious particle droplets. Droplet precautions, including the use of a mask for patient care, should beimplemented until the patient has completed 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. 3,6 2.Preventive Measures a. Vaccine availability Formalin-killed vaccine exists for bubonic plague, but has not been proven to be effective for pneumonic plague. It is not currently available in the United States. b. Immunization recommendations Routine vaccination requires multiple doses given over several weeks and is not recommended for the general population.3 Post-exposure immunization has no utility. 3.Infection Control Practices for Patient Management Symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed plague should be managed according to current guidelines. Recommendations for specific therapy are beyond the scope of this document. For up-to-date information and recommendations for therapy, contact CDC or state health department.a. Isolation precautions For pneumonic plague, Droplet Precautions should be used in addition to Standard Precautions. Droplet Precautions are used for patients known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by large particle droplets, generally larger than 5 in size,4/13/99 20that can be generated by the infected patient during coughing, sneezing, talking, or during respiratory-care procedures. Droplet Precautions require healthcare providers and others to wear a surgical-type mask when within 3 feet of the infected patient. Based on local policy, some healthcarefacilities require a mask be worn to enter the room of a patient on Droplet Precautions. Droplet Precautions should be maintained until patient has completed 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy. b. Patient placement Patients suspected or confirmed to have pneumonic plague require Droplet Precautions. Patient placement recommendations for Droplet Precautions include: Placing infected patient in a private room. Cohort in symptomatic patients with similar symptoms and the same presumptive diagnosis (i.e. pneumonic plague) when private rooms are not available. Maintaining spatial separation of at least 3 feet between infected patients and others when cohorting is not achievable. Avoiding placement of patient requiring Droplet Precautions in the same room with an immunocompromised patient. Special air handling is not necessary and doors may remain open. c. Patient transport Limit the movement and transport of patients on Droplet Precautions to essential medical purposes only. Minimize dispersal of droplets by placing a surgical-type mask on the patient when transport is necessary. 5,6 d. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and environment Principles of Standard Precautions should be generally applied to the management of patient-care equipment and for environmental control (see Section I for more detail).5 e. Discharge management Generally, patients with pneumonic plague would not be discharged from a healthcare facility until no longer infectious (completion of 72 hours of antimicrobial therapy) and wouldrequire no special discharge instructions. In the event of a large bioterrorism exposure withpatients receiving care in their homes, home care providers should be taught to use Standard and Droplet Precautions for all patient care. f. Post-mortem care Standard Precautions and Droplet Precautions should be used for post-mortem care. 5 4. Post Exposure Management a. Decontamination of patients / environment The risk for re-aerosolization of Y. pestis from the contaminated clothing of exposed persons is low. In situations where there may have been gross exposure to Y. pestis , decontamination of skin and potentially contaminated fomites (e.g. clothing or environmental surfaces) may be considered to reduce the risk for cutaneous or bubonic forms of the disease.3 The plan for decontaminating patients may include: Instructing patients to remove contaminated clothing and storing in labeled, plastic bags. Handling clothing minimally to avoid agitation. Instructing to patients to shower thoroughly with soap and water (and providing assistance if necessary).4/13/99 21Instructing personnel regarding Standard Precautions and wearing appropriate barriers (e.g. gloves, gown, face shield) when handling contaminated clothing or other contaminated fomites. Performing environmental surface decontamination using an EPA-registered, facility- approved sporicidal/germicidal agent or 0.5% hypochlorite solution (one part household bleach added to nine parts water).5,6 b. Prophylaxis Recommendations for prophylaxis are subject to change. Up-to-date recommendations should be obtained in consultation with local and state health departments and CDC. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated following confirmed or suspected bioterrorism Y. pestis exposure, and for post-exposure management of healthcare workers and others who had unprotected face-to-face contact with symptomatic patients (Table 2). Table 2. Recommended post-exposure prophylaxis for exposure to Yersinia pestis. Antimicrobial agent Adults Children \u00a7 First choice Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily 5 mg per kg of body mass per day divided into two doses 2nd choice Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily 20-30 mg per kg of body mass daily, divided into two doses \u00a7 Pediatric use of tetracyclines and flouroquinolones is associated with adverse effects that mustbe weighed against the risk of developing a lethal disease. Prophylaxis should continue for 7 days after last known or suspected Y. pestis exposure, or until exposure has been excluded.10 Facilities should ensure that policies are in place to identify and manage health care workers exposed to infectious patients. In general, maintenance of accurate occupational healthrecords will facilitate identification, contact, assessment, and delivery of post-exposure care topotentially exposed healthcare workers 3,11,12 c. Triage and management of large scale exposures / potential exposures Advance planning should include identification of sources for appropriate masks to facilitate adherence to Droplet Precautions for potentially large numbers of patients and staff.Instruction and reiteration of requirements for Droplet Precautions (as opposed to Airborne Precautions) will be necessary to promote compliance and minimize fear and panic related to an aerosol exposure.4/13/99 22Advance planning should also include identification of: Sources of bulk prophylactic antibiotics and planning for acquisition on short notice. Locations, personnel needs and protocols for administering prophylactic post- exposure care to large numbers of potentially exposed individuals. Means for providing telephone follow-up information and other public communications services. See Section I for additional general details regarding planning for large-scale patient management. 5. Laboratory Support and Confirmation Laboratory confirmation of plague is by standard microbiologic culture, but slow growth and misidentification in automated systems are likely to delay diagnosis. For decisions regarding obtaining and processing diagnostic specimens, contact state laboratory authorities or CDC.a. Diagnostic samples Diagnostic samples to obtain include: Serum for capsular antigen testing. Blood tracheal aspirates for culture. b. Laboratory selection Handling of clinical specimens should be coordinated with local and state health departments, and undertaken in Bio-Safety Level (BSL) -2 or -3 laboratories. 3 The FBI will coordinate collection of evidence and delivery of forensic specimens to FBI or Department ofDefense laboratories. c. Transport requirements Specimen packaging and transport must be coordinated with local and state health departments, and the FBI. A chain of custody document should accompany the specimen from the moment of collection. For specific instructions, contact the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100 . Advance planning may include identification of appropriate packaging materials and transport media in collaborationwith the clinical laboratory at individual facilities. 6.Patient, Visitor, and Public Information Fact sheets for distribution should be prepared, including a clear description of Droplet Precautions, symptoms of plague, and instructions to report for evaluation and care if suchsymptoms are recognized. The difference between prophylactic antimicrobial therapy and treatment of an actual infection should be clarified. Decontamination by showering thoroughly with soap and water can be recommended.4/13/99 23D. Smallpox 1.Description of Agent / Syndrome a. Etiology Smallpox is an acute viral illness caused by the variola virus.11 Smallpox is a bioterrorism threat due to its potential to cause severe morbidity in a nonimmune population and because it can be transmitted via the airborne route.10 A single case is considered a public health emergency.b. Clinical features Acute clinical symptoms of smallpox resemble other acute viral illnesses, such as influenza. Skin lesions appear, quickly progressing from macules to papules to vesicles. Otherclinical symptoms to aid in identification of smallpox include: 2-4 day, non-specific prodrome of fever, myalgias. rash most prominent on face and extremities (including palms and soles) in contrast to the truncal distribution of varicella. rash scabs over in 1-2 weeks . In contrast to the rash of varicella, which arises in \"crops,\" variola rash has a synchronous onset . 10 c. Mode of transmission Smallpox is transmitted via both large and small respiratory droplets. Patient-to-patient transmission is likely from airborne and droplet exposure, and by contact with skin lesions or secretions. Patients are considered more infectious if coughing or if they have a hemorrhagic form of smallpox.d. Incubation period The incubation period for smallpox is 7-17 days; the average is 12 days. e. Period of communicability Unlike varicella, which is contagious before the rash is apparent, patients with smallpox become infectious at the onset of the rash and remain infectious until their scabs separate(approximately 3 weeks). 6,10 2.Preventive Measures a. Vaccine availability A live-virus intradermal vaccination is available for the prevention of smallpox.12 b. Immunization recommendations Since the last naturally acquired case of smallpox in the world occurred more than 20 years ago, routine public vaccination has not been recommended.3Vaccination against smallpox does not reliably confer lifelong immunity. Even previously vaccinated persons should be considered susceptible to smallpox. 3.Infection Control Practices for Patient Management Symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed smallpox should be managed according to current guidelines. Recommendations for specific therapy are beyond the scope of this document. For up-to-date information and recommendations for therapy, contact the CDCor state health department.a. Isolation precautions4/13/99 24For patients with suspected or confirmed smallpox, both Airborne and Contact Precautions should be used in addition to Standard Precautions. Airborne Precautions are used for patients known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei (small particle residue, 5 or smaller in size) of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that can remain suspended in air and can be widely dispersed by air currents. Airborne Precautions require healthcare providers and others to wear respiratory protection when entering the patient room. (Appropriate respiratory protection is based on facility selection policy; must meet the minimal NIOSH standard for particulaterespirators, N95). 5,15 Contact Precautions are used for patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important organisms that can be transmitted by direct contactwith the patient or indirect contact with potentially contaminated surfaces in the patient'scare area. Contact precautions require healthcare providers and others to: Wear clean gloves upon entry into patient room. Wear gown for all patient contact and for all contact with the patient's environment. Based on local policy, some healthcare facilities require a gown be worn to enter theroom of a patient on Contact Precautions. Gown must be removed before leaving thepatient's room. Wash hands using an antimicrobial agent. b. Patient placement Patients suspected or confirmed with smallpox require placement in rooms that meet the ventilation and engineering requirements for Airborne Precautions, which include: Monitored negative air pressure in relation to the corridor and surrounding areas. 6 - 12 air exchanges per hour. Appropriate discharge of air to the outdoors, or monitored high efficiency filtration of air prior to circulation to other areas in the healthcare facility. A door that must remain closed. Healthcare facilities without patient rooms appropriate for the isolation and care required for Airborne Precautions should have a plan for transfer of suspected orconfirmed smallpox patients to neighboring facilities with appropriate isolation rooms. Patient placement in a private room is preferred. However, in the event of a large outbreak, patients who have active infections with the same disease (i.e., smallpox) may becohorted in rooms that meet appropriate ventilation and airflow requirements for AirbornePrecautions. 5,6 c. Patient transport Limit the movement and transport of patients with suspected or confirmed smallpox to essential medical purposes only. When transport is necessary, minimize the dispersal of respiratory droplets by placing a mask on the patient, if possible5 d. Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of equipment and environment A component of Contact Precautions is careful management of potentially contaminated equipment and environmental surfaces. When possible, noncritical patient care equipment should be dedicated to a single patient (or cohort of patients with the same illness).4/13/99 25If use of common items is unavoidable, all potentially contaminated, reusable equipment should not be used for the care of another patient until it has been appropriately cleaned and reprocessed. Policies should be in place and monitored for compliance. 5 e. Discharge management In general, patients with smallpox will not be discharged from a healthcare facility until determined they are no longer infectious. Therefore, no special discharge instructions are required.f. Post-mortem care Airborne and Contact Precautions should be used for post-mortem care. 5 4. Post Exposure Management a. Decontamination of patients / environment Patient decontamination after exposure to smallpox is not indicated. Items potentially contaminated by infectious lesions should be handled using Contact Precautions.6 b. Prophylaxis and post-exposure immunization Recommendations for prophylaxis are subject to change. Up-to-date recommendations should be obtained in consultation with local and state health departments and CDC. Post-exposure immunization with smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) is available and effective. Vaccination alone is recommended if given within 3 days of exposure. Passive immunization is also available in the form of vaccinia immune-globulin (VIG) (0.6ml/kg IM). Ifgreater than 3 days has elapsed since exposure, both vaccination and VIG are recommended. 12 VIG is maintained at USAMRIID, 301/619-2833.10 11 Vaccination is generally contraindicated in pregnant women, and persons with immunosuppression, HIV-infection, and eczema, who are at risk for disseminated vacciniadisease. However, the risk of smallpox vaccination should be weighed against the likelihood fordeveloping smallpox following a known exposure. VIG should be given concomitantly with vaccination in these patients. 11 Following prophylactic care, exposed individuals should be instructed to monitor themselves for development of flu-like symptoms or rash during the incubation period (i.e., for 7to 17 days after exposure) and immediately report to designated care sites selected to minimize the risk of exposure to others. Facilities should ensure that policies are in place to identify and manage health care workers exposed to infectious patients. In general, maintenance of accurate occupational healthrecords will facilitate identification, contact, assessment, and delivery of post-exposure care to potentially exposed healthcare workers. c. Triage and management of large scale exposures / potential exposures Advance planning must involve IC professionals in cooperation with building engineering staff, to identify sites within the facility that can provide necessary parameters for Airborne Precautions. See Section I for additional general details regarding planning for large-scale patient management. 5.Laboratory Support and Confirmation a. Diagnostic samples to obtain4/13/99 26For decisions regarding obtaining and processing diagnostic specimens, contact state laboratory authorities or CDC. b. Laboratory selection Handling of clinical specimens must be coordinated with state health departments, CDC, and USAMRIID. Testing can be performed only in BSL - 4 laboratories.11 The FBI will coordinate collection of evidence and delivery of forensic specimens to FBI or Department of Defense laboratories.d. Transport requirements Specimen packaging and transport must be coordinated with local and state health departments, and the FBI. A chain of custody document should accompany the specimen from the moment of collection. For specific instructions, contact the Bioterrorism Emergency Number at the CDC Emergency Response Office, 770/488-7100 . Advance planning may include identification of appropriate packaging materials and transport media in collaboration with the clinical laboratory at individual facilities. 6. Patient, Visitor, and Public Information Fact sheets for distribution should be prepared, including a clear description of symptoms and where to report for evaluation and care if such symptoms are recognized. Details about the type and duration of isolation should be provided. Vaccination information that details whoshould receive the vaccine and possible side effects should be provided. Extreme measures suchas burning or boiling potentially exposed materials should be discouraged.4/13/99 27Reference List 1. Anonymous.
