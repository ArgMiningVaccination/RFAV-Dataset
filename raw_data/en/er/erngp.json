To help you decide, we've reviewed the top natural adderall replacements on the market. Each supplement below was evaluated on a variety of factors including benefits, ingredients, price, and reviews. Whether you have ADHD or just want to unlock 100% brain power, here are the best brain boosting supplements of 2023. 10 Best Natural Adderall Alternatives [Vyvamind](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/vyvamind): Best natural alternative to prescription ADHD medication [Noocube](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/noocube-adderall-dallas): Best for students, learning, creativity, and problem-solving skills [Nooceptin](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/nooceptin): Best adderall replacement for memory, brain cell regeneration, and anxiety [Mind Lab Pro](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/mindlabpro): Best all-in-one nootropic formula to improve cognitive function [Hunter Focus](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/hunterfocus): Best for entrepreneurs and high-performing professionals - Bacopa Monnieri - L-Theanine - Ginkgo Biloba - Top OTC Natural Adderall Alternatives #1. [Vyvamind](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/vyvamind): Best Adderall Alternative Overall Vyvamind is a new addition to most lists of the best Adderall substitutes, but it is steadily climbing the rankings due to its potency, reliability and safety profile. Vvyamind was created to mimic the main beneficial effects of smart drugs and ADHD medications but without the side effects or addiction risks. The result is an effective natural adderall alternative which provides the mental energy boost of a potent caffeine pill with the cognitive enhancement and motivation support of a daily nootropic. It seems to be working already, with some customers referring to Vyvamind as \"natural Vyvanse\" albeit unofficially. Vyvamind Benefits By combining a handful of carefully selected, clinically proven nootropics, [Vyvamind is able to improve cognitive function](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/vyvamind), making you more focused and productive. The benefits you can expect from taking Vyvamind include: - Increased attention span - Intense focus - Help getting into a 'flow state' - Increased brain energy and less mental tiredness - Increased alertness - Reduced need to sleep - Faster processing speeds How Vyvamind Works Vyvamind gets to work immediately, launching a multi-pronged attack against low motivation, distractedness and brain fog. The ingredients have been selected and dosed in such a way as to produce broad improvements in cognitive function, with a particular focus on boosting concentration and mental stamina. The main mechanism of action of Vyvamind is neurotransmitter manipulation. Specifically, the ingredients in Vyvamind quickly increase the production of two key neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine is responsible for executive cognitive functions (speech, working memory, information processing, reactions, etc) while dopamine is largely responsible for motivating behavior (as well as supporting a positive mood and confidence). While it is stimulating neurotransmitter production, Vyvamind also dramatically increases mental energy with its precision dose of caffeine anhydrous. This caffeine dose is combined with a generous serving of theanine to help control side effects, reduce anxiety and prevent \"burnout\". All of this is backed up with comprehensive brain health support and help with natural stress management to keep you functioning at 100% over long periods of time. Vyvamind Formula Overview Let's take a look at the brain pill ingredients in Vyvamind and how they work: Citicoline: Arguably the most effective cholinergic in existence, Citicoline quickly raises acetylcholine levels in the brain. This increases focus, concentration, and learning ability. Tyrosine: Taking this amino acid has been found to significantly increase dopamine levels, boosting motivation and enhancing overall cognition. Theanine: Found in abundance in tea, Theanine is a potent nootropic which eliminates brain fog, reduces anxiety and suppresses the side effects of caffeine while making the stimulant stronger at the same time. Caffeine: This Vyvamind ingredient needs no introduction. Caffeine is probably the strongest natural stimulant used as a supplement today. Taking just 75mg can eliminate fatigue, heighten alertness and sharpen focus. B6: Vitamin B6 is an essential nutrient required for the synthesis of dopamine, healthy energy metabolism in brain cells, and more. B6 deficiencies are linked to higher incidences of ADHD. B12: Vitamin B12 is another vital B vitamin. It is used in many nootropics because it increases mental energy and helps maintain healthy neurons. When to Take Vyvamind We think Vyvamind is best for people in need of a sharp increase in focus, motivation and mental energy and less suitable for people looking for a daily brain health supplement. We recommend taking Vyvamind when you know you need to be mentally switched on and 'locked in' on your work for 6-8 hours. For best results, take Vyvamind first thing in the morning with a full glass of water, orange juice, or tea. It is not advised to take Vyvamind with a heavily caffeinated drink. Taking Vyvamind with or immediately after breakfast should make it less powerful initially but also longer lasting. - Natural OTC adderall alternative with rave reviews - Great substitute for prescription medication for treating ADHD - Natural ingredients with no known adverse effects - One of the best brain supplements for high-performing adults - Discounts when buying more than 1 bottle [Click Here for the Lowest Price on Vyvamind](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/vyvamind) #2.

[Mind Lab Pro](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/mindlabpro): Good Alternative to Prescription Medication for ADHD Mind Lab Pro ranks at the top of nearly all best Adderall alternatives lists because of its top-notch potency, clean ingredients list, and extensive clinical research. If other natural alternatives didn't work for you in the past, then you should consider Mind Lab Pro's incredibly strong cognitive performance formula. As-yet-unpublished [ independent research](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/school-biomedical-sciences/staff/150/dr-andrea-utley) by Dr. Andrea Utley at Leeds University with placebo-controlled, double-blind trials demonstrated that this natural alternative isn't a hoax but instead showed promising results, especially for older participants in the clinical trials. If the research doesn't say enough, consider the company's impressive sales and reviews. You'll find a handful of real reviews on the [official website](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/mindlabpro) speaking for the millions of bottles sold across six continents. The product has over 2,000 ratings, averaging approximately 4.5 out of five stars. Mind Lab Pro Benefits Each Adderall alternative on our list offers varying advantages, so let's look at what you can expect when taking Mind Lab Pro: - Improved concentration for long periods - Better memory retention rates - Sharpened mental clarity and verbal fluidity - Elongated mental strength with brain cell regeneration - Improved creativity and confidence - Stronger mental agility - Faster thinking skills - Heightened moods and energy levels - Better processing and critical thinking abilities - Reduced hyperactivity inside your brain so you can feel calm How Mind Lab Pro Works Traditional nootropics, or \"smart drugs,\" target only a few different brain areas to improve the overall cognitive function of each. Mind Lab Pro heightens this concept by unlocking cognitive benefits for your entire mind. Rather than just helping with memory retention or brain fog, this Adderall alternative moves beyond the self-limited formula and provides a natural pathway to all-encompassing improved brain health. The formula strategy relies on 11 clinically dosed natural nootropics that optimize six brain pathways and four mental performance areas. Brain energy, chemicals, blood flow, alpha brain waves, neuroprotection, and neurodegeneration pathways allow the nootropics to boost memory, performance, mindset, and structural areas. To prove this theory, the soon-to-be published [ University of Leeds study](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/school-biomedical-sciences/staff/150/dr-andrea-utley) researched a group of 105 people for 30 days, with one group taking a placebo and the experimental group taking the nootropic formula. Researchers compared pre and post scores on simple and choice reaction time and anticipation. Mind Lab Pro Formula Overview Often, alternatives to Adderall use harsh chemicals that harm your health.

How Hunter Focus Works Your brain powers everything you do, so it's no surprise that it uses nearly 20% of your body's energy and oxygen. Different herbs, minerals, amino acids, and nutrients supply your brain with the blood flow and power it needs to function properly. If you miss out on these nutrients due to a poor diet, environmental stresses, or chemical imbalances, then you may struggle with decreased cognitive function. Hunter Focus works by supplying your mind with the necessary building blocks for paving stronger brain signal pathways.

[Click Here For The Best Price On Nooceptin.](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/nooceptin) What Is Adderall? Adderall is a synthetic drug, classified as an amphetamine, that doctors use mainly to treat ADHD. It alters your brain chemistry by stimulating the central nervous system. The drug's main goal is to balance certain chemicals in the brain that cause poor attention spans when hyperactive. The theory behind this drug is sound, though it doesn't work for everyone. Some enjoy excellent results, but many still struggle with symptoms, which is why companies discovered the need for natural alternatives to Adderall. Even when Adderall works, it comes with negative side effects, including: Tolerance build-ups: Like many other prescription medications, you can easily gain a tolerance to Adderall, making it harder to find relief. Due to this effect, some find themselves with even worse symptoms than before they started. You might feel increasingly distracted and exhausted any time you don't take the medication. Sleep deprivation: Many Adderall users report issues with falling and staying asleep each night. Since the drug keeps your mind alert, it's hard to wind down at the end of the day. Skewed hunger cues: Decreased appetite is another main side effect of Adderall, causing many who take the drug to suffer a lack of interest in food, potentially causing unfulfilled nutritional needs. Addictions: Younger adults frequently struggle with Adderall addiction due to the associated dopamine releases. Weaning oneself off the drug is challenging since it alters your brain's chemical makeup. When considering the pros and cons of Adderall, you must remember that everyone with ADHD suffers from different levels of symptoms. People with extreme cases likely benefit from the prescription drug rather than a natural supplement, though people with minor symptoms might feel better taking natural Adderall replacements.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a brain condition that causes hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsive behaviors. Some believe abnormal catecholamine levels cause the inherited condition, though this isn't confirmed. Catecholamines are different neurotransmitters, like norepinephrine, dopamine, and epinephrine, that control how the brain thinks. Without proper regulations, your brain can't balance the hormones in charge of sleep cycles, concentration abilities, motivation, fulfillment sensations, mental acuity, reaction times, and more. Such imbalances align with ADHD symptoms, which is why many link abnormal catecholamine levels with the disorder. Natural alternatives to Adderall can resolve ADHD symptoms by including ingredients that help your body regulate catecholamine levels. Prescription Adderall can do the same, though long-term usage frequently causes adverse results. With the substitutes, most people can continuously follow the dosage schedule long-term to treat your condition without gaining a tolerance or suffering negative symptoms. Natural OTC Adderall Alternatives that Improve Brain Function Citicoline Citicoline, a.k.a. cytidine diphosphate-choline or CDP-choline, is a naturally occurring brain chemical that increases acetylcholine (ACh) levels. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter responsible for many physiological processes, including learning and memory. Alzheimer's patients suffer from disrupted acetylcholine function, while people with ADHD typically have lower-than-average ACh levels. Thanks to its ability to boost acetylcholine levels, Citicoline is one of the most popular natural Adderall alternatives on the market. However, it's important to choose a quality supplement since product efficiency may vary between brands. L-Tyrosine L-tyrosine is a common amino acid in various foods like meat, eggs, and dairy products. As a protein building block, L-tyrosine contributes to the production of vital neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine. Norepinephrine acts as a vasoconstrictor and boosts alertness. Dopamine regulates moods by activating the brain's \"reward center\" and plays an important role in memory and spatial learning. Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels strongly correlate with ADHD. It's often difficult to get enough L-tyrosine from the diet alone, so people who struggle with ADHD may benefit from taking an L-tyrosine supplement to boost the production of norepinephrine and dopamine. Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba, a traditional Chinese herbal supplement, can [ boost cerebral blood flow](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163160/) (CBF), which suggests that this ancient remedy may also improve cognitive function. Additionally, Ginkgo biloba is a powerful antioxidant, which may protect the brain from oxidative stress. A randomized, placebo-controlled [ study discovered](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25925875/) that Ginkgo biloba might help combat ADHD effects in children as a supplemental treatment. People who use Ginkgo may have to wait several weeks until they feel its full beneficial effect. Since Ginkgo is a safe, natural supplement, it's worth trying if you're looking for natural supplements to replace adderall. Mineral Supplements (Zinc, Magnesium, Iron) Mineral deficiencies may interfere with cognitive functions, memory, and concentration. Clinical studies revealed that zinc levels [ could be lower](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34272450/) in people with ADHD, while iron supplementation [ may benefit](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34690126/) children with ADHD who receive methylphenidate treatment. Low magnesium levels also correlate with ADHD. Some [ research shows](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110863016300283) that magnesium deficiency may reduce attention span and cause irritability, while other studies suggest that a higher level of magnesium in the brain [ improves memory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20152124/). Since excessively high mineral levels may be toxic, it's important to use discernment when choosing and/or combining supplements. A simple blood test can help uncover any existing mineral deficiencies. B Vitamins Vitamins of the B group serve as coenzymes in many vital biological processes, from energy metabolism to brain health. Clinical studies have linked vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, to mood regulation and alertness, while low levels of this essential vitamin may cause anxiety and irritability. B6 coupled with magnesium may [ help combat hyper-excitability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15466962/) in children. [Other studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750573.2018.1459005) suggest that a supplement of vitamin B12 combined with iron may help treat ADHD symptoms and learning difficulties. B vitamins naturally occur in many foods, including fish, spinach, and bananas. Vitamin B12 appears almost exclusively in animal-based products. A balanced supplement may ensure optimal levels of these essential vitamins. Methionine Methionine, an essential amino acid, participates in fat breakdown, glutathione production, and other crucial cellular functions. Some [ research suggests](https://molecularneurodegeneration.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13024-015-0057-0) that methionine may enhance memory recall and reduce depression. While methionine may convert to homocysteine, an amino acid that correlates with heart disease, most healthy people shouldn't worry about their methionine levels or limit methionine-containing foods. Many foods, including nuts, seeds, meat, seafood, egg whites, and other animal protein sources, are abundant in methionine. Incorporating these foods into a healthy, balanced diet should provide enough methionine for most people's needs without taking extra supplements. GABA GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an amino acid that acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA decreases nervous system activity, which induces a calming, soothing effect and reduces stress, fear, and anxiety. Reduced GABA concentration [ corresponds with](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3970207/#:~:text=GABAergic%20inhibition%20is%20implicated%20in,excitatory%20in%20the%20developing%20brain.) developmental disorders like autism and ADHD, mood disorders, and anxiety. GABA derives from glutamate, an amino acid that commonly appears in many high-protein foods. However, direct sources of GABA in the diet are rare, so many people try an OTC GABA supplement to relieve stress and boost cognitive function. Since GABA is a naturally occurring amino acid, supplements are usually safe and may benefit people interested in natural Adderall alternatives. Caffeine Caffeine, one of the longest-used and most popular CNS stimulants in the world, is famous for its ability to boost alertness and improve concentration. The coffee bean's powerful energizing and focus-restorative properties make it one of the most effective natural alternatives to Adderall. Caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor, antagonizes sleep-inducing adenosine receptors, and promotes brain function by stimulating calcium release from cells. Most American adults have at least one cup of coffee throughout the day. Many OTC supplements also contain caffeine for an energy boost. However, excess caffeine may cause restlessness and insomnia, so it's best to stop consuming caffeine at least six hours before bedtime. L-Theanine L-theanine, an amino acid, occurs naturally in green tea and may account for some of this healthy drink's beneficial properties. L-theanine may help reduce stress, improve mood, and contribute to improved brain health. An L-theanine supplement is the perfect partner for caffeine. While caffeine stimulates the CNS, L-theanine acts as a relaxant, which can counterbalance caffeine's side effects of nervousness, restlessness, and sleep disruption. A [ double-blind study](https://brain.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/18681988/The_combined_effects_of_L_theanine_and_caffeine_on_cognitive_performance_and_mood_) found that combining caffeine and L-theanine improved alertness and accuracy in participants who performed attention and memory tasks. Since caffeine and L-theanine are natural, safe, and easily available, using both makes sense for people living with ADHD. Rhodiola Rosea Rhodiola rosea, a cold-climate perennial native to northern mountainous areas, is a traditional medicinal herb. Rhodiola rosea contains active ingredients that can act as stress adaptogens. For centuries, people in Scandinavia and Russia have used Rhodiola rosea, a.k.a. golden root, to treat anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Several studies have placed Rhodiola rosea on the list of non-pharmacological ADHD treatments. [ Research suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4968082/) that Rhodiola rosea may have a stimulating and emotionally calming effect that can alleviate ADHD symptoms. As a safe plant-based supplement, Rhodiola rosea may be an excellent choice for people looking to try natural Adderall alternatives. How We Ranked the Best Adderall Alternatives If you search online for Adderall alternatives, you'll find an influx of fake, unsafe products, making unattainable claims. So, how did we select the best Adderall alternatives for this list? We analyzed each competitor's ingredient quality, dosages, reviews, pricing, shipping costs, and refund policies. Ingredient Quality The main reasons anyone selects natural supplements rather than prescription drugs are for the clean ingredients and reduced side effects.

Many scam companies use fake reviews to appear authentic, so finding who to trust isn't easy. After thorough research, we determined that all the contenders on this list offered real reviews from people who tried the product. The overall ratings display overwhelmingly positive reactions from large groups of people. Price and Shipping Price is a huge factor for anyone. Your mind is critical, though you don't want to destroy your budget when purchasing a supplement. Unfortunately, the cheapest options use inadequate ingredients and unsafe manufacturing practices. We narrowed our list to companies offering affordable but realistic prices. Many of these manufacturers provide free shipping on large orders and bundle discounts to help you with payments. Refund Policy and Product Guarantee Companies that offer guarantees and transparent returns are confident in their products. Most of the options on our list offer 30- to 67-day periods that allow you to receive a full refund if you're not 100% satisfied with your purchase.

We recommend purchasing multiple bottles to save the most and score free shipping on your order. Can You Buy Adderall Over the Counter? No, you can't buy Adderall or its generic versions over the counter. To purchase Adderall, you must receive a doctor's prescription because of the medication's potential side effects. Your doctor will examine your mental status and consider whether or not you need the drug before writing the prescription. Usually, you can only get the prescription with an ADD or ADHD diagnosis. Some other conditions may also constitute the need for Adderall. If you don't have such conditions or want to skip the lengthy prescription process, consider an alternative from this list. Who Should Consider a Natural Adderall Alternative? Many can benefit from a natural OTC Adderall alternative, though not all. Generally, anyone with a more severe attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) might see better results from the prescription drug. If you've tried Adderall and it didn't work or even harmed you, you might want to consider a nootropic substitute. Athletes, senior citizens, students, and entrepreneurs that don't have severe ADHD but still struggle with cognitive performance might experience excellent results from natural Adderall alternatives. How Do Nootropic Supplements Work To Improve Brain Health? Nootropics improve many different aspects of cognitive performance. The supplements target varying pathways in your mind to improve your thinking, depending on the type of nootropic you take (prescription vs. non-prescription and caffeinated vs. non-caffeinated). For example, some focus on your neurotransmitters (brain chemicals), while others target blood flow circulation, brain oxygen levels, nerve growth factor proteins, or nutrient deprivation. Essentially, Nootropic supplements work to improve brain health in many different ways, depending on the type you take. They nourish any brain area lacking the proper nutrients, blood flow, oxygen, or defense mechanisms. Most people think that the only nootropics are prescription medications, like Adderall or Alzheimer's drugs, though other common substances like caffeine also act as nootropics. Your morning cup of coffee supplies your brain with the energy needed to combat mental tiredness and concentrate for the next few hours.
