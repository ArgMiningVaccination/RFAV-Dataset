But many don't know how this ancient practice significantly increases critical immune cells to combat viruses and colds. In this short blog, we will go over three immune boosting benefits of [acupuncture](https://inm.center/services/acupuncture/) and [Chinese Medicine](https://inm.center/services/chinese-medicine/). Acupuncture increases T Cells The immune system acts as the body's protection against foreign substances and microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses. When the immune system is working properly, it can ward off virulent viruses and colds. From a study, researches discovered, \"Electro-acupuncture on ST-36 induces increases the number of CD4+ T cells in the spleen compared to those observed in the non-acupoint and control groups (1).\" Why is this important? T-cells serve the basic purpose of ridding harmful bacteria and viruses from the body. Through the treatment process, the acupuncture stimulates the brain to release T cells. The more T-cells in the circulating blood, the better! Moxibustion Increases White Blood Cells Within Chinese Medicine, [the use of moxibustion](https://inm.center/services/moxibustion/) is commonly used. Moxa is the application of an herb that we safely burn around the top layer of specific acu-points. This practice has been used for thousands of years to boost immunity. In one study, they discovered that, \"Moxibustion upregulated white blood cell levels in immune-suppression mice, which may contribute to their effect in relieving immune hypofunction caused by alkylating agent CTX (2).\" Acupuncture Treats the Root of the Immune System The use of Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture emphasizes treating the cause of all problems. When dealing with colds and flu's, the same principal applies. The way practitioners find the root is through an assessment. The assessments include medical pulse diagnosis, tongue diagnosis and screening questions. From there, patients will be treated accordingly. Viruses and colds present different in everybody. Therefore, treatment is different and unique for every patient. Finally, to best prevent colds and viruses, schedule a complimentary consultation call (203) 740-9300. If you are already a patient, it is recommended to maintain consistent treatments. Dr. Maslowski, DACM, L.Ac. SOPHIA Natural Health Center References - Chen, Xu. Anli.
