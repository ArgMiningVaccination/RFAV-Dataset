Remember, you may need a referral from your child's PCP or approval from us before your child goes to an appointment or uses a service.

To find out about these benefits, call the Agency Medicaid Help Line at [1-877-254-1055](tel:1-877-254-1055). If your child needs a ride to any of these services, we can help.
