He is a pioneer in the exploration and use of potentised human body substances (like hormones and mediators), and a specialist in ap- plying anthroposophic knowledge into homeopathy. August 2014 2 Mr. Jansen, tell us something about your life and how you came to homeopathy? My wife Elly and I married in 1980. We have 5 children and 6 grandchildren. Before I came in con- tact with homeopathy I completed the High School of Agriculture, so I know a lot about plants and herbs . Then I became manager of 28 employees in a flow- er- and garden centre. When my father died I took over all his greenhouses, as I had to take care of my family. When our second daughter was a baby, she re- ceived the MMR vaccination. Within days she got a very bad bilateral ear infection. Doctors gave her several antibiotics, but after 3 days she got encep ha- litis (brain infection) with very high fever. She w as hospitalised and after another 3 days she fell into a coma. The doctors told us that she could not make i t because her brain was too damaged. She could not have a normal life. They even suggested to let her die. So I took her out of the hospital and brought her to a homeopath who had treated me very well in the past. We talked with her for an hour, she asked me a lot of questions about the baby. Then she gave my daughter some homeopathic remedy and within 3 hours she woke up. After 3 days she was playing with her toys. That day I decided to become a ho- meopath. I completed the School of anthroposophic medi- cine in Den Hout, The Netherlands, where I studied both classical homeopathy and anthroposophic medi- cine. The normal course lasts 5 year, but after 3 3 years my teachers asked me to start a practice, be- cause I knew everything I needed to know. So you could say I am fast, after all, my astrology sign i s Aries. I practice homeopathy since 1988 and my practice is situated in our home estate in Den Hoorn in the Netherlands, near Delft. I chose to live and work there because I need space for concentration and relaxation. There are 3 big cities nearby: Rotterda m, Delft and Den Haag. We live in a beautiful place, w e have 3 greenhouses with everything we need, we grow our own organic food and we have birds, chick- ens, a vineyard, even fig trees. And the children c an play in the beautiful yard with a swimming pool, a trampoline, a lake with water lilies, etc. The international School for Homeopathic Detox Therapy is in the same yard in a special separate building, so I don't need to travel, which saves me time and energy. My wife Elly is an anthroposophic physiotherapist and we work together. She is not only the love of my life but my inspiration as well , my guardian angel and the person to whom I owe all my success. And how did you start the Homeopathic De- tox Therapy (HDT)? It was March 1993, I remember it well. After a busy day in the morning in the homeopathic practice and in the afternoon in my greenhouses with roses, I only had evenings left for studying and thinking. Suddenly the thought came to me: I was not treat- ing the cause that was making the patient sick. Tha t 4 was why I could not cure the disease. And when Hahnemann started homeopathy he was working ac- cording to this principle, for example, with Sepia, Arsenicum, Mercurius and Aurum. Of course, I always asked the patients when their complaints started. Neither the patient nor I relat ed the answer to this question to medications, vaccine s or other toxic substances, although both the patien t and I did see that the symptoms appeared after this . I was too busy repertorising symptoms and treat them the way I was taught. I was not asking myself whether each vaccine or each allopathic medicine might be and should be used as a homeopathic rem- edy. That night in March 1993 I decided to potentize the vaccine DTP. I first started experimenting on myself. I started with 30K and observed the effect. Then I repeated it. The next step was to obtain the whole range of commonly used potencies (30K, 200K, MK and 10MK). Again, I tried them on myself, first once a week in increasing potency and then I continued taking each potency twice a week. I no- ticed that this worked well. I felt better. The potentised DTP vaccine brought a big change in me. My pains subsided and I experienced greater freedom. This is reflected amongst others in the fa ct that I started to give public lectures, something I did not dare to do before, as I used to be very shy. No w I know that the reason for my pathological shyness was the vaccination. Later on I asked my pharmacist to prepare home- opathic remedies from other vaccines, such as MMR 5 and from the allopathic medicines potencies 30K, 200K, MK and 10MK. Thus I was able to even better address the disease causes of some of the patients. In 2001 I met Tinus Smits who was experimenting with a similar method, which he later called CEASE therapy. While he was working mainly with autistic children after vaccination, I was applying HDT in most of my cases. I discovered that this method could cure patients with all sorts of complaints. I n a sense this means, that there are no incurable dis- eases, if the homeopath knows what to do. Why do you think that HDT is such an im- portant method in curing diseases? It is effective, it works quickly and it improves t he vitality of the patient. It works well for people w ith psychiatric symptoms such as depression and mel- ancholy. It is not harmful for the body, it relieve s all complaints and it is very cost effective. HDT has n o adverse reactions on the body, provided that the or - gans are well supported. Here homeopathy again shows its power to put the self-healing ability of the body optimally into action. In the Western world almost everyone suffers from low-grade or latent infections. This usually i s not obvious to them, but still gives them the feeli ng that they are not entirely well, like a sick feelin g in the abdomen, stiff joints, headaches that come and go, athlete's foot, bad taste in the mouth and fa- tigue. These complaints are usually tolerated and ignored. 6 So almost no one knows what it feels like to be really healthy, because already during pregnancy and birth, our defence mechanisms, the immune system included, often are overloaded with harmful substances. And the first vaccination puts blueprin ts of pathology and diseases in our immune system, connected not only with the respective microbes, bu t with the chemical substances in the vaccines as wel l. Vaccinations weaken the immune system, though western medicine says that they make it stronger. The only thing that happens after vaccination is th e production of antibodies against specific diseases. These antibodies only work for five years, they mis - lead our immune system and make us more suscep- tible to other diseases. Actually allopathic medicine says our immune sys- tem is not functioning properly, so there is a need for medical intervention in order \"to help it\". I completely disagree with this way of thinking and treating children with allopathic medicines and vaccines. It's also important to know that vaccinations con- tain a large number of chemicals that cause perma- nent damage. Chemicals such as formaldehyde, al- uminium compounds, mercury (Hg), antibiotics and other substances to which no attention is drawn. Nearly all allopathic medicines such as contracep- tives, antibiotics, NSAID, sleeping pills, antihype r- tensives, painkillers, etc. are bad for your health and have many side effects. Please note that these are 7 all medicines many people frequently use without realising the severe consequences upon their health . Many other chemicals, such as amalgam, plasti- cizers from soft plastics, synthetic hormones and a d- ditives in food, but also polluted drinking water, un- dermine the human health (by disrupting organs and organ systems) and cause sickness. Think of addi- tives in food, sweeteners such as aspartame, food colours, flavour enhancers and substances such as benzoic acid (E210), monopotassium glutamate (E621) and potassium glutamate (E622). The disruption of the organs also falls under the similium and must be addressed with appropriate homeopathic remedies. If someone for example has depression or burnout, part of the cause is that th e serotonin and cortisol metabolism is disturbed and needs to be balanced. For this purpose we could giv e homeopathic doses of serotonin or cortisol. It is part of the homeopath's job to also recognize this and to take into consideration during the trea t- ment. So I give nutrition advices (Healthy Breakfas t advice, Healthy Weight advice and advice which food contains essential nutrients), I supplement the treatment with herbal and orthomolecular products and homeopathic dilutions of endogenous substances that support the affected organs and organ systems. Also we must not forget, that no one can be cured if the miasmas such as syphilis, sycosis, and psora are not treated too, as much as possible. For exam- ple, if you operate on a cancer tumour, but don't a d- dress the miasmatic predisposition, the cancer will come back. So even if you successfully treat the pa - 8 tient with HDT, but don't treat the miasmas well, f or sure he will come back with new problems. Of course, all treatments must be temporary; the patient should eventually recover and be able to go on with his life without further treatment. Because we should always remember, that our highest goal is to make sick people healthy; this is called healing. The efficiency of the HDT method is well demon- strated by blood and urine tests, as research has shown (Boiron, Cier & Mouriquand - Arsenic Poison- ing and Boiron, Cier & Vingert - Arsen ic intoxication in rats). Is HDT a complementary method or is it a completely different form of homeopathy? I see HDT as a missing link, because it focus- es on addressing the harmful external factors . It is a forgotten link Hahnemann already was talkin g about: the lifting of blockages. If someone continu es to live in a damp house or if someone continues to work with substances such as mercury or arsenic, you can't cure him 100%. The living conditions must change before anyone can become curable. If they do not change their living conditions, their healin g will be impossible and the amelioration will be of short duration. The famous master of classical homeopathy George Vithoulkas addresses this too, when he talks about \"the husband syndrome\" for example - if the husband is not supportive to his wife, she can neve r 9 cure as long as they are together, and eventually either they will divorce or she will start to suppr ess her condition with allopathic drugs. If someone has been poisoned and thus his de- fence mechanism is blocked, this should be ad- dressed first. The HDT method can lift the blockage so that the organs can start functioning normal again. After HDT treatment, most blockages disap- pear and the homeopathic picture becomes clear at last - thus the patient can cure completely. If the homeopath is really good in his or her homeopathic method, by including the HDT in addition, the healing will go faster and will be indeed quick, gently and forever. I am sure that every homeopath gets the patients that fit him. You have to take a critical look at t he results in your practice and if they are unsatisfac tory you should ask yourself why you couldn't cure all your patients. In general, the percentage of patien ts who experienced a quick, gentle and durable cure with homeopathy is low. That is also the reason why so few people visit a homeopath. That is why I see a danger to homeopathy; we are not as self-critical a s needed. It cannot be that a patient continues to take the same homeopathic remedies for years, without get- ting completely well (so called constitutional trea t- ment). This is not a cure and possibly this could even be suppression. Healing follows a certain pat- tern. Just look at the Laws of Hering (from the ins ide out, from top to bottom, etc.) and the Theory of 10 Suppression of Vijayakar (based on the development of the embryonic layers). If we are not willing to draw from the entire ocean of homeopathic knowledge and remain confined to one or two schools only, homeopa- thy will disappear and this would be a crime against humanity . That is why I think the different contemporary schools in homeopathy should cooperate and not compete or ignore each other. Homeopathy should be raised to a higher level. What are the biggest problems caused by al- lopathic medication and suppressive treat- ments? The largest group of troublemakers are the medi- cations and interventions that take place around th e time of conception, pregnancy and in the first thre e years of human life. This is because during that pe ri- od the brain, the organs and the systems of the body are developing and medications and interven- tions, as well as substances like tobacco, alcohol or recreation drugs, cause the most damage. A crucial moment is childbirth, which often is forced with a lot of medication. Delivery should be neither too early, nor too late; but I think the co unt- ing is wrong. The last 20 years doctors started to count the 40 weeks of pregnancy from the first day of the last menses, while the counting should start 14 days later, from the moment of ovulation. 11 The pain is not accepted as a normal part of the labour process anymore. Nowadays women get a lot of painkillers during delivery. The epidural anaest he- sia could be very dangerous for the new-born child and even lead to serious neurological problems. More and more I see things happening during pregnancy or at birth that damage the health of the child. And, of course, right after them the vaccine s and the antibiotics appear. How many of your patients are ill because of allopathic medications or interventions? 85% (and perhaps as much as 100%) of the pa- tients who come into my practice have medicine- related illness. The allopathic medication not on- ly suppresses symptoms, but also creates new problems, which confuse the picture of the original disease . On top of this, allopathic drugs cause illnesses in other organs, as well as the end o- crine system, nervous system, digestive system, immune system, etc. What are the social repercussions of the massive use of allopathic drugs? More and more we see chronic symptoms in younger and younger people and the medicine school cannot or does not want to find explanations for this. Take for example lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myeloencephalitis, in vitro fer tili- sation and all kinds of cancers. Pancreatic cancer is now the leading cause of death for people over 70, 12 while 20 years ago it barely existed. And look at t he large number of brain tumours and the shocking rise of breast cancer. The latter is mainly caused by th e disruption of the endocrine system. Women suffer from various hormone-related symptoms: migraine, backache, asexuality, vaginal discharge, dryness during sex, ovarian and uterine cancer, etc. The perpetrators are contraceptives, hormonal injections, Mirene coil, etc. The use of hormonal medication can lead to thyroid problems and depression. And amongst others this leads to use of RRSIs, which often (after slight temporary improvement) worsen the depression. Women are often suicidal, feel trapped and cannot have a nor- mal relationship. Some feel that they are beyond th is world. It is becoming increasingly difficult for th em to maintain a social life. Then they get stomach pains or other symptoms and have to take additional allopathic medication and the side effects accumu- late more and more. The advent of the contraceptive pill was accompa- nied by a huge increase in thyroid problems in wom- en. Today the ratio women to men with thyroid problems is like 95% to 5%, while before it used to be around 50% to 50%. So we can clearly see that men (because in general they don't take hormones) have such problems much less. I also notice a huge increase in allergies, due to an overload of the liver and intestines. The heavy use of antibiotics plays a big role in this. I also see an increase in hyperactivity. This is of - ten related to brain damage, for example by formal-13 dehyde and aluminium components in vaccines, an- aesthetics, etc. What are the consequences for the health con- dition of the population If we continue in this direction? I think that the quality of life will deteriorate. Peo- ple will die from all kinds of new diseases and epi - demics and this will occur at a younger age. I have the right to say this, because recently I have been seeing more and more patients with new diseases that are very difficult or even impossible to cure with allopathic medicine. Actually, that is why they com e to me for treatment. They have seen that HDT has helped their friends and they know that it could he lp them as well. You've just described the symptoms that can be a result of use of contraception and SSRIs. Would you describe other health problems, re- lated to allopathic medication / interventions, and the corresponding symptoms we as home- opaths have to look for? 1. Prednisone and other corticosteroids : \"Never well since\" symptoms, always tired, because the adrenal glands are damaged by these medicines. Because the adrenal glands cannot do their job, you see much fatigue. The immune system does not work properly as well and one gets inflammations and infections easily. 14 2. General anaesthetics : often drowsiness, for- getfulness, spaced out, headaches, constipation, stomach and liver problems, fatigue. It is not rec- ommended that older people receive general anaes- thesia, because it increases the risk of dementia. 3. Local anaesthetics : increased muscle tonus (stiffness) that can remain for a long time or lack of tonus and weakness. In a number of cases this is permanent. For example, after dental treatments with local anaesthetics I regularly see neuropathy of the face muscles. Or epidural anaesthesia can cause severe pains and soreness in the back for a long time and also chronic headaches. 4. Omeprazole is prescribed and used a lot, often unnecessarily, when homeopathic cure is possible, for example with Kali-c, Aethusa and other reme- dies. In many cases a diaphragmatic hernia can easily be cured as well by an osteopath, chiropract or or manual therapist. Omeprazole can cause major liver damage and even liver cancer. After long use it can lead to dementia too. 5. Statins : the unnatural intervention in choles- terol metabolism causes huge problems and can even cripple people. Sometimes fit people can suffe r from severe symptoms after a few months of statins use. They can't walk properly and are very tired and confused . One of my cases was of a woman with Parkinson disease after use of statins . It is not a fact that statins are good for health in the first place, but they prevent the body from producing co- enzyme Q10 and thus the heart is soon affected. But even then medical doctors rarely think of a connec-15 tion with statins or they just follow the protocol of the pharmaceutical industry. We desperately need cholesterol as it is forming and maintaining cell w alls and structures and it is important for the brain an d nervous system, especially as we get older. Patho- logically high cholesterol is caused by many medica - tions (such as omeprazole!) and by eating too many carbohydrates and not enough good fats. If the LDL is too high, I advise the patients not to eat dairy products. 6. NSAIDs (brufen, naproxen, diclofenac, etc.) cause stomach problems, arthritis, fibrom- yalgia and rheumatoid arthritis (ironically, they prescribe NSAIDs for such conditions), but also res - ignation. Drinking more water often helps better fo r stomach pains and headache. For example, read the book \"You're not sick, you're thirsty!\" by Dr. F. B at- manghelidj. 7. Amalgam fillings : especially problems of the liver (liver poison), but also of the nervous syste m and kidneys. The liver cannot do its job properly when there is large amount of heavy metals in the body. The mercury element gives us the feeling that 'everybody is an enemy'. That's why we live in such a hostile world with a lot of aggression - as mercu ry is everywhere, not only in the mouth (fillings) but in the food too. The niccolum element affects the pan- creas and makes people egocentric. And the silver element destroys the gut flora and causes lack of energy. 8. Methylphenidate (such as Ritalin and Con- certa) : it changes the receptors in the brain; it 16 makes people react differently, as they can't recei ve the signals properly. It is possible, but at the sa me time very difficult, to recover from this damage be - cause brain cells are not able to regenerate quickl y. In such cases we must treat the complaints this medicines are prescribed for first, before the deto x. 9. Chemotherapy : the effect of the chemothera- py is doubtful. The director of the A. van Leeuwen- hoek Hospital says that 75% of all chemotherapies i s not useful, and another specialist states that if someone survives the chemo, either he / she was quite strong or did not have cancer at all or the reason for this success was surgery . In most cases, chemotherapy disturbs the process of healing and even can make the cancer more aggres- sive. But radiotherapy could be effective, if well exe- cuted and combined with homeopathic treatment during (Carb-a, Caust.) and after (Radium-br.) the course. 10. Benzodiazepines are prescribed for depres- sion, anxiety and sleeping problems, but they can cause narcolepsy and are quite addictive. Eventuall y the muscles get weaker and lose their tonus be- cause. Usually the homeopathic remedy Syphilinum is a better solution for sleeplessness and for fear of insanity. A patient of mine, who was suffering from heart problems for which he took beta-blockers, was taking oxazepam for more than 30 years because of his high level of stress. Several times he fell asl eep while driving which was nearly fatal to him. After proper detox his narcolepsy was gone and he didn't need his heart medicines anymore. Of course, I 17 completed the cure with Syphilinum and Chelidonium for liver support. How should HDT be applied in practice? First you look at the hierarchy of the allopathic medication and at the hierarchy of the organs and organ systems. You do not start with the detox of most recently taken medicines first. The goal is to determine where the disturbance is most important and treat this first. Often if you start correctly, other complaints disappear without further treatment, as the body gets stronger and can cope with the com- plaints by itself. The method is still in development. Five years ago I usually needed up to 2 years or more to cure my patients. Nowadays I mostly need only 2-7 months for complete recovery from severe symptoms. This is possible because of the new insights, knowledge and experience. I am really happy with the rapid devel- opment of the method. However, still, this is not a l- ways the case and sometimes more time is needed. There are people who need more than a year of treatment before they recover and function normally in the world. What is known about HDT internationally? I organize international seminars in the Nether- lands and homeopaths come to me from all over the world. But I also give seminars in other countries such as United Kingdom, Serbia, Bulgaria and Aus- 18 tria. As of 2014, there are HDT homeopaths in about 20 countries. What are the latest developments? I'm getting deeper knowledge of the effects of al- lopathic medicines on the various organs and organ systems (endocrine system, circulatory system, im- mune system, etc.). In order to prescribe the corre ct treatment, I have to know every allopathic medicine the patient has taken and also the diseases he has suffered from. I then put this information in the timeline from the conception to the consultation. As I said, the body system that is highest in the hierarchy must be treated first. 'Never well since' is not always the starting point for the treatment. There are often other causative factors that appear earlier in life and are hidden below the surface. These causes must be discovered and treated first. In this way I am able to offer treatment that is quick, gentle and forever, and also almost without aggravations. I use a lot of body substances that harmonize and regulate various organs during the detox course, like cortisol, tryptiline, histamine, sap- onins, cholesterol, What you use? In the HDT several common potencies order: 30K, 200K, MK and 10MK. Nowa- days I start the treatment, where possible, with th e 12K potency, because my experience shows that it works more gently in the beginning of the course. 19 Because the 12K potency is on the borderline be- tween material and non-material levels, it must be efficient on both levels. Organ support mostly needs to be done with lower potencies, and I prefer liquid remedies as they can be slightly changed every time the patients take them by succession. Nosodes and endogenous substances are given in various potencies according to the individual needs . How homeopaths can get more information about HDT? Are there any courses and books you could recommend? I realise that after this interview there will be many questions. It is not possible to explain every - thing just in one interview, especially when it com es to such a deep and complex subject as HDT. Be- sides, as I said, the method is developing rapidly and I get new experience and new insights every day from my practice and supervisions. That is why I decided (with the help of Dr. Peter Naydenov, a leading Bulgarian homeopath and one of my first students) to start a Facebook page wher e we intend to publish much more information. In this way we can create a community and be in touch with colleagues from all over the world. I would like to ask everybody to write their questions on our time- line so that I can answer them either directly or i n the book I am writing at the moment. The seminars in which people can get a diploma in HDT are mostly in Den Hoorn, near Delft, in the 20 Netherlands at the moment, but I am open to invita- tions from other countries, provided that enough people come to the courses. Most probably my next HDT course will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria. I was in Bulgaria for a holiday and there was a lot of interest in my method there. We gave two lectures and about 100 people attended them. Many patients asked me for treatment. There are so many people in Bulgaria, especially children, who need HDT, and I hope to be able to teach my colleagues how to cure them with this method. Of course, people from other countries can attend the Sofia HDT courses too. There are inex- pensive flights to Sofia and the accommodation there is very affordable. I speak English with con- secutive translation into Bulgarian. I am considering doing webinars, supervisions and consultations for homeopaths and patients online as this is a convenient form of learning. Please like our page www.facebook.com/homeopathicdetoxtherapy and subscribe to the free newsletter \"HDT Today\". On the website of The International School of HDT www.schoolforhomeopathicdetox.nl we announce all the courses and seminars we offer and people can contact us through email from there. On this websit e there is a list of homeopaths from various countrie s that have completed the full HDT course. Patients can contact them for help, and if needed, can ask them for supervision with me. 21 Are there any interesting cases that you would like to share with the readers? Well, there are many cases I have successfully cured, including children with diabetes and autism, cancer patients, Crohn disease, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, etc. As I mentioned, when you know what to do, there are no incurable diseases. My experi- ence is that well indicated homeopathic remedies work well, but not long lasting. After a proper cou rse of HDT they work perfectly. So I am very happy that I discovered this workaround path. Anything else? I would like to ask my colleagues all around the globe to share this information with other homeo- paths and with allopathic doctors. Please understan d that there is no need for suffering and much of it can be avoided if we think twice before we give allopa- thic medicines, anaesthesia, vaccines, etc. - espe- cially to pregnant women, babies and children. It is better to prevent than to treat the diseases after they have started. But even though many cas- es seem difficult, there is hope, if we as homeopat hs master the HDT. My students are very happy with their results and this makes me happy too. "}
