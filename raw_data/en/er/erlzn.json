Thankfully, most people who experience a shingles outbreak only do so one time. However, others have recurrences. There is no cure for shingles, but there are antiviral medications that can speed the healing process. Shingles vaccination also is available to adults aged 50 and older to help prevent initial outbreaks among those at the highest risk for them. Modern medicine is not the only solution for treating shingles pain and preventing future outbreaks. Naturopaths and doctors agree that natural treatments for shingles can help with both discomfort and relapses. If you're among the people who prefer natural alternatives for treating common conditions, this article provides information on the most effective natural treatments for shingles. What Causes Shingles? Shingles is a viral infection caused by the [varicella zoster virus](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview.html) (VZV). It is the same virus that causes chickenpox. Individuals who recover from chickenpox can have the virus lay dormant in their systems for years. Doctors don't know why, but roughly [1 out of every 3 people](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/index.html) who had chickenpox later have the virus reactivate as shingles. How Common is Shingles? Many people don't think about shingles until it affects them personally. The truth is shingles is far more common than you may realize. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 1 million people suffer from this debilitating and painful condition each year. Anyone who has ever had chickenpox - even a mild case of it 40 years ago - can have the VZV reactivate as shingles. Most Americans born before 1980 have had chickenpox and therefore are at high risk of developing shingles. More than half of all shingles cases happen in people over 60. The risk for serious complications from shingles also increases with age. The first sign of a shingles outbreak usually is a burning pain or itching around one side of the waist. Some individuals experience burning or itching on the side of their face near their eye or forehead. After a few days of these warning signs, a rash of fluid-filled blisters appears in the affected area. It can take a few weeks for the blisters to resolve. For 1 out of 10 people, nerve pain - [postherpetic neuralgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postherpetic-neuralgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20376588#:~:text=Postherpetic%20neuralgia%20(post%2Dhur%2D,herpes%20zoster)%20virus%20causes%20shingles.) - can last for months or even years after the initial outbreak. It is one of the most common shingles complications. Age increases the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia. Can You Get Shingles More Than Once? Unfortunately, yes. Shingles can recur in some people, although doctors are not entirely certain what makes one person more susceptible to a repeat outbreak than another. Medical professionals originally thought that reoccurrences were rare, but now know that they happen in more than [5 percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3031432/) of shingles sufferers. Your risk for developing a second round of this painful virus increases with age. Doctor Recommendations for Shingles Most doctors recommend the [shingles vaccine](https://www.shingrix.com) to prevent an initial outbreak. Medical trials suggest the shingles vaccine is about 85 percent effective for the first four years after vaccination. The CDC has determined that individuals who receive both doses of the vaccine, at the recommended 2 to 6 months between injections, have the most protection. Even if a breakthrough shingles infection occurs, vaccinated adults have less severe symptoms, according to the CDC. Medical practitioners treat active shingles outbreaks with antiviral medications specifically designed to fight the varicella zoster virus. Prescription medications focus on addressing shingles pain and the itching associated with the condition. There is no cure for shingles, only treatment to relieve the symptoms. Some doctors also recommend using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Sometimes physicians prescribe narcotics or steroids to treat the pain and antihistamines for the itching. All medications work best when started within two days of the rash first appearing. Natural Treatments for Shingles Natural treatments for shingles can be just as effective as over-the-counter and prescription medications when used correctly. Not only can these alternative treatments provide natural pain relief for shingles, but they also can boost your immune system to help protect against future outbreaks. Here are some effective natural treatments for shingles that produce immediate results. Shingles is a serious medical condition. Contact your healthcare provider if you suspect you have it before using any natural treatments for shingles. Natural Remedies to Prevent a Shingles Outbreak If you were born before 1980, your chances of experiencing a shingles outbreak are unfortunately high. Getting vaccinated can help with an initial resurgence of the virus, but it may not prevent a second - or third - outbreak in the future. Effective natural treatments for shingles can reduce your risk of being revisited by this painful skin condition. A Final Word on Natural Pain Relief for Shingles Shingles pain can be debilitating, but there are things you can do to prevent outbreaks. Get your shingles booster and keep your immune system strong. If you do become the unfortunate host of this unwelcome visitor, natural treatment for shingles can help keep your shingles pain in check until the rash subsides. Stay "}
