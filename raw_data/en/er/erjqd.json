Homeopathic ideas and practices were also understood by Aristotle and Hippocrates; they're mentioned in ancient Hindu books. But what is homeopathy and how can you use it? Does anyone still use it? Today, Homeopathic medicine is a law-abiding science practiced by homeopathic practitioners in Las Vegas. It's practiced by over 100 million people in India and by celebrities such as Queen Elizabeth II, Cher, and Jennifer Aniston. What is Homeopathy? Knowing and understanding symptoms, how they happen, and how they affect the body is the key to Homeopathy. Symptoms can be physical, mental, and emotional. Each of these types of symptoms can help understand your illness or disease. Homeopathy is a safe, curative form of medicine in these domains to promote overall well-being. While traditional medicine has some innovative qualities of mechanical cure, Homeopathy has amazing qualities of therapeutic healing. Homeopathic medicine does not cause side effects. Using homeopathic medicine does not affect current or previous conventional medicine taken for the ailment. A patient is not seen pathologically, but treated holistically; emotional, mental, and spiritual state take precedence over disease names. A homeopathic practitioner prescribes remedies for specific symptoms. Acute, chronic, or psychological issues are discussed and studied objectively, including your health history. The power of \"like cures like\" In homeopathy, the Law of Similars is based on the principle that \"like cures like.\" The homeopathic treatment of disease by small energetic doses of natural substances produces symptoms of the disease in a healthy person. However these remedies can cure similar symptoms in an ailing person. For example, onions make your eyes water and nose run. Similarly, hay fever causes watering eyes and a burning nose as well. Thus, the homeopathic remedy for hay fever is made from the active ingredient red onions. Also known as Allium Cepa, red onions and other homeopathic products and can alleviate a feverish health condition.
