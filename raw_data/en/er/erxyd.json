We are studying the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines. Detailed description of study The study consists of a screening visit followed by other study visits. From the time of screening, you will be in this study for around 9 months. You may be eligible if you plan to receive the vaccine (initial or booster) but have not yet gotten it yet. The COVID-19 vaccination study includes: a screening visit (approx 1 hour) to check your eligibility. If you qualify, you will come in for the following study visits: Study Visit 1 - Pre-Donor Evaluation (30 min) and Leukopheresis (approx 2.5-4 hours), Visit 2 - vaccination at your place of choice. The study team will not be providing the vaccine. Study Visits 3 - 8 - Blood Draws (approx 30 mins), Study Visit 9 - Leukopheresis (approx 2.5-4 hours). There are additional optional procedures that you may choose to participate in. These include fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the lymph nodes under your armpit to see how protective antibodies are being generated. You may also choose to participate in periodic blood draws/leukopheresis to see how immune protection holds up over the long-term. Compensation is provided after the screening visit if eligible for the study. Eligibility of study You may be eligible for this study if you meet the following criteria: Years - 100 Years - Gender: Male or Female Must be receiving a COVID-19 vaccines or booster Must be willing to consent to blood draws Updated on 24 Jul 2023.
