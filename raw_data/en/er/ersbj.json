NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 2 Contributors The NYS Workers' Compensation Board would like to thank the members of the New York Workers' Compensation Board Medical Advisory Committee (MAC). The MAC served as the Board's advisory body to adapt the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) Practice Guidelines to a New York version of the Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG). In this capacity, the MAC provided valuable input and made recommendations to help guide the final version of these Guidelines. With full consensus reached on many topics, and a careful review of any dissenting opinions on others, the Board established the final product.

E.8 Electrical Therapeutic 76 NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 6 A. General Guideline Principles The principles summarized in this section are key to the intended application of the New York State Medical Treatment Guidelines (MTG) and are applicable to all Workers' Compensation Medical Treatment Guidelines. A.1 Medical Care Medical care and treatment r equired as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities with a focus on a return to work, while striving to restore the patient's health to its pre -injury statu s in so far as is feasible. A.2 Rendering Of Medical Services Any medical provider rendering services to a workers' compensation patient must utilize the Treatment Guidelines as provided for with respect to all work -related injuries and/or illnesses. A.3 Positive Patient Response Positive results are defined primarily as functional gains which can be objectively measured. Objective functional gains include, but are not limited to, positional tolerances, range of motion, strength, endurance, activities of daily living (ADL), cognition, psychological behavior, and efficiency/velocity measures which can be quantified. Subjective reports of pain and function may be considered and given relative weight when the pain has anatom ic and physiologic correlation in proportion to the injury. A.4 Re-Evaluate Treatment If a given treatment or modality is not producing positive results within a well -defined timeframe, the provider should either modify or d iscontinue the treatment regime. The provider should evaluate the efficacy of the treatment or modality 2 to 3 weeks after the initial visit and 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. These timeframes may be slightly longer in the context of conditions that are inherent ly mental health issues, and shorter for other non - musculoskeletal medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, dermatologic etc.). Recognition that treatment failure is at times attributable to an incorrect diagnosis a failure to respond should prompt the clinicia n to reconsider the diagnosis in the event of an unexpected poor response to an otherwise rational intervention. A.5 Education Education of the patient and family, as well as the employer, insurer, policy makers and the community shoul d be a primary emphasis in the treatment of work -related injury or illness. Practitioners should develop and implement effective educational strategies and skills. An education -based paradigm should always start with communication providing reassuring info rmation to the patient. No treatment plan is complete without addressing issues of individual and/or group patient education as a means of facilitating self - management of symptoms and prevention of future injury. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 7 Time Frames A.6 Acuity Acute, Subacute and Chronic are generally defined as timeframes for disease stages: Acute - Less than one month Subacute - One to three month, and Chronic - greater than three months. A.7 Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation refers to the acute timeframe follow ing an injury and is not used to define when a given physician first evaluates an injured worker (initial encounter) in an office or clinical setting. A.8 Diagnostic Time Frames Diagnostic time frames for conducting diagnost ic testing commence on the date of injury. Clinical judgment may substantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.9 Treatment Time Frames Treatment time frames for specific inte rventions commence once treatments have been initiated, not on the date of injury. It is recognized that treatment duration may be impacted by disease process and severity, patient compliance, as well as availability of services. Clinical judgment may subs tantiate the need to accelerate or decelerate the time frames discussed in this document. A.10 Delayed Recovery For those patients who fail to make expected progress 6 -12 weeks after an injury and whose subjective symptoms do not correlate with objective signs and tests, reexamination in order to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis and re -evaluation of the treatment program should be performed. When addressing a clinical issue that is not inherently a mental health issue, assessm ent for potential barriers to recovery (yellow flags/psychological issues) should be ongoing throughout the care of the patient. At 6 - 12 weeks, alternate treatment programs, including formal psychological or psychosocial evaluation should be considered. C linicians must be vigilant for any pre -existing mental health issues or subsequent, consequential mental health issues that may be impacting recovery. For issues that are clearly and inherently mental health issues from the outset (i.e. when it is evident that there is an underlying, work -related, mental health disorder as part of the claim at issue), referral to a mental health provider can and should occur much sooner. Referrals to mental health providers for the evaluation and management of delayed recov ery do not indicate or require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological condition. The evaluation and management of delayed recovery does not require the establishment of a psychiatric or psychological claim. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 8 Treatment Approaches A.11 Active Interventions Active interventions emphasizing patient responsibility, such as therapeutic exercise and/or functional treatment, are generally emphasized over passive modalities, especially as treatment progresse s. Generally, passive and palliative interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active rehabilitation program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. A.12 Active Therapeutic Exercise Program Active therapeutic exercise program goals should incorporate patient strength, endurance, flexibility, range of motion, sensory integration, coordination, cognition and behavior (when at issue) and education as clinically indicated. This includes functional application in vocational or community settings. A.13 Diagnostic Imaging And Testing Procedures Clinical information obtained by history taking and physical examination should be the basis for selection of imaging procedures and interpretation of results. All diagnostic procedures have characteristic specificities and sensitivities for various diagnoses. Usually, selection of one procedure over others depends upon various factors, which may include: relative diagnostic value; risk/benefit profile of the procedure; availability of technology; a patient's tolerance; and/or the treating practitioner's familiarity with the procedure. When a diagnostic procedure, in conjunction with clinical information, provides sufficient information to establish an accurate diagnosis, a second diagnostic procedure is not required. However, a subsequent diagnostic procedure including a repeat of the original (same) procedure can be performed, when the specialty physician (e.g. p hysiatrist, sports medicine physician or other appropriate specialist) radiologist or surgeon documents that the initial study was of inadequate quality to make a diagnosis. Therefore, in such circumstances, a repeat or complementary diagnostic procedure i s permissible under the MTG. It is recognized that repeat imaging studies and other tests may be warranted by the clinical course and/or to follow the progress of treatment in some cases. It may be of value to repeat diagnostic procedures (e.g., imaging studies) during the course of care to reassess or stage the pathology when there is progression of symptoms or findings, prior to surgical interventions and/or therapeutic injections when clinically indicated, and post-operatively to follow the healing pro cess. Regarding serial imaging, (including x - rays, but particularly CT scans), it must be recognized that repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. A given diagnostic imaging procedure may provide the same or distinctive information as obtained by other procedures. Therefore, prudent choice of procedures(s) for a single diagnostic procedure, a complementary procedure in combination with other NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 9 procedures(s), or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, minimize the likelihood of adverse effect on patients, and promote efficiency by avoiding duplication or redundancy. A.14 Surgical Interventions Consideration of surgery should be within the context of expected functional outcome. The concept of \"cure\" with respect to surgical treatment by itself is generally a misnomer. All operative interventions must be based upon positive correlation of clinical findings, clinical cour se and imaging and other diagnostic tests. A comprehensive assimilation of these factors must lead to a specific diagnosis with positive identification of pathologic condition(s). For surgery to be performed to treat pain, there must be clear correlation between the pain symptoms and objective evidence of its cause. In all cases, shared decision making with the patient is advised. The patient should be given the opportunity to understand the pros and cons of surgery, potential for rehabilitation as an alternative where applicable, evidence -based outcomes, and specific surgical experience. A.15 Pre-Authorization All diagnostic imaging, testing procedures, non -surgical and surgical therapeutic procedures, and other therapeutics wit hin the criteria of the Medical Treatment Guidelines and based on a correct application of the Medical Treatment Guidelines are considered authorized, with the exception of the procedures listed in section 324.3(1)(a) of Title 12 NYCRR. These are not inclu ded on the list of pre -authorized procedures. Providers who want to perform one of these procedures must request pre -authorization from the carrier before performing the procedure. Second or subsequent procedures (the repeat performance of a surgical pr ocedure due to failure of, or incomplete success from the same surgical procedure performed earlier, if the Medical Treatment Guidelines do not specifically address multiple procedures) also require pre -authorization. A.16 Psychological/Psychiatric Evalu ations In select patients, mental health evaluations are essential to make, secure or confirm a diagnosis. Of course, the extent and duration of evaluations and/or interventions by mental health p rofessionals may vary, particularly based on whether: the underlying clinical issue in the claim is inherently a mental health issue; or there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question; or there is a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, or is impeding the recovery from (or both) the medical injury or illness that is at issue in the claim in question. Tests of psychological function or psychometric testing, when indicated, can be a valuable component of the psychological evaluation in identifying associated psychological, personality and psychosocial issues. Although these instruments may suggest a diagnosis, ne ither screening nor psychometric tests are capable of making a diagnosis. The diagnosis should only be made after careful analysis of all available data, including from a thorough history and clinical interview. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 10 A professional fluent in the primary langu age of the patient is strongly preferred. When such a provider is not available, services of a professional language interpreter must be provided. Frequency: When assessing for a pre -existing, unrelated mental health issue that has been made worse by, o r is impeding the recovery from (or both) a work -related, medical injury or illness, then a one -time visit for initial psychiatric/psychological encounter should be sufficient, as care would normally be continued by the prior treating provider. If psychome tric testing is indicated by findings in the initial encounter, time for such testing should not exceed an additional three hours of professional time. For conditions in which a mental health issue is a central part of the initial claim, or in which there is a mental health issue that is secondary or consequential to the work -related, medical injury or illness, that is part of the claim in question, then more extensive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions may be clinically indicated, and are discussed i n detail in the Medical Treatment Guidelines for such mental health conditions. A.17 Personality/Psychological/Psychosocial Intervention Following psychosocial evaluation, when intervention is recommended, such intervention should be implemented as soon as possible. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatment modalities. For all psychological/psychiatric interventions, there must be an assessment and treatment plan with measura ble behavioral goals, time frames and specific interventions planned . Time to produce effect: two to eight weeks. Optimum duration: six weeks to three months. Maximum duration: three to six months. Counseling is not intended to delay but rather to en hance functional recovery. For PTSD Psychological Intervention: Optimum duration three to six months. Maximum duration: nine to twelve months. For select patients, longer supervision and treatment may be required, and if further treatment is indicat ed, documentation of the nature of the psychological factors, as well as projecting a realistic functional prognosis, should be provided by the authorized treating practitioner every four weeks during the first six months of treatment. For treatment expect ed to last six to twelve months, such documentation should be provided every four to eight weeks. For long -term treatment beyond twelve months, such documentation should be provided every eight to twelve weeks. All parties should strive for ongoing and con tinuous communications, in order to facilitate seamless, continuous and uninterrupted treatment. A.18 Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Functional capacity evaluation is a comprehensive or more restricted evaluation of the various aspects of function as they relate to the patient's ability to return to work. Areas such as endurance, lifting (dynamic and static), postural tolerance, specific range -of- NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 11 motion, coordination and strength, worker habit s, employability, as well as psychosocial, cognitive, and sensory perceptual aspects of competitive employment may be evaluated. Components of this evaluation may include: (a) musculoskeletal screen; analysis; (e) job - specific activity tolerance; (f) maximum voluntary effort; (g) pain assessment/psychological screening; (h) non -material and material handling activities; (i) cognitive and behavioral; (j) visual; and (k) sensory perceptual factors. In most cases, the question of whether a patient can return to work can be answered without an FCE. An FCE may be considered at time of MMI, following reasonable prior attempts to return to full duty throughout course of treatment, wh en the treating physician is unable to make a clear determination on work status on case closure. An FCE is not indicated early during a treatment regime for any reason including one to support a therapeutic plan. When an FCE is being used to determine return to a specific job site, the treating physician is responsible for understanding and considering the job duties. FCEs cannot be used in isolation to determine work restrictions. The authorized treating physician must interpret the FCE in light of th e individual patient's presentation and medical and personal perceptions. FCEs should not be used as the sole criteria to diagnose malingering. A.19 Return To Work For purposes of these guidelines, return to work is defined as any work or duty that the patient is able to perform safely. It may not be the patient's regular work. Ascertaining a return to work status is part of medical care , and should be included in the treatment and rehabilitation plan. It is normally addressed at every outpatient visit. A description of the patient's status and task limitations is part of any treatment plan and should provide the basis for restriction of work activities when warranted. Early return to work should be a prime goal in treating occupational injuries. The emphasis within these guidelines is to move patients along a continuum of care and return to work, since the prognosis of returning an injured worker to work drops progressively the longer the worker h as been out of work. A.20 Job Site Evaluation The treating physician may communicate with the employer or employer's designee, either in person, by video conference, or by telephone, to obtain information regarding the indiv idual or specific demands of the patient's pre -injury job. This may include a description of the exertional demands of the job, the need for repetitive activities, load lifting, static or awkward postures, environmental exposures, psychological stressors and other factors that would pose a barrier to re -entry, risk of re -injury or disrupt convalescence. When returning to work at the patient's previous job tasks or setting is not feasible, given the clinically determined restrictions on the patient's activi ties, inquiry should be made about modified duty work settings that align with, the patient's condition in view of proposed work activities/demands in modified duty jobs. It should be noted, NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 12 that under certain circumstances, more than one job site evaluati on may be indicated. Ideally, the physician would gain the most information from an on -site inspection of the job settings and activities; but it is recognized that this may not be feasible in most cases. If job videos/CDs/DVDs are available from the empl oyer, these can contribute valuable information, as can video conferences, conducted from the worksite and ideally workstation or work area. Frequency: one or two contacts 1st c ontact : Patient is in a functional state where the patient can perform some work. 2nd c ontact : Patient has advanced to state where the patient is capable of enhanced functional demands in a work environment. The physician shall document the conversation. Other A.21 Guideline Recommendations And Medical Evidence The Workers' Compensation Board and its Medical Advisory Committee have not independently evaluated or vetted the scientific medical literature used in support of the guidelines, but have relied on th e methodology used by the developers of various guidelines utilized and referenced in these Guidelines. A.22 Experimental/Investigational Treatment Medical treatment that is experimental/investigational and not approved for any purpose, application or indication by the FDA is not permitted under these Guidelines. A.23 Injured Workers As Patients In these Guidelines, injured workers are referred to as patients recognizin g that in certain circumstances there is no doctor -patient relationship. A.24 Scope Of Practice These Guidelines do not address scope of practice or change the scope of practice. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 13 Shoulder Injury Effective date will coincide w ith the launch of OnBoard: Limited Release B. Introduction to Shoulder Injury This g uideline addresses the ten most common work -related injuries/ syndromes/disorders to or involving the shoulder complex. This Guideline is divided into the following sections: B.1 History Taking and Physical Examination History taking and physical examination provides information common to all injuries through a discussion of provider procedures which should be applied to each patient, regardless of the injury and diagnosis. A review of systems should be conducted, the elements of which may include signs or symptoms related to the following systems: constitutional symptoms; eyes; the underlying condition being addressed, and clinical judgement, the breadth and focus of the review of sy stems can be tailored on a case by case basis. B.2 Specific Diagnoses, Testing and Treatment Procedures Specific diagnoses, testing and treatment procedures provides information unique to each of the following work -related injuries/ syndromes/ disorde rs: 1) Acromioclavicular Disorder 3) Tendon Brachial Plexus a) Brachial Axillary Nerve c) Long Thoracic Nerve d) Musculocutaneous Nerve e) Spinal Accessory Nerve NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 14 f) Suprascapular Nerve 5) Bursitis of the Shoulder 6) Impingement Syndrome 7) Rotator Cuff Tears 8) Rotator Cuff Tendinitis 9) Shoulder Fractures a) Clavicular Fracture b) Proximal Humeral Fracture c) Humeral Shaft Fracture d) Scapular Fracture e) Sternoclavicular Dislocation/Fracture 10) Shoulder Instability Each diagnosis is presented in the following format: History and Mechanism of Injury; Discussion of relevant physical findings; Laboratory tests; Testing procedures; Diagnosis -based, non -operative therapeutic treatment procedures; Options for operative/surgical treatment; and Options for post -operative rehabilitation/treatment procedures. If a non -operative treatment approach is initially recommended, surgery may be indicated after the failure of conservative management. The patient must continue to exhibit the designated objective findings, subjective symptoms and (where applicable) imaging findings. B.3 Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative (including medications) Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative provides information common to all injuries through detailed discussions of referenced medications and therapeutic procedures with indications for expected time to produce effect, frequency, and optimum and maximum durations. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 15 As shoulder injuries frequently involve a complex of problems, it is always necessary to consider the possible interaction of the various parts of the shoulder mechanism when proceeding with a diagnostic workup and a therapeutic treatment plan. C. History Taking and Physical Examination There are two standard procedures that should be utilized when initially diagnosing work -related shoulder instability. These procedures establish the foundation/basis for and dictate all other following stages of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When findings of clinical evaluations and those of other diagnostic procedures are not consistent with each other, the objective clinical findings should have preference. The medical records should r easonably document the following: C.1 History Taking History Taking should address at least the following for each shoulder injury diagnosis: C.1.a Thorough medical history. C.1.b Occupational relationship. C.1.c History of non-occupational injury and avocational pursuits need to be specifically documented. C.1.d Prior neck, shoulder and/or arm condition (s). C.1.e A review of systems should be conducted, the elements of which may include signs or symptoms related to the fol lowing systems: constitutional on the underlying condition being addressed, and clinical judgement, the breadth and focus of the review of systems can be tailored on a case by case basis. C.2 Physical Findings Physical Findings are specific to and addressed within each shoulder injury diagnosis noted in this section. Given the complexity of the shoulder mechanism, an evaluation for concomitant injury should be considered. C.3 Red Flags Certain findings, \"red flags\", raise suspicion of potentially serious medical condit ions. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 16 Assessment (history and physical examination) should include evaluation for red flags. In the shoulder, these findings or indicators may include fracture; infection or inflammation; subdiaphragmatic problems; and cardiac disease. Further evaluation/c onsultation or urgent/emergency intervention may be indicated, and the New York Shoulder Injury Medical Treatment Guidelines incorporate changes to clinical management triggered by the presence of \"red flags.\" C.4 Follow -Up Diagnostic Imaging / Testing As outlined in detail in General Principles section A -13, the selection of diagnostic imaging studies depends on the case -specific clinical presentation, as well as clinical judgment. In addition, there may be instances where repeat or alternate di agnostic imaging may be clinically indicated. Such instances include, but are not necessarily limited to when: a prior test is of poor quality and/or nondiagnostic; the clinical situation changes (e.g. , new or worsening symptoms, preparing for surgery or t herapeutic injections, etc.); it is necessary to monitor clinical progress (e.g. , post-operatively) or deterioration over time. Prudent choice of procedure(s) or a proper sequential order in multiple procedures will ensure maximum diagnostic accuracy, mi nimize adverse effect to patients and promote clinical efficiency. Repeat procedures result in an increase in cumulative radiation dose and associated risks. Diagnostic imaging procedures have varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity for any diagnos is. Clinical history, physical examination and clinical judgment should be the basis for selection and interpretation of imaging studies. Generally, plain X -rays are a useful starting point, but they are not always sufficient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), arthrography, or computed axial tomography (CT) scanning following arthrography may provide useful information for many shoulder disorders. In certain circumstances as stated above, repeat or alternate imaging may be warranted. Usually, selection o f one procedure over others depends upon multiple factors. D. Specific Diagnoses, Testing and Treatment Procedures D.1 Acromioclavicular (AC Joint Sprains / Dislocations An acute acromioclavicular (AC) joint injury is frequently referred to as a shoulder separation. Classification of Injury: The degree of clavicular displacement depends on the severity of injury to the AC and Coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments, the AC joint capsule, and the supporting muscles of the shoulder (trapezius and deltoid) that attach to the clavicle. The traditional Allman and Tossy classification is a 3 -grade classification scheme. Rockwood expanded that classification to six types of injury. The Rockwood Type I injury NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 17 corresponds to the original Allman/Tossy Grade I; Roc kwood Type II to the original Allman/Tossy Grade II and Rockwood Types III -VI are in the original Grade III Allman/Tossy category. The Allman/Tossy classification and the corresponding Rockwood classification are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1: Allman/Tossy and Rockwood Classification Systems Allman Rockwood Grade I: Type I: Partial disruption of the AC ligament and capsule. Grade II: Type II: Sprains consisting of a ruptured AC ligament and capsule with incomplete injury to the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament, resulting in minimal AC Joint subluxation. Grade III: Type III: Separation or complete tearing of the AC ligament and/or CC ligaments, possible deltoid trapezius fascial injury, and dislocation of the AC Joint. OR Type IV: Dislocation consisting of a displaced clavicle that penetrates posteriorly through or into the trapezius muscle. OR Type V: Dislocation consisting of complete separation of the AC and CC ligaments and dislocation of the AC joint with a large CC interval. OR Type VI: Dislocation consisting of a displaced clavicle that penetrates inferior to the coracoid. Types I -III are common, while Types IV -VI are not and, when found, require surgical consultation. For AC joint degeneration from repetitive motion that is found to be work -related, see Impingement Syndrome. D.1.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.1.a.i Mechanism of Injury (AC Joint Sprains/Dislocations): generally, patients sustain an AC joint injury when they land on the point of the shoulder, driving the acromion downward, or fall on an outstretched hand or elbow, creating a backward and outward force on the shoulder. It is important to rule out other sources of shoulder pain from an acute injury, includi ng rotator cuff tear, fracture and nerve injury. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 18 D.1.b Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.1.b.i Tenderness at the AC joint, at times with contusions and/or abrasions at the joint area; prominence/asymmetry of the shoulder can be seen; and/or D.1.b.ii decreased shoulder motion, and tenderness of the distal end of the clavicle on palpation; there may be increased clavicular translation; cross -body adduction can cause exquisite pain. D.1.b.iii Positive piano sign produced with downward traction o n the ex tended limb with one finger on the acromion, and the other fingertip on the clavicle. A positive sign is present when the acromion displaces distally and the clavicle depresses , \"like depressing a piano key.\" D.1.c Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.1.d Testing Procedures X-ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Plain x -rays may include: D.1.d.i AP view; D.1.d.ii AP radiograph of the shoulder beam 10 degree cephalad (Zanca view); side -to-side comparison with 10 -15 lbs. of weight in each hand. D.1.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include: NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 19 D.1.e.i Procedures such as patient -directed thermal treatment and immobilization (up to six weeks for Type I -III AC joint separations). Immobilization treatments for Type III injuries are controversial. D.1.e.ii Medication, such as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories and ana lgesics, are indicated; narcotics are not normally indicated. D.1.e.ii.a Subacromial Space Injection with Steroids Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : May be therapeutic if the patient responded positively to a diagnostic injection of an anesthetic. Steroid injections directly into the tendons are not recommended. Frequency: Usually one or two injections are adequate. A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. Time to produce effect: Immediate with local anesthetic, or within three days with corticosteroids. Maximum duration: Limited to no more than three injections annually to the same site. D.1.e.iii Manipulation may be indicated in a Type II sprain. D.1.e.iv Physical medicine interventions should emphasize a progressive increase in range of motion without exacerbation of the AC joint injury. With increasing motion and pain control, a strengthening program should be instituted and a return to modified/limited d uty would be considered at this time. By eight to 11 weeks, with restoration of full or near -full motion, return to full duty should be anticipated. D.1.f Operative Procedures D.1.f.i With a Type III AC joint injury, an appropriate orthopedic consultati on could be considered initially, but should be considered when conservative care fails to increase function. D.1.f.ii With a Type IV -VI AC joint injury, an orthopedic surgical consultation is recommended. D.1.g Post -Operative Procedures These should be coordinated by the orthopedic and the primary care physician working with the interdisciplinary team. Keeping with the therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures found in this Shoulder NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 20 Guideline, the patient could be immobilized for two to t hree weeks, restricted in activities, both work -related and avocational, for six to eight weeks while undergoing rehabilitation, and be expected to progress to return to full duty based upon his/her response to rehabilitation and the demands of the job. D.2 Adhesive Capsulitis / Frozen Shoulder Disorder Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder, also known as frozen shoulder disorder, is a soft tissue lesion of the shoulder that affects the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints resulting in restrictions of passive and active range of motion. Occupational adhesive capsulitis arises secondarily to any chest or upper extremity trauma. It may also occur following stroke, traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury among other etiologies. Primary adhesive capsulitis is rarely occupational in origin. The disorder goes through stages, specifically: Stage 1: Consists of acute pain with some limitation in range of motion; generally lasting two to nine months. Loss of expected 2:1 degrees of glenohumeral to scapulothoracic motion. Stage 2: Characterized by progressive stiffness, loss of range of motio n, and muscular atrophy; it may last an additional four to 12 months beyond Stage 1. Stage 3: Characterized by partial or complete resolution of symptoms and restoration of range of motion and strength; it usually takes an additional six to nine months be yond Stage 2. D.2.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.2.a.i Mechanism of Injury: There often is some history of prior injury to the shoulder, shoulder tendon, ligament labrum or other structure . Often adhesive capsulitis is seen with impingement syndrome or other shoulder disorders; refer to appropriate subsection of this Guideline. D.2.a.ii Patient will usually complain of pain in the sub-deltoid region, but occasionally over the long head of the biceps or radiating down the lateral aspect of the arm to the forearm. Pain is often worse at night with difficulty sleeping on the involved side. Motion is restricted and painful. D.2.b Phys ical Findings Restricted active and passive glenohumeral and scapulothoracic NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 21 range of motion are the primary physical finding. It may be useful for the examiner to inject the glenohumeral joint with lidocaine and then repeat range of motion to rule out other shoulder pathology; failure to demonstrate an increase in the range of motion confirms the diagnosis. Postural changes and secondary trigger points along with atrophy of the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles may be seen. D.2.c Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is su spected. D.2.d Testing Procedures X-Ray D.2.d.i X-Ray or MRI Plain x -rays are generally not helpful , and MRI is generally not clinically indicated . Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated to rule out concomitant pathology , either in acute injury, or with injuries that have not responded/progressed with nonoperative treatment, when there is at least a moderately high index of suspicion of another underlying pathology . D.2.d.ii Arthrography Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: May be helpful in ruling out other pathology when other pathology is suspected or establishing the identification and diagnosis of a contracted joint capsule. Arthrography can also be therapeutic as steroids and/or anesthetics may be injected and a brisement or distension arthrogram can be done at the same time (refer to the next subsection on non -operative treatment procedures for further discussion). D.2.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures Non-Operative Treatment Procedures address the goal to restore and maintain function and may include: D.2.e.i Physical medicine interventions are the mainstay of treatment and may include thermal treatment, ultrasound, TENS, manual therapy, and passive and active range -of-motion exercises; as the patient progresses, strengthening NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 22 exercises should be included in the exercise regimen. D.2.e.ii Medications, such as NSAIDs and analgesics, may be helpful; narcotics are indicated only for post - manipulation or post - operative cases. D.2.e.iii Subacromial or Intra -articular space injection with steroids Recommended: in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Occasionally, subacromial bursa and/or glenohumeral and/or intra -articular space steroid injections can decrease inflammation and allow the therapist to increase functional exercise and range of motion. Subacromial space injection with steroids may be useful if the patient responded positively to a diagnostic injection of an anesthetic. Steroid injections directly into the tendons are not recommended. Frequency: Usually one or two injections are adequate. A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. Time to produce effect: Immediate with local anesthetic, or within three days with corticosteroids. Maximum duration: Limited to no more than three injections a nnually to the same site. D.2.e.iv Distension Arthrography or \"Brisement\" Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : In cases that are refractory to conservative therapy lasting at least three to six months and where range of motion remains significantly restricted (abduction less than 90), distension arthrography or \"brisement\" in which saline, an anesthetic and usually a steroid are forcefully injected into the shoulder joint causing disruption of the capsule may be consid ered. Early and aggressive physical medicine to maintain range of motion and restore strength and function should follow distension arthrogra phy or manipulation under anesthesia (MUA); return to work with restrictions should be expected within one week of the procedure; return to full duty is expected within four to six weeks. D.2.e.v Manipulation Manipulative treatment (not therapy) is defi ned as the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by a physician to improve NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 23 physiologic function and support homeostasis that has been altered by the injury or occupational disease and has associated clinical significance. Recommended: in select patients as clinically indicated. Frequency: Up to two to three times a week for eight to 12 weeks, as indicated by the severity of involvement and the desired effect, then up to 2 treatments per week for the next four weeks. Optimum duration : Eight to 12 weeks. Maximum duration : Three months. Extended durations of care beyond what is considered \"maximum\" may be necessary in cases of intractable adhesions, or when resumed after intra - articular injection, arthrogram or manipulation under anesthesia (performed by a qualified surgeon). Time to produce effect : for shoulder treatment: one to six treatments. D.2.f Operative Procedures D.2.f.i Manipulation Under General Anesthesia (MUA) Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : For cases failing conservative therapy of at least 3 -6 months duration and which are significantly limited in range of motion (abduction less than 90) . Manipulation Under General Anesthesia (MUA) may be indicated in cases of intractable restriction and may be performed by a duly qualified physician and surgeon. It may be done in combination with steroid injection or distension arthrography . D.2.g Post -Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Note: Early and aggressive physical medicine interventions are recommended to maintain range of motion and progress strengthening; return to work with restrictions after surgery should be discussed with the treating provider. The patient should be approaching MM I within 8 -12 weeks post - operative; however, NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 24 coexistence of other pathology should be taken into consideration. D.3 Bicipital Tendon Disorders Bicipital tendon disorders may include 1) tendonitis, which is exceedingly rare; 2) secondary bicipital tendinitis which is generally associated with rotator cuff tendinitis or impingement syndrome (refer to the appropriate diagnosis subsections); 3) subluxation of the biceps tendon which occurs with dysfunction of the transverse intertub ercular ligament and massive rotator cuff tears; and 4) acute disruption of the tendon, which can result from an acute distractive force or transection of the tendon from direct trauma. Evaluation of the elbow may be required when evaluating bicipital tendon injury. D.3.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.3.a.i Mechanism of Injury: Bicipital tendon disorders may include symptoms of pain and/or achiness that occur after repetitive use of the shoulder and/or blunt trauma to the shoulder. Secondary bicipital tendinit is may be associated with prolonged above -the-shoulder activities, and/or repeated shoulder flexion, external rotation and abduction. Acute trauma to the biceps tendon of the shoulder girdle may also give rise to injury of the biceps tendon. D.3.a.ii Disorders of the biceps tendon may rotator cuff injury, AC joint separation, subdeltoid bursitis, shoulder instability or other shoulder pathology. Symptoms may be exacerbated or provoked by work that activates the biceps muscle. S ymptoms may be exacerbated by other activities that are not necessarily work -related. D.3.a.iii Symptoms may include aching, burning and/or stabbing pain in the shoulder, usually involving the anterior medial portion of the shoulder girdle. The symptoms are exacerb ated with above -the-shoulder activities and those specifically engaging the biceps (flexion at the shoulder, flexion at the elbow and supination of the forearm). Relief occurs with rest. Patients may report nocturnal symptoms which interfere with sleep dur ing the acute stages of inflammation; pain and weakness in the shoulder during activities; repeated snapping phenomenon with a subluxing tendon; immediate sharp pain and tenderness along the course of the long head of the biceps following a sudden trauma which would raise suspicions of acute NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 25 disruption of the tendon; and/or with predominant pain at the shoulder, accompanied by referral pat terns which may extend pain into the cervical or distal structures, including the arm, elbow, forearm and wrist. D.3.b Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.3.b.i If continuity of the tendon has been lost (biceps tendon rupture), inspection of the shoulder would reveal deformity (biceps bunching); D.3.b.ii Palpation demonstrates tenderness along the course of the bicipital tendon; D.3.b.iii Pain at end range of flexion and abduction as well as biceps tendon activation; and/or D.3.b.iv Provocative testing may include: - pain with resisted supination of forearm; Speed's Test - pain with resisted flexion of the shoulder (elbow extended and forearm supinated); or Ludington's Test - pain with contraction of the biceps (hands are placed behind the head placing the shoulders in abduction and external rotation). D.3.c Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.3.d Diagnostic Testing Procedures D.3.d.i X-Ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Plain x -rays include: Anterior/Posterior (AP) view visualizes elevation of the humeral head, indicative of absence of the rotator cuff due to a tear; NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 26 Lateral view in the plane of the scapula or an axillary view determines if there is anterior or posterior dislocation or the presence of a defect in the humeral head (a Hill -Sachs lesion); 30 degrees caudally angulated AP view determines if there is a spur on the anterior/inferior surface of the acromion and/or the far end of the clavicle; and Outlet view determines if there is a downwardly tipped acromion. D.3.d.ii Sonography, MRI or arthrograph y (Adjunctive testing) Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: should be considered when shoulder pain is refractory to four to six weeks of non -operative conservative treatment and the diagnosis is not readily identified by standard radiographic techniques. D.3.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures Recommended - as clinically indicated. D.3.e.i Benefit may be achieved through rest followed by procedures such as thermal therapy, immobilization, alteration of occupation and/or workstation and manual therapy. D.3.e.ii Medications, such as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories and analgesics, are indicated; narcotics are not normally indicated . D.3.e.iii Physical medicine and rehabilitation interventions should emphasize a progressive increase in range of motion. With increasing motion and pain control, a strengthening program should be instituted and return to modified/limited duty would be considered at this time. By 8-11 weeks, with restoration of full motion, return to full duty should be anticipated. D.3.e.iv Soft tissue injections (biceps tendon insertion) with steroids Indications: May be therapeutic if the patient NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 27 responded positively to a diagnostic injection of an anesthetic. Steroid injections directly into the tendons are not recommended. Frequency: Usually one or two injections are adequate. A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. Time to produce effect: Immediate with local anesthetic, or within three days with corticosteroids Maximum duration : Limited to no more than three injections annually to the same site. D.3.f Operative Procedures - e.g., Arthroscopic partial or complete subscapularis tearing. Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. D.3.f.i Bicipital Tendinitis: Indications: Conservative care prior to potential surgery must address flexibility and strength imbalances. Surgical remedies would be considered after 12 weeks of appropriate conservative care has failed. Since impingement of the biceps tendon could cause continued irritation, an acromioplasty may be necessary, especially when the presence of an obstructing osteophyte is demonstrated on plain x-rays. D.3.f.ii Subluxing Bicipital Tendon: Indications: The decision to surgically stabilize the bicipital tendon is not commonly indicated. In the vast majority of cases, optimal outcome is achieved through successful rehabilitation procedures, and appropriate non - surgical measures should be maximized prior to surgical intervention. D.3.f.iii Acute Disruption of the Bicipital Tendon: Indications : Surgery has been shown to be more effective than conservative care in the treatment of full thickness ruptures of the distal Procedures (Bicipital Tendon Disorders) would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 28 communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Rehabilitation, lasting 6 -12 weeks, is necessary to facilitate maximu m medical improvement (MMI). D.4 Brachi al Plexus Injuries Brachi al plexus injuries to the nerves and shoulder girdle region result in loss of motor and sensory function, pain and instability of the shoulder. Signs and symptoms vary with the mechanism of i njury and the nature and extent of the neurological involvement . The two modes of injury are: 1) acute direct trauma, and 2) repetitive motion or overuse. Transient compression, stretch or traction (neuropraxia) causes sensory and motor signs lasting days to weeks. Damage to the axon ( axonotmesis ) without disruption of the nerve framework may cause similar symptoms. The recovery time is delayed and depends upon axon regrowth distally from the site of injury. Laceration or disruption of the entire nerve with complete loss of framework ( axonotmesis ) is the most severe form of nerve injury. Return of function is dependent upon regrowth of the nerve distal to the injury site , but total disruption of the axon sheath may mitigate against recovery . Electrodiagnostic studies (EDX) are the most commonly used diagnostic modality to analyze nerve injuries. These studies should be utilized when necessary as an extension of the history and clinical examination. Slowing of motor nerve conduction velocities due to demyelinization can be localize d to identify regions of entrapment and injury. Denervation demonstrated on the electromyographic portion is indicative of motor axonal or anterior horn cell loss. Studies should be performed three to four weeks follo wing injury or description of symptoms. If the symptoms have been present for longer than three to four weeks, studies may be performed immediately after the initial evaluation (initial as defined as the first encounter with the physician, not the date of injury) . Serial studies may be indicated if initial studies are negative and may also be useful for gauging prognosis. Limb temperature influences nerve conduction velocities. In cases when significant slowed conduction is recorded, the standard of the Ame rican Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) including temperatures should be followed. It is recommended and preferred that EDX in the outpatient setting be performed and interpreted by physicians board certified in neurology or physical medicine and Rehabilitation. There are six relatively common nerve injuries to the shoulder girdle. Each type will be addressed separately. D.4.a Brachial Plexus Brachial Plexus is formed by the nerve roots of C5 -C8 and T1; these nerve roots NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 29 exit the cervical spine and pass through the scalene musculature; after leaving the scalene musculature, at the level of the clavicle, they form trunks, divisions and chords wh ich ultimately form the peripheral nerves of the arm. D.4.a.i History and Mechanism of Injury Direct injury to brachial plexus results in widespread sensory and motor loss. Direct trauma, subluxation of the shoulder, clavicular fractures, shoulder depre ssion, and head deviation away from the arm may result in variable brachial plexus lesions. It is important to differentiate injuries to the brachial plexus from the acquired (non - plexus neuritis, D.4.a.ii.a Inspection for evidence of trauma or deformity; D.4.a.ii.b Identification of sensory loss and demonstration of weakness which relates to the severity and anatomy of the injury to the brachial plexus; and/or D.4.a.ii.c Pain with recreation of the motions during the mechanism of injury D.4.a.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.a.iv Testing Pro cedures Testing Procedures may include electrodiagnostic studies (EDX). If they do not localize and give sufficient information, then additional information may be obtained from MRI and/or myelography. These studies are employed to differentiate root avulsion from severe brachial plexus injuries. Evaluation of Treatment Procedures (Brachial Plexus): D.4.a.v.a In closed injuries, observation is favored ; repeat electrodiagnostic studies may be helpful to follow recovery. A sling may be indicated in moderate to severe presentations. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 30 D.4.aiv.b Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non - Operative. D.4.a.v.c Medications, such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants (e.g., gabepentin) may be indicated; steroids may be prescribed to help diminish the inflammatory response. Narcotics may be indicated acutely and should be prescribed as indicated for limited periods. D.4.a.vi Operative Procedures (Brachial Plexus): For open injuries, exploration may be worthwhile if there is poor progression of recovery from a conservative approach; for closed injuries, if progressive weakness and loss of function is documented after 4 -6 months of conservative care, then exploration is also w arranted. D.4.a.vii Post-Operative Procedures (Brachial Plexus) would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, surgeon and therapist. This program would begin with 4 -6 weeks of rest followed by progres sive increase in motion and strength. D.4.b Axillary Nerve Axillary Nerve is derived from the 5th and 6th cervical roots. It passes around the shoulder and supplies motor branches to the teres minor and the three heads of the deltoid; it gives sensation to the lateral aspect of the proximal arm at the level of the deltoid. D.4.b.i History and Mechanism of Injury Mechanism of Injury: direct injury and penetrating wounds to the shoulder and upward pressure on the axilla can cause injury to the axillary nerve; nerve injuries can also be seen with fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus and dislocation of the shoulder. Finally, axillary nerve injury can be seen with shoulder surgery in and of itself. D.4.b.ii Physical Findings D.4.b.ii.a Weakness and atrophy of the deltoid muscle; D.4.b.ii.b Strength is lost in abduction, flexion and NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 31 extension of the shoulder; and/or D.4.b.ii.c Sensory loss can be seen over the upper arm. D.4.b.ii i Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.b.iv Testing Procedures Electrodiagnostic Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: for patients with persistent symptoms. D.4.b.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.4.b.v.a Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative. D.4.b.v.b Medications such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants may be indicated and narcotics may on rare occasions be indicated acutely. D.4.b.vi Operative Procedures Operative Procedures are usually not necessary, since most injuries to the axillary nerve are due to stretch and/or traction. Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Surgery may be considered after four to six months with electrodiagnostic studies documenting ongoing enervation and loss of function. D.4.b.v ii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with four to six weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 32 D.4.c Long Thoracic Nerve Long Thoracic Nerve is formed by the cervical fifth, sixth, and seventh roots; it crosses the border of the first rib and descends along the posterior surface of the thoracic wall to the stratus anterior. D.4.c.i History and Mechanism of Injury Injury can occur by direct trauma to the posterior triangle of the neck or trauma may be the result of chronically repeated or forceful shoulder depression. Repeated forward motion of the arms as well as stretch o r compression of the nerve with the arms abducted can lead to long thoracic nerve dysfunction. D.4.c.ii Physical Findings (Long Thoracic Nerve) may include: D.4.c.ii.a Dull ache in the region of the shoulder without sensory loss; D.4.c.ii.b Scapular deformity and/or winging may be family; and/or D.4.c.ii.c Serratus Anterior (scapular winging) may be demonstrated by asking the patient to flex and lean on the patient's arms, such as against a wall and/or the examiner re sisting protraction. D.4.c.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.c.iv Testing Procedures Electrodiagno stic Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: When signs or symptoms persist, electrodiagnostic studies are used to define the anatomy and severity of the injury; side-to-side comparisons of the nerve can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Studies may also exclude more widespread brachial plexus involvement. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 33 D.4.c.v Non-Operative Procedures D.4.c.v.a Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non- Operative. D.4.c.v.b Medications, such - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants may be indicated, and narcotics, on rare occasions, may be indicated acutely. D.4.c.vi Operative Procedures Recommended - in very select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Operative Procedures such as scapular fixation may be recommended, but only in the most severe cases where there is documented significant loss of function. D.4.c.vii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an indiv idualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with eight to ten weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength. D.4.d Musculocutaneous Nerve Musculocutaneous Nerve is derived from the fifth and sixth cervical roots; it innervates the coracobrachialis, biceps and brachialis muscles and also provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the forearm. Trauma (including surgery) or penetrating wound t o the brachial plexus, coracobrachialis, and shoulder often can cause nerve injury. D.4.d.i History and Mechanism of Injury D.4.d.i.a Mechanism of Injury: most commonly a stretch/traction injury due to forceful extension of the elbow inducing nerve dysfunction; trauma can be seen to the sensory component (lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve) which delineates loss of sensation to the forearm. D.4.d.ii Physical Findings D.4.d.ii.a Pain in the arm; NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 34 D.4.d.ii.b Weakness and atrophy in the biceps and brachialis; and/or D.4.d.ii.c Sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the forearm; however, this is not always seen. D.4.d.ii.d Attenuation or loss of the biceps deep tendon reflex. D.4.d.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.d.iv Testing Procedures Electrodiagnostic Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Testing Procedures include electrodiagnostic studies when signs or symptoms persist; side -to-side comparisons of the motor and sensory components of the nerve may be useful since standard norms are not always reliable. D.4.d.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.4.d.v.a Rehabili tation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative. D.4.d.v.b Medications, such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, may be indicated. Narcotics, on rare occasions, ma y be indicated. D.4.d.vi Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Operative Procedures are usually not necessary unless there has been increasing loss of function over four to six months and/or a laceration to the nerve has been identified. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 35 D.4.d.vii Physical Findings Post-Operative Procedures would include an indivi dualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with eight to ten weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength. D.4.e Spinal Accessory Nerve Spinal Accessory Nerve is the eleventh cranial nerve; the nerve innervates the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles which are extremely important for scapular control and ultimately shoulder function. D.4.e.i History and Mechanism of Injury (Spinal Accessory Nerve): D.4.e.i.a Mechanism of Injury: direct trauma to the posterior neck, forceful compression of the shoulder downward and/or deviation of the head away from the traumatized shoulder can lead to injury to this nerv e; surgical procedures in the posterior neck can disrupt the nerve. D.4.e.ii Physical Findings may include: D.4.e.ii.a Pain in the shoulder; D.4.e.ii.b Weakness or paralysis of the trapezius which is seen as winging with the arms out to the side (abduc tion); and/or D.4.e.ii.c Drooping of the shoulder. D.4.e.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.e.iv Testing Procedures Electrodiagnostic Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Testing Procedures include electrodiagnostic studies when signs and symptoms persist. Electrodiagnostic studies are used to define the anatomy and severity of the injury; side -to-side comparisons of the nerve can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis; radiog raphic NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 36 procedures may be necessary to exclude lesion at the base of the brain or upper cervical spine. D.4.e.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.4.e.v. a Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non- Operative. D.4.e.v.b Medications, such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, may be indicated and narcotics, on rare occasions, may be indicated acutely. D.4.e.vi Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indication s: Operative Procedures are usually not necessary unless increased loss of function over four to six months has been documented and/or a laceration to the nerve has been identified. D.4.e.vii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the sur geon and the therapist. This program would begin with eight to ten weeks of rest followed by progressive increase in motion and strength. D.4.f Suprascapular Nerve Suprascapular Nerve is derived from the fifth and sixth cervical root, superior trunk of t he brachial plexus, and it innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles of the rotator cuff. D.4.f.i History and Mechanism of Injury D.4.f.i.a Mechanism of Injury: supraclavicular trauma, stretch, and friction through the suprascapular notch or against the transverse ligament at the notch can cause injury to the nerve; repetitive use of the arm has been shown on occasion to cause traction to the nerve. D.4.f.ii Physical Findings D.4.f.ii.a Pain at the shoulder; NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 37 D.4.f.i i.b Wasting at the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus muscles with weakness; and/or Tinel's can help to elicit a provocative pain response. D.4.f.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.4.f.iv Testing Procedures Electrod iagnostic Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Testing Procedures include electrodiagnostic studies when signs and symptoms persist. Side-to-side comparisons may be useful since standard norms are not always reliable. If one suspects a mass lesion at the suprascapular notch, then an MRI may be indicated. D.4.f.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.4.f.v.a Rehabilitation utilizing procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative. D.4.f.v.b Medications, such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, may be indicated and narcotics, on rare occasions, may be indicated acutely. D.4.f.vi Operative Treatment Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Operative Treatment involving surgical release at the suprascapular notch or spinoglenoid region is warranted depending upon the results of the electrodiagnostic studies and/or absence of improvement with conservative management. D.4.f.vii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. This program would begin with eight to ten weeks of rest followed by progressive incr ease in NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 38 motion and strength. D.5 Bursitis of the Shoulder Acute or chronic inflammation of the bursa (a potential fluid filled sac) that may be caused by trauma, chronic overuse, inflammatory arthritis, and acute or chronic infection that generally presents with localized pain and tenderness of the shoulder. D.5.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.5.a.i Mechanism of Injury: onset of symptoms, date, mechanism of onset, and occupational history and current requirements should be correlated w ith the intensity, character, duration and frequency of associated pain and discomfort. D.5.a.ii History may include nocturnal pain, pain with over -the- shoulder activities, feeling of shoulder weakness, prior treatment for presenting complaint(s), specif ic limitations of movement and pertinent familial history. D.5.b Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.5.b.i Palpation elicits localized tenderness over the particular inflamed tendon; loss of motion during activity; D.5.b.ii Painful arc may be seen between 40 -120 degrees ; and/or D.5.b.iii Bursitis may be associated with other shoulder injury diagnoses such as impingement, rotator cuff instability, tendinitis, etc.; refer to applicable diagnosis subsections for additional guidelines. D.5.c Laboratory Tests Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Laboratory Tests may be used to rule out systemic illness or disease when proper clinical presentation indicates the necessity for such testing. On rare occasions, when indicated, testing could include sedimentation rate, rheumatoid profile, complete blo od count (CBC) with differential and serum uric acid level. Routine screening of other medical disorders may be necessary, as well as bursal aspiration with fluid analysis. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 39 D.5.d Testing Procedures X-Ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Plain x -rays may be performed to rule out other shoulder pathology. D.5.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.5.e.i Benefits may be achieved through non -operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation and workstation , thermal therapy, and ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited to the firs t two to three weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are appropriate. D.5.e.ii May return to work without overhead activities and lifting with involved arm until cleared by physician for th ose and heavier activities. D.5.e.iii Additional modalities/treatment procedures may include physical medicine and rehabilitation including instruction in therapeutic exercise, proper work technique and manual therapy; vocational rehabilitation, vocational assessment and interdisciplinary team approach. Biofeedback Not Recommended D.5.e.iv Medications such as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories, oral steroids and analgesics may be considered. D.5.e.v Intrabursal Injection with Steroids Recommended Frequency: Not more than two to three times annually. Usually one or two injections adequate. A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. Maximum duration : Limited to three injections annually to the same site. D.5.f Operative Procedures Not Recommended - for pure bursitis. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 40 D.6 Impingement Syndrome A collection of symptoms, not a pathologic diagnosis. The symptoms result from the encroachment of the acromion, coracoacromial ligament, coracoid process, and/or the AC joint on the rotator cuff mechanism that passes beneath them as the shoulder is moved. The cuff mechanism is intimately related to the coracoacromial arch. Separated only by the thin lubricating sur faces of the bursa, compression and friction can be minimized by several factors, such as: Shape of the coracoacromial arch that allows passage of the subjacent rotator cuff; Normal undersurface of the capsular laxity; and Coordinated scapulothoracic function. The impingement syndrome may be associated with AC joint arthritis and both partial - and full -thickness rotator cuff tears, as well as adhesive capsulitis/frozen shoulder. Normal function of the rotator cuf f mechanism and biceps tendon assist to diminish impingement syndrome. D.6.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.6.a.i Mechanism of Injury: Established repetitive overuse of the upper extremity; many times this is seen with frequently repeated overhead motion. D.6.a.ii History may include: D.6.a.ii.a Delayed presentation: Since the syndrome is usually not an acute problem, patients will access care if their symptoms have not resolved with rest, time and \"trying to work it out\"; D.6.a.ii.b Complaints of functional losses due to pain, stiffness, weakness and catching when the arm is flexed and internally rotated; and D.6.a.ii.c Poor sleep is common and pain is often felt down the lateral aspect of the upper arm near the deltoid insertion or over the anter ior proximal humerus. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 41 D.6.b Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.6.b.i Inspection of the shoulder may reveal deltoid and rotator cuff atrophy; D.6.b.ii Range of motion is limited, particularly in internal rotation and in cross -body adduct ion; D.6.b.iii Passive motion through the 60 to 90 degree arc of flexion may be accompanied by pain and crepitus; this is accentuated as the shoulder is moved in and out of internal rotation; D.6.b.iv Active elevation of the shoulder is usually more uncomfortable than passive elevation; D.6.b.v Pain on maximum active forward flexion is frequently seen with impingement syndrome, but is not specific for diagnosis; D.6.b.vi Strength testing may reveal weakness. This weakness may be the result of pain, disuse, tendon damage, or poor scapulothoracic mechanics; D.6.b.vii Pain on resisted abduction or external rotation may also indicate that the integrity of the rotator cuff tendons may be compromised; and/or weakness of the posterior scapular stabilizers c an also be seen as a contributing factor to impingement syndrome by altering the mechanics of the glenohumeral joint. D.6.c Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.6.d Testing Procedures D.6.d.i X-Ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: May demonstrate calcification or bone spurs. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 42 D.6.d.ii Subacromial Space Injection Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications - Can be used as a diagnostic procedure by injecting an anesthetic, such as sensorcaine or xylocaine solutions, into the space. If the pain is alleviated with the injection, the diagnosis is confirmed. Adjunctive Testing (Sonography, Arthrography or MRI ) Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Such as standard radiographic techniques (sonography, arthrography or MRI), should be considered when shoulder pain is refractory to 4-6 weeks of non -operative conservative treatment and the diagnosis is not readily identified by a good history and clinical examination. D.6.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures may include: anti-inflammatories and analgesics. D.6.e.ii Subacromial Space Injection Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Subacromial space injection with steroids may be therapeutic if the patient responded positively to a diagnostic injection of an anesthetic. Steroid injections directly into the tendons are not recommended. Frequency : Not more than two to three times annually. Usually one or two injections adequate. A minimum of three weeks interval between injections is recommended. Time to produce effect : Immediate with local anesthetic, or within three days with corticosteroids. Maximum duration : Limited to three injections annually to the same site. D.6.e.iii Relative rest, immobilization, thermal treatment, ultrasound, therapeutic exercise and physical medicine and rehabilitation should be considered. Recommended NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 43 D.6.f Operative Procedures Operative Procedures for impingement syndrome should not be considered prior to an adequate trial of physical rehabilitation that includes direction and supervision by an appropriate, licensed professional and active patient participation. Such a trial sho uld normally last for a minimum of 6 weeks. Refer to Table 2: Criteria for Shoulder Surgery - Impingement Syndrome.

Conventional x- rays , AP, and true lateral or axillary view AND MRI, Ultra - sound or Arthrogram shows positive evidence of deficit in rotator cuff. Recommend 3 - 6 months: three months is adequate if treatment has been continuous, six months if treatment has been intermittent. Treatment must be directed toward gaining full range of m otion, which requires both stretching and strengthening to balance the musculature. Anterior Acromioplasty D.6.g Post-Operative Procedures D.6.g.i Individualized rehabilitation programs based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 44 the therapist might include: D.6.g.i.a Sling or abduction splint; D.6.g.i.b Gentle pendulum exercise, passive glenohumeral range of motion and aggressive posterior scapular stabilizing training can be instituted; D.6.g.i.c At four post -operative, begin isometrics and ADL involvement; and/or D.6.g.i.d Depending upon the patient's functional response, at six weeks post -operative consider beginning li ght resistive exercise; concomitantly, return to a light/modified duty may be plausible given the ability to accommodate \"no repetitive overhead activities.\" D.6.g.ii Progressive resistive exercise from two months with gradual returning to full activity a t 5-7 months; all active non- operative procedures listed in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative, should be considered. D.6.g.iii Work restrictions should be evaluated every four to six weeks during post -operative recovery and rehabilitation with appropriate written communications to both the patient and the employer. Should progress plateau, the provider should reevaluate the patient's condition and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan. D.7 Rotator Cuff Tears Partial or full -thickness tears of the rotator cuff tendons, most often the supraspinatus, can be caused by vascular, traumatic or degenerative factors or a combination. Further tear classification includes: a small tear is less than one centimeter ; medium tear is one to three centimeters ; large tear is three to five centimeters ; and massive tear is greater than five centimeter , usually with retraction. D.7.a History and Mechanism of Injury D.7.a.i Mechanism of Injury: established with sudden trauma to th e shoulder or chronic over -use with repetitive overhead motion with internal or external rotation. D.7.a.ii History may include: NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 45 D.7.a.ii.a Partial -thickness cuff tears usually occur in age groups older than 30. Full -thickness tears can occur in younger age groups. D.7.a.ii.b Complaints of pain along anterior, lateral or posterior glenohumeral joint. D.7.b Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.7.b.i Partial -Thickness Tears D.7.b.i.a There will be pain at the end of range of motion with full passive range of motion for abduction, elevation, external rotation; internal rotation is attainable; D.7.b.i.b Active range of motion will be limited and painful for abduction and external rotation, as well as internal rotation and forward flexion; D.7.b.i.c A painful arc may be present with active elevation; D.7.b.i.d Pain will be positive for resisted tests (abduction, flexion, external rotation, internal rotation, abduction/internal rotation at 90 degrees , and abduction/external rotation at 45 degrees ; and/or D.7.b.i.e If there are positive impingement signs, refer to Section D.6, Impingement Syndrome. D.7.b.ii Full-Thickness Tears D.7.b.ii.a Passive and resisted findings are similar to those for partial -thickness tears; and/or D.7.b.ii.b Active elevation will be severely limited with substitution of scapular rotation being evident. D.7.c Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 46 D.7.d Testing Procedures D.7.d.i X-ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. X-Rays include: D.7.d.i.a AP view visualizes elevation of the humeral head, indicative of absence of the rotator cuff due to a tear; this is a finding of a long -standing tear; D.7.d.i.b Lateral view in the plane of the scapula or an axillary view determines if there is anterior or posterior dislocation or the presence of a defect in the humeral head (a Hill -Sachs lesion); D.7.b.i.c 30 degrees caudally angulated AP view determines if there is a spur on the anterior/inferior surface of the acromion and/or the far end of the clavicle; and D.7.b.i.d Outlet view determines if there is a downwardly tipped acromion. D.7.d.ii Adjunctive Testing (Sonography, Arthrogra phy or MRI) Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indication s: Should be considered when shoulder pain is refractory to four to six weeks of non -operative conservative treatment and the diagnosis is not readily identified by standard radiographic techniques, then sonography, arthrography or MRI may be indicated. MRI should be performed sooner (e.g., one to two weeks), when there is cl inical suspicion of full -thickness rotator cuff tear. D.7.e Treatment Procedures D.7.e.i Medications, as nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories and analgesics, would be indicated; acute rotator cuff tear could indicate the need for limited narcotics use. D.7.e.ii Relative rest and non -operative treatment procedures, such as immobilization, therapeutic exercise, alteration of occupation/work -station, thermal treatment, and therapeutic ultrasound. Exclusive use of passive modalities should be limited t o the first two to three weeks during the acute phase of shoulder discomfort and accompanied by active therapies as soon as these are NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 47 appropriate. If no clinically significant increase in function for a partial - or full -thickness tear is observed after adequate participation in a rehabilitation program, a surgical consultation is indicated. Adequate is here defined as at least 75% attendance in an active physical therapy program with a minimum of two to three sessions per week for four weeks. A physical the rapy program that is based solely on passive modalities, or for which the claimant has not demonstrated compliance, is insufficient. Early surgical intervention produces better surgical outcome due to healthier tissues and often less limitation of movement prior to and after surgery.

D.9.b.iv Testing Procedures D.9.b. iv.a X-Ray Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : trauma series ( three views) are needed; view, axillary view and a lateral view in the plane of the scapula. Note: The latter two views are needed to determine if there is a glenohumeral dislocation. Note: Classification is by the Neer Method: there can be four fragments - the humeral shaft, humeral head, greater tuberosity, and the lesser tuberosity. The fragments are not truly considered fragments unless they are separated by 1 cm or are angulated 45 degrees or more. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 54 D.9.b. iv.b Vascular Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Are obtained emergently if the radial and brachial pulses are absent. D.9.b.v Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative Recommended: in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications: Impacted fractures of the humeral neck or greater tuberosity are managed non -operatively. Isolated and minimally displaced (less than 1 cm) fractures are treated non-operatively. Anterior or post erior dislocation associated with minimally displaced fractures can usually be reduced by closed means, but a general anesthetic is needed. May Include: Medications, such as analgesics and n onsteroidal anti -inflammatories, would be indicated. Narcotics may be indicated acutely for fracture and should be prescribed as indicated in Section E. 1. Immobilization is provided with a sling, to support the elbow, or with an abduction immobilizer if a non - impacted greater tuberosity fragment is presen t. D.9.b.v.a Immobilization is continued for four to six weeks. D.9.b.v.b Shoulder rehabilitation is begun with pendulum exercises ten to 14 days after injury. Subsequently, with pain control, the therapy program can be progressed with therapeutic approa ches noted in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non-Operative. D.9.b.v i Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Unstable surgical neck fractures (no contact between the fracture fragments). Partially unstable fractures (only partial contact) with associated same upper extremity injuries. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 55 Note: Displaced 3 - and 4 -part fractures may be managed by a prosthetic hemiarthroplasty and reattachment of the tuberosities. D.9.b.vi i Post-Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, surgeon and therapist. Refer to Section D.9.b.v, Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative, Proximal Humeral Fracture. D.9.c Fracture D.9.c.i History and Initial Diagnostic Procedures (Humeral Shaft Fracture) Mechanism of Injury: a direct blow can fracture the humeral shaft at the junction of its middle and distal thirds; twisting injuries to the arm will cause a spiral humeral shaft fracture; high energy (velocity or crush) will cause a comminuted humeral shaft fracture. D.9.c.ii Physical Findings Physical ii.a the arm; D.9.c.ii.b Bruising and swelling; and/or D.9.c.ii.c Possible sensory and/or motor dysfunction of the radial nerve. D.9.c.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 56 D.9.c.iv Testing Procedures D.9.c.iv.a Plain x -rays including AP view and lateral of the entire humeral shaft. D.9.c.iv.b Vascular studies if the radial pulse is absent. D.9.c.iv.c Compartment pressure measurements if the surrounding muscles are swollen, tense and painful and particularly if the fracture resulted from a crush injury. D.9.c.v Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.9.c.v.a Most isolated humeral shaft fractures can be managed non-operatively. D.9.c.v.b Medications, such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, would be indicated. Narcotics may be indicated acutely for fracture and should be prescribed as indicated in Section E.1.d. D.9.c.v.c A coaptation splint may be applied. The splint is s tarted in the axilla, extended around the elbow and brought up to the level of the acromion. It is held in place with large elastic bandages. D.9.c.v.d At two to three weeks after injury, a humeral fracture orthosis may be used to allow for full elbow mot ion. D.9.c.vi Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : For operative care would include: Open fracture; Associated forearm or elbow fracture (i.e., the floating elbow injury); Burned upper extremity; Associated paraplegia; Multiple injuries (polytrauma); A radial nerve palsy which came on after closed reduction; and/or Pathologic fracture related to an occupational injury. Accepted methods of internal fixation include: D.9.c.vi.a A broad plate and screws; and/or D.9.c.vi.b Intramedullary rodding with or without cross - locking screws. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 57 D.9.c.vii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeo n and the therapist. Following rigid internal fixation, therapy may be started to obtain passive and later active shoulder motion using appropriate therapeutic approaches as seen in Section D.9.c.v, Non -Operative Treatment Procedures, Humeral Shaft Fractur e. Active elbow and wrist motion may be started immediately. D.9.d Scapular Fracture D.9.d.i History and Mechanism of Injury (Scapular Fracture) Mechanism of Injury: these are the least common of the fractures about the shoulder and include acromial, glenoid, glenoid neck and scapular body fractures. With the exception of anterior glenoid lip fractures caused by an anterior shoulder dislocation, all other scapular fractures are due to a high energy injury. D.9.d.ii Physical Findings (Scapular Fracture) Physical Findings may include: D.9.d.ii.a Pain about the shoulder and thorax; D.9.d.ii.b Bruising and abrasions; D.9.d.ii.c Possibility of associated humeral or rib fractures; and/or D.9.d.ii.d Vascular problems (pulse evaluation and Doppler examination).

Indication s: Because of the association of high energy trauma, may include a complete blood count, urinalysis and chest x -ray. D.9.d.iv Testing Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 58 D.9.d.iv.a X-Ray X-ray trauma series ( three views) are needed: AP view, axillary view, and a lateral view in the plane of the scapula. D.9.d.iv.b Arteriography if a vascular injury is suspected. D.9.d.iv.c Electromyographic exam (EMG) if nerve injuries are Non-displaced acromial, coracoid, glenoid, glenoid neck and scapular body fractures may all be treated with the use of a shoulder immobilizer. Medication, such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, would be indicated. Narcotics may be indicated acutely for fracture and should be prescribed as indicated in Section E.1.d. Pendulum exercises may be started within the first week. Progress to assisted range of motion exercises at three to four weeks using appropriate therapeutic procedures. D.9.d.vi Operative Treatment Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. D.9.d.vi.a Acromial fractures which are displaced should be internally fixed to prevent a nonunion. These fractures may be fixed with lagged screws and a superiorly placed plate to neutralize the muscular forces. D.9.d.vi.b Glenoid fractures which are displaced greater than two to three mm should be fixed internally. The approach is determined by studying the results of a CT scan. D.9.d.vi.c Scapular body fractures require internal fixation if the lateral or medial borders are displaced to such a degree as to interfere with scapulothora cic motion. D.9.d.vi.d Displaced fractures of the scapular neck and the ipsilateral clavicle require internal fixation of the clavicle to reduce the scapular neck fracture. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 59 D.9.d.vii Post-Operative Procedures Post-Operative Procedures would include an individualized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. A shoulder immobilizer is utilized, pendulum exercises at one week, deltoid isometric exercises are started early, and, at four to six weeks, active range of motion is commenced. D.9.e Sternoclavicular Dislocation/Fracture D.9.e.i History and Mechanism of Injury Mechanism of Injury: established with sudden trauma to the shoulder/anterior chest wall ; anterior dislocations of the sterno - clavicular joint usually do not require active treatment; however, symptomatic posterior dislocations will require reduction. D.9.e.ii Physical Findings Physical Findings may include: D.9.e.ii.a Pain at the sternoclavicular area; D.9.e.ii.b Abrasions on the chest wall, clavicle and shoulder can be seen; D.9.e.ii.c Deformities can be seen in the above regions; and/or D.9.e.ii.d Pain with palpation and motion at the sternoclavicular joint area. D.9.e.iii Laboratory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.9.e.iv Testing Procedures X-Ray- Vascular Studies Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Indications : Plain x -rays of the sternoclavicular joint are routinely done. When indicated, comparative views of the NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 60 contralateral limb may be necessary. X-rays of other shoulder areas and chest wall may be done if clinically indicated. Indications: Vascular studies should be considered if the history and clinical examination indicate extensive injury. D.9.e.v Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative Symptomatic posterior dislocations should be reduced in the operating room u nder general anesthesia. D.9.e.v.a Immobilize with a sling for 3 -4 weeks. Subsequently, further rehabilitation may be utilized using procedures set forth in Section E, Therapeutic Procedures: Non- Operative. D.9.e.v.b Medications, such as analgesics and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatories, may be indicated; narcotics may be indicated acutely for fracture and should be prescribed as indicated for limited periods. Refer to Section E.1. D.9.e.v.c Manipulation (for Sternoclavicular Dislocation): Manipulative treatment (not therapy) is defined as the therapeutic application of manually guided forces by an operator to improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis that has been altered by the injury or occupational disease, and has associat ed clinical significance. Time to produce effect for shoulder treatment: one to six treatments . D.9.e.vi Operative Procedures Not Recommended D.10 Shoulder Instability Subluxation (partial dislocation) or dislocation of the glenohumeral joint in either an anterior, interior, posterior or multidirectional position. D.10.a History and Mechanism of Injury NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 61 D.10.a.i Mechanism of Injury: instability should be apparent following a direct traumatic blow to the shoulder, or indirectly by falling on an outstretched arm, or while applying significant traction to the arm, or may also develop with a cumulative trauma to the shoulder. Symptoms should be exacerbated or provoked by work and initially alleviated with a period of rest. Symptoms may be exacerbate d by other activities that are not necessarily work -related (e.g., driving a car). D.10.a.ii History may include: D.10.a.ii.a A slipping sensation in the arm; D.10.a.ii.b Severe pain with inability to move the arm; D.10.a.ii.c Abduction and external rotation produce a feeling that the shoulder might \"come out\"; or D.10.a.ii.d Feeling of shoulder weakness. D.10.a.iii In subacute and/or chronic instabilities, age of onset of instability is important in the history. Older age group (over age 3 0) has a propensity not to re -dislocate. Younger age groups need a more aggressive treatment plan. D.10.a.iv Avoid any aggressive treatment in patients with history of voluntary subluxation or dislocation. These patients may need a psychiatric evaluation. D.10.b Physical Findings D.10.b.i Anterior dislocations would likely include loss of normal shoulder contour; a fullness in the axilla; pain over the shoulder with any motion and often the patient holding the extremity in a very still position. D.10.b.ii Posterior dislocations usually occur with a direct fall on the shoulder or outstretched arm resulting in posteriorly directed forces to the humeral head. These patients present with inability to externally rotate the shoulder. D.10.b.iii Neurologic examination could reveal most commonly axillary nerve injuries, but occasionally musculocutaneous nerve injuries are seen. D.10.b.iv Abduction and external rotation positioning will produce pain in those who have anterior instabilit y. Direct posterior stress in a supine position will produce pain in those with posterior instability. Longitudinal traction will produce a \"sulcus sign\" (a large dimple on the lateral side of the shoulder) when there is inferior instability. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 62 D.10.c Labor atory Tests Are generally not indicated Recommended - in select patients where a systemic illness or disease is suspected. D.10.d Testing Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. D.10.d.i X-Ray Indications : Plain x-rays to rule out bony deficit on the glenoid, including AP, axillary view, lateral in the plane of the scapula and possibly the West Point view. Axillary view to identify larger Hill -Sachs lesion of humeral head. D.10.d.ii MRI/CT Indications : On more difficult diagnostic cases with subtle history and physical findings suggesting instability, MRI, or CT - assisted arthrogram or MRI - assisted arthrogram may be ordered for lateral detachment after four to eight weeks of therapy. (This is done only a fter other conservative therapies have failed.) D.10.e Non-Operative Treatment Procedures D.10.e.i First-Time Acute Severe Bony Involvement: D.10.e.i.a Therapeutic Procedures : Immobilization Therapeutic Exercise Superficial Heat and Cold Ultrasound TENS is not recommended Alteration of Occupation and Work station May not return to work with overhead activity or lifting with involved arm until cleared by physician for heavier activities. D.10.e.i.b Additional therapies may include: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation o Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 63 o Manual Therapy Techniques Medications o Analgesics o Anti-inflammatories D.10.e.i.c Biofeedback Not Recommended - for first -time acute severe bony involvement. D.10.e.ii Acute or chronic dislocations with large fracture fragments contributing to instability: D.10.e.ii.a Attempt to treat with immobilization if in acceptable position, otherwise repair surgically. D.10.e.ii.b Return to work may be directly related to time it takes for the fracture to heal. D.10.e.iii Subacute and/or chronic instability: D.10.e.iii.a Provocative dislocation should first be treated similarly to acute dislocation. D.10.e.iii.b If acute treatment is unsuccessful, and still having findings of instability, consider operative repair. D.10.f Operative Procedures Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. D.10.f.i Identify causative agent for the instability (i.e., labral detachment, lesion, Procedures The arm is immobilized in a sling for one to 12 weeks post -injury, depending upon the age of the patient. The patient is instructed in isometric exercises while in the sling for the internal and external rotators and the deltoid. Post-Operative Procedures would include an individua lized rehabilitation program based upon communication among the physician, the surgeon and the therapist. Depending upon the type of surgery, the patient will be immobilized for NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 64 three to six weeks. As soon as it is safe to proceed without damaging the repa ir, progressive therapy with consultation involving an occupational and/or physical therapist should begin with therapeutic exercise, physical medicine and rehabilitation. During this period of time, the patient could resume working when: D.10.g.i Medications which would predispose to injury are no longer being prescribed or used; and D.10.g.ii The treating physician has cleared the patient for the specific vocational activities. D.11 Superior Labrum Anterior and Poster (SLAP) Lesions Lesions of the superior aspect of the glenoid labrum that extend anteriorly and posteriorly in relation to the biceps tendon insertion. There are several different types of SLAP lesions described: 1) Type I is a fraying of the superior labral edge without de tachment of the labrum from the glenoid rim. 2) Type II is a detachment of the biceps anchor from the glenoid. Three distinct Type II lesions have been described as anterior only, posterior only, or combined anterior and posterior. 3) Type III is a bucket handle tear in the superior labrum only with biceps tendon and remainder of the superior labrum having stable attachment. 4) Type IV is a bucket handle tear as in Type III, but with extension of the tear in to the biceps tendon. Additional types of les ions have been described that include extensions of the above -described lesions or extensions of Bankart lesions. D.11.a History and Mechanisms of Injury D.11.a.i Mechanism of Injury: Com mon mechanisms of injury that are thought to contribute to SLAP lesions include: a) Compression injury such as fall on an outstretched arm with the shoulder in forward flexion and abduction or direct blow to the glenohumeral joint; b) Traction injury such as repetitive overhead throwing, attempting to break a fall fr om a height, and sudden pull when losing hold of a heavy object; NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 65 c) Motor Vehicle Accident d) Repetitive overhead motions with force such as pitching; or e) A fall on adducted arm with upward force directed on elbow. In some cases no mechanism of injury can be identified. D.11.a.i History may include: a) Symptoms with overhead throwing motions; b) Dislocation, subluxation, or subjective sense of instability; c) Poorly localized shoulder pain that is exacerbated by overhead activities; d) Catching, locking, popping or snapping; e) Subtle instability. D.11.b Physical Findings (SLAP Lesion) D.11.b.i The physical examination is often nonspecific secondary to other associated intra -articular abnormalities. D.11.b.ii No one test or combination of tests has been shown to have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity or positive predictive values for diagnosing SLAP lesion. Sensitivity and specificity are relatively low for individual tests and combinations. D.11.b.iii Overall physical examination tests for SLAP lesions may be used to strengthen a diagnosis of SLAP lesion, but the decision to proceed to operative management should not be based on physical examination alone. Speed Test Yergason's Test Active Compression (O'Brien) Test Jobe Relocation Test Crank Test Anterior Apprehension Maneuver Tenderness at the bicipital groove Anterior Slide (Kibler) Test NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 66 Compression Rotation Test Pain Provocation Test Biceps Load Test II D.11.c Diagnostic Testing Procedures (SLAP Lesion) D.11.c.i Radiographs are usually normal in isolated SLAP lesions. However, they can be useful in identifying other sources of abnormalities. D.11.c.ii Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with arthrogram has the highest reported accuracy for both diagnosis and classification of SLAP lesions; however, it may be difficult to differentiate SLAP lesions, especially Type II lesions, from normal anatomic variants and from asymptomatic age -related changes. D.11.c.iii Arthroscopic evaluation is the most definitive diagnostic test. D.11.d Non-Operative Treatment Procedures (SLAP Lesion) Most SLAP lesions are associated with other pathology such as rotator cuff tears, Bankart lesions, joint instability, biceps tendon tears, and supraspinatus tears. The provider should refer to the treatment p rotocols for these conditions and follow both the surgical and non -surgical recommendations. For suspected isolated SLAP lesions, non -invasive care, consider the following. D.11.d.i Medications such as analgesics and anti -inflammatories may be helpful. D.11.d.ii Therapeutic procedures may include instruction in therapeutic exercise and proper work techniques, and evaluation of occupational work station . D.11.d.iii Benefits may be achieved through therapeutic rehabilitation and rehabilitation intervention s. They should include range of motion (ROM), active therapies, and a home exercise program. Passive as well as active therapies may be used for control of pain and swelling. Therapy should progress to strengthening and an independent home exercise program targeted to further improve ROM and strength of the shoulder girdle musculature. D.11.d.iv Subacromial bursal and/or glenohumeral steroid injections may decrease inflammation and allow the therapist to progress with functional exercise and ROM. Time to Produce Effect: One injection. Maximum Duration: 3 injections in one year at least 4 to 8 weeks apart. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 67 Steroid injections should be used cautiously in diabetic patients. Diabetic patients should be reminded to check their blood glucose levels at least daily for 2 weeks after injections. D.11.d.v Return to work with appropriate restrictions should be considered early in the course of treatment. D.11.d.vi Other non -operative therapies may be employed in individual cases. D.11.e Surgical Indications There is a significant amount of normal anatomic variation of the superior glenoid labrum and origin of the long head of the biceps tendo n. Differentiation between normal variation and pathology is imperative. D.11.e.i The physician should identify other shoulder pathology if any exists and follow the appropriate surgical indications. If a SLAP lesion is suspected, an arthroscopic exam sh ould be performed in conjunction with the primary surgical procedure and an appropriate repair performed if necessary. or D.11.e.ii When no additional pathology is identified and there is an inadequate response to at least three months of non-operative management with active patient participation as evidenced by continued pain with functional limitations and/or instability significantly affecting activities of daily living or work duties. D.11.e.iii Prior to surgical intervention, the pati ent and treating physician should identify functional operative goals and the likelihood of achieving improved ability to perform activities of daily living or work activities and the patient should agree to comply with the pre- and post -operative treatmen t plan and home exercise requirements. The patient should understand the length of partial and full disability expected post - operatively. The patient should also understand that 1) non -operative treatment is an acceptable option and that 2) a potential complication of the surgery is shoulder stiffness with pain and possibly decreased function. D.11.f Operative Procedures (SLAP lesion) Operative treatment of SLAP lesions depends on the type of lesion present and whether any other intra -articul ar abnormalities are present. The following are generally accepted protocols for surgical intervention. D.11.f.i Type I: Debridement is reasonable but not required; NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 68 D.11.f.ii Repair anchors options; D.11.f.iii Type III: Debridement or excision of the bucket handle component alone or repair via suture anchors or biceps tenotomy/tenodesis are reasonable options IV: Debridement tenotomy D.11.g Post -Operative Treatment (SLAP lesion) Post -operative rehabilitation programs should be individualized and dependent upon whether any other intra -articular abnormalities exist and were operatively treated. There is a paucity of information on rehabilitation of isolated SLAP lesions. Common post -operative care involves wearing a sling, without active shoulder motion for 4 to 6 weeks. Elbow, wrist, and hand range -of-motion (ROM) exercises may be used at this time. The sl ing is removed at 4 to 6 weeks and active ROM is usually begun with restrictions directed by the surgeon. It is reasonable to restrict external rotation and abduction up to six months post-operative. E. Therapeutic Procedures: Non -Operative E.1 Medicati ons For most patients, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamol) may be a reasonable alternative to NSAIDs for patients who are not candidates for NSAIDs, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (including tramadol) and less impairing. E.1.a Non-Steroidal Anti -inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) for Treatment of Acute, Subacute, or Chronic Shoulder pain Recommended - for treatment of acute, subacute, or chronic shoulder pain Indications : For acute, subacute, or chronic shoulder pain, NSAIDs are recommended for treatment. Over -the-counter (OTC) agents may suffice and should be tried first. Frequency/Duration : As needed use may be reasonable for many patients. Indications for Discontinuation: Resolution of symptoms, lack of efficacy, or developm ent of adverse effects, that necessitate discontinuation. E.1.b NSAIDs for Patients at High Risk of Gastrointestinal Bleeding NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 69 Recommended - for concomi use of cytoprotective classes of drugs: misoprostol, sucralfate, histamine Type 2 receptor block ers, and proton pump inhibitors for patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indication s: For patients with a high -risk factor profile who also have indications for NSAIDs, cytoprotective medications should be considered, particularly if longer term treatment is contemplated. At -risk patients include those with a history of prior gastrointestinal bleeding, elderly, diabetics, and cigarette smokers. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol, sucralfate, H2 blockers recommen ded. Dose and frequency per manufacturer. There is not generally believed to be substantial differences in efficacy for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. Indications for Discontinuation : Intolerance, development of adverse effects, or discontinuation of NSAID. E.1.c NSAIDs for Patients at Risk for Cardiovascular Adverse Effects Patients with known cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease should have the risks and benefits of NSAID therapy for pain d iscussed. Recommended - Acetaminophen or aspirin as the first -line therapy appear to be the safest regarding cardiovascular adverse effects. Recommended - If needed, NSAIDs that are non -selective are preferred over COX -2 specific drugs. In patients receiving low -dose aspiri n for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, to minimize the potential for the NSAID to counteract the beneficial effects of aspirin, the NSAID should be taken at least 30 minutes after or 8 hours before the daily aspirin. E.1.d Acetami nophen for Treatment of Shoulder Pain Recommended - for treatment of shoulder pain, particularly in patients with contraindications for NSAIDs. Indications : All patients with shoulder pain, including acute, subacute, chronic, and post -operative. Dose /Frequency : Per manufacturer's recommendations; may be utilized on an as-needed basis. There is evidence of hepatic toxicity when exceeding four gm/day. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, adverse effects or intolerance. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 70 Rationale for Re commendations : For most patients, generic ibuprofen, naproxen, or other older generation NSAIDs are recommended as first -line medications. Second -line medications should include one of the other generic medications. Acetaminophen (or the analog paracetamo l) may be a reasonable alternative for these patients, although most evidence suggests acetaminophen is modestly less effective for arthrosis patients. There is evidence that NSAIDs are as effective for relief of pain as opioids (and tramadol) and less impairing. E.1.e Topical Medications Recommended - In select patients for treatment of pain associated with acute, subacute, or chronic shoulder pain . including topical creams, ointments, and lidocaine patches Rationale for Recommendation : TOPICAL DRUG DELIVERY (e.g., capsaicin, topical lidocaine, topical NSAIDs and topical salicylates and nonsalicylates) may be an acceptable form of treatment in selected patients. A topical agent should be prescribed with strict instructions for application and maximum number of applications per day to obtain the desired benefit and avoid potential toxicity. For most patients, the effects of long -term use are unknown and thus may be better used episodically. These agents may be used in those patients who prefer topical treatments over oral medications. Localized skin reactions may occur, depending on the medication agent used. Prescribers should consid er that topical medication can result in toxic blood levels. Capsaicin offers a safe and effective alternative to systemic NSAIDs, although its use is limited by local stinging or burning sensation that typically disappears with regular use. Patients shou ld be advised to apply the cream on the affected area with a plastic glove or cotton applicator to avoid inadvertent contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Long -term use of capsaicin is not recommended. Topical Lidocaine is only indicated when there is d ocumentation of a diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In this instance, a trial for a period of not greater than four weeks can be considered, with the need for documentation of functional gains as criteria for additional use. Topical NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac g el) may achieve tissue levels that are potentially therapeutic. Overall the low level of systemic absorption can be advantageous, allowing the topical use of these medications when systemic administration is relatively contraindicated (such as patients wit h hypertension, cardiac failure, peptic ulcer disease or renal insufficiency). Topical Salicylates or Nonsalicylates (e.g. methyl salicylate) overall do not appear to be more effective than topical NSAIDs. May be used for a short -term course especially in patients with chronic conditions in whom systemic medication is relatively contraindicated or as an adjuvant to systemic medication NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 71 E.1.f Opioids Not Recommended - for acute, subacute, or chronic shoulder pain. Recommended - for limited use (not more than seven days) for post -operative pain management as adjunctive therapy to more effective treatments. Indications: For post -operative pain management, a brief prescription of opioids as adjuncts to more efficacious treatments (especially NSAIDs, acetaminophen) is often required, especially nocturnally. Frequency/Duration: Prescribed as needed throughout the day, then later only at night, before weaning off completely. Rationale for Recommendation : Some patients have insufficient pain relief with NSAIDs, thus judicious use of opioids may be helpful, particularly for nocturnal use. Opioids are recommended for brief, select use in post -operative patients with primary use at night to achieve sleep post -operatively. E.1.g Hypnotics Hypnotics may be given to shoulder injury sufferers because of a chief complaint of \"inability to sleep.\" Such medications must be used with caution because of their dependence -producing capabilities. Physical methods of restoring a normal sleep pattern can usually be employed as an alternative to medication. Time to produce effect: 1 -3 days. Frequency: At night. Optimum duration: 1 week. Maximum duration: 2 -3 weeks E.1.h Psychotropic/Anti -Anxiety Medications Not recommended. [Note: These guidelines do recommend the use of antidepressant medications in limited circumstances, and in select patients, such as with specific nerve injuries.] E.1.i Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Not Recommended . E.2 Immobilization Time is dependent upon type of injury, then progress with muscle girdle strengthening. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 72 Time to produce effect: 1 day. Frequency: Once. Optimum duration: 1 week. Maximum duration: 12 weeks. The arm is immobilized in a sling for 1 -12 weeks post -injury, depending upon the age of the patient. The patient is instructed in isometric exercises while in the sling for the internal and external rotators and the deltoid. E.2.a Kinesiotaping, Taping or Strapping Recommended - for acute joint immobilization (for example, acute ankle sprain) . Not Recommended - for acute or non -acute pain. E.3 Relative Rest Relative Rest may last three to five weeks and require job modification/modified duty so as not to exacerbate the acute inflamed shoulder. E.4 Therapeutic Exercise Rehabilitation Rehabilitation (supervised formal therapy) required as a result of a work -related injury should be focused on restoring functional ability required to meet the patient's daily and work activities and return to work; striving to restore the injured worker t o pre -injury status in so far as is feasible. Active therapy requires an internal effort by the patient to complete a specific exercise or task. Passive therapy are those interventions not requiring the exertion of effort on the part of the patient, but rather are dependent on modalities delivered by a therapist. Generally passive interventions are viewed as a means to facilitate progress in an active therapy program with concomitant attainment of objective functional gains. Active interventions should be emphasized over passive interventions. The patient should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapies at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement levels. Assistive devices may be included as an adjunctive measure incorporated into the rehabilitation plan to facilitate functional gains. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 73 E.4.a Therapy Active E.4.a.i Therapy Active E.4.a.i.a Physical / Occupational Therapy Recommended - to improve function, including range of motion and strength. Frequency/Dose/Duration : Frequency of visits is usually individualized based on severity of the limitation. Two to three visits per week for two weeks are often used to initiate an exercise program. Total numbers of visits may be as few as two to three for mild patients or up to 12 to 15 with documentation of objective functional improvement. As part of the rehabilitation plan, patients should be instructed to continue both active and passive therapy, at home as an extension of the treatment process in order to maintain improvement. Indications : All postoperative and conservatively managed patients. Indications for Discontinuation : Resolution of pain, intolerance, lack of effic acy or noncompliance. E.4.a.i.b Therapeutic Exercise Therapeutic exercise where the therapist instructs the patient in a supervised clinic and home program to increase strength of the supporting shoulder musculature. Motions and muscles to be strengthened include shoulder internal and external rotators, abductors and scapula stabilizers. Isometrics are performed initially, progressing to isotonic exercises as tolerated. Recommended - in select patients as clinically indicated. Frequency : Typically two to three times/week for eight to 12 weeks as noted below. Weeks 1 -3: Isometrics in sling. Weeks 3 -8: Progressive isotonic exercises. Weeks 8 -12: Begin overhead activities when the rotator cuff strength is normalized, and full active elevat ion has been achieved. NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 74 E.5 Superficial Heat and Cold Superficial heat and cold therapies are thermal agents applied in various manners that lower or raise the body tissue temperature for the reduction of pain, inflammation, and/or effusion resulting from injury or induced by exercise. It may be used acutely with compression and elevation. Indications include acute pain, edema and hemorrhage, need to increase pain threshold, reduce muscle spasm and promote stretching/flexibility. Includes portable cryotherapy units. May be performed in conjunction with other active therapy or may be self - administered by the patient. Time to produce effect: Immediate. Frequency: two to five times per week. Optimum duration: three weeks as primary, or up to two months if used intermittently as an adjunct to other therapeutic procedures, or longer for adhesive capsulitis (Refer to Section D.2, Adhesive Capsulitis.) Maximum duration: two months. E.6 Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) TENS treatment should include at least one instructional session for proper application and use. Indications incl ude muscle spasm, atrophy and control of concomitant pain in the office setting. Minimal TENS unit parameters should include pulse rate, pulse width and amplitude modulation. Consistent, measurable, functional improvement must be documented and determinati on of the likelihood of chronicity prior to the provision of a home unit. TENS treatment should be used in conjunction with active physical therapy. Time to Produce Effect: Immediate. Frequency: Variable. Optimum Duration: 3 sessions. Maximum Duration: 3 sessions. Purchase or provide with home unit if effective. E.7 Therapeutic Ultrasound With or Without Electrical Stimulation Therapeutic ultrasound with or without electric stimulation using sonic generators to deliver acoustic energy for ther apeutic thermal and/or non - thermal soft tissue treatment. Indications include scar tissue, adhesions, collagen fiber and muscle spasm, and the need to extend muscle tissue or accelerate the soft tissue healing. Time to produce effect: six to 15 treatment s. Frequency: three times/week. Optimum duration: four weeks, or longer for adhesive capsulitis. (Refer to Section D.2, Adhesive Capsulitis.) NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 75 E.8 Electrical Therapeutic Modality Electrical Therapeutic Modality can be utilized as an adjunct for recovery. In order to justify its use, one must provide documentation regarding functional gains. Time to produce effect: eight to 12 sessions. Frequency: three times/week. Optimum duration: four weeks. E.9 Return to Work May return to work with no overhead activity, lifting, or repetitive motion with the involved arm until cleared by the primary treating physician for heavier activities. Each case regarding task tolerance should be individualized based on the diagnosis and job demands. E.10 Biofeed back Not Recommended E.11 Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation E.11.a Instruction in Therapeutic Exercise and Proper Work Techniques An active therapeutic exercise program may be beneficial and should contain elements of improving patient flexibility, mobility, posture/body mechanics, activities of daily living, splinting, bracing, sensory reeducation, endurance, strength and education. Time to produce effect: 2 weeks. Frequency: 2 -3 times/week. Optimum duration: 4 -6 weeks, or longer for ca ses of adhesive capsulitis. Refer to Section D.2.e, Non -Operative Treatment Procedures (Adhesive Capsulitis/Frozen Shoulder). Maximum duration: 12 weeks. E.11.b Manual Therapy Techniques Soft tissue mobilization/manipulation techniques may be used as an adjunctive treatment modality. E.11.c Post -Operative Treatment Post-Operative Treatment may include scar/adhesion reduction NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 76 techniques. E.12 Therapy: Ongoing Maintenance Care A maintenance program of physical therapy or occupational therapy may be i ndicated in certain situations, after the determination of MMI, when tied to maintenance of functional status. Although the current body of scientific evidence as reviewed does not support the routine use of this intervention, maintenance therapy modaliti es may be indicated in certain situations in order to maintain functional status, without which an objective deterioration of function has been previously observed and documented in the medical record. Specific objective goals should be identified and mea sured in order to support the need for ongoing maintenance care. Progressively longer trials of therapeutic withdrawal are to be attempted to ascertain whether therapeutic goals can be maintained in the absence of clinical interventions. Within a year and annually thereafter, a trial without maintenance treatment should be instituted. The care of chronic shoulder symptoms should include an ongoing patient self - management plan performed by the patient regularly and a self -directed pain management p lan initiated as indicated: An ongoing clinically appropriate self -management plan, typically independent, home -based and self -directed, developed jointly by the provider and patient, should be implemented to encourage physical activity and/or work activit ies despite residual pain, with the goal of preserving function. In addition to the self -management plan, a self -directed pain management plan should be developed which can be initiated by the patient in the event that symptoms worsen and function decreas es. If deterioration of ability to maintain function is documented, reinstatement of ongoing maintenance may be acceptable. Frequency: Maximum up to ten visits/year, after the determination of MMI, according to objectively documented maintenance of functional status. No variance from the maximum frequency is permitted. Ongoing Maintenance Care is a component of the Functional Maintenance Care recommendat ions detailed in the New York Non -Acute Pain Medical Treatment NYS WCB MTG - Shoulder Injury 77 Guidelines . Please consult the New York Non -Acute Pain Medical Treatment Guidelines for additional information.
