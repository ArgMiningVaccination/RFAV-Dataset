Our energy drinks use natural ingredients including natural caffeine and can be enjoyed daily if not consumed to excess. Replace your morning coffee with an energy drink, or enjoy one for an afternoon pick-me-up. Everyone's tolerance to caffeine varies. It is recommended by The U.S. Food and Drink Administration that adults consume no more than 400mg per day. This is around 4 cups of coffee or 2-4 energy drinks, depending on the brand. Check each product's page or packaging for its caffeine content. Do energy drinks reduce fatigue? In general, energy drinks are considered to reduce fatigue. The most popular reason for people consuming energy drinks is to increase mental alertness. A [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15549275/) has found that energy drinks may have the capacity to improve cognitive performance and alleviate fatigue. Of course, everyone's body is different and what works for you might not work for the next person. We have selected a range of healthy energy drinks that we believe will deliver a natural dose of energy when you need to combat fatigue. If in doubt, exercise caution and find what works best for you. If you are worried about your health, speak to a medical professional. Are vegan energy drinks good for kids? It is usually recommended that young kids do not consume energy drinks. Caffeine has a greater effect on children than on adults and experts suggest kids under the age of 12 should not consume caffeine. It is generally advised that kids over the age of 12 consume no more than 100mg of caffeine per day, which is less than many energy drinks. It is best to be cautious and always check the information on a product's page or packaging for information on its caffeine content. If your child consumes caffeine and it has adverse effects, seek help from a medical professional. "}
