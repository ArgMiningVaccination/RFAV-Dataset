Click Here For Our COVID-19 Safety Guidelines Dear Village Zendo Members and Friends, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that transmission rates for COVID-19 in our local counties are low. As a result, the Executive Committee of the Village Zendo has determined that effective immediately the use of masks will be optional for in-person practice at the Zendo. We will no longer require proof of vaccination to enter the Zendo. You are still very welcome to wear a mask when you attend Village Zendo events. If you have a condition that impairs your immune system, and if you are over the age of 75, we recommend that you wear a mask. If you have fever, chills, cough, sneezing, runny nose or a new rash please take appropriate care of yourself and do not come to the Zendo until you have recovered. If you have been exposed to COVID-19 recently, please wear a mask. Any member may still choose to wear masks or N95s. Please respect their decision. Please be aware that if community transmission of COVID-19 or Flu return to CDC high or substantial levels, we may be required to return to mandatory masking. Staying up-to-date with vaccines remains the most important way to prevent the serious complications from COVID-19.
