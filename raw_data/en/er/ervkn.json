Over the past 8 years I have taken over 100 hours of in person training and over 200 hours of virtual training on the integration of oils and Chinese Medicine. One of the ways I use oils, and guide others to use oils, is by applying them to acupuncture points to create shifts similar to those seen with acupuncture needles. Each acupuncture point and each essential oil has a unique energetic vibration and a unique history. When they all align, magic can happen. Aroma Acupoint Therapy is gentle, completely safe and yet profoundly effective treatment modality that utilizes the energetic potential locked within pure essential oils. Treatment involves placing particular oils on specific acupoints or reflex zones on the body in order to trigger energetic changes in the individual that will bring her back to a state of balance. Aroma Acupoint Therapy works on the basis of mutual resonance through the systematic and intentional combination of essential oils and acupoints, resulting in a more significant clinical effect than using either of these treatment methods alone. How Aroma Acupoint Therapy Works The basic premise is that essential oils, being energetically just as active as acupuncture points, have the ability to stimulate the points in a similar way as needles. However, the difference between them lies in the fact that unlike acupuncture needles, essential oils are also able to provide a content of information to the point that will suggest a particular type of therapeutic action. The basic aim is always to select an oil that possesses the same function as an acupoint; an oil that will activate a particular point function. "}
