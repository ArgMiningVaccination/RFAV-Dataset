It still enjoys the faith of a large number of people of our country though it is perhaps , the oldest system of healing in the world. It is encouraged in many countries like Japan, Germany etc Definition The term \" Ayurveda\" is derived from two Sanskrit words , Ayur and Veda . Ayur means life and Veda means knowledge or science. Therefore Ayurveda means science of life or way of life. Ayurveda incorporates science, religion and philosophy in it. Besides, dealing with principles for maintenance of health , it as also developed a wide range therapeutic measures to combat illness. Principle The principle of Ayurveda is based on the concept of five basic elements and tridoshas. According to Ayurveda, the whole universe made up of five basic elements ( Pancha mahabuthas) The whole universe includes the material world, plant kingdom and all other living beings. In other words ,these five elements together form the basis of all matter. The five elements are - Akasha (ether), Vayu ( air), Agni (fire), Jala (water), Prithvi (earth) There is a balanced condensation of these elements in different proportions to suit the needs and requirements of different structures and functions of the body matrix and its parts. The growth and development of body matrix depends on its nutrition i.e.. on food. The food, in turn, is composed of above elements. The health or sickness depends on the presence or absence of a balanced state of the total body matrix including the balance between its different constituents . The properties , location and manifestations of these elements are as follows Ether is non resistance, it is located in he body cavities like mouth, thorax, abdomen, lung cavity, digestive tract. Air is related to movements, vibrations and oscillations. They manifests movement of muscles, pulsation of heart, expansion and contraction of lungs, functioning of digestive and nervous systems. Fire concerned to radiation, it manifests digestion, metabolism, temperature, vision and intelligence. Water is related to force and cohesion. Located in cytoplasm, blood, salivary glands, gastric juice. Earth is concerned to resistance and solidarity. They manifests skin, nails, hairs and bones. These elements manifest in the functioning of our scenes. They are also closely related to our ability to perceive and interact with environment. TRIDOSHAS The five elements combine to form \" Tri Doshas\" i.e Vata, Pitta, and Kappha. They are the \" Basic Forces '' and also known as the \" Pillars of Life\" Vata (Air principle) the elements ether and air Pitta (Fire principle) the elements fire and water Kapha ( Water principle) the elements earth and water According to the Ayurveda , sickness is due to the imbalance of any one or more of the three doshas. Eg Aggravation of Pitta leads to indigestion, skin diseases and liver problems. Diagnosis In Ayurveda diagnosis is always done of the patient as whole. Diagnosis is carried out to find out which dosha is aggravated. For his purpose , nadi (Pulse),tongue , skin, physical features, stool, urine etc are examined. Treatment The importance of treatment is to restore the balance and harmony of doshas with proper diet and drugs Selection of the drugs - Based upon 1. Rasa (Taste), 2. Virya (Potency) and Vipaka (Taste after digestion) RASA Rasa indicates the composition, properties and and probable action of the drugs . There are six tastes. Each taste has one or more mahabuthas (elements) and each taste has its own influence on doshas. Eg Sweet ( earth and water) , - Kapha increases, vata and pitta deceases and promote antibiotic activities Sour - (Water and fire) - Pitta increases - stimulates enzymes Saline- (Fire and earth)- Pitta increases Bitter - (Air and fire) - Pitta increases Pungent- (Air and ether)- Kapha and earth)- Pitta and vatta increases VIRYA On the basis of Virya, the drugs are classified into hot and cold drugs Hot (Ushna) drugs - Aggravates pitta and pacifies vata and kapha, drumstick Jeera, amla Vipaka Food and medicine undergoes various changes during digestion (metabolism). The taste after digestion is known as vipaka. The three tastes described under vipaka, sweet, sour and pungent. Sweet - Aggravates kapha and alleviates pitta and vatha Sour - Aggravates vatha Pungent - Aggravates vatha and alleviates kapha INTRODUCTION There are so many alternative ways of treatment in whole world other than allopathy, which serve humanity for curing diseases & ailments that comes under the alternative system of health care . DEFINATION ''Those pathies which are widely used for the treatment of diseases in very natural way other than allopathy is known as alternative medicine of treatment'' The process of treatment of these alternative medicine includes ancient types of procedure, have there unique features, unique ways of treatment of different diseases, unique principles & laws which they follow & also unique medicine, those totally different from allopathic medicine. IN INDIA There are some pathies of alternative medicine which are widely used for treatment now a days include:- 1. Ayurvedic 2. Homoeopathy 3. Unani 4. Yoga 5. Sujok 6. Siddha 7. Naturopathy 8. Acupressure & Acupuncture. HOMEOPATHY SYSTEM OF MEDICINE Homeopathy is relatively a recent system of medicine. The word \" Homeopathy\" is derived from two Greek words , Homois meaning similar and pathos meaning suffering. Homeopathy simply means treating diseases with remedies, prescribed in minute doses, which are capable of producing symptoms similar to the disease when they taken by the healthy people. It is based on the natural law of healing. \"Similia Similibus Curantur \" which means \"Likes are cured by likes\" ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT Homoeopathy is a system of medical treatment introduced by Dr.Christian Friedrich Samual Hahnenann, a German physician. he had spread a long and useful life of 88 years during which he benefited the suffering humanity immense by introducing this new system of medicine. DIFINATION & MEANNING Homoeopathy is a system of treatment (branch of medical science) works on the principle of ''Similia similibus curenter''. Means like cures like , further explanation is that patient & medicine symptoms are similar, it also called LAW OF SIMILA ABOUT THE FOUNDER DR.HAHNEMANN The Founder of homoeopathy was born on 10th April, 1755 at Meissen in saxony of Germany. He was basically a M.D Medicine allopathic doctor who turned in to Homoeopath. He Died on 2nd july 1843. DISCOVERY OF HOMOEOPATHY Because some dissatisfaction on that time about there practicing way of treatment i.e. allopathy, he relinquished ( to give up) the medical practice and devoted himself in translating the books, because Hahnemann had knowledge about the various language. In 1790, when Hahnemann was engaged in translating Cullen's materia medica his attention was arrested by the remark of author that cinchona bark cured malaria because of its bitterness and tonic effects of stomach. This explanation appeared unsatisfactory to him. Hahnemann himself ingested cinchona juice, He was attacked by symptoms very similar to malarial fever. This unexpected result set up in his mind a new train of thoughts and he conducted similar experiments on himself and other individuals with other medicines whose curative action in certain diseases had been well established. He found that in the healthy persons the medicine produce symptoms very similar to what they cure in diseases individuals. So he had led to the inference that medicine cure disease only because they can produce similar symptoms in healthy individuals. The whole of homoeopathy derives from this Law. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPAL OF HOMOEOPATHY 1. Law of Similia 2. Law of Simplex 3. Law of Minimum 4. Doctrine of Drug proving 5. Theory of Chronic disease 6. Theory of Vital force 7. Doctrine of Drug-dynamization Principle The cause of the disease itself can be its treatment i.e. Law of similar. This is the basic principle of homeopathy. According to Hahnemann, diseases are congenital and caused by gene mutations. Toxic or poisonous substances are called Miasms are responsible for gene mutation Miasms are of three types Psora Psychosis Syphilis These exist in a suppressed or sleeping state in a person. As long as they are in that state, the person does not suffer from diseases due to resistance power. If any one of them stimulated , then the person loses his resistance power and suffers from diseases related to it. Therefore , Homeopathy is called a Genetic medicine Discovery of drugs The drugs are discovered by testing on humans but not on animals . A drug is administered on healthy person to induce any one of the miasms and the symptoms of the drugs are discovered Treatment The treatment is based on he concept of proving and prover Prover - The healthy person Proving - The symptoms (Physical, mental, emotional changes) that are caused by the various potencies of medicines in prover. For the treatment , the symptoms of the drug are compared with the symptoms of the patient. In other words the selection of the drug depends upon the symptoms of the drug and patient condition. The Unani System of Medicine has a long and impressive record in India. It was introduced in India by the Arabs and Persians sometime around the eleventh century. Today, India is one of the leading countries in so for as the practice of Unani medicine is concerned. It has the largest number of Unani educational, research and health care institutions. Origin & Development of Unani System Unani system originated in Greece Hakim Ajmal Khan IS UNANI physician but also one of the foremost freedom fighters in the country. He established an Ayurvedic and Unani Tibbia College and Hindustani Dawakhana - a pharmaceutical company - for Ayurvedic and Unani medicine in Delhi in Today the Unani system of medicine with hospitals and educational and research institutions, forms an integral part of the national health care delivery system. Principles & Concepts According to the basic principles of Unani the body is made up of the four basic elements i.e earth ,air, water, fire which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet, dry. After mixing and interaction of four elements a new compound having new temperament existence. i.e Hot wet, hot dry, cold wet, and cold and dry. The body has the simple and compound organs which got their nourishment ( The substances necessary for growth, health, and good condition ) through four humours i.e. blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. The humour (put into a good mood) is also assigned temperament as blood is hot and wet, Phlegm is cold and hot, Yellow bile is hot and dry and Black bile is cold and dry. Phlegm is cold and hot ( Thick, sticky, stringy mucus secreted by the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, as during a cold or other respiratory infection). Yellow bile is hot and dry (A yellow, or greenish, viscid fluid, usually alkaline in reaction, secreted by the liver. It passes into the intestines, where it aids in the digestive) Black bile is cold and dry (a humor that was once believed to be secreted by the kidneys or spleen and to cause sadness) Unani medicine believes in promotion of health, prevention of diseases and cure. Health of human is based on the six essentials Atmospheric air Physical activity and rest Drinks and foods Sleep and wakefulness Excretion and retention Mental activity and rest The human body is considered to be made up of the following seven components are: i. Elements (Arkan) ii. Temperament (Mizaj) iii.Humors (Akhlat) iv. Organs (Aaza) v. (Arwah) vi. Faculties (Quwa) vii. Functions (Afaal) Elements (Arkan) The human body contains four elements. (earth ,air, water, fire) Each of the four elements has its own temperament as follows: Element Temperament Air Hot and Moist Earth Cold and Dry, Fire Hot and Dry, Water Cold and Moist Temperament (Mizaj) In the Unani system, the temperament of the individual is very important as it is considered to be unique. The individual's temperament is believed to be the result of the interaction of these four elements. Humors (Akhlat) Humours are those moist and fluid parts of the body which are produced after transformation and metabolism of the aliments; they serve the function of nutrition, growth and repair; and produce energy, for the preservation of individual and his species. The humors are responsible for maintaining moisture of different organs of the body and also provide nutrition to the body. Organs (Aaza) These are the various organs of the human body. The health or disease of each individual organ affects the state of health of the whole body. Spirits (Arwah) Ruh (Spirit) is a gaseous substance, obtained from the inspired air, it helps in all the metabolic activities of the body. It is the source of vitality for all the organs of the body. These are considered to be the life force and are, therefore, important in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These are the carriers of different powers, which make the whole body system and its parts functional. Faculties (Quwa) These are of three kinds: Natural power (Quwa Tabiyah) Natural power is the power of metabolism and reproduction. Liver is the seat of this power and the process is carried on in every tissue of the body. Metabolism is concerned with the processes of nutrition and growth of human Nutrition comes from the food and is carried to all parts of the body, while growth power is responsible for the construction and growth of human organism. Psychic power refers to nervous and psychic power. It is located in side the brain and is responsible for perceptive and motive power. Perceptive power conveys impressions or sensation and motive power brings about movements as a response to sensation. Vital power (Quwa Haywaniyah) Vital power is responsible for maintaining life and enables all the organs to accept the effect of psychic power. This power is located in the heart. It Keeps life running in the tissues. Functions (Afaal) This component refers to the movements and functions of all the organs of the body. In case of a healthy body the various organs are not only in proper shape but are also performing their respective functions. This makes it necessary to have full knowledge of the functions of the human body in full detail Diagnosis The Diagnostic process in Unani system is dependent on observation and physical examination. Diagnosis involves investigating the causes of disease thoroughly and in detail. For this, the physicians depend mainly on pulse reading and examination of urine and stool. The ten conditions of pulse observed during the diagnosis are: i. Quantity ii. Force iii. Duration of movement iv. Condition of the vessel wall v. Volume vi. Duration of the rest period vii. Palpitation of the pulse viii. Equality and inequality ix. Balance of the pulse x. Rhythm Physical examination Is carried out by the diagnosis of urinogenital disorders, pathogenesis of blood and other humors, metabolic disorders and liver diseases. The following observations of urine are made: Colour Consistency Clearness and turbidity Odour Foam or froth Precipitates Quantity The examination of stool, its colour, quantity, consistency and the presence of foreign body help very much in the diagnosis of various diseases. Besides the means of pulse reading and physical examination of urine and stool, other conventional means such as inspection, palpitation, percussion and occultation are also used for diagnosis purposes. Strenght of Unani Unani system of Medicine has very remarkable strength in the following disorders: Skin disorders Digestive disorders Mental disorders Sexual disorders Gynecological disorders Neurological disorders "}
