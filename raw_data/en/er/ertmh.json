Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone, and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to ameliorate mood swings. The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp. Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis, exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Ms. Rothman figures that she has done everything she needs to do. In fact, Ms. Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional treatments. Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who co-wrote \"Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,\" and Dr. David Heber, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California, Los Angeles. Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal, from vitamin supplements like the Body Wise line, with its scientific-sounding claims, to pulverized Chinese herbs. What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of quality or of effectiveness. No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to confirm that their ingredients do what they profess. \"There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,\" said Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. \"Like all ideology, it's dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are molecules.\" Before 1994, the Government categorized dietary supplements as food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the shelf. But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the burden of proof on the F.D.A., which lacks the resources to police a growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that women will end up with poor-quality products. \"My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big herbal companies,\" said Dr. Heber. \"Big companies have big insurance liabilities.\" Dr. Friedman added, \"It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment, a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian roulette.\" Ms. Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes about food and nutrition, spent two years using her professional skills to select what she considered a quality line of supplements manufactured in a plant that adheres to F.D.A. pharmaceutical standards. Not every product is as reassuring. A walk down an aisle in a large Los Angeles natural-foods store is truly a magical mystery tour stocked with tall canisters of soy-protein powder from four competing manufacturers; a line of herbal solutions promising that the herbs are suspended in organic alcohol, and seven kinds of ginseng. The menopause preparations take up two shelves: supplements comprising different ingredients and several pots of wild-yam cream, none that list the amount of wild yam in the preparation. There are remedies in the food aisles, primarily tofu meals that include barbecue-flavored snacks. And at the check-out counter, 60-pill packs of Remifemin offer \"nutritional support for women experiencing menopause.\" These same women can then repair to a nearby coffee boutique for a soyccino. The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term effects of menopause -- bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and skin dryness -- depends on natural sources of depleted hormones, along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot flashes. It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived estrogen. Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule. Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a \"booked practice, early morning to late at night\" concocting custom hormone cocktails for his patients. If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is unnecessary, Dr. Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded. Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs, with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women, which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on patient testimonials than on research. Ms. Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: she began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance. \"I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,\" she said. Nor any menopausal symptoms. The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular products. Dr. Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen. While \"we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,\" she said, referring to the \"gold standard\" in which half the subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such studies were not conducted. \"The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in perspective,\" she said. Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal. \"I bumped it up to 40,\" she said, \"and the hot flashes disappeared.\" Dr. Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect. But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness; for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for example, the F.D.A. has yet to limit the progesterone content. What works is often a matter of experimentation and individual perception. \"The most hopeful sign,\" Dr. Friedman said, \"is that the National Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?\" Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause information exchange. There are several reasons. This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by managed care -- having promised everything, medicine has delivered far less. \"Skepticism is the inheritance doctors have gotten over the last century,\" Dr. Friedman said. \"The more sophisticated medicine has become, the more the American public expects. That intersects with managed care, which has been a disaster in terms of the public trust.\" Expectations were very high, Dr. Friedman added, \"but the results were less than people hoped for,\" so they have become \"disillusioned with medicine.\" This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can learn about other cultures and treatments. \"Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking we can change the world and live to 120,\" Dr. Heber said. \"An internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China, they don't take Premarin.\" The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part, untested and unregulated. That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit projections. But drugs, unlike \"cosmeceuticals,\" undergo rigorous clinical trials to win F.D.A. approval. The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them. \"We were all taught in medical school 25 years ago that drugs were good, vitamins were bad and supplements were dangerous,\" Dr. Heber said. \"It's the younger doctors who are usually open to this and will do the research on their own.\" Most doctors receive information about new treatments from drug-company representatives toting brochures and samples. These companies are not interested in alternative remedies so far. Since natural remedies cannot be patented, a successful product only guarantees increased competition. Sharon MacFarland's father, Bruce, began selling Progest cream 20 years ago. Eight years later, Ms. MacFarland began the company's new division, called Transitions for Women. Today, she said, the company sells about 1 million tubes of Progest annually at $30 each through its catalogue and health-food stores. That means more than 83,000 customers are using about a tube a month, enough to attract other companies with competing preparations. Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies therefore urge women to find what Dr. Love calls a \"guide\" who knows which companies make the best products and how they are supposed to work. \"You can't just take two of these and three of those,\" Dr. Love said. \"You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only safeguard.\" Karen Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer, is the author of \"To Dance With the Devil: The New "}
