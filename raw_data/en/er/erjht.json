At this time, only certain groups of people are technically eligible for the additional shot. Some cities or counties are more lenient on who can get the shot in an effort to reduce the spread during the upcoming holiday season. If you're eligible and planning on getting the shot, some providers suggest that you fully prepare for the appointment. One of the major fears, besides the needle, of the first COVID-19 vaccines was [the potential side effects](https://www.dherbs.com/articles/will-the-covid-19-booster-shots-have-side-effects/). It wasn't the same for everyone, with some people only experiencing site pain and flu-like symptoms. It seems that providers want to help people reduce the risk of side effects after the booster shot. In an effort to do this, some pharmacies currently send out instructions in the appointment details to drink water before and after the shot. Although the reasoning is to help reduce symptoms, does drinking water actually lessen the intensity of side effects? Does Drinking Water Help? There's no argument that [drinking water is beneficial for overall health](https://www.dherbs.com/articles/7-simple-tips-to-help-you-drink-more-water/). Hydrating is good for organ function, but it may not have an effect on how the immune system responds to the vaccine. No health expert can guarantee that drinking water will help you prevent side effects, but it may help the body if you develop a fever. When the body develops a fever, it uses the internal fluids to help cool it down, which can lead to dehydration. This means that drinking water before and after the booster shot may reduce the risk of dehydration if you develop a fever. At the very least, experts recommend hydrating before and after the booster shot to reduce the risk of fainting. Several reports stated that people regularly fainted after the first COVID-19 vaccine shots. If you get the shot in a state of dehydration, it can increase the risk of feeling ill or fainting. Infectious disease specialists say that increasing intravascular volume by hydrating may help prevent a vasovagal syncope event, which may cause fainting. In that regard, hydrating can be quite beneficial leading up to your booster shot, should you decide to get it. Beyond that, however, it's very difficult for experts to say that water will prevent side effects. There isn't specific data that indicates that drinking 16 ounces of water before the shot will [enhance the immune system](https://www.dherbs.com/store/immune-booster-kit-p-785.html). What About Pain Medication Before Or After The Shot? Many health experts say that it's not wise to pre-medicate with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication. Taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen before the vaccine for the purpose of preventing side effects is not healthy. In fact, the CDC states that it's not known if they affect the efficacy of the vaccine. It's also not wise to take antihistamines before you get the COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot. There are, however, no studies on how these OTCs will affect immune response. According to research about other vaccines, pain relievers may cause a weaker response to the vaccine, making the shot less effective. Rather than immediately resorting to OTC pain medication to counteract site pain, the CDC recommends applying an ice pack to the injection site. This may help relieve pain and stiffness. It may also be beneficial to keep the arm moving because increasing blood flow to the area may accelerate recovery. Ultimately, there is no magic potion that will prevent the post-COVID vaccine side effects. Drinking water may make you feel better and help the body combat any symptoms you do experience.
