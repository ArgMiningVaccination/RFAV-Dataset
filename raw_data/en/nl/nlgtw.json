The Momentary will continue to be free admission, no tickets required. COVID-19 Visitation Policies *As of July 21, 2021*: Due to the recent rise in COVID-19 cases, we recommend that all visitors ages 2 and up wear a face covering while indoors except while eating or drinking. In addition, we require all staff to wear face coverings indoors, as well as guests who are not yet vaccinated. Masks will be available upon entry for those who do not have one. Crystal Bridges is open with limited capacity and safety measures in place. Here's a guide to what you need to know before visiting: 1. For your safety, we continue to require face coverings Crystal Bridges and the Momentary require visitors and staff to wear face coverings for ages 10 and older, except when eating or drinking. Face coverings are recommended for ages 2-9. Face shields and face coverings with exhaust valves or vents are not allowed. Program Attendance Policy: For the safety of museum staff and other participants, program attendees (adults and children of all ages) will be required to wear a face covering while attending indoor and outdoor programs at the museum. Children's masks are available upon entry to the museum, or you can provide a mask from home. Programs will be spaced appropriately and will not use shared materials. Masks are available upon entry and at outdoor events and venues for those who do not have one. Please ensure everyone in your group is aware of the museum's face covering requirements.

Generally, weekends at the museum are the busiest times while afternoon and evening hours during the week are less crowded. As COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates decline and vaccination rates increase, we have recently increased our capacity to more accommodate visitors who want to enjoy safe and engaging art experiences. Currently, we are allowing up to 60 guests per 15 minutes, which adheres to a two-thirds capacity per state guidelines for indoor venues. After reserving a timed ticket, visitors will receive an email with information about what to expect. 2021 General admission and exhibition tickets can be booked here.
