Provide a well-characterised site for res earch groups to carry out projects on any aspect of MNA that will be funded by the Research Councils or other funding bodies. The objectives of the work described in this report were: 1) To use direct push technology (cone penetr ometer and Geoprobe) to gain further information on the lateral and vertical distribution of contaminants at the site toimprove the delineation of groundwater pl umes and aid our understanding of the vertical migration of contaminants at the site. 2) To install groundwater monitoring wells in the sandstone aquifer in the vicinity of borehole 309 to delineate an apparent benzene plume in this region of the site The main conclusions of this phase of the site investigation are: 1) BTEX (primarily benzene) contamination at the top of the sandstone aquifer in the region of BH309 has been confirmed (up to 5.6 mg/l). No hole in the boulder clayhas been found to explain how the ben zene contamination in BH309D has reached the sandstone aquifer. However, th e clay layer does reduce in thickness to approximately 4 m and contains a high proportion of sand and gravel in the vicinityof BH309. 2) There is no evidence from the vertical profiling that contamination has migrated through the boulder clay and into the sandstone at any other locations. 3) The extent of contamination in the sha llow aquifer does not extend as far to the south-east as was originally postulated in the Conceptual Site Model. 4) The presence of a styrene plume co-mingled with BTEX, TMBs and naphthalenes has been confirmed in the shallow groundwater. No new chlorinated solventcontamination has been detected.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 iiCONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I 1. INTRODUCTION 12.

INTRODUCTION SIReN (Site for Innovative Research in Natural Attenuation) is a joint initiative between Shell Global Solutions International, the Environment Agency for England andWales, CL:AIRE and AEA Technology (Towler et al. , 2000) to promote field-based research in monitored natural attenuation (MNA) The objectives are to: 1) Facilitate the development of confidence in MNA and its acceptance as a technically defensible risk management option for contaminated sites in the UK. 2) Provide a well-characterized site for res earch groups to carry out projects on any aspect of MNA that will be funded by the Research Councils or other funding bodies. The site is a large (180 ha) operational pe trochemicals manufacturing plant. Over its long history (50 years) it has manufactured a range of products (e.g. alcohols, glycols, amines, detergents, polystyrene, polypropyl ene) from refined petroleum hydrocarbon feedstocks. As a result of the activitie s undertaken on the site, both the ground and groundwater have been impacted with various contaminants, primarily benzene,toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX), trimethylbenzenes (TMB), with smaller amounts of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents (CAH). A preliminary site conceptual model ha s been developed along with a groundwater model for the site (Earle et al. , 2001; Jones et al. , 2001). In general terms, the vertical profile of the ground at the site is as follows: Made ground < 1 m Sand and gravels 2.85 m - 8.5 m Boulder clay 0.36 m - 30 m Sands and gravels 0 m - 7.6 m Sandstone > 77 m. The first encountered groundwater in the uppe r sands and gravels occurs at 0.5 m - 2.0 mbgl. Groundwater in both the shallow aqui fer and deep (sandstone) aquifer flows to the northwest, north or northeast (depending on the part of the site) towards a river anda canal. A number of site investigations (76 boreholes at 26 locations and numerous trial pits and shallow CPT LIF (cone penetrometer with light induced fluorescenceprobe) points have detected these contamin ants at several locations around the site almost exclusively in the shallow groundw ater and associated ground. At only one location has significant contamination (ben zene only) penetrated into the sandstone aquifer. The objective of the work described in this report was two fold: 1) To use direct push technology (cone penetrometer and Geoprobe) to gain further information on the lateral and vertical distribution of contaminants at the site toimprove the delineation of groundwater pl umes and aid our understanding of the vertical migration of contaminants at th e site. Push technology was viewed as a more cost effective means of gaining info rmation on deep contamination at the site compared to traditional drilling methods. It costs approximately \u00a310,000 to install a monitoring well in the sandstone aquifer by traditional methods. A key question is:R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 2how has benzene got into the sandstone aqui fer, given the presence of a substantial layer of boulder clay above the sandstone? Thus, a key aim was to continue thevertical profiling through the boulder clay a nd into the sand/gravel layer above the sandstone while recognizing that push technologies will not penetrate the sandstone. 2) To install groundwater monitoring wells in the sandstone aquifer in the vicinity of borehole 309 to delineate an apparent benzene plume in this region of the site.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 32. METHODS 2.1 Vertical Profiling Between the 30th May and 8th June, 2001 Fugro carried out c one penetration tests (CPT) at each of six locations and installed 1-4 piezometers at each of 10 locations using a Geoprobe (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1).

Static cone penetration tests were carried out using a 20 t capacity hydraulic penetrometer equipment mounted in a hea vy truck ballasted to provide a reaction weight of about 18 t. A 7.5 t capacity el ectric cone was used. During each test, measurements of local side friction were made in addition to cone end resistance. The ratio of the two (friction ratio) is indicative of soil type. All tests were terminated whenthe maximum available safe thrust capacity of the equipment was reached in very dense or hard materials. The LIF probe detects chemicals containing one or more aromatic rings such as BTEX or polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Kenny et al., 2000). The MIP probe samples volatiles which are transported to the surface in a st ream of nitrogen and analyzed sequentially through photoionisation (PID), flame ionisa tion (FID) and dry electrolytic conductivity (DELCD) detectors to indicate the presence of volatile aromatic (PID), aliphatic (FID) and halogenated (DELCD) contaminants in the sub-surface. Thus, continuous readings of soil type and contamination were obtained down the profile. 2.1.2 Installation of groundwater monitoring and well points Groundwater monitoring and well points were installed using a van mounted Geoprobe (a combined hydraulic push/percussion driv e system). Shallow (< 5 m) monitoring wells were composed of 25 mm id HDPE w ith a protective filter sock to prevent blockage of the screen. Due to difficult c onditions at the site (very dense and running sands) a drive in well point system was used for deeper groundwater samplinginstallations. A small diameter casing pipe was fitted with a sacrificial tip whichcovered the open end of the casing to prevent the ingress of water or soil. The casing pipe was driven to the required depth w ith successive lengths of pipe using the Geoprobe percussion soil sampling equipment or the 20 t CPT truck. A steel mesh well point (6 mm id) with sample tubing (6 mm id) was introduced to the casing pipes and screwed into the sacrificial point. The casing string was pulled back leaving the sacrificial tip and installed monitoring point in the ground. Given the nature of the ground at the site, it did not prove possible to get deeper than 15 m (shallower in some locations) with either the cone penetrometer or the Geoprobe. The locations of the monitoring and well point s with the screened intervals are given in Table 2.1 and Figure 2.1.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 52.1.3 Groundwater sampling Groundwater from the new monitoring wells and well points was sampled in August 2001. Some of the 50 mm id monitoring wells installed in previous rounds of site investigation were sampled at the same time (Figure 2.1). The 50 mm id monitoring wells were sampled with a bladder pump, but this could not be used on the 22 mm or 6 mm diameter wells. Peristaltic and/or vacuum pumps wereused to sample the latter (Table 3.1). In several cases both types of pump were used onthe same well to compare the effect of sa mpling pump on the data obtained to address concerns that vacuum pumping might strip volatiles from the groundwater and aerate it, thereby changing the chemistry of the sample prior to analysis. To ensure that the sample was representa tive of the aquifer, groundwater was pumped through a flow through cell (Well Wizard) for 20 -60 min, until relatively stablereadings for temperature, pH, electri cal conductivity, dissolved oxygen and redox potential were obtained, before samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Dissolved oxygen and Fe(II) were also measured on-site using Hach field test kits for comparative purposes. 2.2 Installation and sampling of deep groundwater monitoring wells in the sandstone aquifer Between 20 th November 2001 and 26th March drilled in the vicinity of borehole 309 where benzene has been consistently detected (in the region of 5 mg/l) over the previous two years (Fi gure 2.2). The circles in Figure 2.2 represent 25m, 50m and 100m radii from BH309. A comb ination of soft ground cable percussion drilling, rotary open hole drilling and rotary coring was used to achieve the desireddepths (up to 49 m). A schematic summary of the borehole logs is given in Figure 3.1. The original drillers logs are in Appendix 4. Falling head permeability tests were carried out in all boreholes apart from 404 and 406 (Figure 3.2). Borehole 404 was abandoned at 2.0 m when a pocket of highly pungent chemical was encountered. A Waterra multi-level sampler with seven por ts was installed in borehole 406 under the supervision of Peter Dumble (Waterra ) and Gary Wealthall (University of Sheffield/BGS). Following development, the wells were samp led for chemical analysis in May 2002 and again in August 2002. Water level data over time are given in Appendix 5.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 6R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 73. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Vertical profiling 3.1.1 Static cone tests Static cone penetrometer tests were performed at locations VP1, VP2, VP4, VP12, VP13, and VP15 (Figure 2.1). At least two tests were carried out at each location, one during the LIF screening and one during the MI P screening. The raw data of the static cone tests and their interpretation are given in Appendix one. Note that Fugro use the location identifiers CPT1 (=VP1 LIF) and CPTM1 (=VP1 MIP). It did not prove possible to get deeper than 15 m at any location due to the hard and compacted nature of the ground. Interpretation of the friction ratio measurem ents gave vertical ground profiles similar to those observed by traditional borehole drilli ng and logging techniques. Approximately 1 m of made ground was underlain by sands with some gravel to a depth of 4 - 7 mbgl. Beneath the sandy layer, firm to stiff clay wa s present at all locations ranging from 4 - 9 m in thickness. Beneath the firm/stiff clay layer, was a layer of sandy clay with gravels. At none of the locations was there an obvious pathway for contamination to reach the sandstone aquifer, although it is interesti ng to note that the two vertical profiling locations closest to BH309 where benzene has been found in the sandstone aquifer hadeither the thinnest layer of boulder clay (~ 4 m at VP13) or gravel within the boulder clay (VP12), which may increase the permeability of the boulder clay. Light induced fluorescence cone testing The LIF data are given in Appendix 2. There was no indication of aromatic hydrocarbon contamination at locations VP 1, VP2 and VP4 all the way down to 15 m. Strong signals were obtained at 1 - 3 m at VP12 and VP13, but there was no indication of any contamination below 3 m. A weak signal was obtained at VP15 at around 1 m. Membrane interface probe testing MIP data are given in Appendix 3. Vola tile hydrocarbons were detected at all locations.The signal at VP1 is indicative of aromatic hydrocarbon (signals from both the PID andFID) contamination such as BTEX, styrene and naphthalene, primarily located at 4 - 6 m in the sandy layer above the clay, although some volatiles do appear to havepenetrated into the clay to a depth of 9 m. The measurements were stopped at 14 m, which is still in the clay. The signal at VP2 is indicative of aromatic hydrocarbon contamination located at 3-8 m, which is primarily in the sandy layer above the clay, although a small amount of penetration into the clay has taken place. Small pockets of aliphatic hydrocarbons (FIDR&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 8signal, but no PID signal) are indicated at lower depths, which could well be methane. The measurements were stopped at 14 m, which is still in the clay. The signal at VP4 is indicative of the presence of very few volatiles down the profile other than two small pockets of primarily aliphatic hydrocarbons (most likely methane) at 8 m and 10 m in the clay layer. The measurements were stopped at 13.5 m which isbelow the stiff clay layer. No volatiles were detected below the clay. The signal at VP12 is indicative of aromatic hydrocarbon contamination located at 1 - 6 m which is primarily in the sandy layer above the clay, although a small amount ofpenetration into the clay has taken place. Significant pockets of aliphatic hydrocarbons are indicated at lower depths within the cl ay. This could represent methane. The measurements were stopped at 11 m which is just into the sand layer beneath the clay. The signal indicated aliphatic volatile hydrocarbons at 11 m. The signal at VP13 was very strong (note the scale is attenuated by a factor of 5 compared to the traces for VP1, VP 2, VP4 and VP12), indicating aromatic hydrocarbons located at 1.5 - 5 m which is pr imarily in the sandy layer above the clay, although a small amount of penetration into the clay (approximately 1 m) has taken place. Below this level, two small pocke ts of aliphatic hydrocarbons (most likely methane) were detected at 7.5 m and 8.5 m in the clay. The signal at VP15 was also very strong (sam e scale as for VP13). It indicated pockets of aromatic hydrocarbons between 3.5 m and 5.5 m which covers the bottom of the sandlayer above the clay and the upper 1.5 m of the clay layer. The measurements were stopped at 11.5 m. There was no indication of volatiles below the firm clay layer that runs out around 10 m. VP15 was the only lo cation where the DELCD signal indicated the presence of volatile halogenated contamination. 3.1.2 Groundwater analysis Field measurements The temperature, pH and electrical conductivity measurements made in the field with a flow through cell (Well Wizard) are given in Table 3.1, along with water levels andtype of pump used to sample each well. Groundwater temperature ranged from 12.6 oC to 21.9oC. The values are considerably higher than those reported in March 2000 (8oC - 12.7 oC). The upper end of the range is high for groundwater, even in August. They may be due to an underground steam leak, but this seems unlikely gi ven that a temperature of 21.3oC was recorded in groundwater from a depth of 8.5 m. Groundwater pH was generally around neutra lity (pH 5.92 - 7.42), with the exception of borehole 308 where the pH was 10 at 5 m and 9.4 at 19 m (compared to 11.9 and 9.9 respectively in March 2000). Elect rical conductivity ranged from 316 \u00b5S to 3400 \u00b5S, which is similar to the range reported in March 2000.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 9Oxidation reduction potential correlated well with dissolved oxygen concentration. It ranged from -120 mV in the well (BH308S ) with the lowest dissolved oxygen concentration (0.33 mg/l by flow through cell) to +131 mV in the well (with one of the highest dissolved oxygen concentrations ( 4.1 mg/l by flow through cell). The range is somewhat narrower than that reported in March 2000 ( - 230 mV to + 118 mV) Table 3.1 Groundwater sampling and field measurements Location access VP2 22 3.0 Peristaltic 1.5 18.6 7.42 316 131 VP4 22 3.0 Peristaltic 1.5 21.9 -37 2.79 Vacuum 1.64 15.1 6.58 632 30 VP12D 6 11.5 Vacuum Insufficient samplerecovered. 22 11.5 Too deep for peristaltic orvacuum VP16 6 7.6 Vacuum 5.5 14.6 7.32 554 39 Tube kinked?

Nitrate concentrations in the shallow groundwater in wells VP10, VP11, VP12 and VP13 are very low (< 0.3 mg/l) which is in k eeping with much of the site from previous rounds of investigation. These are however, the most heavily contaminated of the new wells. Even the relatively clean we lls VP2 and VP4 contain only moderate concentrations of nitrate (3.0 and 5.7 mg/l) indicating that nitrate is not a major electronacceptor for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation. This confirms previous observations at the site. Fe(II) tended to be much higher (3.6 - 66.4 mg/l) in the more heavily contaminated wells (VP10, VP12 and VP13) and below the lim it of detection (< 0.5 mg/l) in the clean wells VP2 and VP4, indicating that Fe(III) may be a significant electron acceptor for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at the site. In several samples Fe(II) was apparentlygreater than total dissolved phase Fe. Characterization of the iron chemistry of thegroundwater at the site requires further work. The concentrations of Mn(II) and total dissolv ed phase manganese are in the region of 1 mg/l or less, indicating that Mn(IV) is not ac ting as a significant electron acceptor at the site. There was little difference in the c oncentrations of Mn(II) and total dissolved phase manganese concentrations. Sulphate was highest (358 mg/l) in one of th e clean wells (VP4), compared to < 5 mg/l to 52 mg/l in the contaminated wells indica ting that sulphate is a significant source of electron acceptor for anaerobic hydrocarbon degr adation in parts of the site. This confirms previous findings. Methane was only detected (2.6 - 6.4 mg/l) in the most heavily contaminated wells (VP12 and VP13). In all the other wells it was below the limit of detection (0.01 mg/l).This is strongly indicative of methanoge nic driven anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation and confirms previous findings.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 11Table 3.2 Electron acceptors and reduced products in groundwater.

The correlation in dissolved oxygen measur ements made on-site between the flow through cell and the Hach field test k it was quite good, although some measurements could not be made with Hach method becau se of the cloudy nature of the sample. Laboratory measurements of dissolved oxygen were generally lower than those obtained in the field indicating possibl e consumption of oxygen during transit. Dissolved oxygen was generally higher in the new vertical profile wells (1.1 mg/l - 7.2 mg/l) than the original traditional bore holes (0.62 mg/l - 2.1 mg/l). The different methods of sampling (bladder pump versus pe ristaltic pump) may have had something to do with this, although sampling with a peri staltic pump is a gentle means of sampling which has been successfully used to sample groundwater for analysis of volatiles, so it is unlikely to have led to aeration of the samples. Correlation between dissolved phase Fe(II) concentrations in the groundwater analyzed on-site by the Hach colorimetric field test kit and on filtered and acidified samples analyzed in the laboratory was poor.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 12Table 3.3 Dissolved oxygen and iron in groundwater Location Depth (mbgl)Sampling pumpDO FTC 6.0 5.2 0.2 < 0.5 VP4 3.0 Peristaltic 7.2 8.0 2.6 0.2 < 0.5 VP8S 3.0 Peristaltic 1.1 1.0 0.8 1.8 < 0.5 VP8I 8.5 Peristaltic 5.3 4.0 3.3 0.4 < 0.5 VP10 2.6 Peristaltic 1.3 1.0 < 0.5 4.5 14.8 VP11 5.0 Peristaltic 3.7 1.0 < 0.5 3.2 < 0.5 VP12S 2.79 Peristaltic 3.8 Cloudy < 0.5 Cloudy 22.4 Vacuum 0.5 34.0 VP13S 3.05 Peristaltic 3.9 4.0 3.7 4.0 3.6 Vacuum 1.8 7.2 VP13I 6.09 Peristaltic 1.3 1.0 < 0.5 1.0 66.4 Vacuum < 0.5 52.8 VP16 7.6 Vacuum 4.08 Cloudy Cloudy DW2S 2.45 Bladder 2.12 0.0 DW2I 4.83 Bladder 0.62 2.5 DW2D 25.2 Bladder 1.22 1.0 6.0 DW4S 3.26 Bladder 2.48 2.0 4.2 DW4I 5.52 Bladder Bladder BH308I 19.42 Bladder 1.02 Cloudy BH309S 3.97 Bladder 1.04 4.5 BH309I 25.84 Bladder Cloudy BH309D 29.53 Bladder 0.82 0.0 5.5 Key: FTC = flow through cell Hach = field test kit 3.1.3 Organic contaminants Data on the petroleum hydrocarbons det ected in the groundwater samples are summarized in Table 3.4. Two types of pumps were employed to sa mple the narrow wells (6mm and 22 mm id) installed with the Geoprobe, a peristaltic pump and a vacuum pump. Both pumps were at their limit for sampling from 11.0 - 13.0 mbgl . Some wells were sampled with both types of pump to assess the effect of vac uum pumping on the loss of volatiles from the groundwater. In general, samples recovered with the vacuum pump had lowerconcentrations of volatiles than those rec overed with the peristaltic pump, however, the difference was only significant when the c oncentration of volatiles in the groundwater was low-moderate (< 1 mg/l). See for example, samples from VP8S. When theconcentration of volatiles was high (> 1 mg/l) the difference was generally insignificant (see for example samples from VP12S, VP13S and VP13I). Duplicate sampling from the same well by the same method gave r easonably reproducible data (see VP12D and 309D). Groundwater samples could only be obtained from two of the new well points that had penetrated beneath the firm/stiff clay layer, namely VP8D and VP12D. Neither of these contained significant concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons.R&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 13Of the new wells gr oundwater VP8, VP10, VP11, VP12, VP13 and VP 16 had concentrations of one or more of the following components TPH, BTEX, trimethylbenzenes, styrene and naphthalenes at > 1 mg/l. The TPH is in the C6-C16 range. The TPH values reported undoubtedly include the BTEX, TMBs, styrene andnaphthalenes. The new wells thereby conf irm the widespread contamination of the shallow groundwater in the centre of th e site reported previously (Earle et al , 2001; Jones et al, 2001). Wells VP2 and VP4 were essentially clea n, suggesting that the shallow groundwater contamination does not extend as far s outh-eastwards as was proposed in the Conceptual Site Model report (Earle et al, 2001; Jones et al, 2001). VP12 (1-2 mg/l styrene) confirms the pres ence of a styrene plume in the shallow groundwater first detected in DW4S. Re peat sampling of DW4S this time around yielded a styrene concentration of 38 mg/l. The styrene is co-mingled with petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH, BTEX, TMBs and naphtha lenes). This provides the opportunity for an MNA study on styrene. Repeat sampling of traditional borehole 309D screened in the top of the sandstone confirms the presence of benzene at 5 mg/l.

The highest concentrations were recorded in boreholes 309, 406, 402 and 405. Given the variability in the depths at which contamination is detected in the different wells, interpretation of the data is not straightforward.

CONCLUSIONSR&D TECHNICAL REPORT P2-208/TR/3 17 BTEX (primarily benzene) contamination at the top of the sandstone aquifer in the region of BH309 has been confirmed (up to 5.6 mg/l). No pathway through the boulder clay has been found to explain how the benzene contamination in BH309D has reach ed the sandstone aquifer. However the clay layer does reduce in thickness to approximately 4 m and contains a high proportion of sand and gravel in the vicinity of BH309. There is no evidence from the vertical profiling that contamination has migrated through the boulder clay and into the sandstone at any other locations. The extent of contamination in the sha llow aquifer does not extend as far to the south-east as was originally postulated in the Conceptual Site Model (Earle et al., 2001; Jones et al ., 2001). The presence of a styrene plume co -mingled with BTEX, TMBs and naphthalenes has been confirmed in the shallow groundwater. No new chlorinated solvent contamination has been detected. Fe(III), sulphate and bicarbonate appear to be the most significant electron acceptors for anaerobic hydrocarbon degrad ation in the shallow groundwater at the site.
