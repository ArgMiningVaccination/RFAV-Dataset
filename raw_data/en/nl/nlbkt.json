It is used to diagnose, treat, and prevent disease. It also can be used to maintain wellness and adjust to changes in the seasons. At Summit Health, acupuncture is used with traditional medical practices as a complementary approach to help patients achieve and maintain their health goals. How Does Acupuncture Work? During the procedure, very fine needles are inserted under the surface of the skin to stimulate specific points on the body. This process is intended to release the flow of energy (or qi) to restore and maintain health. Acupuncture involves activating one or more of the 20 energy pathways (or meridians) in the body. The treatment helps stimulate the body's ability to correct imbalances, open blocks in the flow of energy through the meridians and promote healing. Studies have shown that acupuncture benefits people with a variety of conditions, including back pain. Before you have acupuncture and to get an overall perspective of your health, your practitioner will likely ask about all aspects of your health, lifestyle, and behaviors. To take advantage of all acupuncture benefits, it is important to tell the acupuncturist about all your medical conditions, medications, and treatments as well as your concerns and expectations. Acupuncture Benefits One of the primary benefits of the treatment is that there are few if any acupuncture side effects. It is an exceptionally safe treatment. While people experience acupuncture differently, most patients describe feeling little or no pain during the procedure. In fact, the needles are so thin that many people barely feel them at all. Some patients suggest they are energized after the treatment, while others say they feel relaxed. The number of acupuncture treatments you need will depend on your condition and overall health. Most acupuncture therapy requires multiple sessions over several weeks or more.
