Going as far as thinking there is something deeply wrong and even sick with someone who gets their cats declawed. Yet I bet most of the most vocal and angry kitty lovers here will have at some point during this discussion eaten chicken, which in most cases is raised in the most inhumane and cruel way imaginable. I won't touch chicken because of the way it is reared and haven't since I was 16. I won't get my cat's declawed either...but I am not about to start threatening and insulting people because they choose to do one or the other. That's not really the way to get people to change their minds. Supporting the way chickens are intensively reared is way worse than having your cat declawed. it's not only the chicken... Some years ago I worked for a company that maintained barns and other animal farm technical stuff... I'm not easily repulsed, but what I saw in these \"food production sites\" made me quit eating meat for a couple weeks (but I couldn't stand being vegetarian for a longer period). Unfortunately many people nowadays don't see animals as living creatures anymore, just as things to be used. Unlike things, animals do have a soul, do have feelings, do feel pain. Many people forget this for their own convenience. | 3) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Oil and AND our country..](forum_thread.php?id=47492) Posted 16 Jun 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I'm both righteous and competent.

I believe our lives would become much more 'localised' in the long term. People would have to find jobs closer to home or move within striking distance of jobs. We might have to buy our groceries from local sources as well as grow some of our own food, and maybe holidays would once more be taken closer to home. Would any of these listed things be bad? I doubt it. If that is the future I'm even eagerly looking forward to it. Communities might become more self-reliant but also, unfortunately, more 'insular.' In that respect it might be like a return to the past. Cars might only be used for long journeys or public transport might have to replace them because of the high price of keeping a car, if they could run at all. Lots of things would change, but not necessarily for the worse. I prefer to be optimistic and say that we would eventually find other energy sources to replace the oil anyway. | 13) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [A World Without Jun 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I can grow my own food but would need animals and water, land and sun.

How would the solar cells be made with no oil? No plastic remember. :) syntetic. Actually you can make solar panels without using plastic, or without needing energy to produce chips...

Does really the end justify the means? Is it really right to say it's okay for a company to make profit no matter what law, written or unwritten, may be broken? All of these 100 companies got away with their crimes way too easily, and they are just the upper top of an entire iceberg. I rather think that, when a company does criminal things, then their owners are responsible for that and should be punished as criminals, or at least as confidants of criminals. There is a reason that countries have laws. And companies - being legal persons - do not stand above the laws, hence they as an entity (and/or their owners) should be punished as hard as natural persons. | 15) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#64 - RECONSTRUCTION as Champ Won](forum_thread.php?id=47303) ( [Message 762451](forum_thread.php?id=47303&postid=762451)) Posted 3 Jun 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while trying to make boinc running, and my headset working under openSuse | 16) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : Those in Poor Countries!!](forum_thread.php?id=47308) ( 762347](forum_thread.php?id=47308&postid=762347)) Posted 3 Jun 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: What saddened me was watching the News at 10 here in the UK last Friday evening.

I've seen milk rise from \u00c3\u00c2\u00a31.12 22 days ago to \u00c3\u00c2\u00a31.44 now, that a rise of 22%. Are the Supermarkets wrong?

And he is right. Since I know several languages - some I do understand (more or less), some I forgot, and some of which I only got a glimpse into - I must say that English, and especially the American variant of it, is the easiest of all languages I know. 1) Grammar. Compared to Russian which was the first \"second language\" I learned in school, or to Roman languages like French or Spanish - even to German, my first language, the English grammar is quite easy to catch, imo. 2) Compatibility. Since the English language is using the Latin alphabet, people from many countries don't have to learn another alphabet when learning English 3) It is the most widespread language in the world, as far as I know it. You can travel to each and every country, and you will meet people understanding English. Being understood and spoken by people from all over the world, English is more or less the language which made Esperanto (which was developed to become a universal language) as unnecessary to learn as Sindarin for example. | 18) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Did you forget that Louisiana is considered a 3rd world country by some standards :) This comment gives you away.

There will still be very rich people, there will still be very poor people. This is a contradiction in itself. Capitalism only provides the most income and opportunity for a few (statistically spoken) - those few who are exploiting the others who have to sell their work power, their land, their resources to afford a living or to even just survive. That's why there are some who are rich and many who are poor.

That appears to be more significant than old age. Note that the Linux ideas are built on very well proven and deeply developed foundations from as far as 40 years ago... A big change more recently is that there has been more interest and effort to also make the (multiple desktops, yes you have a choice there) look more 'friendly'. That's an interesting comment because both KDE and GNOME are so horribly cluttered (at least on every Linux distro I've tried) and not intuitive at all. And being able to have 4 desktops in one windowing system is hardly imaginative. Its downright confusing and, if I may say, a stupid idea. Not to mention that with two different windowing systems comes much confusion on which to develop apps for, creating sort of a user-divide on a platform. Its great to have choice, but where's the uniformity? Imagine writing documentation for your app where you have to double up your text with explanations for both. At least on a Mac and Windows systems you have a basic foundation you can rely on. Strictly speaking on my perspective here, but the Linux GUIs are hardly 'friendly' at all. OS/2 was almost as bad with their unfriendly-ness. For a certain contrasting system you also have the 'dinosaur syndrome' of commercial hubris to stiltify all further progress. You additionally can have an impossible tangled web of lock-in and history that makes the system unmaintainable... Most companies try to lock in their users. There's nothing wrong with it as long as the consumer is happy. Comcast and AT&T do it. IBM used to do it. Personally, I think the greatest difference is in the focus of the development... Is the OS designed to be good to use and good for the user? Or is the OS contrived primarily to exploit the market? Exploiting the market is certainly am opinionated view, one that I don't entirely share. If Linux is claiming to be focusing on what's good to use and good for the user, either I disagree with their philosophical direction altogether or they need to re-examine what the term 'user friendly' means. When they do, then they might be a serious competitor on the desktop for the 'average' person out there. Some years ago I was given a copy of Suse 8.1 when it was still almost new... It was the first Linux distro I tried... Comparing to XP, I can't say that this was too user-unfriendly... apart from driver problems which vanished after some weeks after an online update, and that I had to download the media codecs from third party websides because of legal reasons... And I'm someone who tries to use the registry or the command tools as seldom as possible... who prefers to click a symbol and the program works... And for the look of Vista... you can give your KDE any Look&Feel you want it to have.. from DOS to Vista, from OS/2 to OS/X , from other OS-related to self-made ones... Windows kind of restricts you. And also Vista does not include any needed software right from installation of the OS, just a few programs... | 40) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Biofuels are ruining the 24 May 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This thread is supposed to be about biofuels, and it has apparently been hijacked into a discussion of agribusiness.

I didn't doubt that he quoted the oath correctly. I said specifically that his assertion that \"each medical who makes profit out of medical treatment betrays the oath they have sworn,\" (sic) was wrong because the part he underlined as evidence, \"I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism,\" does not address anything other than who shall benefit from a doctor's ministrations. I then noted that \"nothing in that oath says anything about making, or not making, a profit at all.\" I don't know what else to tell you here, this is pretty simple stuff: the oath does not mention, nor address, profit, therefore those that make profit do not \"betray[] the oath they have sworn.\" Even if he sez so. Well, when someone is sick, where lies their benefit when they get financially squeezed out like a lemon by the doctor, that this person rather decides to end their own life by refusing the treatment than to make debts to pay the treatment, with the risk to never get a job after the treatment to pay these debts back? I still think any medical treatment should be absolutely free of any charge. For everyone.

One student, Mychal Bell, was convicted of aggravated battery by an all-white jury and faced as much as 22 years in prison. A state appeals court dismissed the verdict, ruling that Bell should not have been tried in an adult court. Bell was released from prison after nine months but was recently re-incarcerated on a probation violation. The white students who hung the nooses were suspended and forced to attend disciplinary courses. Jena High School's principal, who is white, sought to expel them, but was overruled by the school superintendent, who is also white and called the nooses a schoolboy prank. Thousands of people marched in Jena last month to protest what they called the overzealous prosecution of the six black students, who originally were charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Washington told the committee he could not stop the LaSalle Parish prosecutor, Reed Walters, from proceeding with the charges because the federal government's authority in the case is limited. \"I want to assure this committee that the Department of Justice was engaged,\" he said. Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Tex.) criticized that response. \"I want you to tell me why you, the first black [Western District of Louisiana] U.S. district attorney, did not do more, and I want to know what you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!\" \"I did intervene,\" Washington said. \"I will tell you that, just like you were offended [by the charges], I was offended.\" | 76) |[Message came home after [clubbing](http://www.final-destination-club.de/index.php?programm) Baby seals?

[...] With the development of the place-notational Long Count calendar (believed to have been inherited from other Mesoamerican cultures), the Maya had an elegant system with which events could be recorded in a linear relationship to one another, and also with respect to the calendar (\"linear time\") itself. In theory, this system could readily be extended to delineate any length of time desired, by simply adding to the number of higher-order place markers used (and thereby generating an ever-increasing sequence of day-multiples, each day in the sequence uniquely identified by its Long Count number). In practice, most Maya Long Count inscriptions confine themselves to noting only the first 5 coefficients in this system (a b'ak'tun-count), since this was more than adequate to express any historical or current date (with an equivalent span of approximately 5125 solar years). Even so, example inscriptions exist which noted or implied lengthier sequences, indicating that the Maya well understood a linear (past-present-future) conception of time. [...] The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar forms the basis for a New Age belief, first forecast by Jos\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 Arg\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcelles, that a cataclysm will take place on or about 21 December 2012, a forecast that mainstream Mayanist scholars consider a mis-interpretation.[...] And another wiki for the [Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar) And here is what seems to be the reason for these silly end-of-world theories: 2012 and the Long Count According to the Popol Vuh, a book compiling details of creation accounts known to the K'iche' Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the first three creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where men were placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous creation ended at the start of a 13th b'ak'tun. The previous creation ended on a long count of 12.19.19.17.19. Another 12.19.19.17.19 will occur on December 20, 2012, followed by the start of the thirteenth b'ak'tun, 13.0.0.0.0, on December 21, 2012. Significance within the New Age movement Two figures within the New Age, the artist and theorist Jos\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 Arg\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcelles and the late ethnobotanist and psychonaut Terence McKenna, have publicized theories concerning the significance of the end of the cycle. (They arrived at their conclusions separately from one another.) They have jointly inspired a number of articles and books that this will be the end of this creation, the next pole shift or, as McKenna speculated in his theories, the end of history and events as \"novel\" as the origin of life on Earth, which we could not possibly imagine. Other, more mundane speculations involve a worldwide catastrophe, such as a pole shift. The idea of the significance of the date has also increasingly passed into popular culture.

Bush Cites Oil As Reason to Stay in Iraq By Peter Baker The Washington Post Sunday 05 November 2006 Greeley, Colo.- During the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and his aides sternly dismissed suggestions that the war was all about oil. \"Nonsense,\" Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld declared. \"This is not about that,\" said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. Now, more than 3 1/2 years later, someone else is asserting that the war is about oil - President Bush. As he barnstorms across the country campaigning for Republican candidates in Tuesday's elections, Bush has been citing oil as a reason to stay in Iraq. If the United States pulled its troops out prematurely and surrendered the country to insurgents, he warns audiences, it would effectively hand over Iraq's considerable petroleum reserves to terrorists who would use it as a weapon against other countries. \"You can imagine a world in which these extremists and radicals got control of energy resources,\" he said at a rally here Saturday for Rep. Marilyn Musgrave (R-Colo.). \"And then you can imagine them saying, 'We're going to pull a bunch of oil off the market to run your price of oil up unless you do the following. And the following would be along the lines of, well, 'Retreat and let us continue to expand our dark vision.' \" Bush said extremists controlling Iraq \"would use energy as economic blackmail\" and try to pressure the United States to abandon its alliance with Israel. At a stop in Missouri on Friday, he suggested that such radicals would be \"able to pull millions of barrels of oil off the market, driving the price up to $300 or $400 a barrel.\" Oil is not the only reason Bush offers for staying in Iraq, but his comments on the stump represent another striking evolution of his argument on behalf of the war. The slogan of \"no blood for oil\" became a rallying cry for antiwar activists prior to the March 2003 invasion and angered administration officials. \"There are certain things like that, myths, that are floating around,\" Rumsfeld told Steve Kroft of CBS Radio in November 2002. \"It has nothing to do with oil, literally nothing to do with oil.\" White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Saturday that Bush's latest argument does not reflect a real shift. \"We're still not saying we went into Iraq for oil. That's not true,\" he said. \"But there is the realistic strategic concern that if a country with such enormous oil reserves and the corresponding revenues you can derive from that is controlled by essentially a terrorist organization, it could be destabilizing for the region.\" Some analysts, however, said that Bush is exaggerating the impact of Iraq's oil production on world markets. Iraq has more than 112 billion barrels of oil, the second-largest proven reserves in the world. But it currently pumps just 2.3 million barrels per day and exports 1.6 million of that, according to the State Department's tracking report on the country, still short of what it produced before the invasion. That represents a fraction of the 85 million barrels produced around the world each day and less than the surplus capacity of Saudi Arabia and other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meaning in a crisis they could ramp up their wells to make up for the shortfall, analysts said. The United States also has 688 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, enough to counter a disruption of Iraqi oil for 14 months. Even if Iraq did not sell oil to the United States, it would not matter as long as it sold it to someone because the international market is fungible and what counts is the overall supply and overall demand, according to analysts. If Iraq cut off exports altogether, it still would not have the dire effect on the world market that Bush predicts, they said. The price of oil began rising dramatically in 2002 as the confrontation with Iraq loomed, but many factors contributed, including increasing demand by China and problems in Nigeria, Venezuela and elsewhere. The world, in fact, has already seen what would happen if Iraqi oil were cut off entirely, as Bush suggests radicals might do. Iraq effectively stopped pumping oil altogether in the months immediately after the invasion. And yet the price of oil has never topped $80, much less come anywhere near the $300 or $400 a barrel Bush cited as a possible consequence of a radical Iraqi regime withholding the country's oil. \"They're a minor exporter,\" said Edward Morse, managing director and chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers. \"They have potential to be a greater exporter. But it's ludicrous to suggest someone could hold the world hostage by withholding oil from the market, especially a regime that needs money.\" Disruptions of oil supplies certainly affect the markets, but not as drastically as Bush suggested, Morse said. He noted that Venezuela's capacity has fallen by 1 million barrels a day since President Hugo Chavez came to power there and yet it has not given him any geopolitical leverage over the United States even though he is an avowed Bush foe. But Morse agreed that Iran, for example, could \"play mischief\" because it already effectively controls much of Iraqi oil in the southern part of the country. Fratto, the White House spokesman, argued that even if radicals could not move the markets dramatically with Iraqi oil, they would use the country as a base to topple other governments in the Middle East such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which would give them \"a lot more oil to blackmail with.\" | by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Well, the independent media have been telling that for years, and the other ones are too dependent from big money to be contrary to the official opinion.

More unsubstantiated garbage from you in your continued efforts to apologize tyrants, murderous thugs, and dictators.

Most hated company? I don't have a most hated company - but if you want examples of companies that profit from the war, just look at the weapon producing industry, at the oil industry - even those mercenaries of the private military companies profit from the war - and they get paid by YOU, with your tax dollars! You see the numbers on the officially published statistics? The war, started by your government, has cost your country in average f'ing $341.4 million per single day! For the same money the US spent for the war in 2007 alone, more than 20 million university scholarships for a year, or more than a million affordable house units, or about 10,000 new-built elementary schools could have been provided. Is the \"normal citizen\" worth so little that the government rather throws the money away for unnecessary things like invasions than for fighting homelessness, poverty, social inequality in general in their own country? I wish all of our governments nothing evil - but each of those in the parliament/Congress/Bundestag/Houses of Parliament etc - each of these government people should walk in the shoes of a poor person for 2 or 3 months before going back on their posts. I'm sure this experience would radically change their point of view on budget priorities. They would think twice if any single more dollar for war is needed as long as the US is not threatened, and as long as there is poverty and homelessness, and as long as people have to make debts to get education. For your interest: I never apologized tyrants or killers - but I also know that the end NEVER justifies the means.

I experienced myself how propaganda can work, how discontent can be magnified by propaganda, how even people can look around stuff they used to love and find more and more they're dissatisfied with (Like: As I hear in radio/see on TV, THERE they have always NEW cars, they live in houses they OWN, they can OWN entire factories there, these and those things are CHEAPER than where I live...) - it's like a constant brain-wash, and those who are not stabile enough fall for it and try to get out of their home country instead of trying to improve their society to reach the advantages they envy in the country they want to migrate to... I hate to be the one to break the news to you buddy, but private ownership of houses and cars isn't propaganda....it's pretty much the norm over here. I know it's the norm in USA, but not the norm in Cuba for example - and it also was not the norm in the GDR: most houses, factories etc are(were) common property, and you could rent but almost never own a house or a company (except by heritage) - and if the company you owned was bigger than a small family business it was made common property anyway. And in all pictures and movies I saw about Cuba, new cars seemed to be an exception, mostly I've seen old cars (that's why I pointed out \"NEW cars\"). | 143) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) down as Cuban leader](forum_thread.php?id=45446) ( downright anti-America...

Life experience, buddy: I already have lived in a socialist country for decades. Since the GDR no longer exists, there isn't a separate entry in the CIA factbook, however, Wikipedia DID contain exactly what I was looking for: To this day, there remain vast differences between the former East Germany and West Germany (for example, in lifestyle, wealth, political beliefs and other matters) and thus it is still common to speak of eastern and western Germany distinctly. The Eastern German economy has struggled since unification, and large subsidies are still transferred from west to east. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany) Like I said, mass exodus doesn't occur when things are \"so much better\" at home... Despite it becoming off-topic I have to comment that: Sure the economy in east Germany has struggled since the \"reunification\" - which is no miracle after most of the factories have been closed down directly or indirectly by the [Treuhand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treuhand). Btw the former chairman of the Treuhand (Rohwedder) was shot after he demanded to first renew the former state-owned companies and to sell them afterwards. Well, whoever was interested in the direction the Treuhand went after his death made it look like some terror group shot him... FYI: There are areas in East Germany which have now the highest unemployment rates of entire Europe, and much more people left East Germany after the \"reunification\" than during all the years while the GDR existed. East Germany has become nothing more than a low-income colony (though the prices are about the same as in West Germany) -- and to get back on topic: I think that Cuba will face a similar fate should it ever be taken over by the States (as is spoken of by some few \"Exile-Cubans\") | 163) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Post: Here's a [Lullaby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WpCLc2WXGo) for you 164) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Fidel Castro steps down as Cuban leader](forum_thread.php?id=45446) ( 741486](forum_thread.php?id=45446&postid=741486)) Posted 19 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: What makes you say they are tyrants?

The question rather is: can we as mankind afford throwing away tons of food on a daily base while hundreds of people are starving each hour? But instead of sending the \"surplus food\" where it's needed badly, the food industry rather waste the oceans with it or burn it like garbage or bury it as fertilizer or throw it away otherwise, just to keep the food rare and it's prices high. Just another reason why I think that food production should not be controlled by a just few big private companies whose bosses know no moral, who would sell their own family for even more profit.

For example, (I'm not saying we should do this, it's just an example) if we all turned vegetarian there would be probably be enough to feed the world 3 times over. That is, stop 'wasting' food by feeding it to animals to convert to meat, the process of which loses the energy of the source food as compared to what we end up with. Grow crops to feed people and not animals bred specifically for meat and using up resources to do so. I read some time ago that if food and wealth were distributed fairly, there would be twice as much as needed to feed all of the inhabitants of the world at any given time.

Make it where there has to be so many votes before a ban can be implimented, not just 1 or 2 votes. Make it a majority, regardless if mods are on different time zones. Make it where if a ban vote is initiated, that person cannot post for 24 hours, giving the majority of the mods a chance to vote. That's a very constructive suggestion worth thinking (and posting) about KWSN! I'm sorry I can't post about it now, I'm a little tired out. But I will think about it and post on this if I have anything useful to add. I can see though, that a 24 hour temporary ban would be much preferable to a member than a month's ban. Don't most Chat Rooms operate that way, a 24 hour ban first, subject to ratification? That's the way it worked on the Bearshare Chat Rooms, I remember. It was also used (the 24 hr ban) to cool fighting members out. :]] Beets On one of \"my\" boards (the boards where I'm moderating) the admin created a \"Gamecock Forum\" as an involuntary exile for those who are fighting each other on the board, and which is only visible to them and the team (which is the admins and mods) instead of banning them. These \"gamecocks\" see only this one forum when they log in as long as no consense can be reached even with the mediation by the team, but they get banned when they don't behave even there. We had several users in this \"Gamecock Forum\" meanwhile, but banned only one which (as we found out) actually was a second account of a regular user who behaved (more or less) with his original account. Maybe this idea could be adapted here, as an involuntary exile during the ban vote? | 206) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Did the bible say anything about life outside planet Earth?](forum_thread.php?id=46492) ( [Message 740556](forum_thread.php?id=46492&postid=740556)) Posted 17 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Have you ever considered that almost all which is written in the Bible was written and meant figuratively, to meet the poor knowledge and the understanding of the simple folks the preachers and prophets spoke to thousands of years ago? When you explain things to children you too choose the simplest of language and the most placative allegories to meet their understanding, I suppose. But to get back to the question at hand \"Did the Bible say anything about life outside planet Earth?\", I tried to find something in The Bible (but the short time given I was only able to scan through - didn't want to use Google) but the verses which sprang into my memory weren't in the Bible but in another religious work: \"The Pearl of Great Price\" (Moses 1:33 through 35) which is used by the Mormons.: 33 And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten. 34 And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many. 35 But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them. Also in the \"Pearl of Great Price\", (Moses 7:30): 30 And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just; thou art merciful and kind forever; I will search through my King James Bible for the cross references given (- and even Google a bit) - and when I found some interesting verses I'll post them later. Then there is something in the Kabbala, in the book Sohar; and even the Q'ran mentions other worlds with inhabitants on them (iirc). But anyway, even if there nothing can be found in the Bible but in the Apocryphs for example (I didn't go as far as looking in there yet) don't forget: the early church took many things out of the Bible and changed others when they decided what should become the canonical Scripture at the First Vatican Council (when was it? some time in the 4th century I think) I have read the Bible plenty times and never found anything about a \"flat\" Earth. Maybe you didn't look closely enough. \"The devil took him [Jesus] up into an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them.\" - Matthew 4:8 How could one see all the kingdoms of the world from an exceedingly high mountain unless the world was flat? \"I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. The tree grew, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.\" - Daniel 4:10-11 Not only is it stated that the Earth has an \"end\", but again, it's not possible to have a sight of \"the end of all the earth\" no matter how high a tree grows unless the Earth is flat. From Revelation: \"I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth\" (Rev. 7:1) \"There was a great earthquake... and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casts her figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind.\" (Rev. 6:12,13) The fact that stars can \"fall down\" onto the Earth is keeping in line with the notion that the stars, the sun, and the moon, were fixed in a firmament above the Earth. ...of course, it also suggests that stars are not spheres of hot gas like the sun and are not incredibly larger and more massive than the earth. \"Who shut the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb, when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness, when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place, when I said, This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt?\" Job 38:8-11 It is implied God has made doors and bars at the edge of the Earth to keep the waters of the world from overflowing. How about this passage? \"He can command the sun not to rise\" (Job 9:7) But since the Sun doesn't actually rise, it's just an effect of the Earth's rotation, wouldn't the passage have been more accurate if it said \"He can command the earth to stop moving.\" That the Earth is set upon pillars and is FIXED and unmoving: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 - 1 Chronicles 16:30 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Thou hast fixed the earth immovable and firm ...\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 - Psalm 93:1 He established the earth upon its foundations, so that it will not totter, forever and ever. - Psalm 104:5 The world is firmly established, it will not be moved. - Psalm 93:1 & 1 Chronicles 16:30 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth??Who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof? - Job 38:4-6 For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he set the world on them. - 1 Samuel 2:8 It is I who have firmly set its pillars. - Psalm 75:3 Who stretched out the heavens...and established the world. - Jeremiah 10:12 Of course we know today that not only does the Earth rotate, but that it orbits the Sun and that Solar System itself orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and that the Milky Way Galaxy moves as well... Furthermore, the Bible states that the heavens, the stars, the moon and the Sun are fixed in a solid firmament surrounding the Earth and that when God shakes the Heavens, the whole Earth shakes too. The earth quaked, the foundations of heaven were trembling. - 2 Samuel 22:8 The earth quakes, the heavens tremble. - Joel 2:10 I shall make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place. - Isaiah 13:13 The greatest theologians and Christian philosophers in history all felt that the Bible clearly indicated that the sky and stars were fixed in a solid firmament above their heads: Ambrose, commenting on Genesis 1:6, said, \"the specific solidity of this exterior firmament is meant\" (Hexameron, FC 42.60). And Saint Augustine said the word firmament was used \"to indicate not that it is motionless but that it is solid and that it constitutes an impassable boundary between the waters above and the waters below\" (The Literal Meaning of Genesis, ACW 41.1.61). Martin Luther, a brilliant man and the father of protestantism, shared their beliefs that the Bible was *CLEAR* about this: \"Scripture simply says that the moon, the sun, and the stars were placed in the firmament of heaven, below and above which heaven are the waters...We Christians must be different from the philosophers [astronomers] in the way we think about the causes of things. And if some are beyond our comprehension like those before us concerning the waters above the heavens, we must believe them rather than wickedly deny them or presumptuously interpret them in conformity; with our understanding.\" - Martin Luther, Lectures on Genesis, Vol. 1, Luther's Works, Concordia Pub. House He was referring to this passage: \"God said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,' and God made the firmament, and separated the waters which were below the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament... Then God made the two great lights...(and) the stars also.

Firstly, I can't speak for Esme she will have to do that herself, but I doubt if she would see herself as a special case. As I understand ir she justs wants fair justice for all. Secondly we are supposed to already have an arbimod, it's called ADMIN!!! Although at the moment I believe we are leaderless? Lastly, some 2 years ago I myself proposed the post of Senior or lead Mod, who would be responsible for the other mods to take the pressure off Admin. It was not thought to be a good idea at the time. Perhaps your idea is a variation of that which could be re-visited. All new ideas are welcome, keep 'em coming. Hi Chris!!! If I could maybe clarify my idea along the lines of your three points? About your first point: Maybe I used the wrong phrase with \"Special Case\". I certainly don't mean anything pejorative or something you'd take as a stigma. I could as well have used the term \"VIP\" or \"Very Important Person\", but that might have offended some other people and seemed to glib a phrase to describe her. The reason that I refer to Es that way is, that she seems to have expressed, on several occasions, a difficulty in being treated \"just like anybody else\". That's all I meant by \"Special Case\". Maybe \"Special Situation Person\" is a better description? No stigma is meant or attached, in any case. Es may indeed want \"justice for all\" but what I'm concerned with is..justice for her. And lest friction in the emails she now has with the modlist.:]] About your second point: The differences I see between the Administrator and an \"Ombudsmod\" or \"Arbi-mod\" are many. The Administrator has a number of issues to deal with and can't take the time to deal specially for one person. An Ombudsmod could, as a moderator..just like other moderators. Also, the Ombudsmod would free the other mods from dealing with that person, thereby lightening their workload. All they have to do is forward the red-xs on that person. Es, if she agreed to deal with an Ombudsmod, would get personal attention (something else I meant by \"Special\"). Not even the modlist have the time to give her that, let alone the Administrator. About your third point: About your idea of a Senior or Lead mod, this is nothing like that. The Ombudsmod is a specialized mod, not a senior mod. The Ombudmod has no power over the modlist. In fact, the modlist would have some say in his/her selection and the term renewal for another month. The idea here is arbitration, communication and the lessening of tension and/or friction. :] The Senior or Lead mod is an idea worth considering, and that's another idea that could be discussed. But it's different than this idea of a specialized mod with a very narrow jurisdiction. Does this help in any way? Beets But would this Ombudsmod also be called for if it came to difficulties between the mods themselves? I rather understand the position of an Ombudsman (or in this hypothetical case, an Ombudsmod) as someone who tries to reach a consensus between the parties of a \"special case\", rather a mediator than an arbitrator... | 213) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Did the bible say anything about life outside planet Earth?](forum_thread.php?id=46492) ( [Message 740474](forum_thread.php?id=46492&postid=740474)) Posted 17 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Did the holy bible say (or hint) anything about life outside planet Earth and our solar system?

The Old Testament refers only to the Earth and the Heavens and does not imply that stars are merely distant suns with other potential worlds in orbit, indeed, it does not even imply that there are other worlds in orbit around our own sun. In fact, the Bible suggests that the Earth is flat and supported upon foundations or pillars made by God. Reference is made to the \"four corners\" of the Earth and also the \"ends\" of the Earth. Because the Bible had many authors (all humans, as imperfect as any of us), it's not necessarily consistent in its explanations about the Earth. The Earth is also described as circular. It is not, however, described as spherical.

But on the other hand, when they commit a crime they deserve a trial and have to go with the punishment the judge decided. But I think since kids and juveniles are influenced by their surroundings, parents have to work twice as hard to make their kids not being influenced by the wrong people, and to teach their kids to know right from wrong and to remain on the right way. So when kids and juveniles commit a crime (even less than what happened to Blurf), it's not just the crime of them, but also a sign that their parents have failed badly - and that's why I think they should also get a punishment. Thorin... What you seem to have missed in my post about spanking is that I know there are people who take things way too far. I was in the same situation you were as far as \" corporal punishment \" goes. There is a very fine line between \" punishment \" and abuse. I know that line very well. I also said that I had spanked my daughter. Did I abuse her when I did it?? Nope. Wanna know WHY it wasn't abuse? Because it wasn't used regularly as a form of discipline. From the day she was born, until she turned ten, she got spanked exactly twice. I will not get into what she did, but I will say that she had done the same thing more than once, and after I spanked her, she never did it again. There is absolutely nothing wrong with spanking a child if it isn't done for minor infractions. Trust me, 99.999% of the time, all I had to do was say my daughter's name in a certain tone, or look at her in a certain way, and she knew that she messed up. That, in and of itself, was normally enough punishment to get my point across. I agree with you about, having gone through the same type of abuse as you, making a promise to myself about not being like my parents and relatives. Not being abusive. When my daughter was born, I made the same promise. I also resolved to speak to her on a little bit higher level when she did something wrong, so that she would know WHY it was wrong. Of course, when Danielle was learning to read, while her mother had her learning Dick and Jane stuff, I was the guy who had Danielle on my lap teaching her words from whatever I was reading at the time...lol Sorry, I have to admit I missed some of your point.

And as the saying goes: Dog don't eat dog... Okay, when I became a mod here some were already biased against me - the same way they are biased against Esme, and these some accused me to be biased... But I never act biased when acting as a mod on a board, actually the very first time when I was called as a mod was on a board with very personal and delicate topics, with many of the users being quite labile and easily offended. I just couldn't afford to be biased even the slightiest bit... So I learned to be impartial the hard way. And I think I still am unbiased. I even almost lost a friend before I became a mod here when I supported a ban decision against this friend of mine. I don't have anything against the mods as a group, and also no issue with those who I think are fair and correct - I always support moderation decisions when they've been just... But then there are some mods who allowed to get the power into their mind, who actually do hide behind their mod tag. Who bait people, and hide angry responses to their posts as being flame-bait. Who act angry when being told that they are on \"Ignore\", who judge posts upon who wrote them instead of what is their content. Such people do not deserve the mod-tag anymore (if they ever deserved it), and should be demodded asap. | 216) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 217) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [How do we express new ideas for forum moderation?](forum_thread.php?id=46403) ( [Message 740412](forum_thread.php?id=46403&postid=740412)) Posted 17 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I had people talking about me that way when I was a mod here - but this was not here in the boards.

Do I believe in spanking as a punishment? Hell, NO! Do I believe that such treatment can rather cause criminal deeds? Not really - though it's more likely that kids become criminal who had been physically abused than kids with loving parents who never beat or spank them. Having been BEATEN as a child and juvenile as a punishment, for example for not having done homework yet when my parents came home two hours later than me; or as a punishment for trouble in school both because I was beaten up by other pupils and did not defend myself ('cause they were older and stronger or more than I could handle), and because I was beaten up by other pupils and did defend myself; or for coming home later than expected from being at my grandparents or at friends known to my parents... Such really minor stuff already caused a beating... My mother stopped spanking me with her hand when I was 5, from that age on she used either a belt, or a carpet beater, or her clogs to \"spank\" me because she thought that punishing me should not hurt herself... My father on the other hand did only hit me one time as far as I remember: It was a slap in the face when I was 15 or so, and when my nose was bleeding (it bleeded at each opportunity which raised my blood pressure at that time) he thought it was directly caused by that slap and begged my pardon. The only thing they reached was that I swore that if ever I had children they would get a better treatment from me than I got from my parents, that I would be a better parent to my kids than my parents were to me. Even when my stepson came home after having done some serious trouble shortly before his 18th birthday I did not spank him. I dragged him into his room, and actually spoke with him, discussed with him, to touch his conscience despite he was drunk - three days he did avoid me, then he came to me shamefully, excused for his behavior, and asked me why I did not just beat the hell out of him the other day. By this reaction he showed imho that the lesson I gave him had worked better than a beating which would've been shrugged off after the blessures healed. Has my ex-wife (his mother) ever spanked her kids? I know of two times, both out of utter helplessness, followed by excusing... Has his father spanked his kids? When you count a similar treatment into \"spanking\" like I got as a child, then yes, but let's rather say his belt danced on the backs of both his kids and their mother regularly on a daily base. Is that Physical Abuse? YES. Sorry KM, but in my opinion no minor trouble caused by kids and juveniles deserve a spanking. But on the other hand, when they commit a crime they deserve a trial and have to go with the punishment the judge decided. But I think since kids and juveniles are influenced by their surroundings, parents have to work twice as hard to make their kids not being influenced by the wrong people, and to teach their kids to know right from wrong and to remain on the right way.

One of the suspects said in the interrogation that \"a cripple is an easy mark. How could I turn down the chance?\" That signifies (to me) experience and a true lack of caring about what they did. You made a point: They don't care. I think they aren't even aware that it is egally and morally wrong, because they have learnt to do not care anymore. I met such individuals myself when I worked as a store detective a couple years ago. Those I met (children from either level of society) just shrugged when I caught them, not caring about consequences: at home there were none, and the trial before the juvenile court was just a necessary inconveniencce, mostly because of (an original quote, translated by me): \"the blabber of some old morons who need to feel important\". School? They just skipped entire weeks. \"We won't get any chance after school anyway, so why should we finish it in the first place?\" Consequences in school? Hah! In classes with about 30 pupils one more or less is hardly noticed. Consequences at home? None at all, because their parents were either too busy with their jobs or with mourning at themselves to care about such behavior. Or there were beatings anyway so that one trouble more or less didn't matter. So where and how should they have learned to be respectful, helpful, empathic? With no good examples at all? With no opportunity to learn that every deed causes a consequence? In my opinion, most nowadays sociopaths are MADE by circumstances caused by society. And that's STILL no excuse for such deeds. But some of these individuals get easily caught by people who do actually (pretend to) care, and who teach them that to be helpful is weak, and only the strong will rule, and who mislead them with rules like \"do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them\", or \"If someone in your lair annoys you, treat them cruelly and without mercy\", or \"When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him\".

Being a mod on other boards, and having been one here, I know that forum moderation is easy. The only possible difficulty is that, when posting or moderating, the moderators always must be aware that they are representing the forum's administration. What hogwash! Sure, moderation is easy if one ignores offensive behaviour and lets certain posters do what they want to the detriment of other posters. But that is not being a good moderator. A good moderator has to act on offensive behaviour even if it may cost a friendship; to look the other way is easy, to tell a friend they are doing wrong is not at all easy. As for your claim that \"representing the forum's administration\" is difficult, being such a representative (if that is so) has nothing to do with the difficulties that arise on the boards. The \"forum's administration\" should monitor the moderators, all of whom are volunteers, and if moderators act improperly, the administrators can and should remove them. This is no difficulty, it's just the way things work. Well, been there done that (as you know). I even almost lost friends before I became a mod here when I told them their ban was correct imo, and I would have had them banned as well if they behaved like that on one of the boards were I am still a mod. My friends do know that I have no problems to tell them if they are wrong or right. What I called a posibble difficulty at \"representing the forum administration\" is that sometimes when moderators are posting, they forget that they are not \"just normal users\" without such responsibility, and that their co-mods then don't touch their posts out of misunderstood loyalty, causing other users to leave the boards in anger (I do not claim that such things happened here, but I have seen such happening on several boards both related and not related to BOINC). | 239) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Well...

That's why I think you can't draw a line from which age people are mature enough to be responsible enough to be judged as adults. That's why I think that maturity can be found out (ex. by psychologists - and their judgement is most probably not subjective). Though I nonetheless tend to disagree KM, I must admit he has a point. Several people I grew up with, who are in my age and had a similar bad childhood like me, have committed crimes since we were teens. A few of them still (or again) are in jail. So why did I not commit crimes like them? Why have I never been in jail like them? Because even as a teen I decided, no matter how the people around me (my parents included) treated me, not to have me sink that low myself. It is always a matter of decision-making. Every person in their right mind can say no to their own plans and ponderings until the last second before they set them into reality. Even if you go as far as drawing a gun and aiming it at someone, you can always stop yourself before bending your finger and shoot - as long as you're able and willing to listen to your conscience.

What is enough, what too much as punishment/disciplary measure? Is it better to send them to a psychic clinic for stationary therapy - to both, protect the society from them and help them to socialize? Or is it better to send them to jail (like any adults) just to protect the society from them - with them learning nothing in the worst case or having a worse fate there than they caused their victims themselves? Or is it better to teach them responsibility by release on licence and/or social work, or detention? Honestly spoken, I do not know. Even here in Germany there are people who say, \"if they are grown up enough to do such things they have to face the punishment for grown-ups\"... But I disagree to that, even though I think sometimes they seem to get off lightly with such offences... I really don't know. I think the truth lies inbetween: However they are tried, the sentence should be chosen based on the maturity (despite the age) of the offenders instead of just their age, to be real just. | 247) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Thanks Ice and Albert :) winning while opening a bottle of red wine to celebrate. :) | 248) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: a win before leaving Where are you going?

Whilst many citizens wished to join the USA, the outcome of that war was actually a US CONQUEST of Mexican territory and not a Mexican invasion of the USA. History has a knack of coming up with awkward facts when ultra-nationalists only pick bits they like. \"Technically\" speaking, you are correct. The Alamo fell about one month prior to Texas declaring it's Independence from Mexico. However, utilizing that type of logic, the United States didn't declare it's independence until 1776. Now you subtract the 250 years used in the initial example, and you get 1758. \"Technically\" the United States didn't exist (just like the state of Texas didn't exist) and therefore could not have been occupied by foreign invaders at that time either. That's not an \"awkward\" history fact, that's data manipulation. For future purposes, I believe in manifest destiny...Texas was always Texas. Interesting for once. Not my manipulation either but yours, as you have now admitted. I know you only ever acknowledge one side of history but I suppose the people in the Alamo and the people declaring Texan independence were freedom fighters in their own eyes. Did that make them insurrectionists and terrorists in the eyes of Mexico? Don't forget that one man's \"freedom fighter\" is another man's \"terrorist\". In this case I'm for freedom. Self-determination is an important right. I seem to recall George III disagreeing with that and losing rather forcibly. If he had had a more enlightened - even liberal - attitude, history might have been very different and better for the world as a whole. I wonder how I should feel if I were a citizen of Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, Cuba, Somalia, Palestine, etc., etc. Well spoken! | 251) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: first win after work.

Girls will be girls and boys will be boys (whether they like it or not). for example..a man who speaks up and makes his opinion known is called assertive and praised. A woman who does so is called aggressive or a b**** or even crazy. It's ok for men to use certain words causally and regularly and it is not even noticed. A woman does so once or twice and suddenly she is 'running amok'. Most of these biases are so ingrained we don't even notice them and they are accepted as right and proper and the natural order of things. Hmm.

Social Security is but one tiny aspect of the problem known collectively as \"welfare\" (a one way exchange of goods and services). As I indicated earlier, due to your bias, you seek out ONLY the information which supports your opinion, thus you \"apparently\" missed the end of the second paragraph. Let me take this opportunity to rectify the situation: In fiscal 2006, the federal government spent almost $2.7 trillion. Social Security ($544 billion), Medicare ($374 billion) and Medicaid ($181 billion) dominated. There was $199 billion more for payments to the poor, including the earned-income tax credit and food stamps, among others. My statement remains: Imagine what could have done with this money if it were poured out into social welfare instead of raising the profits of the weapon producing industries which earn their billions by producing more costs for funerals, for medical treatments, for disability payments which then also have to be paid by Social Security! Supporting a few already big companies to make them richer by starting an absolutely unnecessary war instead of reducing the poverty of the many needy people and raising the overall wealth by that is morally, politically, and economically just wrong. | 300) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#60 - TL04 is & we are CLOSED for reconstruction](forum_thread.php?id=46098) ( [Message 736998](forum_thread.php?id=46098&postid=736998)) Posted 10 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I thought I was winning. hmmmm Puzzling. ;-D Sadly mistaken.

I see, so Hitler and the Nazi's were innocent victims of western propaganda...and here all this time I just thought you were retarded. Thanks for clearing that up.... No, BS. You couldn't get me more wrong. But that under the Nazi regime the Jews and Communists were considered as enemies, that was because of propaganda. That the Germans during the Third Reich were so eager to go to war, was because of massive propaganda (remember that speech of \"Wollt ihr den totalen Krieg?\" [\"Do you want the total war?\"]). That even in your country communists are considered as enemies is because of propaganda. Also, for example: that in former Yugoslavia the Serbians, Bosnians, and Croatians who lived peacefully together when it was still Yugoslavia, suddenly considered each other as enemies, that was because of propaganda. The splitting of the former Soviet Union into all these separate countries, that was also because of propaganda. That while the GDR existed, armed force aimed their weapons at people who wanted to go West into \"freedom\", was because of propaganda. Even the [Uprising in 1953](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany) started because of propaganda (mainly by [RIAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_in_the_American_Sector), a West Berlin-based radio sender). That Jews and Palestinians in Israel can't live together without fighting anymore, is because of propaganda. When Muslims, Jews and Christians hate each other (and even members of other denominations among themselves), then because of propaganda. Media (and propaganda in general) have a lot of influence on people. And the media have been misused to steer people into having a certain opinion about other countries, people, convictions, and faiths often enough. | 305) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Freiwirtschaft vs Keynesianism the better economic theory?](forum_thread.php?id=46342) ( [Message 736781](forum_thread.php?id=46342&postid=736781)) Posted 10 Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Comparing two market economy theories, I think Gesell had the best economic theory because he thought about all people, not just those who own a business. While [John Maynard Keynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynes) provided in his [General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment%2C_Interest%2C_and_Money) a theory in which both the state and the private sector had important roles, where the state would actuate production by deficit spending, but which stated that there \"must be significant slack in the labor market before fiscal expansion is justified\", [Gesell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Gesell) provided a theory with his [Natural Economic Order](http://www.utopie.it/pubblicazioni/gesell.htm) which was imho more social. The idea of the [Freiwirtschaft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiwirtschaft) should ensure a natural decrease of the worth of money if not flowing, making it unable to be hoarded. Unlike Keynes, he provided a solution that a full employment (that everyone who can work would have a job) can be reached, and that the rate of economic growth would be set by the entire society. Unlike Keynes, he stated that MONEY were just a medium of exchange and should not have any own value with superiority above work or things, and he was strictly against incomes through interests alone. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld) wrote: According to Silvio Gesell, all human-produced goods are subject to expensive storage, whereas money is not: Grain loses its weight, metal products rust, housing deteroriates. Therefore money has a supreme advantage over all other goods. John Maynard Keynes found another effect, which he deemed more important: liquidity preference. Being \"liquid\" with money is a great advantage to anybody, much more so than having comparable amounts (past utility) of any product. The result is that people will not even provide zero-risk, inflation corrected credits unless a certain interest rate is offered. Freigeld simply reduces this 'primordial' interest rate, which is estimated to be somewhere around 3% to 5%, by an absolute, in order to lower the average interest rate to a value around 0. That's why I think that Gesell's theory of Freiwirtschaft is more thought through, and much more social than the theory of Keynes, and that's why I do prefer the first (Freigeld) above the latter (Keynesianism). And that's why I could imagine a world where all land is Free Land, where all money is [Free Money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld). What is your opinion about these theories? Do you know of better economic theories? If yes, please explain why they are better than these two. | 306) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) Apr 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6604775898578139565](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6604775898578139565) Peace, Propaganda & the Promised Land provides a striking comparison of U.S. and international media coverage of the crisis in the Middle East, zeroing in on how structural distortions in U.S. coverage have reinforced false perceptions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Perhaps one day you will learn two things about the world: A) We don't do things over here like they are done in Germany. B) You can't believe everything you read, ESPECIALLY when your opinion is already biased and you're looking specifically for material which supports that preconceived notion.Sure - but I'm not biased about new topics, first I search information (on several sources), then I make my opinion.

There is also an article I've found before only in laws of military dictatorships: [Article 99](http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/ucmj/blart-99.htm) Any person subject to this chapter who before or in the presence of the enemy-- (1) runs away; (2) shamefully abandons, surrenders, or delivers up any command, unit, place, or military property which it is his duty to defend; (3) through disobedience, neglect, or intentional misconduct endangers the safety of any such command, unit, place, or military property; (4) casts away his arms or ammunition; (5) is guilty of cowardly conduct; (6) quits his place of duty to plunder or pillage; (7) causes false alarms in any command, unit, or place under control of the armed forces; (8) willfully fails to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy; or (9) does not afford all practicable relief and assistance to any troops, combatants, vessels, or aircraft of the armed forces belonging to the United States or their allies when engaged in battle; shall be punished by death or such punishment as a court-martial may direct.

The decisions during these cases reaffirmed that following manifestly illegal orders is not a viable defense from criminal prosecution. In United States v. Keenan, the accused (Keenan) was found guilty of murder after he obeyed in order to shoot and kill an elderly Vietnamese citizen. The Court of Military Appeals held that \"the justification for acts done pursuant to orders does not exist if the order was of such a nature that a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know it to be illegal.\" If you have ordinary sense, you can not obey a patently UNLAWFUL order. If at any time after the fact you become to believe that you were given an order that was unlawful, you have a duty to report it. Shooting your own men because they failed to follow a lawful order even in combat is pretty much a movie thing. Even if it was recorded on video that the persons disobediance was putting the entire unit in immenent danger you would have to come up with a good reason why that person couldn't have been arrested and turned over for trial. I guarantee you would be before a court martial. If you think anyone can do anything on a battlefield or war zone without worrying about the consequences please read the article at: [http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm](http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm) Well, I only read about how it is in the US. I never served in any US or even NATO military unit, it was the East German NVA where I served back then. But I do know of several armies where deserters and people who refused to obey orders in war or even in \"situations of heightened security\" (see the Monday demonstrations in East Germany in '89 or the TianNanMen massacre in China as examples) have been killed by their superiors, in a kind of \"prosecutor-judge-and-executer-all-at-once\" way. I saw how Soviet deserters in East Germany were treated during the Cold War, and I learned how people were treated in the Army I served in, who deserted or refused to obey orders even if the order was unlawful. I also read a lot how such people were treated elsewhere, and that made me hate armies even more, as being places of inhumanity and general insanity. To me, the entire military industry worldwide, as well as all those armies, are as necessary as a hole in the head. But I suppose we're getting way off-topic anyway. /Edit/ See also [Punitive Article 85](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm85.htm) (c) Any person found guilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 And [Article 90](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/punitivearticles/a/mcm90.htm) Article 90\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acAssaulting or willfully disobeying superior commissioned officer Text. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Any person subject to this chapter who\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac (1) strikes his superior commissioned officer or draws or lifts up any weapon or offers any violence against him while he is in the execution of his office; or (2) willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer; shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, and if the offense is committed at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 | 319) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#60 - TL04 is & we are CLOSED for reconstruction](forum_thread.php?id=46098) ( [Message 735844](forum_thread.php?id=46098&postid=735844)) Posted 7 Apr 2008 by Post: A multicoloured bump.

Actually farmers plant seeds because they KNOW how agriculture works due to centuries of practice by farmers who preceded them...not because they \"imagine\" it would be a good idea. They know how it's supposed to work - and before they tried it themselves they don't know if (depending of weather, soil quality, watering, etc.) it will work out on their own fields. But they hope, they believe, they imagine that they will have success too, so they try. Even experienced farmers can be 100% sure if they succeed due to the weather or other disturbances: but they imagine they will have at least as much fruit as last year no matter what, so they continue. | 322) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [when is the TRUTH gonna be known....](forum_thread.php?id=46173) ( thorin belvrog - \"Then every soldier in every war would have to be charged under those articles.

I've also been a mod already - even here... And I'm agreeing with Knightmare: well-placed words here and there and you needed less actual mod'ing. The most stress I had during my time as SETI mod? Reading through the several hundred mails which were the normal daily amount at the modlist. The problem is not at all that boards are moderated... It's that some mods on some boards are seeing the power they have but don't see the responsibility coming with it. Those mods don't see that their behavior is watched more closely by the users of those boards because of the mod-tag they wear, like in real life the behavior of cops is watched more closely by everyone else because of the uniform they wear. Like Cops representing the Law, moderators are representing the admin, the project itself, BOINC... The way they are seen by the users has huge impact on the image the project is having. Just they seem to forget that, while enjoying the power they have. That's why I like the idea of a temporary service of mods. Since I doubt that the admins will choose noobs as new mods, the experience will already be there, and those two, three more buttons are easy to manage. And to know that the service will be over after six months maximum will hopefully prevent the new mods to become power-addicted, but lets them show more responsibility instead. | 345) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Interest falling 2008 [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Two steps heading to improvement...

If your product is good, one satisfied costumer brings you 5 new ones. But if your product is not satisfying, each customer going elsewhere makes 5 more leave with him and 15 more not even thinking about shopping at you. You want to sell your product? Satisfy your customers. Not you, they have to like what you're selling them. PR is similar, and the image of a project is a very sensitive thing to sell. You want good advertising for the project? Convince the crunchers that they are appreciated (also if they do not donate money). Convince them that they are important to you, that you respect them. Convince them that the problems mentioned are worked at. Convince them that you listen to them and want to improve things - even if you think yourself that everythink is perfect as it is. Sell the customers (actual and potential crunchers) a good image of SETI! If you manage that, and they see that the project fits into its image, then the advertising will improve itself.

A bit off course on a few points, but not 'wheel spinning' off course.... And thank you for the fact that you HAVE contributed to the cause..... So many complain but have not bothered to support what they purport to believe in...... I will continue to crunch for my project........ Issues aside.....it is my quest.... You must try to set personal issues aside...........and if you must vent, PM me instead of doing so here......please. Thank you for recognising that I have contributed..quite a lot actually..to the cause. It's not a vent Mark. I think there are problems with the project because of the funding crisis...and that panic from the top is trickling down to the rest of the project and causing decisions and actions that are not necessarily the best for the project. If we are not allowed to acknowledge that there are problems then there is no way we can begin to fix them. Again..simply stamping on and crushing the messengers is not going to help. It will just turn people off. Putting hands out and demanding that we now pay for the 'privilege' of donating our computers..and making people feel like they aren't 'dedicated' to the cause is not the way to encourage people. Is seti a cult or a volunteer project? Should we be thinking of new ways to get people here..and use this site as a resource..or endlessly grinding that resource down? Maybe Dr Anderson has it right..and making Boinc a social network site will help (but he will also have to take on some of the responsibility that goes with that and put in checks and accountability to protect people)..maybe someone should think about making these forums a welcoming place where EVERYONE feels SAFE to post? Not just a chosen few. How about putting up resources for educators? Other scientific sites do it. Lessons plans..work sheets..videos...flash games about searching for aliens and other resources for teachers to help explain the work done here. It's not enough to have seti@home printed in school text books...and speaking from experience pupils aren't that impressed with Boinc when they do sign up. Oh, Seti has become a cult allright...... And I am the High Priest........LOL...... But seriously...... This has been blown way out of proportion..... Personal vendettas have taken the stage, and there is really no place for them here......go to frickin' 'my space' or some other teeny boppers hangout.... Not a personal attack, just a general opinion of what has been going on here lately....... I luv this project......... It's what got me interested in DC computing many years ago.....it's what led me to build my first computer..... I learned about it at work and did not have a computer at home...... Criminy..........I got interested and built my first 233mmx......... And I have had many computers since..... I guess I am just a simple and gentle soul at heart........ I have had my arguments with a few here on the boards, but none have lingered long.......I do not hold grudges.... What's yesterday is yesterday.......let's talk about tomorrow......... Of Seti yet to come....... Yes it has become a cult. And not SETI @home alone, but many other BOINC projects as well. Not a religious cult tho but I know enough of cult-like ideologies to know one when I see one. What makes an ideology a cult? Look what Mao did - he made a cult out of himself, and the party officials became his High Priests. The BOINC community is anything else than a community even though it is claimed to be Open Source: a community would mean transparency and making things interesting - see Linux and the all the Linux boards that sprinkle of life, of ideas, of actual participating. See the always actual Linux wikis. THAT is Open Source life, that is how I think all BOINC based projects should be run... The projects themselves, especially SETI, are not like that. The leaders are in their ivory tower of science, and many hardly share any of their appreciateed time to drop a post directed to the dumb masses. Sure there are a few who are allowed to contribute apps or to write something into the Wiki, but these few have approval by the powers that be. A cult? Damn, YES! All normal users are claimed to be valued but are only valued IF they donate money added to their computer power. Those who dare to not donate money are treated as mere annoying disturbances - even more when they dare to criticize what's wrong. You don't pay your tithing? You criticize our leaders? Or the project? The TRUTH??? You are NOT believing in our case, so why should YOU have a say in here? Go away, Non-believer, or shut the hell up like a good cult-member should do, and pay your tithing, then you are valued again... Who does need participating users anyway, just the crunching machines will do, together with a pay-to-play system So no need for boards and dealing with the users - even the answers to FAQ could be Googled. Someone sure will answer them somewhere, YOU, the scientist, don't have the time for it. Participating users need a social place, there they need rules and need to be spoken at, need to be encouraged or even informed about results already or not yet achieved... what a stress, what a discomfort... you have to leave the comfort of the ivory tower to do so... Then the participants even begin to question your chosen representers, your actions and non-actions, your project - how ungrateful of them! Can't they just shut up and let you do your hobby, the science? Stricter rules have to be made, the volunteering representers have to be given more power... what a stress, what a discomfort, to leave the ivory tower to do so... | 354) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW#60 - TL04 is & we are CLOSED for reconstruction](forum_thread.php?id=46098) ( [Message 730730](forum_thread.php?id=46098&postid=730730)) Posted 26 Mar 2008 Post: Good night SETI ;) btw, Phil: nice math puzzle you have chosen!

I started with 45, devided by 3 to get the oldest childs age, which is 15 (15x3). The 45 devided by 5 for the second child or 9. And the third is the oldest, 15, minus 14 (since he is 14 years younger than the oldest). for an age of 1. Add 10 years to each of the children to get to todays age is 15+10=25; 9+10=19; 1+10=11.

But unfortunately I don't have a say in that subject... :,( Peru tribe battles oil giant over pollution By Dan Collyns BBC News, Loreto, Peru Tomas Maynas says fish died and crops wilted It is a familiar story. Big business moves into a pristine wilderness and starts destroying the environment and by turn the livelihoods of the indigenous people who live there. But in a reversal of plot, there are now cases of people living traditional lifestyles who are now invading the territory of the big companies and taking them on at their own game. The story of the Achuar tribe living in the Amazon rainforest of north-eastern Peru is one of them. Last year, they filed a class action lawsuit against oil giant Occidental Petroleum, in Los Angeles. Now they are awaiting a judge's decision on whether the case can proceed in the US or will be sent back to Peru, where it stands little chance of coming to court. 'No credible data The Achuar people, who have lived for thousands of years in the rainforest, allege that the company contaminated their territory during more than 30 years of oil drilling, making their people sick, even causing some to die, and damaging their land and livelihoods beyond repair. Occidental Petroleum, which pulled out of Peru eight years ago, denies liability in the case. Oil spills are still found, the Achuar say It has responded, saying: \"We are aware of no credible data of negative community health impacts resulting from Occidental's operations in Peru.\" The oil bonanza began in Peru almost 40 years ago when many foreign companies were given an open invitation by successive governments to test and drill in the Amazon. What they did not consider was the devastating impact it would have on the native people, principally the Achuar - their land, their livelihood and their health. The Achuar's spiritual leader, Tomas Maynas, wears a bright red headdress made of toucan feathers, and has red war paint streaked on his face. He is the plaintiff in the suit against the company. He remembers how everything changed when the oil companies arrived. He says the animals ran away, the fish died and their crops started to wilt. A whole generation had their health damaged. How can we keep quiet as our parents did Petronila Chumpi \"The Peruvian state just wants to extract as much oil as they can from our land. They've made millions of dollars but we haven't seen it here. \"We know there's wealth here and there'll be more drilling so the state will keep on killing us. But sometimes, when there is pressure, the state gives in.\" The lawsuit alleges Occidental Petroleum ignored industry standards and employed out-of-date practices, dumping around 9bn barrels of toxic waste water into streams and rivers over 30 years. After Occidental left, its operations were taken over by Pluspetrol. Pluspetrol agreed to change practices in late 2006 when the Achuar, after repeated attempts to negotiate, took direct action. Shotguns and spears Many of the older Achuar men once fought in tribal wars with their neighbours, now they finally had the chance to hit their elusive new enemies where it hurt - in their pockets. Peacefully, yet armed with shotguns and spears, they occupied and held the Amazon oil wells in October 2006. The ecosystem is the genetic bank of the Amazon...that is our capital, the genetic bank that we have to preserve for humanity, and for the world Ivan Vasquez Loreto regional president The government and the company, losing millions of dollars a day, were forced to come to the negotiating table. The Achuar came away with a commitment from Pluspetrol to reduce contamination and to pay millions of dollars to clean up and establish a 10-year health plan. It was thanks to help from outside but also a new generation of indigenous leaders who are learning how to protect their rights in the modern world. \"A whole generation had their health damaged. How can we keep quiet as our parents did?\" asks 29-year-old Petronila Chumpi. \"We can't allow this, we're a new generation, we know how to read and write and we have to help our people because they didn't have the knowledge to defend themselves against the oil companies. But now we do.\" Improvement Even on a fast motorboat, Trompeteros is a long day's journey up three rain-swollen rivers from Loreto's regional capital, Iquitos. A hamlet of some 3,000 people, it is situated right opposite Block Eight, one of the main oil wells. The Achuar have lived in the region for thousands of years Local people say there is still contamination and oil spills, but now the Achuar have GPS transceivers to log the problems where they find them. Little by little there are signs of improvement. But there is frustration on the part of Pluspetrol, which has pledged to pay millions of dollars, that the government is not playing a bigger role. \"This oil industry should be of benefit for everybody - maybe today it's not of benefit to indigenous people and the government should find the best way to solve that problem,\" says Roberto Ramallo, general manager of Pluspetrol Norte. But the problem is that the Achuar and other tribes live on top of potentially enormous reserves of crude oil. Thanks to an intense drive to auction it off, almost three-quarters of the Peruvian Amazon is leased for oil exploration and extraction. High global demand and the price of oil is also making companies look at the Peruvian Amazon as an attractive prospect, but is it sustainable? \"All of this petroleum exploration in the Amazon is a grand experiment,\" says Bill Powers of E-Tech, a not-for-profit engineering firm. \"It's just coming into the jungle, developing the resource, getting the economic benefit and historically it's been whatever happens to whoever was there before, happens. \"There's no plan, there's no effort made to ensure that they maintain their cultural integrity or that they have something to do once the rivers and the forest don't provide what they used to provide.\" Future plans Carbon trading schemes have yet to reach this part of the Amazon and the oil boom is not the only threat. President Alan Garcia has proposed privatising large areas of the rainforest, but local officials say the government in Lima does not understand the impact this would have. Pluspetrol Norte says oil should benefit everyone The regional president of Loreto, Ivan Vasquez, says the Amazon needs to preserve its diversity at all costs. \"The ecosystem is the genetic bank of the Amazon, as it brings together genetic matrices which don't exist anywhere else - thousands of interconnected genetic bases. \"That is our capital, the genetic bank that we have to preserve for humanity, and for the world.\" The Achuar have so far rejected new oil exploration on their territory. Their story is an emblematic case of resistance for indigenous Amazonians and is unprecedented in Peru. But the Peruvian rainforest, the biggest stretch of Amazon outside Brazil, is still the focus of the relentless global hunt to find new sources of fossil fuels. | 360) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [Cars present part 2](forum_thread.php?id=40517) ( 730227](forum_thread.php?id=40517&postid=730227)) Posted 25 Mar 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: GM concepts The truck on the bottom left is definitively designed by Colani (that is, not an official GM concept since there are Colani trucks based on almost every brand), as well as the yellow bubbly car above it.

LEHREN By the time Specialist Jerry Ryen King decided to write about his experiences in Iraq, the teenage paratrooper had more to share than most other soldiers. In two operations to clear the outskirts of the village of Turki in the deadly Diyala Province, Specialist King and the rest of the Fifth Squadron faced days of firefights, grenade attacks and land mines. Well-trained insurgents had burrowed deep into muddy canals, a throwback to the trenches of World War I. As the fighting wore on, B-1 bombers and F-16s were called in to drop a series of powerful bombs. Once the area was clear of insurgents, the squadron, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, uncovered hidden caches of weapons. Two months later, Specialist King, a handsome former honors student and double-sport athlete from Georgia, sat down at his computer. In informal but powerful prose, he began a journal. After 232 long, desolate, morose, but somewhat days of tranquility into deployment, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve decided that I should start writing some of the things I experienced here in Iraq. I have to say that the events that I have encountered here have changed my outlook on life... The most recent mission started out as a 24-36 hour air-assault sniper mission in a known al-Qaida stronghold just north of Baghdad. We landed a few hours before daybreak and as soon as I got off the helicopter my night vision broke, I was surrounded by the sound of artillery rounds, people screaming in Arabic, automatic weapons, and the terrain didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t look anything like what we were briefed. I knew it was going to be a bad day and a half. Jerry Ryen King, journal entry, March 7, 2007 A month later, Specialist King was sitting inside his combat outpost, an abandoned school in Sadah, when suicide bombers exploded two dump trucks just outside the building. The school partly collapsed, killing Specialist King on April 23, 2007, along with eight other soldiers, and making the blast one of the most lethal for Americans fighting in Iraq. In that instant, Specialist King became one of 4,000 service members and Defense Department civilians to die in the Iraq war \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac a milestone that was reached late Sunday, five years since the war began in March 2003. The last four members of that group, like the majority of the most recent 1,000 to die, were killed by an improvised explosive device, known as an I.E.D. They died at 10 p.m. Sunday on a patrol in Baghdad, military officials said; their names have not yet been released. The next day we cleared an area that made me feel as if I were in Vietnam. Honestly, it was one of the scariest times of my life. At one point I was in water up to my waist and heard an AK fire in my direction. But all in all the day was going pretty good, no one was hurt, I got to shoot a few rounds, toss a grenade, and we were walking to where the helicopter was supposed to pick us up. Jerry Ryen King, journal entry, March 7, 2007 The year 2007 would prove to be especially hard on American service members; more of them died last year than in any other since the war began. Many of those deaths came in the midst of the 30,000-troop buildup known as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"the surge,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 the linchpin of President Bush\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s strategy to tamp down widespread violence between Islamic Sunnis and Shiites, much of it in Baghdad. In April, May and June alone, 331 American service members died, making it the war\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s deadliest three-month period. But by fall, the strategy, bolstered by new alliances with Sunni tribal chiefs and a decision by the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr to order his militia to stop fighting, appeared to be paying off as the country entered a period of relative calm. Military casualties and Iraqi civilian deaths fell, and the October-December period produced the fewest casualties of any three months of the war. The past month, though, has seen an uptick in killings and explosions, particularly suicide bombings. The violence has traveled north to Mosul, where the group calling itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia remains strong. Everything changed in a matter of 15 minutes... About the time I was opening my MRE (meal ready to eat) I heard an explosion. Everyone started running towards the sound of the explosion. Apparently a suicide bomber had blown himself up killing four soldiers from my squadron and injuring another. Our 36 hour mission turned into another air-assault into a totally different city, the clearing of it, and 5 more days. We did find over 100 RPG\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s, IED making materials, insurgents implacing IED\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s, artillery rounds, a sniper rifle, and sort of like a terrorist training book and cd\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. Jerry Ryen King, journal entry, March 7, 2007 Unlike the soldiers of some previous wars, who were only occasionally able to send letters back home to loved ones, many of those who died left behind an extraordinary electronic testimony describing in detail the labor, the fears and the banality of serving in Iraq. In excerpts published here from journals, blogs and e-mail, six soldiers who died in the most recent group of 1,000 mostly skim the alarming particulars of combat, a kindness shown their relatives and close friends. Instead, they plunge readily into the mundane, but no less important rhythms of home. They fire off comments about holiday celebrations, impending weddings, credit card bills, school antics and the creeping anxiety of family members who are coping with one deployment too many. At other moments, the service members describe the humor of daily life down range, as they call it. Hurriedly, with little time to worry about spelling or grammar, they riff on the chaos around them and reveal moments of fear. As casualties climb and the violence intensifies, so does their urge to share their grief and foreboding. A Last Goodbye Hey beautiful well we were on blackout again, we lost yet some more soldiers.

Juan Campos, 27, flew from Baghdad to Texas for two weeks last year, there was more on his mind than rest and relaxation. He visited his father\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s grave, which he had never seen. He spent time with his grandparents and touched base with the rest of his rambling, extended family. The day he was scheduled to return to war, Sergeant Campos and his wife went out dancing and drinking all evening with friends. Calm and reserved by nature, Sergeant Campos could out-salsa and out-hip-hop most anyone on the dance floor. At the airport, his wife, Jamie Campos, who had grown used to the upheaval of deployment, surprised herself. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I cried and I have never ever cried before,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Mrs. Campos, 26, who has a 9-year-old son, Andre. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It was just really, really weird. He knew, and I kind of knew. It felt different.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We both felt that it was the last goodbye,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 she said. Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2006 Mood: gloomy The life of an infantryman is never safe..how do I know, well I live it every day. I lost a good friend of mine just two days ago to an enemy sniper. The worst feeling in the world is having lost one of your own and not being able to fight back. The more I go on patrol, the more alert I tend to be, but regardless of the situation here in Iraq is that we are never safe. No matter the countermeasures we take to prevent any attacks. They seem to seep through the cracks. Every day a soldier is lost or wounded by enemy attacks. I for one would like to make it home to my family one day. Pray for us and keep us in your thoughts...for an infantryman\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s life is never safe. Juan Campos, Myspace blog Sergeant Campos, a member of the First Battalion, 26th Infantry, Charlie Company out of Germany, was one of thousands of infantrymen assigned to stabilize Baghdad and the surrounding areas last year during the troop buildup. Troops were sent deep into insurgent neighborhoods, where they lived in small outposts, patrolled on foot, cleared houses, mingled with Iraqis and rebuilt the infrastructure. The extra 30,000 service members \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac 160,000 in all \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac were deployed to Iraq to help quell the runaway violence that threatened large-scale civil war. Most soldiers spent 15 months in Iraq, a length of time that military commanders have said is unsustainable. Many had fought in the war at least once. A few had been in Iraq multiple times. My only goals are to make it out of this place alive and return you guys and make you as happy as I can. Juan Campos, e-mail message to his wife Dec. 15, 2006 But to Sergeant Campos and the rest of Charlie Company in Adhamiya, a north Baghdad stronghold for Sunni insurgents, the buildup seemed oddly invisible. The men patrolled almost every day, sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day for months, often in 120-degree weather. Exhaustion was too kind a word for their fatigue. More than 150 soldiers lived in a two-story house with portable toilets, no air-conditioning and temperamental showers. Sleep came only a few hours at a time. The fighting was vicious. Adhamiya was such a magnet for sectarian bloodletting that the military built a wall around it to contain the violence. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"They walled us in and left us there,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Staff Sgt. Robin Johnson, 28, said of the 110 men in Charlie Company. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We were a family. I would die for these guys before I die for my own blood brother.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 On patrol, sniper fire rang out so routinely that soldiers in Sergeant Campos\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s platoon seldom stood still for more than four seconds. They scoured rooftops for Iraqi children who lobbed grenades at American soldiers for a handful of cash. Roadside bombs burst from inside drainage pipes, impossible to detect from the street. The bombs grew larger by the month. Last year, these powerful improvised explosive devices were responsible for a majority of American fatalities, a new milestone. The bombs also killed multiple soldiers more often than in the past, a testament to their potency. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It was the most horrible thing you could possibly imagine,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Sergeant Johnson said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"As soon as you left the gate, you could die at any second. If you went out for a day and you weren\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t attacked, it was confusing.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Charlie Company soldiers found a steady stream of Iraqis killed by insurgents for money or revenge. Some had their faces wiped clean by acid. Others were missing their heads or limbs. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbIt Could Have Been Me\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 to tell the story of iraq is a hard one. Ryan Wood, Myspace blog Sgt. Ryan M. Wood, 22, a gifted artist, prolific writer and a sly romantic from Oklahoma, was also one of the bluntest soldiers inside Charlie Company. it is fighting extreme boredom with the lingering thought in the forefront of your mind that any minute on this patrol could be my last endeavour, only highlighted by times of such extreme terror and an adrenaline rush that no drug can touch. what [expletive] circumstances thinking \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"that should\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve been me\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"it could\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve been me\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. wondering it that pile of trash will suddenly explode killing you or worse one of your beloved comrads..only backed by the past thoughts and experiences of really losing friends of yours and not feeling completely hopeless that it was all for nothing because all in all, you know the final outcome of this war. it is walking on that thin line between sanity and insanity. that feeling of total abandonment by a government and a country you used to love because politics are fighting this war......and its a losing battle....and we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re the ones ultimently paying the price. Ryan Wood, Myspace blog, Adhamiya For the soldiers in Iraq, reconciling Adhamiya with America was not always easy. One place was buried in garbage and gore and hopelessness. The other seemed unmoored from the war, fixated on the minutia of daily life and the hiccups of the famous. The media was content to indulge. What the Hell America?? \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"What the hell happened?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 any intelligent American might ask themselves throughout their day.

Ryan Wood, Myspace blog, May 26, 2007 The somberness of the job was hard to shake off. But, day to day, there was no more reliable antidote than Pfc. Daniel J. Agami, a South Floridian with biceps the size of cantaloupes, and Pfc. Ryan J. Hill, a self-described hellion who loved his \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"momma\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 and hailed from what he called the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"felony flats\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 of Oregon. Funny men in the best sense of the word, the two provided a valuable and essential commodity in a war zone. Their mother jokes \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac the kind that begin, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"your mother is so...\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac were legendary, culminating in a Myspace joke-off. It ended abruptly after an enough-is-enough phone call from Private Hill\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mother, who ranked No. 1 on his list of heroes in Myspace. Private Agami proclaimed victory. About a month later...I went to my room and my mattress was missing and all my close were being worn by other people. I couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t figure it out so I knew right off the bat to go to Hill. I saw him walking down the hall wearing five of my winter jackets. He sold half my wardrobe right off his back to people in our company and my mattress was in someone else\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s room. So then I had go to around and buy all my stuff back. (Now I think he won). Daniel J. Agami, Charlie Company. Eulogy sent via e-mail message to his mother, Jan. 29, 2007 To keep their spirits up, combat soldiers learned to appreciate the incongruities of war in Iraq. Jokes scrawled inside a Port-o-Potty quickly made the rounds. Situational humor, from goofy to macabre, proved plentiful. A really girly guy who was a cheerleader in high school, got knocked down and nearly hurt by the wind of the helicopter. Listening to Dickson recite what was in every single MRE was pretty funny. A cow charged and nearly trampled one of my friends when we were raiding a compound. And lastly, I thought that it was pretty comical that I shot at a guy a long ways out but missed and later after taking his house and using it as a patrol base he offered me Chai and rice. Jerry Ryen King, Diyala Province Even a trip to the dentist, with its fringe benefits, is cause for amusement in a war zone. Last Sat. I had two of my wisdom teeth pulled. After taking double the prescribe percocot and morphine pills that the doctor gave me for the pain I decided to catch a flight back to my FOB (forward operation base). It was the coolest Blackhawk ride I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve had, I was absolutely ripped and I talked the pilots into leaving the doors open. We had four more guys die a couple days ago. They hit an IED, it killed everyone in the humvee.. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s starting to get a little scary. We made it our first six months with just two deaths and that was plenty. But now just in the past two and a half weeks we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve had nine more guys get killed, and over 50 wounded. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2m just hoping that I can make it the 75 more days or so that we have left of combat operations before we start packing. Jerry Ryen King, journal entry, April 11, 2007 Among the guys in Charlie Company, Private Agami, 25, was one of the boldest and most resilient. He was the kind of guy who joined an endurance ski contest on a whim. He came in fourth. He had never skied in his life. Private Agami had time for everyone, and everyone had time for him. Affectionately called G.I. Jew, he held his religion up to the light. He used it to build tolerance among the troops and shatter stereotypes; few in his unit had ever met a Jew. He flew the Israeli flag over his cot in Adhamiya. He painted the words Hebrew Hammer onto his rifle. He even managed to keep kosher, a feat that required a steady diet of protein shakes and cereal. Commander Mom, I cant wait to come home and when I do, dont worry ill have allot to say to the congregation. Dont worry about my mental stage either, we all receive counseling and help from doctors when something like this happens. I am a strong individual physically and mentally and if there is one thing the army teaches you, it is how to deal with death. Everyday that passes it gets easier and easier. I miss you guys very much and I love you! Daniel Agami, e-mail message to his mother, Oct. 28, 2006 It did not get easier. I try not to cry. I have never cried this much my entire life. two great men got taken from us way too soon. i wonder why it was them in not me. I sit here right now wondering why did they go to the gates of heaven n not me. I try everynight count my blessing that I made it another day but why are we in this hell over here? why? i cant stop askin why? Ryan Hill, Myspace blog, Nov. 1, 2006. Private Hill was riding in a Humvee on Jan. 20, 2007, when an I.E.D. buried in the middle of the road detonated under his seat, killing him instantly. Sergeant Campos was riding in a Humvee on May 14, 2007, two weeks after returning from Texas, when it hit an I.E.D. The bomb lifted the Humvee five feet off the ground and engulfed it in flames. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"That\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s when we just left hope at the door,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Sergeant Johnson said. Severely burned over 80 percent of his body, Sergeant Campos lived two weeks. He died June 1. Another soldier, Pfc. Nicholas S. Hartge, 20, of Indiana, died in the same attack. Private Agami was driving a Bradley fighting vehicle on June 21, 2007, when it hit an I.E.D. The explosion flipped the 30-ton vehicle, which also carried Sergeant Wood. Both men were killed, along with three other soldiers and an Iraqi interpreter. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Obviously, it came to a point, you didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t care anymore if it got better,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Staff Sgt. Jeremy S. Rausch, 31, one of Sergeant Campos\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s best friends in Charlie Company. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t care about the people because they didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t care about themselves. We had already lost enough people that we just thought, you know, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbwhy?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 During their time in Adhamiya, the soldiers of Charlie Company caught more than two dozen high-value targets, found nearly 50 weapons caches, detained innumerable insurgents and won countless combat awards. They lost 14 men. Their mission was hailed a success. Just in Case Texan to the core, enamored of the military, Specialist Daniel E. Gomez, 21, an Army combat medic in the division\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s Alpha Company, relied on his books, his iPod and an Xbox to distract him from the swirl. strange but this place where we are at is unreal almost. I hope I come back mentally in shape. lol. Daniel Gomez, Myspace blog, Sept. 9, 2006 He took pride in being the guy who tended to wounded soldiers under fire, patching them up to help them survive. As the violence intensified, Specialist Gomez set aside thoughts of a free Iraq or a safer America and, like generations of soldiers before him, simply started fighting for the soldier next to him. A few days ago I realized why I am here in Baghdad dealing with all the gunfire, the rocket attacks, the IEDs, the car bombs, the death. I have only been here going on a month and a half. Already I have seen what war really is... but officially its called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"full spectrum operations.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 No I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t down Bush, he is my CinC, and I think he is doing an good job with what Clinton left him. I don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t debate why we are involved in Iraq. I just know why I am here. It is not for the smiling Iraqi kids, or the even the feeling of wearing the uniform ( it feels damn good though :) . I am here for the soldier on patrol with me. But why are you there in the states. Why are you having that nice dinner, watching TV, going out on dates... Daniel Gomez, e-mail to friends and family. Sept. 27, 2006 And then Specialist Gomez fell in love. An e-mail flirtation with Katy Broom, his sister\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s close friend, gradually led to a cyberexchange of guarded promises about the future. Headed home for a rest break in May, the tentativeness lifted and they began to rely on each other to get through the day. The two joked about \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"the best sex we never had.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 ...this R&R there is someone new in my life. Exactly what she is too me, and what I am to her is uncertain, but its not really important at the moment. Just the thought that I could spent a second of my life with her, before I have to come back here makes everything worth it. Daniel Gomez, Myspace blog, May 9, 2007 Rest and relaxation in Georgia went better than expected. He fell in love with the love of his life all over again, this time in person. The couple shared one kiss during his leave. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He was everything I expected and more,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Ms. Broom, 20, who spent one week and two days with him. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It was kind of surreal when we met. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s almost like a perfect love and war story.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Not many soldiers leave behind a just-in-case letter. Specialist Gomez did. He handed Ms. Broom an envelope at the airport with the words, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t read unless something happens to me.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 On July 18, 2007, two months after his leave, Specialist Gomez died in Adhamiya when the Bradley fighting vehicle he was in struck a roadside bomb. The explosion and flames also killed three other soldiers. Ms. Broom waited three days after she got word to open the letter.

We were supposed to meet, darling. I needed someone to make me smile, someone that was an old romantic like I was. I was going through a very rough time in Iraq and I was startin to doubt my mental state. Then one day after a patrol, I go to my facebook and there you were... I can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t stop crying while I writing this letter, but I have to talk to you one last time, because maybe the last time I heard your voice I did not know it would be the last time I heard your voice....

A Note from Michael Moore Monday, March 24th, 2008 Friends, It would have to happen on Easter Sunday, wouldn't it, that the 4,000th American soldier would die in Iraq. Play me that crazy preacher again, will you, about how maybe God, in all his infinite wisdom, may not exactly be blessing America these days. Is anyone surprised? 4,000 dead. Unofficial estimates are that there may be up to 100,000 wounded, injured, or mentally ruined by this war. And there could be up to a million Iraqi dead. We will pay the consequences of this for a long, long time. God will keep blessing America. And where is Darth Vader in all this? A reporter from ABC News this week told Dick Cheney, in regards to Iraq, \"two-thirds of Americans say it's not worth fighting.\" Cheney cut her off with a one word answer: \"So?\" \"So?\" As in, \"So what?\" As in, \"F*** you. I could care less.\" I would like every American to see Cheney flip the virtual bird at the them, the American people. [Click here](http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/19/cheney-poll-iraq/) and pass it around. Then ask yourself why we haven't risen up and thrown him and his puppet out of the White House. The Democrats have had the power to literally pull the plug on this war for the past 15 months -- and they have refused to do so. What are we to do about that? Continue to sink into our despair? Or get creative? Real creative. I know there are many of you reading this who have the chutzpah and ingenuity to confront your local congressperson. Will you? For me? Cheney spent Wednesday, the 5th anniversary of the war, not mourning the dead he killed, but fishing off the Sultan of Oman's royal yacht. So? Ask your favorite Republican what they think of that. The Founding Fathers would never have uttered the presumptuous words, \"God Bless America.\" That, to them, sounded like a command instead of a request, and one doesn't command God, even if they are America. In fact, they were worried God would punish America. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington feared that God would react unfavorably against his soldiers for the way they were behaving. John Adams wondered if God might punish America and cause it to lose the war, just to prove His point that America was not worthy. They and the others believed it would be arrogant on their part to assume that God would single out America for a blessing. What a long road we have traveled since then. I see that Frontline on PBS this week has a documentary called \"Bush's War.\" That's what I've been calling it for a long time. It's not the \"Iraq War.\" Iraq did nothing. Iraq didn't plan 9/11. It didn't have weapons of mass destruction. It DID have movie theaters and bars and women wearing what they wanted and a significant Christian population and one of the few Arab capitals with an open synagogue. But that's all gone now. Show a movie and you'll be shot in the head. Over a hundred women have been randomly executed for not wearing a scarf. I'm happy, as a blessed American, that I had a hand in all this. I just paid my taxes, so that means I helped to pay for this freedom we've brought to Baghdad. So? Will God bless me? God bless all of you in this Easter Week as we begin the 6th year of Bush's War. God help America. Please.

Of course this caused reservations at the patient's mother.) At the next appointment, the doctor said: \"[...] my being transgendered is not a secret. I just assumed that you knew. That is the reason most of my transgendered patients come to me and feel comfortable working with me, because we have a common understanding of the issues. If we were little kids, I'd use the playground retort to an insult, that it takes one to know one.\" [...] \"I don't understand Doctor, Jenny, you look so...\" I couldn't get myself to say the words. Realistic, convincing, I finally came up with \"... feminine\". \"Amazing what a boatload of hormones, a couple of bags of silicone and the removal of some superfluous plumbing can do for you,\" she retorted. I couldn't help myself, I cracked up. \"None of that would make a man a woman,\" I finally got out. \"He'd just be a very emotional soprano with a lumpy chest [...]\" Or as the last sentence in that [article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jan/31/gender.weekend7) says, which is quoted in wikipedia: ...I don't have a problem with men disposing of their genitals, but it does not make them women, in the same way that shoving a bit of vacuum hose down your 501s does not make you a man. So what makes a person a man or a woman - if not the \"plumbing\"? Since I know a few post-operation transsexual people myself, I can just agree with these statements quoted above. None of them acts like a [Eunuch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuch) with breasts, but they are acting like any naturally born women, fitting to their new appearance. Actually one of them is so convincing female, I didn't believe at first that it was the same person I knew as male before - while in my opinion another one (my former class-mate) might need a facial softening to become fully acceptable as a woman... Back to the story, this doctor explains: \"[...]Being transgendered is a state of mind, not body. Physical appearance simply helps others to relate to you in the proper perspective, which brings us full circle to your son's behavior.\" That made me wonder: Do the transgendered simply undergo this (not just risk-less) operation because our society rather accepts trans-men and trans-women than men who act female and women who act male? Are the gender-roles still so deep inside our minds that we cannot accept people who are different in gender meanings, even call them sick or pervert? Is it the Catholic heritage considering them as acting against God's commandments? There have been many transgendered persons in other cultures throughout the ages since the times of the Code of Hammurabi (who ruled ca. 1796 BC \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac 1750 BC in ancient Babylon), even the Native Americans had their share ( [Two-Spirit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit)). These cultures accepted their \"being different\" and made them part of the society. So the argument of \"transgenderism being just an invention of recent times\" isn't working. So why are \"WE\" (the western civilizations) do not accept them these days? | 380) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) 2008 win :P | 381) |[Message SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning between two power naps :) | : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [gender, sex, 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: A couple of weeks later at work he wanted to talk about the changes he was going through and that he was planning a sex change operation. As a close friend I couldn't help but try to understand and support him in his pursuit of happiness. That was until he told me the real reason he was going through all this. After reading that post I wonder if your \"friend\" really was doing it for the right reasons, or those that he considered might be the best option... If a person honestly considers himself to be a woman trapped in a mans body, or vice versa, then I'm all for corrective surgery (aka Gender reassignment), but if they simply have a mental issue because they feel that they dont fit in, or want to be like the other sex, then I have to wonder if thats the right thing to do? I think theres a fine line to say \"I'm a woman, but I was born with a penis\" compared to, \"I am a man and I like men, and I really envy Jenny because all the guys like her. I might get my penis converted to a Vagina to be like her\". (AFAIK) That's why usually a person claiming to be transgendered has to go through a long and severe psychological examination before they are allowed to get The Operation, getting the permission by the psychologist only if they can be verified as really transgendered. This point given I'm getting the impression after reading your post, that your friend might not have passed the psychological examinations, that'S why he needed to go to Thailand to have the operation done there. | 383) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : 2008 having SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning without black pudding, powered by pure caffeine :D | 385) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good morning/evening/afternoon, my friends Sad to hear that Colonel Flooding has annected you valley, Dan.

See, the Kurds were encouraged by us to start an uprising back in 1991, then we bailed on them and they were left with no support and Saddam's forces easily regained control and killed thousands. I don't know what the \"answer\" is, but an immediate and full withdrawl is likely not going to be the \"correct answer\". The issue over there is that people simply will not try to get along. There have been centuries, perhaps millenia, of fighting. Iraq is in a weakened state. If we pull out, there are several possibilities, one of which is an invasion by Turkey in the North, coinciding with an invasion by Iran and Syria. I think that you can see where this would not be very ideal for the world as a whole, but perhaps you think that a united Arab front would be \"good\" to counter American influence via threats upon oil reserves and Israel...? and recruiters are sent out to feed the youth with lies to get more cannon fodder... Again, I had the choice to pursue a career in the Nuclear Power Officer Candidate program. I initiated that sequence of events by voluntarily taking the ASVAB. No matter what you may think, if I had even made it to Lieutenant, let alone Lieutenant Commander, Commander, or Captain, I could easily get a job with any of the major power companies here in the United States, or just a \"simple\" teaching job at a university... In a sub, I would not be \"cannon fodder\", unless dealing with other subs or destroyers / minefields, and the last time I checked, the only fleet with potentially matching skills and capabilities would be the Russian fleet. I understand you, and yet I am convinced that you could have got this professional education in civil companies as well. The main lie of the recruiters is (I heard that myself when overhearing a recruiting discussion) that you can only get the best professional education and the chance to work in that profession if you are willing to join military. That poor guy I overheard was intersted in cars, not in shooting - he wanted to become mechanic. \"Join us, and we give you the opportunity to not only learn he skills but also to work as a mechanic for sure,\" was the content of what the recruiter told him. Huh? Why shouldn't that be possible as well when remaining a civilian? That guy and I discussed later and remained penpals when I left the States (I was on vacation over there as I told before). Last time I heard of that guy was a short note of his parents that he died abroad in one of these wars back in the 90s. | 434) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while going back to bed :) | 435) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [What the heck is up in Berkeley?!](forum_thread.php?id=45202) ( 726750](forum_thread.php?id=45202&postid=726750)) Posted 16 Mar 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: In my opinion, it's easy to distinguish friend from foe.

This is exactly what is being done, not firing until being fired upon, and is why any kind of ground-based \"Civil War\" will have problems, as the opposition knows that you can't be 100% accurate at telling them apart going by how they look. There's no need anymore for this Civil war anywa: saddam is out of the way, the old regime is gone, the US troops are overdue to leave the invaded country since years ago. I'm just convinced that ALL wars (except when being attacked and invaded) are a)100% unnecessary and b) 100% avoidable. They can be avoided by the art of diplomacy or by intelligence actions - and that easily, if the governments only wanted to.

Yeah, well that very same religious crap you're using to defend your stance also teaches an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. So I even change my advise to all young people: If you don't want to be a killer, refuse to serve in a military that will send you to other countries and orders you to kill their civil citizens! Guess what genius, military service isn't a requirement over here, it's a choice every single current member of the US military made of their own freewill. In my opinion, it's easy to distinguish friend from foe. Everyone who don't raise their weapon against me is NOT my enemy even if I'm told they are. I rather consider those who would order me to shoot at civilians my enemy. I've already told my former superior that I would have turned around and aimed my gun at the person giving me the order to aim my weapon at unarmed (or even obviously unarmed) civilians if I had been in a situation like that. He didn't like that idea, but knowing me he knew I would have done so no matter what happened to me then. So not only did you previously advise the youth of the world to commit crimes, you now allege to have threatened the life of one of your superiors. Seems to me that on top of everything else, you're full of crap too. I didn't threaten him. I told him way after my service, when we talked about several nasty situations that happened back in 1988/89, that I would have turned my gun at him if he had ordered me to shoot at civilians. If I were full of crap (what I'm not, according to people who are far more qualified to judge that than you), then thanks to the military service that I, in opposite to you, had to attend. I even did agitate against military before, and quite effectfully. When my step-sons came into the age to attend their military service, I talked them into attending alternative service instead - that way they were not bound to serve elsewhere abroad, but could actually serve our country by doing good. And I talked all parents of my step-children's class-mates into doing likewise. Even despite the salary of a soldier who was sent to serve in, let's say, Namibia is much higher than the salary of one who attends social service in his home town instead, my efforts were successful. Between 2002 and 2005, no boy and no girl from the school where my step-kids were studying went to attend military service but chose alternative services instead - thanks to their parents who listened to me. | 441) |[Message 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning whilst watching the last third of \"Hair\" ...poor Berger... | 443) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) I always liked [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyYTz-r52QI) Mar 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: My thought of the day is: Always do what your conscience advises you - no matter what others order you to do. | 445) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : | 446) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [109 Random Know.

Why would they have done it even without 9/11? The profits of the weapon system producing companies were going down, they urgently needed a push.

It was well known before 9/11 that Osama was operating out of Afghanistan, and that people affliated with him had attacked US interestes overseas (US embassies in Africa, the Cole, etc). That the US government had plans ready for an invasion given these facts does not suggest to me that the US wanted an excuse to invade, rather that should a further attack occur of sufficient magnitude, there would be no delay responding to the general public's quite unsterstandable call for a response. Simply put, I would be shocked if our leaders did not ask on a regular basis: \"Where are our enemies? Do we have plans should they decide to attack?\" Since Osama was trained by the CIA himself, I would not be astonished if it turned out that all these attacks on the embassies were set up to awaken a fear of terrorists.

Aaah I see: Once more the USA as the World's Uber-sheriff... There has been NO NEED for the USA to defend themselves against any other country since 1945. Even Pearl Harbor - heck, that was just an over-sea station on a place the Navy had no reason to be in the first place, they were only there to represent America's wish to show-off as a military super-power everywhere! They even overreacted on this attack! The attack on Pearl Harbor being an attack on the entire United States of America? Go figure! You really should read up on history before trying to claim \"show off\". The fleet was there to try to protect others, one of which was ironically China. After the attack on December 7th, Japan formally declared war on US on December 8th. According to what I'm reading, the formal declaration was actually supposed to have happened about 30 minutes BEFORE the attack on December 7th, but the person delivering the message got delayed.Well, in my opinion this declaraton of war by the Japanese Tenno was as if let's say Switzerland or the Vatican would declare war on US - a too little country to be a serious threat and too far away to be really effective with the little ressources they had, but it was a sign to \"not lose their face\". Since the Tenno was no Hitler., there were other ways possible than this war there, and to drop those nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki some time later - which was totally exaggerated, inhuman, and showed some more time that the US want to be seen as nothing else than a military superpower. The actions of your country as well as Japan helped shape the actions in the years since. If it hadn't been for the attack and Hitler's alliance with Japan, our country probably wouldn't have entered Europe until 1943 or 1944, since we were at the time pretty much isolationist.What is to say against isolationism? If I were deciding here in Germany, I would end Germany's membership in the EU & in the NATO, and would try to be neutral. The problem is that this country has learned that if we're not prepared, the fight will come to us. The isolationism caused us to get burned. Right. The US were FORCED by being attacked to enter Korea, Vietnam, and all the other countries since. Or was it the other way around? Invade these countries before they are even ready to think about attacking us? Like: Kick their a**es as long as they are weak, that they learn who's the boss! Sorry but do you really believe that militaristic crap you're tryig to tell me? Isolationism is what is driving the whole Berkeley stuff anyway, and it is the opinion you seem to be stating as well. And why not? Haven't enough American and foreign people died in wars the US have started by invasion? I have nothing against having military trained forces to keep the power to defend the country - but the US military is not defending, it's attacking others. For pure Defence, you don't even need all these forces that exist now. Just the National Guard, in need reinforced by the Reserves, would be enough. These morons scream \"no blood for oil\", then will turn right around and complain about the price of gas. Sure. Blame the customers when companies raise their prices out of sheer greed. When there are proposals about drilling to find more oil, these same morons will oppose that.What, to find more oil? ou already have enough. And you could ask Canada to export some to you. Just squeeze the oil ressources you already have before drilling to open more wells. Nuclear power? Oppose that too, even though U.S. reactor designs are far safer than the propaganda machine make them out to be.Who says they are safe? Even in Germany where we have one of the strictest standards in the world, where you can say that the reactors are safe, there almost happened a GAU some years ago. The reactor in Tchernobyl was also supposed to be \"far safer than the propaganda machine make them out to be\". That much for topic Nuclear Power. No. \"The exact same place\" would be if the volunteers went right to the divisions, companies, etc directly, without having met anyone trying to talk them into it. And I met and watched recruiters when I've been in the States - I know they are telling even worse lies than door-to-door insurance sellers.

He found his way there though there was NO single recruiter in Germany. He had to go to France to attend them, and even there he met no recruiter, because there was none. And still he had to wait in a long line of volunteers when he arrived at his goal. Why? Because all these volunteers were interested enough to find the Legion. Oh, and for the second time, the \"Recruiting Office\" is the exact same place as your \"Legion\" office.

They even overreacted on this attack! The attack on Pearl Harbor being an attack on the entire United States of America? countries US troops went into? Have these countries attacked the USA that they had to defend themselves? So why do the USA need such a big military machine? For nothing but invading other countries and beginning wars, to keep the profits of the military industry rising, ... and has always maintained a military to do that. Right. Do you want to know the real \"Axis of Evil\"? See the producers of weapons, ammo and armory, and their lobbyists in politics and media - fight the MIC, and you get the true terrorists! No State, city, county or township has the right to prevent US military recruiters from accepting new members in recruiting offices located on property that is owned or leased by the US government. In this same vein, if any State institution accepts Federal money, their refusal to allow military recruiters on that State institution's premises (at reasonable times) to give prospective members information about the military, should be cause to re-examine the grant of federal money to that institution.So when I understand you right, the military has the right to order mayors, congress men, governors etc who were elected by the people around with no urgent need? To even black-mail public, civil institutions to either let them in, or already granted Federal money will be refused?

Now, if you're buying a cup of yoghurt for example: from producing the cups to printing, filling and closing them, these cups and their contents are carried three times across entire Europe until they reach the shops. Is this good for the environment? But it is EU standard. Or why does Germany have to import meat whilst being told to close the own animal farms down? Most of the diaries, animal farms and acres in Germany have been closed down because the EU commission said so! This would not be possible if the EU were disestablished, the borders closed, and import/export meant paying fees again. I think all food (except fruits and vegetable that can't be grown there) should be produced or grown in the areas where it is sold. THIS would be good for the environment. And what about those exaggerated EU standards which even include the size, weight, roundness of \"acceptable\" fruits and vegetables? Hundreds of naturally grown sorts do not meet those crappy standards set up by these wannabe-experts in Brussels, and cannot be sold - despite having much more vitamins than those from the green-house that meet those standards. Hell, even the strict DIN/ASA standards used for industrial products throughout Europe look like being no standard at all, compared to the standards set by the EU know-it-alls. Or look at that commuting of workers throughout europe: A lot of people come to work here - okay, why not (though it would be better if we hadn't so many unemployed people ourselves).

He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the LORD. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand: one belonging to him, and the other to the LORD. When the last scene of his life flashed before him he looked back, at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times of his life. This really bothered him and he questioned the LORD about it: \"LORD, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me.\" The LORD replied: \"My son, My precious child, I love you and I would never leave you, During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.\" Author unknown | 499) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Mar 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: The more I read this thread the more I am depressed.

But I go even further in my point of view. Not only that I think that the EC has a too huge impact on the national legal, political and economical systems of the EU countries, I think even the introduction of the Euro as a common currency came way too early, like putting the cart before the horse. In my opinion, the countries better should have been given the possibility to reach a similar economic level before even thinking about such a thing as founding the EU (even though it had developed out of the ECSC which I think already was a mistake in itself). I think the Euro and the EC should be disestablished asap, giving the current members their sovereignty and their own currencies back - with the option to re-establish the EU, IF all citizens of all European countries express their wish to be united that way with a referendum. What advantage has come since the EU for the average person anyway? None. Quite the opposite. Even the introduction of the Euro had a huge disadvantage: when the Euro became official currency, it meant an almost 100% inflation (at least in Germany), because all prizes had the same digits like in DM but in Euro instead (with \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac 1 = DM 1,9588, so that a thing that did cost 1 DM the day before did cost 1 Euro then), while all wages and social welfare incomes had been cut in half according to that exchange rate. | 504) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I'm just a little fruit bat and no one notices me :( Who said that? :D Not me. ;) I always try to notice this little tiny fruitbat named Monday :D | 505) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 13 Mar 2008 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I use Firefox, and sometimes Opera.

That's not strange to me - since Afghanistan never attacked the USA. and to invade a country without being attacked by it in the first hand is, strictly spoken, criminally starting a war. Quite wrong, were the allies that fought against Iraq after Iraq invaded Kuwait acting criminally, or had their war been sanctioned by the U.N.? Was Briatin acting criminally when it declared war on Germany following Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939? Even so, the Afghan leadership (Taliban) actively supported those that conspired (Al Queada) to attack New York and Washington in 2001, and as such were held to be allies. The USA was attacked first by groups operating at liberty within the borders of Afghanistan and the UN saw it that way too. Or do you believe one of the many other conspiracy theories of 9/11? You really think that all of them are just conspiracy theories? Why? Because those in power who are afraid that people begin to think for themselves tell you so?

It has 144 registered users (and yes I know, that's tiny.) Ten to twelve of them post quite regularly - between daily and weekly, some several posts a day, some just a few remarks and that's it for a while. But each day, each hour there are 4 to ten guests for each logged-in user. That board is read by more people than just by its posters. Sometimes the others are already registered users who only log in when they want to write something, sometimes (mostly) it's guests who are not yet registered. What do you think happens when it comes to ask for donations? The users will donate - those who can, and I'm sure even the readers will do, since there is (mostly) peace on this board. The realize that there is (sometimes harsh) discussion there, but it's obvious (for everyone) that there is almost no bickering and fighting, at least not more than usually among friends... I sure think that even only a part of the registered users are actually posting, the board have much more influence to how the entire project is seen than the statistics can tell. See the disaster on Predictor@home: What happened on that board had influenced many opinions throughout the entire BOINC universe, the news were spread by all people: users and readers. I bet the admins of that project have a lot more difficulties to gather donations than you actually have here. That's why I'm convinced that each effort to gain a more peaceful SETI@home board (not peaceful like a cemetery, but peaceful like being among friends) - even though only 5 to 10 % of the SETI@home crunchers are actually posting - really will influence the minds of the crunchers whether they (further) donate or not (if they are able to), or if they start to donate at all. | 533) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 688661](forum_thread.php?id=43716&postid=688661)) Posted 4 Dec 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Winning, with a beautiful song in [Freiheit](http://www.youtube.com/?v=Wrnv4FneVUM) \"Freiheit\" (\"Freedom\") \"Freiheit\" is a song that encourages rebelling against suppression and conformity.

That's funny, because the \"capitalists\" seem to get along just fine without you. I haven't seen Roger Smith begging the UAW for a job recently... If the whole system collapsed tomorrow, no electricity, no machines, no nothing. Working people would, after the initial shock, simply fall back on the old system of cooperation and barter in exchange for goods and services. Not I. I, and everyone that thinks as I do would create money to make it easier to trade for what you needed. I don't want to make candles and slaughter animals and build LCD screens and CPUs and the power supplies to run them. I want to use money, that I earned from my labor, to pay others to do all that crap for me. And I will. Under that system, there was no allowance for greed or sloth. If you didn't produce, you died. Seems that the UAW is happily dying right now, in fact, they're hastening the end. Must be their sloth, because they have all the labor they need, and that's all they need, right? Labor. I wonder what they're waiting for? All the money in the world won't help if money was only useful as firestarter. Except that it won't be useful only as firestarter. It will be useful to buy the things you need that you cannot produce yourself. I, and everyone else who thinks like me will make sure of it.

Dear Eric, Have your 2, 3 Uber-bullies told you who is to be considered as one of the evil ones and who is to be banned? Do you really think these 2, 3 can be trusted more than those who have been moderated/demodded/banned because they spoke up against them?? When so many on the boards complain, this can't be just excused by \"hidden agenda\". Of course: when bullies are called bullies, they will - instead of admitting it - rather claim to have been annoyed, antagonized or insulted and want to get rid of the accuser by all costs, as can be seen here daily.

Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could not have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. This is so logical, no matter who spoke it first. The capital is produced by labor (since it's not the dollar bills that operate the machines but the workers). If there is no labor, there will be no capital. Let the labor stop - in the entire country, for a couple days or a week (called a General Strike) - do you think those who own the capital will still get the same win? On the other side: workers even work if you just promise them to pay for their work. Labor - meaning the workers - just produce the capital which is then partly used for investing in more labor (or in paying for the work already done) which produces more capital etc (like a coil). Labor can exist without capital, but capital only exists by labor. Hence it's the labor which is the superior, not the capital - that's also why I respect the working class much more than the CEOs and other rich parasites who do nothing but letting \"their money\" work for them. | belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: You don't make it easy to reply: expecting something about free speech while applying a kind of a muzzle. Ok: my expectation about free speech are like what I'm used to at some of the German boards I am reading: Even though they can be (and are) read by teenagers, swearwords are kind of tolerated (as long as they are used rarely for example for dramatic purpose etc, {belongs to the context} and don't mutate into a \"written Tourette\" or into a swear contest - and they stay there as long as no-one finds them objectionable); and criticism is tolerated too, as long as it's constructive - though I must admit that the border between criticism and flame might be flowing. Anyway . There's much common sense needed. I want you to compare the Rules of one of the German boards I'm posting on to the rules of this one (I just post the translation here instead of the original German text to make it easier for you), then you might see what I mean: * Absolutely forbidden are contents which are hate-related, which glorify violence or which are pornographic. * No \"Flames\"! Flames are posts with insulting content or personal attacks. Please use generally a moderate language that is not displeasing to other users. * Most users know you only from reading your posts/mails. Please write your posts/mails/PM easy-to-understand, and watch quality, style and orthography. Sometimes less can be more. * Don't abuse the board for advertisement or chain-letters! * Watch the Copyright! Short quotations are basically legal when the source or auther is named in the post. * [...] Please treat the posts/topics with the respect they deserve. Rather think twice what you post. You see, there's not so much difference. Most of it (both here as well as there) is just common sense, written down as Rules. | 552) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 686375](forum_thread.php?id=43716&postid=686375)) Posted 29 |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 686307](forum_thread.php?id=43716&postid=686307)) Posted 29 Nov 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while successfully ignoring the weather - because it happens to be rather outside than inside :D | 554) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 686303](forum_thread.php?id=43716&postid=686303)) Posted 29 Nov 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while successfully ignoring the weather - because it happens to be rather outside than inside :D | 555) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 686223](forum_thread.php?id=43716&postid=686223)) Posted 29 Nov 2007 by [thorin Post: Taking back the lead.

The purpose of SETI@home is not to have forums, and every minute I spend dealing with them is a minute diverted away from the science. I'm not ready to abandon them yet, but every time someone raises a stink because they didn't like where the lines were drawn I get closer to that point. They are right. It's a science project. If there are forums at all, they should be very restrictive in posting scope. A combined Staff Blog/Technical READ-ONLY forum for communication from the project to the participants that's too wordy to put on the front page. A very SETI@Home-specific science forum. the current one is overrun with non-SETU@Home threads. A Client Operations forum - reporting scienceclient operation problems. Send BOINC problems to the BOINC forums. EVERYTHING ELSE is worthless gibber-jabber. No. It's SOCIAL networking. Sure worthless gibber-jabber for some autistic, egocentric people, but at least as important as the science itself for people like me who like to find friends or at least like to communicate with people who have a kind of similar interests... To me, even when a project (no matter if in real life or virtual) is very interesting and challenging - if I can't use it to meet friends, to meet people who also are interested in it, to share my thoughts about and around it with others - I soon lose the interest in this project. If I am forced to work on it alone without social networking, I feel like simmering in my own sauce, like doing nothing, like wasting time. I'm not such an autistic MENSA member who enjoy just their own company, just they themselves and their computers - I use this and other projects, as well as other boards,and places in the real life to actually meet people with similar interests in the first place. Finding friends is worthless? Talking to people with similar interests just gibber-jabber? Sorry, pal - not for me. I see you belong to a team. Isn't your (excellent) team site the place to meet and converse with your (virtual) friends? I crunch as part of a team, that's true - but I belong to myself. I don't care what teams my friends are part of, and I don't like that concurrence thinking many teams obviously do show.

The market already HAS \"all the power,\" because nothing else produces goods and services--the gov't sure doesn't, and your precious UAW certainly can't even produce car one. And, as usual, you've just repeated a bromide you find pleasing. Corporations don't have power because they can't force you to do anything, ever. The only entity that can do that is the gov't. Something you keep begging to take over things: therefore, giving it greater power and taking it away from those who can afford it the least. you are right: the market has power - because the gov't gave it to them. It's (unfortunately) not the government but the corporations who dictate prices. It's not the gov't but the corporations who dictate where to close down or open up plants. It's the corporations and not the gov't who dictate who/what shall be supported or not, where shall be a financial cut and where not. It's even the corporations and not the government who dictate whether or not a specific weapon system is built or whether or not a certain science program is supported. The government has allowed to be the puppet on the strings of the corporation - it's time for it to become independent, to show the corporations who really should rule: people who are chosen and supported by The People (and not by the corporations). Let the government be the master over the market, as it should be - then chances are good that all life gets better. | 567) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [which US Presidential candidate would best serve space exploration?](forum_thread.php?id=43586) ( [Message 685733](forum_thread.php?id=43586&postid=685733)) Posted 28 Nov 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: No, they abhor strong gov'ts because the dislike the cronyism, War in Iraq, the CIA, the DoD, corporate welfare, the NHS, HMS Invincible, and et cetera. They dislike paying for massive weapons systems or paying for school for children that they don't have. Let me just get you to repeat this. I'm sorry, my mistake. I should have been more clear. I stated the above quote in response to your comment, \"A strong central government is unacceptable to these people (and their followers) as it represents the will of the people over the wants of the wealthy.\" More specifically, I was referring to small gov't types in general, not whatever you mean by \"corporatists and republicans.\" I didn't reply correctly. Cronyism...both entities thrive because of this War in Iraq...both entities started this CIA...both make inmmense use of this DoD...both enrich themselves through this Corporate welfare...see DoD response NHS...one entity makes billions by the lack of healthcare and the other is a collection of selfish *#@^#! with no regard for those who cannot afford it. Massive Weapons Systems...see DoD response Paying for Schooling...More selfish *#@^#! None of this is relevant to the point as I corrected it. The examples were reasons that small gov't types abhor big gov't. They dislike paying for these things by force. Well, I'm convinced. Only a pure Bushtard could pull something like that out of their *ss to prove their point. Good night Barney. I simply have to ask. Do you think this crap helps your position? I mean, do you actually believe that your vague hand-waving and impotent and erroneous comments about me actually serve to convince your readers of a position that has nothing to do with me? Furthermore, if you are seeking to convince those that actively disagree with you, not just those at the margin, do you think they are likely to come around to your point of view with this stuff? I mean, calling someone who would shut down 95% of the gov't a \"Bushtard\" suggests either utter incompetence, or a complete lack of reasoning skills. I mean, you can't even seem to be able to read, let alone form an argument--you seem to have missed the entire point of the post. Why would anyone in their right mind listen to you?

The purpose of SETI@home is not to have forums, and every minute I spend dealing with them is a minute diverted away from the science. I'm not ready to abandon them yet, but every time someone raises a stink because they didn't like where the lines were drawn I get closer to that point. They are right. It's a science project. If there are forums at all, they should be very restrictive in posting scope. A combined Staff Blog/Technical READ-ONLY forum for communication from the project to the participants that's too wordy to put on the front page. A very SETI@Home-specific science forum. the current one is overrun with non-SETU@Home threads. A Client Operations forum - reporting scienceclient operation problems. Send BOINC problems to the BOINC forums. EVERYTHING ELSE is worthless gibber-jabber. No. It's SOCIAL networking. Sure worthless gibber-jabber for some autistic, egocentric people, but at least as important as the science itself for people like me who like to find friends or at least like to communicate with people who have a kind of similar interests... To me, even when a project (no matter if in real life or virtual) is very interesting and challenging - if I can't use it to meet friends, to meet people who also are interested in it, to share my thoughts about and around it with others - I soon lose the interest in this project. If I am forced to work on it alone without social networking, I feel like simmering in my own sauce, like doing nothing, like wasting time. I'm not such an autistic MENSA member who enjoy just their own company, just they themselves and their computers - I use this and other projects, as well as other boards,and places in the real life to actually meet people with similar interests in the first place. Finding friends is worthless? Talking to people with similar interests just gibber-jabber?

Jeffrey, this sort of thing rarely happens in America. In fact, in my home state I believe nobody has ever been convicted of killing an intruder in their own home....ever. A few have been charged, but none convicted. The attitude of the courts and police in Aus/N.Z seems to be one of \"Hmmm I wonder what this family/shopkeep did to provoke this attack. Sure his children were sexually assaulted but there must have been a better 'non-violent' solution\". It's thoroughly disgusting. I don't miss that about those countries. England is no better. From my former home town, and from the town where my dad was born I personally know two cases that were treated totally in opposition to each other but were victims of same crime: burglary. Both cases are friends of mine, persons who taught me self-defense & Martial Arts skills. Case 1: One has been attacked by a burglar with a knife, and defending himself he knocked that burglar out without getting injured himself - but then, while the burglar was convicted for burglary, his victim was convicted of aggravated battery and tried murder because he (who defended his own life & house) was an active Martial Arts coach and should have warned this burglar first before using his skills on him. Case 2. also burglary, this time a criminal with a handgun, and the house dweller with just a Maglite torch. Here also long story short: the burglar has been surprised by the victim and was knocked out by using the Maglite. Then - after the investigations - the burglar was convicted of burglary, of carrying an illegal weapon, and - despite the victim hasn't been injured - assault & battery. The judge said that the victim had been very lucky and better run and hide next time, calling 110 (the German equivalent of 911) asap... (If the judge & jury only had known/cared about the self-defense skills of that man he gained in his past, also \"Case2\" would have been convicted, just like \"Case 1\" ...) As he told me after the trial, he used the Maglite torch only to make up some \"helpless\" and \"anxious\" image - Actually he could have been more effective without it, even without knocking that criminal out, but then the self-defense paragraphs wouldn't have worked anymore... Hence, everyone who carries a weapon (whether a knife, a firearm - or being the weapon themselves by having Martial Arts skills) should better know the self-defense paragraphs very well, better than their own social security number, that their actions of self-defense always remains within the borders of these paragraphs... ;) | 572) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Closed #{[(52]}](forum_thread.php?id=43716) 27 Nov boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [which best serve space exploration?](forum_thread.php?id=43586) ( [Message 684963](forum_thread.php?id=43586&postid=684963)) Posted 27 Nov Post: extremely right-wing remains extremely right-wing, no matter what face or name is masking it.

I mean, it is OK that we band together to take his private property simply because we are in a union? Because if you can understand why your brother doesn't want our little union to take away a part of his private property and why we have no right to demand that, you can understand why corporations don't want your union to take away a part of their private property and why you don't have the right to demand that. OK...go out and have your gang legally recognized as a labour or trade union with it's own constitution, political structure and by-laws. Then we'll talk. Until that point, this is nonsense. It's not nonsense because you sez so. Here, I'll start it for you, \"this is nonsense because....\" Or here, \"It is OK to take private property from people who aren't my brother because (insert reasoning here), but it is not OK to take private property from my brother because (insert reasoning here).\" You see, both the motorcycle and the shares of stock are private property. If you believe that one or the other are not private property, then you must present that argument, \"A (motorcycle or stock shares) are not private property because....\" You seem to think it is OK to take some private property as long as you agree with it, but then also seem to think that it isn't OK to take other private property when you don't agree with it. That's inconsistent and hypocritical and deeply undermines your position. That some organization happens to create a self-serving constitution, political structure, and by-laws does not make taking private property any more right. That's rubbish. While owning a bike is property of private goods - like a bicycle, a coat, a game... Things actually used by the person who possesses them. Owning shares of stock is property of some sheet of paper that tells you that you own a part of production means. You don't use these sheets (except when selling/buying them), you don't (normally) use these production means - and the gambling with them on the Stock Exchange does not only affect a few persons person but can affect thousands. Imho all enterprises with more than a handful employees never should be owned by a few people or by banks. Simply because the workers are not treated as humans anymore but just as items on the cost list. Put all bigger enterprises in common property, let the community/ State/ country/ government possess all stocks (or at least most) of all shares that are not given to the employees of that particular company - then maybe there will be more justice. But anyway: this stock gambling must be stopped immediately, because it has brought too much misery and poverty to the people. | 584) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Hilary Clinton ~ possible first female president of the US](forum_thread.php?id=42952) ( [Message 684756](forum_thread.php?id=42952&postid=684756)) Posted 26 Nov 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I thought I'd have a go at that 'Candidate Calculator' thingy....Being Australian, and having no idea about US internal poltics or politicians, I was suprised because I've actually heard a little about this bloke: Your Top Match Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) 64.52% match Not a real high highest match is it ? ... guess maybe I don't have all that much in common with US politicians :D Jason [Your Other Top Matches New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson (D) - 64.52% (Never heard of him, was he one of the 4400?)

The experiment to crunch with both systems at the same time was successful in the first place, that's why I want to do everything right before I mess things up.

The case will probably be argued in the spring. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down sections of the Washington gun law that make it exceedingly difficult to legally own a handgun, that prohibit carrying guns without a license even from one room to another, and that require lawfully owned firearms to be kept unloaded. The Second Amendment, surely one of the most disputed passages in the United States Constitution and one whose punctuation is not always rendered consistently, states this in its entirety: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The Supreme Court has never directly addressed the basic meaning of that passage. When it last considered a Second Amendment case, in 1939, it addressed a somewhat peripheral question, holding that a sawed-off shotgun was not one of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"arms\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 that the Founding Fathers had in mind. Today\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s announcement that the justices would take the District of Columbia case was no surprise, given that the District of Columbia Circuit\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s interpretation of the Second Amendment conflicts with the interpretation of nine other federal appeals courts, and differences between the circuits often steer issues to the high court. But the argument, and the outcome, will be among the most eagerly awaited in years, with the stakes potentially very high for lawmakers and gun enthusiasts alike. Whichever way the justices rule, gun control is likely to remain a hot political issue, in the 2008 campaigns and beyond. The mayor of Washington, Adrian M. Fenty, whose city was sometimes called the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"murder capital\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 of the country at the height of the crack epidemic and the accompanying bloodshed, vowed earlier this year to seek reinstatement of the city\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s gun law. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We have made the determination that this law can and should be defended, and we are willing to take our case to the highest court in the land,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said. The willingness, indeed eagerness, to have the case heard by the Supreme Court is one thing the opponents of the District of Columbia\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s gun law agree with. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The Bill of Rights does not end at the District of Columbia\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s borders, and it includes the right to keep and bear arms,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Alan Gura, lead counsel for those challenging the law. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"After three decades of failure trying to control firearms in the District, it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s time for law-abiding city residents to be able to defend themselves in their homes,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Mr. Gura said in a statement. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We are confident the Supreme Court will vindicate that right in Washington, D.C., and across the nation.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The plaintiffs complain that the 31-year-old Washington, D.C., law \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac which virtually bans handguns and requires that all shotguns and rifles be kept unloaded and either trigger-locked or disassembled at all times \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac makes no exception for legitimate self-defense considerations. Given the fact that the District law affects shoulder weapons as well as pistols and revolvers, there would appear to be a wide range of findings for the justices to consider. The case accepted today is \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"not about machine guns or so-called assault weapons or concealed carry,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Robert A. Levy, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a prominent libertarian research organization, said in a statement today. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s about the right to possess ordinary, garden-variety handguns in the home for self-defense.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The title of the case is Heller v. District of Columbia, after Dick Heller, a District of Columbia resident who works as an armed security guard and is one of six plaintiffs recruited by Mr. Levy. None of the plaintiffs has asserted a right to carry their weapons outside their homes. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I want to be able to defend myself and my wife from violent criminals, and the Constitution says I have a right to do that by keeping a gun in my home,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Mr. Heller said in a statement. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The police can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t be everywhere, and they can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t protect everyone all the time. Responsible gun ownership is a basic right we have as American citizens.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said during his Senate confirmation hearing that the 1939 Second Amendment decision left \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"very open\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 the question of whether the Second Amendment protected an individual or a collective right to bear arms. The current lineup of justices is considered relatively conservative, which might give hope to opponents of gun control. But lawyers and other court-watchers who try to predict outcomes in advance do so at their peril. | 622) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person to Post Wins #{[(51]} or higher - How be Eeeh', me deer?

By law, the workday would be cut to six hours. Street vendors, homemakers and maids would have state-mandated pensions. And President Hugo Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez would have significantly enhanced powers and be eligible for re-election for the rest of his life. A sweeping revision of the Constitution, expected to be approved by referendum on Dec. 2, is both bolstering Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s popularity here among people who would benefit and stirring contempt from economists who declare it demagogy. Signaling new instability here, dissent is also emerging among his former lieutenants, one of whom says the president is carrying out a populist coup. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"There is a perverse subversion of our existing Constitution under way,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Gen. Ra\u00c3\u00c2\u00bal Isa\u00c3\u00c2as Baduel, a retired defense minister and former confidant of Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez who broke with him in a stunning defection this month to the political opposition. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"This is not a reform,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 General Baduel said in an interview here this week. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I categorize it as a coup d\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9tat.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez loyalists already control the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, almost every state government, the entire federal bureaucracy and newly nationalized companies in the telephone, electricity and oil industries. Soon they could control even more. But this is an upheaval that would be carried out with the approval of the voters. While opinion polls in Venezuela are often tainted by partisanship, they suggest that the referendum could be Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s closest electoral test since his presidency began in 1999, but one he may well win. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We are witnessing a seizure and redirection of power through legitimate means,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Alberto Barrera Tyszka, co-author of a best-selling biography of Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"This is not a dictatorship but something more complex: the tyranny of popularity.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 One of the 69 amendments allows Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez to create new administrative regions, governed by vice presidents chosen by him. Critics say the reforms would also shift funds from states and cities, where a handful of elected officials still oppose him, to communal councils, new local governing entities that are predominantly pro-Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez. Interviews this week on the streets here and in Maracaibo, Venezuela\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s second largest city, offer a window into the strength of Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s followers and the challenges of his critics. His supporters, many of whom are public servants in a bureaucracy that has recently ballooned, have flooded poor districts to campaign for the overhaul. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The comandante should have more power because he is the force behind our revolution,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Egda Vilchez, 51, a pro-Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez activist, as she campaigned in favor of the new charter this week at a busy intersection in Cacique Mara, an area of slums in eastern Maracaibo. Such statements may sound dogmatic, but they are voiced with a fervor in organized campaigning that is unmatched in richer areas of Venezuela\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s largest cities, from which much of the opposition to Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez is drawn. Aside from a nascent student movement, which has held protests of increasing defiance in recent weeks, the middle and upper classes seem largely resigned about the outcome of a referendum that is less about specific issues than Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s resilient support among the poor. In comments after a summit of Latin American leaders this month in Chile, Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez laid out his project in simple language. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Capitalist Venezuela is entering its grave,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"and socialist Venezuela is being born.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Indeed, socialist imagery is pervasive throughout this country, from the red shirts worn by Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez and his followers to the chant of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Fatherland, socialism or death!\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 repeated at the end of his rallies. But walking into a grocery store here offers a different view of the changes washing over Venezuela. Combined with price controls that keep farmers from profitably producing some basic foods, climbing incomes of the poorest Venezuelans have stripped supermarket aisles bare of items like milk and eggs. Meanwhile, foreign exchange controls create bottlenecks for importers seeking to meet rising demand for many products. Such imbalances plague oil economies elsewhere, with oil revenues often making it cheaper to import goods than produce them at home. But the system Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez is creating is perhaps unique: a hybrid of state-supported enterprises and no-holds-barred capitalism in which 500,000 automobiles are expected to be sold this year. Lacking here, for instance, is the authoritarianism one might expect in a country where billboards promoting Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez have proliferated in the last year. Looming above the Centro San Ignacio, a high-end shopping mall here, is one of the president hugging a child while he explains the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"motors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 of his revolution. Others show him kissing old women, decorating graduates of the military university and embracing an ally, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. Beneath these images, a lack of order persists at the street level, reflecting a state flush with oil money but weak when facing systemic problems like violent crime. The country had 9,568 homicides in the first nine months of this year, a 9 percent increase from the same period last year. Private companies here, meanwhile, are in the awkward position of profiting from a growing economy even as many are dreading what is to come, their fears illustrated by the accelerating capital flight that has caused the currency, the bol\u00c3\u00c2var, to plunge in value against the dollar since Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez proposed the constitutional overhaul in August. Sparse details as to how Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s government would carry out measures like a six-hour workday or finance a new social security system have done little for economic confidence, with Fedec\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1maras, the country\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s main business association, urging voters to oppose the new charter \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"by all legal means.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The proposals have also revealed sharp divisions among the president\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s own supporters, symbolized by the sharp criticism from General Baduel, who had helped reinstall Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez in power after a brief coup in 2002. Marisabel Rodr\u00c3\u00c2guez, the president\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s ex-wife and former first lady, came out against the new charter this week, saying it would lead to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"absolute concentration of power.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 And previously pro-Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez governors like Ram\u00c3\u00c2\u00b3n Mart\u00c3\u00c2nez of Sucre State, sensing their power could be curtailed, have begun criticizing the measures. Under the project, term limits would be abolished only for the president, not for governors or mayors. Another item raises the threshold for collecting signatures to hold a vote to recall the president, effectively shielding him from one option voters have to challenge his power under the existing Constitution of 1999. Other measures in the project are considered progressive by both critics of Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez and his political base, which includes leftist military officials, academics, civil servants and a large portion of the urban and rural poor. The voting age in this demographically young country, for instance, would be lowered to 16 from 18. Discrimination based on sexual orientation would also be prohibited. Many of the items are vaguely worded, however, like one giving the president the power to create \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"communal cities.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Clearly there are positive aspects to the reform, but the government has committed a political error by trying to rush it to voters without enough discussion,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Edgardo Lander, a sociologist at the Central University of Venezuela who is generally sympathetic to Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The opposition can argue this is illegitimate if it is approved by a low margin.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez, 53, who recently hinted at staying in power until 2031, might also be preparing for resistance here if oil revenues prove insufficient to finance his ambitions. One of the reforms allows him to declare states of emergency during which he can censor television stations and newspapers. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez wants to liquidate challenges to his rule to enable him to govern Venezuela for the rest of his life,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Manuel Rosales, governor of Zulia State and the main challenger to Mr. Ch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1vez in presidential elections last year, said in an interview at his office in Maracaibo. | 629) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person to Post Wins #{[(51]} or higher - How be Eeeh', me deer?

Paramount Television Group is currently producing a \"Dr. Laura\" television show. Recently she has become a convert to Judaism and has made some statements about homosexuals that have caused the Canadian anti-hate laws to censure her. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a US resident, which was posted on the Internet.... ENJOY. Dear Dr. Laura, Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them. a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offence. d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself? f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an Abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this? g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die? i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? j) My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them (Lev.24:10-16)? Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws (Lev. 20:14)? I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging. Your devoted disciple and adoring fan. | 631) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person to Post Wins #{[(51]} or higher - How be Eeeh', me deer?

For every journey, security officials will want credit card details, holiday contact numbers, travel plans, email addresses, car numbers and even any previous missed flights. The information, taken when a ticket is bought, will be shared among police, customs, immigration and the security services for at least 24 hours before a journey is due to take place. Anybody about whom the authorities are dubious can be turned away when they arrive at the airport or station with their baggage. Those with outstanding court fines, such as a speeding penalty, could also be barred from leaving the country, even if they pose no security risk. The information is equired under the \"e-borders\" system to be introduced, beginning in earnest from mid-2009. By 2014 every one of the predicted 305million passenger journeys in and out of the UK will be logged, with details stored about the passenger on every trip. The scheme will apply to every way of leaving the country, whether by ferry, plane, or small aircraft. It would apply to a family having a day out in France by Eurotunnel, and even to a yachtsman leaving British waters during the day and returning to shore. The measure applies equally to UK residents going abroad and foreigners travelling here. A pilot of the \"e-borders\" technology, known as Project Semaphore, has already screened 29million passengers. Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said: \"Successful trials of the new system have already led to more than 1,000 criminals being caught and more than 15,000 people of concern being checked out by immigration, customs or the police.\" Comments anyone? They learned a lot from the East German Stasi! That's awful. Security concerns are one thing, but this is spying on mostly innocent people, to find a few to have an excuse for this measure.

Surprise surprise. And as usual, you missed the point entirely. I didn't say corporations were on the side of angels. I said that after they have said no, they only sign contracts with unions after coercion. Here, I'll quote it for you. \"Companies do not want such contracts because they drive costs up, and often only sign them because of the underlying threat. That's coercion. If the company says, 'No Union,' what part of No Union do you guys not understand? If they've said that, then the only way they are going to sign such a contract is if the union forces them into it. How do they force a company to sign? Could that be 'damage, assault and battery against employees, preventing the delivery of raw materials, work slowdowns, blocking the gates, et cetera?'\" That you really really really really really really really really really want them to sign is of no interest to them. So they don't do it unless they are forced. That they fight back using the same tactics as unions do is no surprise at all. What interest can an employer have to fear unions (who by the way are for improving the working conditions of the employees)? Why do companies claim to \"have not enough money\" to give their employers even a 1% raise whilst they shovel the monthly million Dollar wins into the pockets of the CEOs and share-holders? Why do companies have to spy on their employers (like for example Wal-Mart does), have to thread or intimidate them, have to gag them, have to make their customers fear unions? If the unions did that (like YOU claim they do), they actually would begin to fight the war on the REAL terror, started by employers who engaged Pinkerton and such Mafia-like agencies!! [That](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_spies#Frameups)'s the strategy of these bully employers, not of unions: In 1980, union buster Martin Jay Levitt conducted a counter-organizing drive at a nursing home in Sebring, Ohio. He sought to portray the union as dangerous, and the nursing home's residents as potential victims of violence. Before the campaign was concluded, residents \u00e2\u20ac\" who for years had depended upon intimate contact with nurse's aids and other care-givers \u00e2\u20ac\" were led to fear being alone with any of these mostly pro-union employees. Residents became so frightened that they began locking their doors at night, and their fears propelled an anti-union backlash. The climate of fear was entirely manufactured for the sole purpose of destroying the union organizing drive. In his book Confessions of a Union Buster Levitt wrote, \"I dispatched a contingent of commandos to scratch up the cars of high-profile pro-company workers and to make threatening phone calls to others.\" The union buster took advantage of his confederates' actions by having the nursing home's executive director write a letter to employees \"taking the union to task for such barbarous scare tactics.\" This frameup was one part of an ugly psychological campaign which lasted a year and a half. Bright lights installed in the parking lot were publicized as necessary \"due to the increasing hostility of the union.\" Employees were barraged with propaganda about taking alternate routes to work. The nursing home bought an old school bus, and the company's new bus service was announced as a protective measure for loyal employees during any possible strike. Letters were sent to employees about each new security measure. Such repetitive actions reinforced the climate of fear, all of which had initially been conjured as part of a frameup \u00e2\u20ac\" through criminal mischief perpetrated by the union buster You really believe the crap the media, influenced by those bullies, the big business chiefs, want you to believe, don't you? Try to get some independent point of view! I really recommend these two books to you: * Levitt, Martin Jay. 1993. Confessions of a Union Buster. * Smith, Robert Michael. 2003.

[...] Union busting is a field populated by bullies and built on deceit. A campaign against a union is an assault on individuals and a war on truth. As such, it is a war without honor.

Indeed, fundamentalist Christians are told to stay far away from psychics and other such people. If you call it logical, then back up your statements.

Please see my post in KM's MLC thread, where I provided a link. Well, actually you both are right :) Christians believe in prophets (like in the Old Testament - it's full of them). Prophets can see and reveal things not seen by other humans, even look into the future, hence they are a kind of psychics. But: Christians are told to stay far away of psychics who aren't known to do that by Divine Power, by the Holy Spirit. They are told to avoid False Prophets, witches, magi.

You don't have to exploit people to become rich. Even if I sold a million copies of a self-produced CD to a price of $0.05 more than the price of blank CDs (which could be afforded by everyone), giving me a win of $0.05 per item (which is little), I'd make 50K bucks without exploiting anyone. But I would get big trouble by the big media industry and their influence to the gov't. They want to cut costs? Why don't they begin in the top levels, like CEOs or something? Because you could divide the entire salary and benefit package of the highest paid 1000 people at a place like GM and everyone else would get a couple of hundred bucks in one paycheck, once. Of course, that wouldn't solve even one problem, wouldn't make the company more competitive, wouldn't pay down debt or change market conditions, or anything else. It would, however, destroy the company. So, for in exchange for a one-time payment of a few hundred bucks, the people who got paid that get to lose their jobs. Few if any of them are going to make that trade. Sure it IS possible to create poverty, actually those who create wealth for a few at the costs of others do make those others poor. Man, then Oprah and Michael Moore must be REALLY REALLY REALLY skrewing people hard. I mean, they make millions more than most CEOs. They must be creating poverty left and right, taking their money right out of the mouths of the poor. So you think wealth is created out of nothing? Money makes more money in this capitalistic society. You have to be rich to become richer, else the risk of investing anywhere is just too high. Do you really believe the people in Africa and North Korea have chosen to starve? Well, you and Waite seem to think that wealth is created out of whole cloth. Yet they aren't doing it. Those out of work UAW workers aren't doing it either. If I were them, I would just choose to create wealth so I could spend it. I mean, it's just that easy, right? Oh so you're bringing up some well-paid media persons as example for rich people? Why are you refusing to mention real exploiters like Bill Gates, like the Waltons, like Dassler, Albrecht, Buffet, Cox, Abramovich, etc.? Do you really believe the majority of Indians chose to live of less than a Dollar per day while some few there don't know which place they shall put their millions? I think that some people are capable of earning substantially more than others. And that those others will not support them out of hand. Michael Moore for example. Oprah. Babs Streisand. These are exceedingly rich people that will not do as you would have them do. Since when is Mexico a socialist country? Only because they try to be more social than the States, the economic system is the same: capitalism. Do you really think Mexican people leave their families and maybe even their tiny fields heading for the States just for the adventure of it? They have no choice! It's either leaving the family and go where jobs are offered and work there (even illegally) or watch their beloved ones starve while starving themselves. I think these people seek to make better lives for themselves and it is so miserable where they live that they are smart to leave and try to make a better life for themselves. More power to them. Now, if Oprah and Moore would just quit skrewing them so badly, maybe they'd have a chance. Capitalism, the system you are so adoring, made them poor enough to take such desperate measures. This is one of the most stupid things I've ever seen you say. \"Capitalism,\" as you use it there, is the system they are coming to, to find jobs to make their lives better. They are leaving the insanely socialistic Mexico because the socialistic system there destroys wealth. You should be thrilled with that place. All the laws and rules and gov't meddling you could ever want. [snip] Do you really think that people take up temp jobs or other jobs with substandard wages because they agree with them? They take them because THEY DO HAVE NO CHOICE! I know enough engineers and people with master degrees - even with excellent certificates - who work in temp companies or as burger-flippers or as waiters, just to have a job, just to not live on welfare, because THERE IS no job according to their qualifications here for them. Then provide it for them Thorin. If you think someone has a right to a job at someone else's expense, then you should be providing it for them. If you think that because someone has some degree that they have a right to a job, what happens when others who disagree with you will not provide those jobs? I mean, you won't, so why should they? Because you think they should? Don't hold your breath, they don't care what you think. Oh, so the jobs are at the employers expense? Hell, it's not the worker exploiting the employer, it's the employer exploiting the worker! It's those who refuse to pay the worker what their work is actually WORTH who are responsible that workers have to sacrifice their spare-time to take up a second or third job. It's like the other broken record you always bring up again: \"The market can't bear higher wages\". That's the silliest excuse I've ever read. \"The market\" can bear millions of CEO salaries, and millions of Dollars as Golden Handshakes when managers move to other companies but not a rise of wages according to the inflation rate?? \"The market\" can bear rising prices for daily needs and declining prices for luxury articles, but can't bear appropriate wages for those who produce these goods? Forget it. | 704) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : law targets illegal 12 Nov 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Oh are you really that blind? The market is not so free as you claim it is. Just ask yourself, who decides which goods are imported? The customers? No. And who made it impossible to those countries to live independently? It was the Western Economy which made them be dependent on exporting only a few goods and then stopped buying just these goods when the countries wanted to put up their own industry (with borrowed money) besides these mono-cultures. It's not the gov'ts of these countries who made their people poor. It's the Global Capitalism. You truly believe this? Try telling this to the countries shackled by IMF policies. No, because if they wanted hard currency loans, they are subject to the rules of those who are willing to lend it to them. If they didn't want to borrow under such restrictions, they should have just created all the wealth they needed and dispensed with the IMF all together. Right? Why didn't they do that? Why didn't they just create this wealth? By selling off all public assets and siphoning the profits out of countries, poverty IS CREATED. I don't need some speel about the impossibility of creating a negative because it is possible to create a vacuum where all wealth is removed by the greed of the controllers of the IMF and World Bank. Well, then maybe the gov'ts in question should have just created wealth instead of borrowing money.

Doesn't it seem strange to everyone that governments are enforcing, with ever increasing hysteria, national borders while at the same time lecturing the working class about the need to eliminate borders when it comes to economics? What purpose is being served by enforcing the borders in the case of human mobility while removing restrictions on the movement of capital? Well, one example would be in the case of places that have socialized medicine, it's to prevent the system from being bankrupted. Most simply because that system isn't free. If one follows this to the obvious conclusion, we find that it appears that the investor class, or capitalists, seem to be creating a situation where humans are trapped in regions of low wage earnings and capital is free to move into that same region to exploit the wage situation. Yay, the \"investor class\" now equals \"capitalists.\" How incisive. And yes, any rational concern is always looking to cut costs, everywhere. On labor, materials, expenses, everything. Giving people who otherwise would not have jobs is part of that process. It helps raise the standard of living for those who need the income, and it raises the standard of living in the original market by lowering costs and bringing more goods and services to a greater number of people. I believe the uproar over illegal immigrants is not the real story, rather, it's a means of gathering support from the masses in containing people inside the low wages regions created by the capitalists. Heh heh. Stronger enforcement of borders is simply a means of reducing mobility from within created zones of impoverishment. I would argue that everyone shouldn't get angry at those trying to escape poverty but focus your attention and anger on those creating it. It's not possible to \"create poverty,\" it's only possible to create wealth. If you think that is so easy, then you should be doing it. The UAW should be doing it and selling cars and really sticking it to GM and BMW. All those poor people in the DPRK should just be creating wealth because jeebusknows they've got more poverty than they could ever hope for. They want to cut costs? Why don't they begin in the top levels, like CEOs or something? Sure it IS possible to create poverty, actually those who create wealth for a few at the costs of others do make those others poor. Do you really believe the people in Africa and North Korea have chosen to starve? Do you really believe the majority of Indians chose to live of less than a Dollar per day while some few there don't know which place they shall put their millions? Do you really think Mexican people leave their families and maybe even their tiny fields heading for the States just for the adventure of it? They have no choice!

OK, what happens when you cannot convince them of either? I mean, you cannot convince me of that, ever, unless you pay the difference yourself. What will you do when they simply ignore you because they couldn't care less what you think? 1) I will never pay anymore than what the market will bear, and if the person in front of me is poor at bargaining, they will make less than they would have.

Thus, minimum wage is the minimum compensation one receives in exchange for their labor. Understand why those on welfare receive less, genius? Sure - but then, people who work should be PAID for their work. That means they have to be paid real wages instead of just the welfare amount for their labor. And even the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac7.50 paid by these temp agencies like Manpower etc here in Germany are too low wages to afford a living. | 796) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [What's Your Post: What is my class?

R/B wrote: This 'moderator' defending how these homosexuals are put into PRISON CAMPS in the paradise island of beloved Stalinist Cuba? To R/B First, I've never been citizen in Cuba and I also have never been there myself at all, though many people who actually have visited Cuba as tourists told me they found it truly lovely there. Quite poor but lovely. Second: Each country, even each \"socialist\" country have their own laws - and I can't know all of them. So do not accuse me for defending decisions of a foreign country's government which I never have done. When mentioning Cuba (until the message where I said that with the refugees) I mentioned - like many here - only the health care system there. Third, if this statement in your question were right and known to me as a true fact I would have discussed here in the Politics forum against this as soon as I learned from it instead of defending it - most people who know me from my posts know that. But it isn't. There are normal prisons and correctional centers in Cuba like in any other country, but the only existing [PRISON CAMP in Cuba](http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Ade%3Aofficial&hs=jcQ&q=prison+camps+cuba&btnG=Suche&meta=) is Guatanamo Bay, and is used by the USA as you should know. And for the rights of Homosexuals in Cuba, you may read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Cuba) for example. As Fuzzy Hollynoodles uses to say: Google is your friend.

For the record, this is the statement I made which got your knickers all crumpled. Notice it is in the form of an interrogative. Nowhere did I accuse Thorin of stating anything against homosexuals did I? But setting up strawmen is perhaps the only way I am seemingly vulnerable to attack as my facts and logic are unassailable. ;-) <------requisite 'Jeffrey winky' What's next, ADMINS? This 'moderator' defending how these homosexuals are put into PRISON CAMPS in the paradise island of beloved Stalinist Cuba? Without evidence? His postings are his own evidence. It's difficult to defend a Stalinist prison state and it's system without defending its practices. He defends imprisoning political dissidents and certain minority groups via his defense of the regime itself. He doesn't have to state anything explicitly against those groups to be fairly accused of defending the way in which they are mistreated. Example: (and before some nitwit thinks I'm accusing Thorin of being a Nazi know that I am not) A person cannot praise the Nazi state left, right, and center and then shriek \"Whoooo! little ole' me!!??\" when someone points out that they are defending the persecution of Jews and others by logical implication. Clear enough for you? Aww c'mon. Of course in hindsight I can say that some topics were good and other topics were wrong or even bad. What's wrong with saying that the politics was wrong and the system everything else than perfect, but they had some good things which even made Western people move there? As for me, I could easily exchange the possibility to visit a few countries in the world (which I can't afford atm anyway) against 0.0x% unemployment rate, against cost-free education, against not having to pay 1/2 to 2/3 of my income for the rent of the apartment (or house) I live in, against not having to pay for a visit at the doctor or dentist and for their treatment, and against paying only a small fee for the entire prescription instead of huge fees for each of the listed drugs on the prescription. But seeing the rest of the politics, the spying and the lies and the censoring (both in the media and in general, and the self-censoring in your own head): IMHO with the reunion, the East Germans jumped from the frying pan into the fire. In East Germany, dissidents were arrested and imprisoned, in West Germany they are called terrorists (or sympathizers of terrorists) and are arrested and imprisoned either. No big difference. Sure they got rid of the Wall, but got unemployment and drugs and poverty in exchange. Before the re-union they could afford to travel but were only allowed to see a certain part of the world - now they are allowed to travel everywhere but can't afford it anymore. FYI, mentioning the Homosexuals: Before you post such lies like detention camps for Homosexuals in East Germany, please google for better information or evidences. In the entire German-speaking area it was forbidden by an old law ( [\u00c3\u00c2\u00a7175 StGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Germany) from 1871 to be exactly, which had only minor changes except during the \"Third Reich\") to perform male homosexuality. You could get arrested (and not sent to camps like under the Nazi regime) for that in East Germany, West Germany, and Austria, though they quit to see it a crime in 1968 in East Germany, in 1969 in West Germany, in 1971 in Austria. | 864) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: And now it's my turn.

Anytime you have to SMUGGLE tapes in and out of a country and insist upon calling it absolutely fabulous, dahling we can suspect that your motives are wholly impure. In my opinion Cuban refugees, like in former times the East German refugees, are telling as much truth about their former home country as a divorced husband or wife about their ex-spouse: Only focusing on the few worse things and ignoring the many better ones. And how many 'divorced spouses' are paddling around in the Caribbean escaping from the wonderful land of the USA ...or England...or Canada? Hmmm...or maybe those death camps? If you are so blind to obviousness in history and so obtuse it was a mistake to make you a moderator. You should resign at once. edit: What's next, ADMINS? This 'moderator' defending how these homosexuals are put into PRISON CAMPS in the paradise island of beloved Stalinist Cuba? Hmmm. Seeems to me that someone made a very bad bad mistake here appointing this person as an Ambassador of SETI. I for one, don't think the homosexual community would appreciate it much knowing these are the kinds of opinions coming out of the SETIathome project. Not to mention the Cuban community (check the stats on how many identify themselves as cuban american). Free speech is one thing....having a hateful person employed as a 'Moderator' is another. I never said anything against homosexuals. At least not at this board. And AFAIK no-one on this board has ever had a reason to call my posts hateful. Until now all your silly accusations have been wrong, and I don't know what you're aiming at. But feel free to further accuse me with anything you wish, maybe you might find something by incident. | 873) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: @R/B: No. Now you are in error. wars only start out of either greed, or false pride (or both).

I suspect, and fairly so, that when you use the word 'greed' it is an aspersion against those that refuse to cooperate with collectivist schemes and live in freedom instead. (as evidence: any of your past posts praising the aims and general system practiced by EAST Germany). Here's a free word of advice for any rational men out there: When you hear anyone claiming their only goal is the mere pursuit of any 'public or higher' good and morality RUN like hell. Well, you can suspect what you want, but I know what greed is, and I know what pride is - as being 2 of the 7 cardinal sins. [Greed:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed) Greed is the selfish desire for or pursuit of money, wealth, food, or other possessions, especially when this denies the same goods to others. [Pride:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride) Pride is the name of an emotion which refers to a strong sense of self-respect, a refusal to be humiliated as well as joy in the accomplishments of oneself or a person, group, nation or object that one identifies with. To think of self higher than anyone and everyone else. Accentuations by me You STILL won't address the point will you? I chooose, and rational men like Rush do as well, to place ourselves above others in a certain moral context. You are the one that refuses to allow 'peace'. You cite 'god' and bible verses. You cite 'society' and 'community'...and continue to preach that WE are the 'eeeeeeeeeeeeevil' ones. Aristotle called 'Pride' the 'crown of all virtues'...Rand summed it as the 'sum of all virtues'. You decry it as a SIN. Guess what? You and your altruism needthe egoist. You neeeed us. Yet you deride every virtue as evil that produces for you and your collectivists slime molds that which you demand as a right. So much for your altruism. Because when we refuse to cooperate out comes your Berlin Wall (which, sir, I still remind you that you praise as a 'necessary evil') in order to make your sick murderous state of terror operate. Answer just ONE question. I will dare you to do so. Does man have the right to exist for his own sake? Does he have the right to exist for his own happiness and purposes, to pursue his own goals and achievements, to find his own values free of your force and able to prosper without your thugs and police batons? Does man have a right to his own BODY!? Or is it subject to your collectivist 'voting rights' and especially, Thorin, your Christian God? Regardless of your answer you should get out of the good moral egoists people's way. Yes, or no. Here is my answer: Everyone has the right to live for their own happiness or purposes, even to do or refuse to do whatever they want - as long as their deeds or refusals harm no-one else. To me the \"Golden Rule\" is the most important rule, independent from all economic systems: \"Treat others as you would like to be treated.\" Well - I advocate nothing less than that. Now you're just lying to us. I'm sorry. But it's not possible to believe that after perhaps hundreds of your postings all of a sudden after you became a moderator you have changed your entire ethical system to agree with the peaceful one that repudiates violence and coercions? You've done a full 180 degree turn around and renounced forced socialism and internment camps for homosexuals and political dissidents? You've done all of this and agreed that it's wrong for those that publish dissenting opinions to be jailed or have their newspapers seized? Really? Even with all of Jeffrey's proselytizing I don't think you'd ever be converted to peaceful purposes so easily. :-) <----that's a Jeffrey winky. You still are invited to answer my other questions regarding whether or not it's 'OK by you' to live for my own sake and happiness without consulting with others as a moral privelege but as a right. I eagerly await your reply, sir. I always repudiated coercion and violence. Show me in all my post history that I advocated any violence. Quite the contrary. Man have you ever really read my posts? Have I ever said that people have to be forced or driven by any force except their own moral standards? Nonetheless, you, and your fellow objectivists always have accused me to be for a Wall and for guns pointed at people (which I always posted against), because I am for a REAL communism - a system which has never really existed in the world throughout the entire written history (except in some short-time experiments in a few rather small areas). Have I ever stated that there have to be secret services spying on people? Nope. Have I advocated a violent revolution? No. Though I admitted that a revolution was and still is needed to get rid of the capitalistic injustice (which is per se in the system), I have said (and still say) that this revolution must happen in the heads of the people, not by weapons. Have I ever said that there have to be internment camps? Man I am against Guantanamo, then I won't be for other camps like it! Have I ever advocated to prosecute homosexuals or dissidents? I never had. Just read my posts if you don't believe me. I always advocated tolerance, fair treatment and a peaceful co-existence. The only thing I don't tolerate is injustice and inhuman behavior. And intentionally false accusations. Have I ever said that the politics as being performed in the GDR and Soviet Union has been good? I have posted some imho good things which have been there (like the free health-care, and the free education, and no unemployment) but I have never stated that the system as it has been was super. Man, I have seen the good things and the bad things and injustice of two different systems - and though I must admit it was better in GDR than in West Germany in some few subjects I wouldn't want to go back there. They had their chance to throw the good things of both systems together to merge a new one after the re-union, didn't take this chance, Ok I survived it. And I tried to show up the difference between real communism (which I advocate), the socialistic system as it has been (which I don't advocate), and the Nazi system (which I am against) - 3 systems you don't quit to try to merge together despite they are entirely different ethical and political systems - which, btw, in my opinion only shows your political ignorance. So, who is the liar here? Just READ my POSTS first and read them well before accusing me such stupid things. Have I ever said otherwise that where there is a right there is a duty, and that with powers there comes responsibility? Do what you want - as long as you don't harm anyone else. And treat others as you want to be treated by them. These simple rules are the foundation of all principles I am living, not he principles themselves... | 874) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: just a short win before having to go off for a while Gotta go gotta go... bye ... bye | 875) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) our Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: wars only start out of either greed, or false pride (or both).

Speaking of freedom, I rather tend to prefer the rule of the Wicca: \"Do what you want, but harm no-one.\" You can also have peace though being an individual, if you follow a few principles: respect the others, tolerate their way of living and their opinions and beliefs, treat them like you want to be treated by them, and replace concurrence with co-operation. | 931) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW(48) RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 663384](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=663384)) Posted 20 Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Out and in for a win 932) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 663308](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=663308)) Posted 20 Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: They could be just around the corner?

I think that's the dilemma with using another language than the origin one. Ebenezer Scrooge was imho a typical example of an egoist (and that's why he was visited by those ghosts)... Scrooge was not an egoist, maybe he was an egotist. As I understood it, an egotist is what I know as being egocentric: selfish, narcisstic, seeing the own self as the center of everything; and there is only a slight difference if any to an egoist (without a t). [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egoist) wrote: egoist (plural egoists) 1. an egocentric or self-centered person; an egotist 2. an advocate of egoism. In Objectivist philosophy, a person exhibiting \"rational self-interest.\" It is in my electronic dictionary (a program I have bought and have installed, a quite expensive program, by the way): egotist [\u00c3\u00c2\u00b4egetist] sb. en der altid taler om (g-tst, g-) n. 1. n. 1. The tendency to speak or write of oneself excessively and boastfully. 2. An inflated sense of one's own importance; conceit. See Synonyms at conceit.

Egotism, the more commonly used term, means \"the fact of being excessively onceited or absorbed in oneself\". Strictly speaking, egoism is a term used in Ethics to mean \"a theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of moral behaviour\", although this sense is not dominant today: around 90 per cent of the citations for egoism on the Oxford English Corpus are for the meaning \"excessive conceit\".\" The 1926 edition of H. W. Fowler, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, contains the following: ego(t)ism. The two words are modern formations of about the same date. Etymologically, there is no difference between them to affect the sense, but egoism is correctly & egotism incorrectly formed -- a fact that is now, since both are established, of no importance. Egotism is, or was till recently, the more popular form, & is (perhaps consequently) restricted to the more popular senses -- excessive use of 'I' in speech or writing, & self-importance or self-centredness in character. Egoism shows signs of ousting egotism even in these senses, but is also used in metaphysics & ethics as a name for the theory that a person has no proof that anything exists outside his own mind, & for the theory that self-interest is the foundation of morality. However arbitrary the differentiation may be, it serves a useful purpose if it can yet be maintained. | 960) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW(48) RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 662661](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=662661)) Posted 19 Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning without a rhyme is easy, rhyming to gain a win not. | 961) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW(48) RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 662459](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=662459)) Posted 19 Oct 2007 by again. :) | 962) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTPW(48) RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 662402](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=662402)) Posted 19 Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Speaking of real women...The woman that I am totally and completely in love with.

The past has shown that cost is going to be driver if anything. VHS won over BETA because it cost less. NTSC also won because of cost. Most people don't care anything about the quality if the price difference is more then a few bucks. Well that is unless the thing is \"trendy\" - the IPOD is an example of this. I hope they come out with players that can do both for under $250, with movies under $20 and writeabel disks under $10. People don't care about quality - if they did MP3s would never have been invented (but that is another issue) NTSC won? As far as I know only a very small number of countries including the USA use NTSC as standard, all the other ones use PAL. And I don't think that costs are the only factor why one of the systems won over the other one. The specs are also not the problem. I think it's a marketing thing, and also a shareholder value thing.

I'm glad I don't smoke. Next, the military will start torturing smokers (by withholding the smokes). Hotels and motels have had non-smoking rooms for years. If you only rent the room/flat/apartment then you do not own it, and as such the actual owner can make the rules about whether smoking is allowed within THEIR property. I have been a lifelong smoker up until 5 months ago, and maybe yet will go back to it sometime in the future, but I do agree with not allowing smoking in enclosed public spaces. There was a case in the UK this week where a taxicab driver has been fined \u00c3\u00c2\u00a350 for smoking in his cab (without a passenger)because his cab has been designated a place of work. A bit iffy that one, as the glass partition would have stopped any smells from the driver getting into the passenger compartment anyway. But there you are. I was really shocked when i was in london. I was searching for smoking areas but didnt find any. I think they will lost visitors. Its also horrible not to smoke in a pub. In germany it starts in january too i will no more eat in a restaurant then. Here in Hessen it started last month.

Tradition holds that Judas hanged himself, but even if that is true, it is unclear if that happened before or after Jesus died on the cross, and though disgraced, Judas was still an apostle. So the number of apostles at the time of Jesus' death would depend on when Judas died. Then, there is Paul, who turned from Roman citizen bent on hounding the splinter group of Jews who followed Jesus, to the next (12th?) apostle. According to the Bible (St. Matthew), Judas hanged himself when Jesus was brought to Pilate. So He must have been still alive when Judas died. It was after the Lord's Ascension that they selected another Apostle, Matthias, to make the 12 full again (Acts 1:23-26). Saul alias Paul came much later. He was mentioned first as Saul in Acts 7,58 (when Stephen was stoned) and Acts 8:1-3 (persecuting the Christians). He had his vision and was baptized later, as it's written in Acts 9. It's not before Acts 13 that Saul changed his name into Paul - maybe there were too many members of the early church too scared of his original name that he finally changed it? | 1073) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) RECONSTRUCTION & POLISHING](forum_thread.php?id=42871) ( [Message 658121](forum_thread.php?id=42871&postid=658121)) Posted 12 Oct 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good Morning Gavin!

At DKK 1600 per person, the total for the big wigs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 night out comes to DKK 112,000. S\u00c3\u00c2\u00b8nderborg\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mayor, Jan Prokopek Jensen, said Moore\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s presentation - which includes a viewing of his latest film about the American health care system, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbSicko\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 - can be \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbinspirational\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 for the city\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s businesses and government.

Two years ago, the administrative office\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s equivalent prior to the regional reorganisation decided that S\u00c3\u00c2\u00b8nderborg\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s municipal employees and business persons could not use public funds to attend a Pavarotti concert. The administration indicated that any arrangement where public funds are used must serve the needs of the community and not the individual, and it determined the concert - unlike a commentary about American health care - would be of no benefit to the city. ----------------------------------- My comment: The delusions continue. :-( Just more hypocrisy.

That might be still okay - but later he reports: Some interrogations require only that the interrogator efficiently question an already-willing source. However, other interrogations, especially those of high-value sources, may require that the interrogator adopt an attitude or behavior intended to mislead or deceive the source. Such interrogations require the interrogator to be a skillful role player or actor. ... 9. Without training, personnel serving as interrogators are more likely to believe that physical abuse and inhumane treatment of prisoners are permissible interrogation techniques. Such behavior not only causes needless suffering for the victim and is criminal, it jeopardizes the intelligence collection effort. Once a prisoner has been abused, gaining his or her willing cooperation is often impossible, even for a highly-skilled interrogator. In addition, any information gained during such an interrogation cannot be regarded as dependable or reliable. (Under torture or threat of torture, the victim is more likely to say what he or she thinks the interrogator wants to hear than to speak the truth.)... ... So far I haven't heard of any military forces which cared less about the Geneva Convention than the US military and NATO troops under US leadership! After days (or, in some cases, more than a week) attempting to avoid the \"hunter\" forces, the soldiers were captured and brought to a central holding facility. Interrogators and military police personnel from various units worked on-site to provide the resistance training. The \"prisoners\" were often subjected to uncomfortable or harsh treatment, such as stress positions, sleep deprivation, and a number of the other techniques that have recently come under scrutiny. This part of the training was not inflicted in order to obtain information through interrogation. Rather, it was employed to simulate the type of treatment the soldier might experience should he fall into the hands of an enemy that did not follow the Geneva Conventions as strictly as did the NATO forces... \"uncomfortable or harsh treatment\" - these techniques already are torture! Don't they get it?

Duh, welcome to reality. People make mistakes. They go overboard. Some cops do the same thing. Some doctors leave their patients dead on the operating table. There are always risks with human interactions, that doesn't mean that we don't interact. Still no reason for violence and torture. Thorin, that wasn't the point, you either missed or evaded it again. Some people will ALWAYS torture others. It happens everywhere. Serial killers. Extremely malicious children. Cops. And yes, even interrogators that go overboard. That will ALWAYS happen because some people will ALWAYS simply do it. But, of course, that wasn't the point. The point was that even though some small number of interrogators will always do that, that isn't sufficient reason to stop all interrogation. You tell me Thorin, here's the problem that an interrogator faces nearly every single time: They simply don't know. They don't know the answer. They suspect they have the right guy, but they don't know. They think he knows what they need, but they don't know. They think they can get the information in time, but they don't know. So what would you do? How much discomfort will you dish out, knowing full well that no matter how likely you are to be correct, you might not be. I'm waiting for your answer here. What about psychological tricks? You don't necessarily need the violence of torture to get quick information. You don't even need to threaten with violence to make them give you the information you need deliberately when you do it right. I'm still waiting for your answer here. So what would you do? How much discomfort will you dish out, knowing full well that no matter how likely you are to be correct, you might not be. But once again, you know nothing about which you speak, you have no idea whatsoever, yet you do blather on. OF COURSE you use psych tricks. Get this: Somewhere near 90+ percent of anyone you begin to interrogate sings at the first opportunity. After that you use psych tricks, Mutt and Jeff, Ego Up and Down, et cetera, you use a combination of all those things to break them. Menstrual blood on a Koran. Pork. Religious attacks. Futility. Any of those things. Most are very effective. Even then you can use the threat of waterboarding, whether you actually intend to use it or not. All that stuff is tried first. No one in their right mind just sets up a waterboard and then uses it. That's a waste of time and isn't necessary. Feel free to believe this all you wish. Normally you do not have weeks to get the information you need. You have minutes and hours and if you are *really* lucky, you have a day or two. Still no reason to terrorize or torture people. To advocate this sadistic procedure even on suspects is just like advocating fascism. That this is reason enough for you (about the only time that \"because you sez so\" is a valid argument (you lucked out)) does not mean it is reason enough for others. They disagree with you. They don't care what you think they are advocating. Knowing that people like you call them \"fascists\" and hold up a bevy of unrelated signs at anti-war rallies is little more than a source of amusement. Any human is to be treated as innocent until their guilt is proved. That's the law. And even interrogators have to follow the law. Heh. That's just more classic naivet\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9. Just as all speeders do, and all tax evaders do, and all cops do, and all CEOs do. Earth to Thorin: no, they don't, any more than any of these other people do. That they don't do follow the laws doesn't mean they are't supposed to follow them. Ad AFAIK the laws allow no expectatios, they are valid for everyone within the country where they are valid. Sure. Just like speeding. Everyone does it. And no one cares. And a few people get tickets. And it STILL goes on because it's a part of every day life that simply cannot be enforced. That people are supposed to follow your precious gov't rules doesn't mean that they do, or that they should. The gov'ts and organizations that they work for condone interrogation in private while decrying it in public. That's just hypocrisy, and makes it even worse. Yeah, you note that, and yet you constantly advocate to give the hypocrites even greater powers over everyone. What a great plan. You don't just water board everyone for the hell of it. Well, I wouldn't \"water board\" no-one in that case. As the saying goes: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Yay. Another bromide from Thorin. No argument, just empty sentiment. Note to you from first hand experience. Most of these guys are deadly competent. They are well trained and very effective. Oh, and if they had an empty motto referring to you it would be \"Who cares what they think?\" I mean, it doesn't look good on a shoulder patch, but it has a ring to it. Full Stop! I still say these people are incompetent. They may be well-trained and effective. But you can train a monkey, too - even to become \"deadly effective\". Human Competence is another thing. You don't speak of \"making people tell you what they have done\". You talk about \"break people and make them admit whatever you want them to admit\". To even admit that black is white and white is black. Like what they do in Abu Ghraib and other detention camps like that. And everyone knows that those who are detained there are mostly scapegoats. Like, \"Guilty or not, let's arrest them, they look guilty - after some treatment we will see that they also will be guilty\". That's like what they did in the Spanish Inquisition, during witch hunts. And to call that \"going overboard\" is a lame excuse. Did the Nazis \"go overboard\" when they burned books and began to gather Jews to gas them? Did McCarthy \"go overboard\" inventing \"Un-American behavior\" - and using this to hunt lefties instead of the evil ones? Did Bush just \"go overboard\" to command your military to march into Afghanistan, Iraq (and maybe Iran)? No. They intended to do so. They deliberately did these things, like the interrogators/inquisitors deliberately cross the line between appropriate questioning and sadistic torturing. Maybe they enjoy having power over the detainees, the possibility to do everything to them what you want to make them admit what you want them to admit, without being punished yourself - Well, incidents do happen...

My questions were predicated on the guilt of the detainee being 100% certain - let's assume that is beyond all doubt. Surely then it is the greater good? When you can describe how such a situation would arise, that you had a detainee that you knew without doubt had knowledge that you didn't already possess, and that this knowledge would save another, only then could I accept your conclusion. The situation you describe goes to the very core of the matter, how can you know what another person knows? OK. YOU saw this person first hand planting the device and you knew it to be a bomb. You saw him detained. The authorities, of which you are a part, want to stop the timer and defuse it but they are not able to do so. You know it was he who set this device but he claims he cannot defuse it. He readily admitted to having planted it thus confirming what you had seen. Ten other people also saw him planting the device. Its your decision now - 2m dead or YOU authorise his torture. Yes it may mean 2,000,001 in the end. What would you now do? As I say circumstances change things and people. Almost everyone can put a bomb anywhere and fuse it, but it takes some experience to defuse it once it is sharp. So even though the person set the bomb, he might really not know how to defuse it again. First solve the problem, then punish the guilty - that's my principle.

How many innocent persons should be allowed to be terrorized and tortured to catch the guilty one? 5? 10? 100? As many as it needs to find the right guy among them? Nobody in their right mind does that because it's a complete waste of time because most people don't know enough to bother, and of the rest, they aren't likely to know what you need to know anyway. Normally you just assess them, where did you catch them and why? What other evidence do you have? How likely is it that they are involved? One asks these questions among others to determine whether the person is even a likely candidate, even those that are are usually quickly dismissed. You simply don't have time to waste just plowing through every jackass that comes across your desk. Have you ever been accused and interrogated though being innocent? I have, back in 1988.

How many innocent persons should be allowed to be terrorized and tortured to catch the guilty one? 5? 10? 100? As many as it needs to find the right guy among them? Have you ever been accused and interrogated though being innocent? I have, back in 1988. And I'm very glad that that officer who interrogated me didn't use torture.

So your position is that that child should have been allowed to die, crying, screaming, alone, and in complete terror, rather than threaten a reasonable suspect? You want to sacrifice that child's life rather than cause discomfort to a suspect? Not really. But what if the suspect had been falsely accused and the informations give because of the threatened torture had led nowhere? This time the cops were lucky to have interrogated the right guy.

Having lived all your life in a capitalistic country you may know that market is a matter of supply and demand. If they know you really need their products you will have to pay more for them than if they just want you to buy their products. That's what the pharmacy companies do right now: they know that there is a high demand for their products, so they demand high prices for them.

She told me the following story which happened to them a couple years ago: Once, her daughter came home with her best female friend from a party which she was invited to. On their way back they had a car incident, and the friend of young Ms. B.. who drove the car, got some severe bruises. So young Ms. B. asked her mom if her friend could stay over night (and the rest of the weekend) to come over it. Well, the mother allowed this, she didn't want to disappoint her daughter... Anyway: After a night full of nightmares, Mrs. B. talked with her guest and learned about the hobby of that girl: she claimed to practice black magic. Mrs. B. told her that she wouldn't believe in it but asked her anyway to not practice anything like this in her house. Anyway she began to feel mistrust... The rest of the day went well, just like a normal Saturday for a single mother, with two teenage girls instead of one in the house... Then, after another night full of nightmares, Sunday morning came, and Mrs B. wanted to prepare to go to church like each Sunday, knowing that her daughter wouldn't join her - as she haven't done for the past couple years. But when Mrs. B. went under the shower she saw that she suddenly had bruises - at the same places where the friend of her daughter had them before! Not believing what she saw and felt she finished her showering and went to church, but she couldn't really ignore these bruises. When she came home after church, she woke the girls up, and demanded the guest of her daughter to show her own bruises again, telling them what she experienced at the morning. The girl's bruises had vanished. It turned out that this girl had found a way to heal from her wounds by just giving them away... Of course both, mother and daughter threw the girl out, ad young Ms. B. even quit friendship with her - but both of them, mother and daughter, went through a long unlucky time after that...

I hope Thorin thinks about it, even if his intentions are good the effect would be not. It would be a dictatorship. Thorin, I respect that you at least care about others, but open dialog is the way to go as well as initiating/supporting help programs. About police brutality: the biggest threat to true freedom is if the authorities can commit wrongdoings without consequences. What I don't understand is, that a minority of citizens will justify each act of police brutality no matter how brutal and how unprovoked (until being a victim themselves) - and you can indeed find the same behavior in this forum. Perhaps you'd be better suited constantly critiquing your own GERMAN government? Well, if you compare it objectively the situation in the US is far far worse then in Germany. And you're right. Though I have been washed away by a police water cannon without even having been a participant of a demonstration or sit-in; though I have seen German police people catching beggars, beating them up whilst loading them into a bus and unloading them about 5 miles outside the town to \"clean the city\"; though I have seen policemen provoke violent reactions in peaceful demonstrations; though I have seen German police men bash the head of a resident alien who was confused with an illegal immigrant against a wall; though I have seen all these and more things myself and even more terrible things on documentaries, I must say that our German police still is not as violent as the US police but developing to become like them. I know how brutal and right-wing police can be. And I know that there must be an extreme change in the governments to avoid (better saying: to undo) the developing to a police state. What do you think why all this cameras are built- in everywhere, why emails and phone-calls can be supervised, why everyone is becoming a suspect by just mentioning several words? In the GDR it was the Stasi; in West Germany it's Verfassungsschutz and BKA, in the States it's FBI, CIA and NSA which control the people like a nowadays' Gestapo. Like: \"You're not following our ideas? You're Un-American!

Aren't police officers supposed to have taken an oath on the Constitution? [Part 2.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueJi_uEurHE) Hmm.. after watching the videos, and checking up on a couple of things, that it isn't as bad as you are making it out to be. It appears that a pro-war group was holding a rally and an anti-war group (or groups) tried to disrupt it. It seems likely that the pro-war group had a permit, especially given their speaker list (including Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain, according to that one guy). It also seems likely that the 'Code Pink' group (and maybe others) crashed the party, so to speak, and tried to disrupt it. It appears that the police, doing their job, tried to separate the two factions by moving the code pink people to another area away from the pro-war speakers podium, and that the code pink people that refused to move got arrested. This is not a violation of 'free speech rights'. The Government has a compelling interest in separating opposing groups like this. Human beings, being the hotheads that we frequently are, have a tendency to resort to violence in emotionally charged circumstances such as this. Separation of opposing groups like this became standard procedure back at the height of the civil rights movement. Frequently, minority groups holding civil rights rallies found their rallies disrupted when the KKK would show up and begin intimidating them, and frequently violence would break out between the civil rights people and the sheetheads. Nobody stopped the Code Pink people from having their say. They just had to do it 'over there', so as not to disrupt the pro-war group. And if it had been an anti-war rally, and pro-war people had shown up, it would have resulted in an identical response. The pro-war people would have been separated and moved, and arrested if they refused to do so. This response actually HELPS guarantee the right of 'free speech' for all concerned. It lets each group have their say, without a direct confrontation with the associated risk of violence. If the Code Pink people want to have a rally, let them go for it! All they need to do is decide on a venue and go get a permit. And 'permits' are not a violation of free speech rights either, when it comes to protests and rallies. The permit process helps guarantee the free-speech rights of the group, by ensuring that there are no scheduling conflicts between your group and other groups protesting/rallying about other issues, and it puts the police department on notice so they can assign some officers to provide security services at your protest/rally (for things like traffic control and elimination of disruptions). CodePink protestor: \"Congress shall make no law...\" Police: \"Excuse need to go over protestor: \"Congress shall make no law...\" Police Officer: \"Please go over there, or I will have to arrest you...\" CodePink protestor: \"Congress shall make no law...\" Police Officer: \"Ok, I tried... You are under arrest. <gets out the cuffs> You have the right to remain silent...\" This is no different than \"Taser-boy's\" circumstances. Failure to comply with a Police Officer's lawful instructions leads to arrest. Resist arrest, and get a smackdown when they have to forcibly put the handcuffs on you. At least, from what I saw, the CodePink lady had the good sense to not resist arrest. It wasn't WHAT that lady was reciting, it was that she was disrupting somebody else's lawful demonstration and her failure to obey the police officer that tried to get her to move a couple of hundred feet that got her arrested. You have a right to hold a demonstration without interference by your opponents. Your opponents have a right to hold a demonstration without interference by you. Neither you nor your opponents have a right to disrupt each other's demonstration. Nothing to see here... Move along. There are plenty of legitimate reasons why the point could be made that the USA (and a number of other nations) are moving towards being police states. Reasons like increasing surveillance of citizens, abrogation of rights protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures, and search warrants issued by a magistrate being increasingly not required, as examples. The issue raised by Thorin's post that I quoted ISN'T one of them. But the most disturbing and evil thing is imho that such warmonger meetings are permitted, and peaceful people are suppressed at the same time. Have you seen the interview in Part 2? The (clerical?) woman who was accused to protest disturbingly and handcuffed for 7 hrs after being removed from the place only because she showed the peace sign with her hand? And it IS the message which was recited, not by whom or when and where. Code Pink and any other similar organization with similar goals have my full sympathy and understanding. Warmongers don't. Their meetings and tirades are no \"lawful\" demonstration in my eyes, as well as KKK meetings or the meetings of New Nazi groups are lawful. To call these enemies of the free \"lawful\" is like spitting in the faces of the founders of the USA. These movements are opposing everything the fathers of the USA stood for - and that your government allows these movements, and protects them by the police lead me to a question: What kind of politics make the USA government state that such fascist groups can be allowed and called \"lawful\" there - and groups who want peace are (and often have been) violently suppressed? | for reading the Constitution?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCLuYvBeq40) WTF?

The merits or rewards were just a side-effect, which often even embarrassed these people. Their only intention was to offer their skills, experience and knowledge to help people who they felt to be in need. It's a matter of empathy and compassion. Of sheer charity. Of sympathy for the fellow human. Of love. Like a car-driver who is picking up a hitch-hiker to help them get faster from A to B (taken as an example: I know about the risks nowadays), or someone who sees an incident and goes there to help the injured person, or someone who gives a beggar something to eat, or someone who offers a homeless a shelter to sleep - these people don't care whether they know those people in need personally or not. They feel sympathy for those people and just help, just like the [Good Samarita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan). It's even proven by social-psychologists: According to C. Daniel Batson's 'empathy-altruism hypothesis' for example, if you feel empathy towards another person you will help them, regardless of what you can gain from it. Relieving their suffering becomes the most important thing. They go to heaven..To those who believe in Heaven, that's a side-effect at helping others, but not the reason to help. The reason to help is that they see people who are in need of help they can offer, and offer them this help just to decrease their misery, to make them less unhappy. As I read elsewhere: \"I had so much luck in life, I just want to share what my life has give me.\" Sure there are people who help only to gain merits, who help to feel \"greater\", to gain the feeling of people becoming dependent of them - but these are no altruists in my eyes. _______________________________________________________________________ Even animals can act altruistic in the meaning of selfless help. That's just natural, and has been watched often by sociobiologists. Some animals offer their own lives to let others survive, other animals do hunt or gather to feed other individual animals which doesn't help themselves but the entire group (/herd/pack/whatever) in the long run. | 1236) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & CLEANING](forum_thread.php?id=42539) 652308](forum_thread.php?id=42539&postid=652308)) Posted 1 Oct 2007 by Care for a Jelly Baby, John?

They act as every human should act. Actually, they are. It has been psychologically proven that humans help others out of a selfishness to make themselves feel better. Every single human helps another because they like that feeling of \"doing good\". You see, the deed itself, the knowledge to have helped others, to have done good, to have brought happiness is their only reward - and not any material thing which drive pure egoists. They care because they feel right to care (and that's not a \"helper syndrome\" as the psychologists also often like to accuse, as if it were a kind of illness). Altruism is not a syndrome, not an illness; it's the pure humanity. And every human feels better after having done something human.

I don't accept any of that feel good nonsense definition of 'altruism' that you give. I submit to you that only a proper egoist...or someone acting egoistically is capable of even helping another that is desperately in need of some sort of aid. It is not normal for a person to spend his life in a constant state of emergency. Except of course when he's plagued by altruistic forces left and right... I've never met a person, man or woman, that is heroic that has not been SELFISH. I want that selfishness. I've never met a woman attracted to me or any man because of his 'selflessness'. It's the worse sort of characteristic you could ever impart to a child. What a horror...! Was Mother Teresa, who saw her call in serving \"the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone\", selfish or an egoist? Are people in general who give up their life and income to help others acting egoistically? Are the \"Doctors Without Borders\" acting egoistically? Are people selfish when they volunteer as fire fighters? Are people selfish who go to other states and areas to help people in need? People for example who helped the victims of Katrina? Are those selfish who volunteer in rescue missions and soup kitchens for the poor? Is someone a proper egoist who stops at an incident to give First Aid to a stranger who is injured before calling an ambulance? No, they aren't. They help people whom they never met before, and whom they maybe never will meet after that, without demanding or even expecting a reward. These examples act altruistic, selfless, human. They act as every human should act. \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" said Kant. And it would be a poor world when everyone did care only about themselves, but it would be a better world if everyone would be altruistic. | 1240) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & CLEANING](forum_thread.php?id=42539) 651772](forum_thread.php?id=42539&postid=651772)) Posted 30 Sorry I didn't understand this.

If a government acts human and just and SERVES the People, why not keeping it's ruling; but if a government acts inhuman or unjust, and only fills the own wallets of the rulers whilst suppressing the People, then it's not worth to be called government, then it's tyranny. Your definition of tyranny is a dictatorship that doesn't have enough support 'of the people'. The Myanmar military dictatorship does have plenty of support in the population.Do you know that for sure? Who sez so? the official Myanmar media? They are controlled by the government. They can't say otherwise even if knowing better. What's the difference? I think your from a country that had 2 seperate styles of dictatorships both of which 'served the people'.No. None of the governments I've been living under has really served the people. They served their own agendas, claiming to serve their party. Of course that depends on who you talk to doesn't it? You think it's ok to violate people's rights as long as you get enough people to AGREE that the rights they're violating and the force the government is using is something they are in favor of. Oh, I 'get the point' alright.And you are wrong again. You're not against dictatorships, just unpopular dictatorships.As I said I'm against each governmental injustice. Each individual has human rights, and each human should be treated equal and have equal chances and rights. In most countries it's not like that, there some people are \"more equal than the others\". Minorities have no chance in hell in a system that you advocate. Let's not forget the individual is the smallest minority on earth. This is why they've got to build walls and use guns to keep people in line. They choose not to participate and have to be forced....but as long as they're being forced to 'serve the people' it's ok by you and people that support altruism like yours.I've got the impression that you misunderstand me intentionally. I never said that I advocate such thing. I said the only \"force\" should be a moral one, that people should be willing, driven by their own moral standards, to participate - or be ignored by the community if they don't do. Bloody altruists. Well... That's a topic of [another R/B wrote: Bloody altruists To me, Altruism is the ideal ethic system. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism), Altruism is: _____________________________________________________ Altruism is selfless concern for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures, and central to many religious traditions. In English, this idea was often described as the Golden rule of ethics. Some newer philosophies such as egoism have criticized the concept, with writers such as Nietzsche arguing that there is no moral obligation to help others. Altruism can be distinguished from a feeling of loyalty and duty. Altruism focuses on a motivation to help others or a want to do good without reward, while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (for example, God, a king), a specific organization (for example, a government), or an abstract concept (for example, patriotism etc). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is giving without regard to reward or the benefits of recognition. [...] Advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act, or refrain from acting, so that benefit or good is bestowed on other people, if necessary to the exclusion of one's own interests (Note that refraining from murdering someone, for example, is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped, as he already has his life; this would amount to the same thing as ignoring someone). [...] On a somewhat related note, altruism is often held \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac even by non-altruists \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power. Such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace. When they do not, they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own. [...] In common parlance, altruism usually means helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons, although it may well entail the \"internal\" benefit of a \"good feeling,\" sense of satisfaction, self-esteem, fulfillment of duty (whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one's conscience), or the like. In this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question. Humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don't know and will never meet. For example, some humans donate to international charities and volunteer their time to help society's less fortunate. It can however be argued that an individual would contribute to a charity to gain respect or stature within his/her own community. | 1249) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I find no shame in wanting to raise other people's quality of life to at least my own.

BRODER and JAMES RISEN WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac The American security contractor Blackwater USA has been involved in a far higher rate of shootings while guarding American diplomats in Iraq than other security firms providing similar services to the State Department, according to Bush administration officials and industry officials. Blackwater is now the focus of investigations in both Baghdad and Washington over a Sept. 16 shooting in which at least 11 Iraqis were killed. Beyond that episode, the company has been involved in cases in which its personnel fired weapons while guarding State Department officials in Iraq at least twice as often per convoy mission as security guards working for other American security firms, the officials said. The disclosure came as the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had sent a team of officials to Iraq to get answers to questions about the use of American security contractors there. The State Department keeps reports on each case in which weapons were fired by security personnel guarding American diplomats in Iraq. Officials familiar with the internal State Department reports would not provide the actual statistics, but they indicated that the records showed that Blackwater personnel were involved in dozens of episodes in which they had resorted to force. The officials said that Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s incident rate was at least twice that recorded by employees of DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, the two other United States-based security firms that have been contracted by the State Department to provide security for diplomats and other senior civilians in Iraq. The State Department would not comment on most matters relating to Blackwater, citing the current investigation. But Sean McCormack, the department\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s spokesman, said that of 1,800 escort missions by Blackwater this year, there had been \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"only a very small fraction, very small fraction, that have involved any sort of use of force.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 In 2005, DynCorp reported 32 shootings during about 3,200 convoy missions, and in 2006 that company reported 10 episodes during about 1,500 convoy missions. While comparable Blackwater statistics were not available, government officials said the firm\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s rate per convoy mission was about twice DynCorp\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. The State Department\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s incident reports have not been made public, and Blackwater refused to provide its own data on cases in which its personnel used their weapons while guarding American diplomats. The State Department is in the process of providing at least some of the data to Congress. The administration and industry officials who agreed to discuss the broad rate of Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s involvement in violent events would not disclose the specific numbers. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The incident rate for Blackwater is higher, there is a distinction,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said a senior American government official who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss a delicate, continuing investigation. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The real question that is open for discussion is why.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 A Blackwater spokeswoman declined to comment. Blackwater, based in North Carolina, has gained a reputation among Iraqis and even among American military personnel serving in Iraq as a company that flaunts an aggressive, quick-draw image that leads its security personnel to take excessively violent actions to protect the people they are paid to guard. After the latest shooting, the Iraqi government demanded that the company be banned from operating in the country. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You can find any number of people, particularly in uniform, who will tell you that they do see Blackwater as a company that promotes a much more aggressive response to things than other main contractors do,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 a senior American official said. Today, Blackwater operates in the most violent parts of Iraq and guards the most prominent American diplomats, which some American government officials say explains why it is involved in more shootings than its competitors. The shootings included in the reports include all cases in which weapons are fired, including those meant as warning shots. Others add that Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s aggressive posture in guarding diplomats reflects the wishes of its client, the State Department\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Still, other government officials say that Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s corporate culture seems to encourage excessive behavior. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Is it the operating environment or something specific about Blackwater?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 asked one government official. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"My best guess is that it is both.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Blackwater was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince, a former member of the Navy Seals, and is privately owned. Most of its nearly 1,000 people in Iraq are independent contractors, rather than employees of the company, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Tyrrell. Blackwater has a total of about 550 full-time employees, the she said. Its diplomatic security contract with the State Department is now the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s largest, Ms. Tyrrell said, while declining to provide the dollar amount. The company also provides security for the State Department in Afghanistan, where it also has counternarcotics-related contracts. In addition to the Sept. 16 shooting in the Nisour area of Baghdad, Iraqi officials said Blackwater employees had been involved in six other episodes under investigation. Those episodes left a total of 10 Iraqis dead and 15 wounded, they said. Many American officials now share the view that Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s behavior is increasingly stoking resentment among Iraqis and is proving counterproductive to American efforts to gain support for its military efforts in Iraq. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"They\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re repeat offenders, and yet they continue to prosper in Iraq,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who has been broadly critical of the role of contractors in Iraq. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s really affecting attitudes toward the United States when you have these cowboy guys out there. These guys represent the U.S. to them and there are no rules of the game for them.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Despite the growing criticism of Blackwater and its tactics, the company still enjoys an unusually close relationship with the Bush administration, and with the State Department and Pentagon in particular. It has received government contracts worth more than $1 billion since 2002, with most coming under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, according to the independent budget monitoring group OMB Watch. Last year, the State Department gave Blackwater the lead role in diplomatic security in Iraq, reducing the roles of DynCorp and Triple Canopy. The company employs about 850 workers in Iraq under its diplomatic security contract, about three-quarters of them Americans, according to the State Department and the Congressional Research Service. DynCorp has 157 security guards in Iraq; Triple Canopy has about 250. The figures compiled by the State Department track the number of shootings per convoy mission, rather than measuring against the number of employees. Just in recent weeks, Blackwater has also been awarded another large State Department contract to provide helicopter services in Iraq. The company\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s close ties to the Bush administration have raised questions about the political clout of Mr. Prince, Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s founder and owner. He is the scion of a wealthy Michigan family that is active in Republican politics. He and the family have given more than $325,000 in political donations over the past 10 years, the vast majority to Republican candidates and party committees, according to federal campaign finance reports. Mr. Prince has helped cement his ties to the government by hiring prominent officials. J. Cofer Black, the former counterterrorism chief at the C.I.A. and State Department, is a vice chairman at Blackwater. Mr. Black is also now a senior adviser on counterterrorism and national security issues to the Republican presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. Joseph E. Schmitz, the former inspector general at the Pentagon, now is chief operating officer and general counsel for Blackwater\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s parent company, the Prince Group. Officials at other firms in the contracting industry said that Mr. Prince sometimes met with government contracting officers, which they say is an unusual step for the chief executive of a corporation. No Blackwater employees, or any other contractors, have been charged with crimes related to the shootings in Iraq, although there are a number of American laws governing actions overseas and in wartime that could be applied, according to experts in international law. In addition, a measure enacted last year calls for the Pentagon to bring contractors in Iraq under the jurisdiction of American military law, but the Defense Department has not yet put into effect the rules needed to do so. Separately, American officials specifically exempted all United States personnel from Iraqi law under an order signed in 2004 by L.Paul Bremer III, then the top official of the American occupation authority. The Sept. 16 shootings have so angered Iraqis, however, that the Iraqi government is proposing a measure that would overturn the American rule and subject Western private security companies to Iraqi law. The proposal requires the approval of the Iraqi Parliament. In a sign of the Pentagon\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s concern over private security contractors, Mr. Gates last Sunday sent a five-person team to Iraq to discuss with Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, the rules governing contractors. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He has some real concerns about oversight of contractors in Iraq and he is looking for ways to sort of make sure we do a better job on that front,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Geoff Morrell, Mr. Gates\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s spokesman, told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England sent a three-page memorandum to senior Defense Department officials and top commanders around the world ordering them to ensure that contractors in the field were operating under rules of engagement consistent with the military\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s. | Post: i really didn't like THAT feelin' - so i never did it again - ONLY to spook the animals - in the 'close proximity' of my aim - to scare 'im off - DOH! ;) My \"point of no return\", the situation I still sometimes dream of, was rather an incident, happening when I was 17: Leaving the house of my buddy after visiting him, his fathers guard dog came jumping at me without any barking or growling - I just was opening the garden door (though having been told to wait for my buddy at the house), and seeing this dog jumping at me, I just moved the heel off my hand against its snout when I saw its teeth were only inches away from my arm. I hit its nose - and the addition of our both's moves: my turning, and the dogs jump, was no good for the dog. It died. And the death of this dog was no good for the friendship to this guy, either. Our friendship ended with this situation. Since then I was the monster in his eyes.

When my cousins, I and my brother (in order of age) were shooting, our targets were metal plate targets with a tilt mechanism and formed as animals: a deer, a hog, a fox and a rabbit - which were just 1.5 by 3 inch on size. And our granddad taught us to hit them on 50 yards with just a normal air-rifle, or with bow and arrow. And you are right, Richard: ZEN really helps. It even helped me once, a dozen years ago, to kill a rabbit only using my butterfly knife. I was waiting for my prey as every hunter waits for their prey, but I did not wait for it on a raised hide: I just sat down in the opening... on the grass ... widely seen... just sitting there... waiting... meditating... feeling ONE with nature... thinking of nothing... sending out peace... waiting... letting the rabbit come to me and even gnaw at my jacket, not seeing any danger in my very being ... - then, out of a sudden, my butterfly knife appeared in my hand, the rabbit died and became my supper that day.

The posting of essays advocating egoism only proves that this magazine can no longer be leftist. | 1297) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & CLEANING](forum_thread.php?id=42539) 649194](forum_thread.php?id=42539&postid=649194)) Posted 26 Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I hope the kitty gang leaves my new mouse alone...

Actually I think that the USA already have become a police state, as well as Germany and some others have become police states also. For example: here in Germany, demonstrations have to be applied for permit at the authorities 6 to 8 weeks minimum in advance, announcing the subject, and the estimated number of participants to the authorities. When the goal of the demonstration seems to be a \"critical\" one, several divisions of cops get all free weekends or any holiday canceled before the day of the demonstration, they are sent to training camps on the other side of the country to build up even more frustration and temper in them, even hate (like, \"if it were not for those demonstrators you could have stayed in your usual police offices or enjoy your free weekend/your vacation instead of robbing through the wilderness here\") - before they are commanded to \"guard\" these demonstrations. Of course then they welcome each single excuse of a reason to let their dammed up aggressions go against the demonstrators. The best example of this you could see at Rostock-Heiligendamm. And a old retired ex-cop told me that they used to follow this \"hate the people\" - strategy since the late 60's/ early 70's. Also the US cops seem to have a certain paranoia in them, seeing a potential criminal in each person they are speaking to whilst being in office. I saw that they even grabbed to their weapons when they asked drivers for their driving license. It seems to me that the knowledge of having the \"power over freedom and life\" makes them paranoid and anxious, makes them \"shoot first ask later\". __________________________ I saw that cops acted like bullies to the people they normally are supposed \"to protect and to serve\" - and got away with it, because each action agaist that bullying would have been \"resistance against police\". I saw that they could arrest people with made up \"evidences\" and got away with it. I saw that they could beat up unarmed persons in numbers of 5, 6 cops against 1 person, causing this person go to hospital for several weeks without them having a single bruise themselves - and got away with it. I saw that cops even could kill unarmed, handcuffed people and got away with it. And I'm speaking of Real Life and court reports, not movies. And I'm also speaking about West Germany and UK and France and USA, not only East Germany (though such things also happened there). Police states?

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUtBlDu8azU) is the video again. As you will see, the thing was, Meyer was jumped upon only because of asking whether or not Kerry was member at \"Skulls & Bones\", the same secret society Bush supposed to be a member of. Then, the entire \"angry ranting\" (which is rather a loud protesting against the rude treatment by the police), and what you interpret as \"attacking the Senator\" is only because the cops are upon Meyer - who actually did nothing than raise inconvenient subjects. Of course the speech of Kerry was then interrupted only by the \"Why are you arresting me?\" and \"Aw!\" and \"What did of me\" and \"Don't tase me!\" of a in my eyes non-violent person. Things began go wrong when the cops went to arrest Meyer whilst he was asking his questions. The first \"bad move\" as you call it, MajorKong, was made by the police who played censor there.

Pictures like It's indeed a fine line between justice and censorship and those crimes are for sure not on an equal level. As I stated before I am also rather for an open discussion, but you need to weigh one thing against the other. In this case I still see the offense/threat by the nooses way more serious then the danger of censorship. Btw. something funny I remember: Due to the law against Nazi-symbols in Germany a guy who sold stuff with ANTI-Nazy symbols (fists bashing swastikas, swastikas thrown into trashcans and so on) was found guilty violating the law and to a payment of 3600\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac. His whole stock got confiscated. Luckily our high court the \"Bundesgerichtshof\" stopped this nonsense, even the prosecutors there voted for not guilty.

But that's normal for a country where the anti-fascist [VVN](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/VVN) (= Union of those persecuted by the Nazi regime) are and have been under surveillance of the Verfassungsschutz, and the ultra- right-wings like NPD, Republikaner, and other organizations are legal parties and organizations with all rights any other party or organization does have. | 1309) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [No Andrew Meyer Thread Till Now?

[spiegel.de](http://www.spiegel.de/videoplayer/0,6298,21771,00.html) - I saw a student asking inconvenient questions and being interrupted by several cops who wanted to hinder him to do so. Censorship? Have the questions been too inconvenient? After the initial attempts to peacefully lead him away from the 'audience question podium' failed,...which was not really peacefully... Why have they been against some interrogating questions? ... Meyers became more agitated and tried to break away from the officer's grip as he lunged towards Sen. Kerry.No, he lunged to get out of their grip. Kerry stood quite far away on the stage. Not only Meyer was several yards away from the stage when asking his interrogating questions, he also would have to climb on the stage first to really attack Kerry. Which means, your point, Threatening move is THAT, is not longer valid. ... After he tried to attack Sen. Kerry,...With what? With more inconvenient questions? Or with the sheet he had in his hand? ... THAT is when more officers jumped on him, he was dragged away from Sen. Kerry towards the back of the room,in the [video I saw](http://www.spiegel.de/videoplayer/0,6298,21771,00.html), he never was THAT close to the Senator! ...and they tried to handcuff him without success. Of course, when 4, 5 cops wrestling him down, they hinder each other to handcuff that one guy - they were enough to successfully handcuff a huge octopus, but one or two had been enough to handcuff that ONE person! ...He was still highly agitated and still attempting to break free.Sure - if I were attacked by cops because of just asking questions I would also try to break free. It was THEN, and ONLY THEN that the electric device was brought out and used on Meyers.Oh, of course - it's not enough for one unarmed student to be jumped on by a superiority of 4 or 5 armed cops, they also HAD TO stun him to calm him down - And that's no police violence, of course not! Oh, and it wasn't a Taser, it was a Stun Gun....which surely makes it less harmful... Tasers can be used at range. You gotta touch the perp with the Stun Gun. Other than that, though, same thing for the most part, except they are sightly less dangerous.Sure... \"slightly\"... A stun gun discharges through two metal contacts OUTSIDE the body. A taser fires needles connected by wires to the unit. These needles penetrate the skin and discharge into the 'wet' tissues beneath. You can get a MUCH bigger jolt from a Taser.That's why they use stun guns for torturing - they are \"less dangerous\" for the victim! It still are some Kilo-Volt which are sent into the body of an unarmed person! And I know what a stun gun/taser is, how it works, the associated dangers, and what it feels like to be zapped by one. It isn't fun.And still you advocate it? However, I stand by my statement when I called them 'non-lethal'. A firearm (which is considered 'lethal') is designed to do someone severe bodily harm leading to death. A taser/stun gun is designed to incapacitate someone (although from time to time people DO end up dying -- stuff happens) without causing bodily harm. That's the collateral damage then, isn't it? No, the police in the Meyers vs. Kerry incident acted properly.Properly for a police state. Oh, and another thing... Meyers HAD to have been planning this. Why else would he have had a friend next to him video-recording the incident? I wonder if she (the friend) will be brought up on 'conspiracy to commit' charges?There were several students with cameras - all part of a conspiracy? Forget it. Oh, throwing an egg or tomato at someone *IS* assault. THAT, in and of itself, could have given Meyers a few years in prison. If the egg were a ceramic egg I would understand this argument. But a normal egg or some vegetable? Paah! You can calmly and peacefully call someone every name in the book...Sure. But if you start lunging towards them when you are agitated, especially if you touch them in any way or try to hit them with any sort of a thrown object, you are guilty of assault (possibly aggravated) of one degree or another. That means prison time.Only if you're close enough to hit someone. If I stood 6 feet away from you and struck out as to hit you, would this be a threat? I doubt it. | 1310) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe & CLEANING](forum_thread.php?id=42539) 25 Sep 2007 by is |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [No Andrew Meyer Thread Till Now?

He/she/it didn't taser the kid because they personally were threatened. The kid, in the middle of his angry rant, rushed towards Senator Kerry (D-Mass), a very important and influential politician on the national level. Kerry ran against Bush for President in 2004. The security-type person used their Taser on the kid to stop what could have been an assassination attempt. They did their *job*. Oh, thus just speaking angry, and being \"pottymouthed\" to a person who is a politician by chance is an assassination attempt? Ridiculous! What is this security guy? Paranoid or something? Or is it just the new nowadays' muzzle policy: \"Shut up and listen or you get TASER'd?\" FIY: Tasers are not NON-lethal, it's what your biased media like to call \"less-lethal\". Although the statistics differ on how many have actually died after being shocked by a TASER, some numbers state it is as high as 250 since the TASER has been introduced to law enforcement officials. What are Tasers? They are hand-held weapons that deliver a jolt of electricity \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac up to 50,000 volts \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac from up to 6.5 metres away. The shot can penetrate up to five centimetres of clothing. It stuns the target by causing an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue. He/she is immobilized and falls to the ground \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. TASERs work by overriding the electrical system of the body by use of a high voltage, low current electrical discharge, making the muscles twitch or spasm, causing great pain and brief paralysis in victims. ... Most of the testing of the TASER and weapons like it have been performed on pigs and relaxed, healthy humans, but on the street most people facing police custody are not relaxed. They also may be on drugs, have health issues or be mentally ill and for these people 50,000 volts, especially if given more than once, may be all it takes to kill them. I don't know which sadistic mind invented these things, and which sadistic mind introduced them as a police weapon, permitted to be used against unarmed civilians who just express their anger VOCALLY. Oh, your police is better than the Chinese or Russia ones, they don't use bullets and bats anymore against people who are angry and \"pottymouthed\", they use 50,000 Volt to muzzle them. Very human. Very non-violent. What would this police or security man have done if the \"kid\" as you call him had thrown an egg or a tomato on the Senator? Shot him dead with their gun? I bet they would've done that, paranoid and violent as they are.

I just find it funny (and hilarious) that even people like you who blindly advocate more and massive gov't intrusion into our lives, then turn around and decry the same gov't that they've begged to meddle. In one breath you seem to understand its true nature, noting how it lies, yet in the next you beg it to meddle endlessly in our lives. In my eyes that's not turning around. It's not the nature of a government to betray its citizens, it's the corruption of the people who rule which makes their government a bad one. It's the governing people, not the government itself who lie and betray and do worse things. So if you want a righteous and caring government, get rid of all corrupt people in the current one, and form a new government of chosen righteous and caring people if you find enough of them to form it. | 1333) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: ...

Aaaaaaaaaarrrggggghhh I wouldn't say that people vote with their feet. First of all, once you buy a new computer Windows is in most of all cases already installed. Most people are just unwilling to remove it and install another system. Like: \"I paid for it, it works more or less, why should I exchange it?\". Then, there are those who say: \"I always used Windows why should I break with this tradition?\". Only those who really are open for alternatives inform themselves about other Operation Systems. When my former home-town administration decided to install Linux on all their computers, they not only saved a lot of money per year, but they also realized that though for an average user the change from Windows to Linux is not that difficult, the anxiousness was a hindering factor nonetheless. Everyone who used Windows with only simple user rights can use Linux with no difficulties. And if \"root\" changes the setting to 'double click' the change is even easier.

Just as with Iraq, there is no evidence of an Iranian bomb and no threat, therefore, of the country using one. And by what moral authority do the biggest nuclear powers in the world presume to pontificate over Iran? Their continuing possession of nuclear arms does more to destabilise the world than Iran could ever do. But the issue here is not nuclear weapons, it is, as it was with Iraq, the region's oil and US hegemony in the region. This was made clear by no less a person than Alan Greenspan, who was for 18 years head of the US Federal Reserve bank and whose memoirs, which were published on Monday, declare, much to the chagrin of the White House:\"I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows. The Iraq war was largely about oil.\" And there you have it, straight from the horse's mouth. And you can't reasonably accuse Alan Greenspan to be left-wing, can you? 1404) ist Religion.

Growth is the most powerful weapon in the fight for higher living standards. Faster growth will require policies that encourage macroeconomic stability, shift resources to more efficient sectors, and integrate with the global economy. reads wonderful. And they have to learn much more... * Improving the distribution of income and wealth. The benefits of growth for the poor may be eroded if the distribution of income worsens. But policies that promote better income distribution are not well understood; learning more about the impact of policies on distribution should be high on the agenda. (To learn more, read about Inequality) if they only did that instead of letting people starve! * Accelerating social development. Social indicators will benefit from improvements in economic growth and income and wealth distribution, but there is still room for policies that target interventions that appear to have a large impact on health and educational outcomes. At the top of the list are female education, safe water and sanitation, and child immunization, as well as safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. (To learn more, read about Safety Nets and Transfers.) Attention is also needed to the social structures and institutions which affect development (read about Social Capital). Like \"free\", decentralized markets? No way, sirs!!! Second, donors and international agencies must support countries that show a determination to take up the challenges of the Millennium Development Goals. Then open your ears and hearts to help them! Third, international agencies must work with developing countries to strengthen country capacity to monitor progress on outcomes. This will involve ensuring that the statistical infrastructure in key countries is adequate to mount periodic surveys and analyze the data, and that there is capacity to conduct participatory studies and hear the voices of the poor. Especially the World Bank knows exactly (at least theoretically) [what poverty means](http://www1.worldbank.org/prem/poverty/mission/up1.htm).

[Here some thoughts about 9/11](http://www.gerhard-wisnewski.de/modules.php?name=Inhalt&sop=showpage&pid=40), again by Wisnewski. I think it's worth to read. From \"The Spiral of Silence\": [...] Under the high pressure with which the official view is exerted, thought just takes on its own form. This is the way totally contradictory issues ar forced into a single brain, for which, with all the best intentions, there is just no room. Here we may also mention the implicit and explicit aspect. First of all, people refuse, on their own account, to believe in anything as horrifying as an internal conspiracy to kill more than three thousand people. A massive thought restriction is in place here. It resembles thought restrictions which, in the case of child abuse, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t allow a child to believe that his parents may actually be criminals. So far, no external pressure is needed to keep the child's mind from coming to undesired conclusions. If, however, the child is additionally (explicitly) threatened by his persecutor, then the child will remain silent literally until the grave. On the basis of some critical media accounts of September 11, we have seen how additional outside pressure has been exerted on the extant \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Spiral of Silence\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. In the case of Willy Brunner and me, the pressure peaked with the official campaign of rejection and employment prohibition by the German state broadcasting company, WDR. Other authors were grouped with the extreme right movement, as in the case recently with the TV Theme Show \"Conspiracy Theories\" for the station \"Arte\" (4.13.05). Such grouping alone is a career endangering accusation for a German author. Furthermore there was an attempt to give the Spiral of Silence into one more crucial twist, by comparing 9/11 sceptics with Holocaust deniers: those who doubt that millions of Jews were gassed in German concentration camps. It was by no means an arbitrary accusation, having more to do with the fact that negation of the holocaust is a criminal offence (\u00c3\u00c2\u00a7130, Abs. 3 StGB) under German law. If equating 9/11 sceptics with holocaust deniers succeeds, any critical view on the official version of the 9/11 attacks could become equally taboo. Better still, it would throw holocaust negation and conspiracy theorists into one pot, forbidding public statement of critical background thought in any form. From \"A Medieval Myth\": [...] Most, if not all of the elements of the 9/11 myth, interact like fire and water. But the more perfect the chaos - the more contradictory and confusing - the more the brain yearns for a resolution. Only in chaos on this level is the brain prepared to accept any story as long as it brings some order to the insanity. More than anything, disorder breeds the desire for order. That is why the deeply-seated, contradictory nature of these mythical elements was desperately needed. The brain gladly brushes over details, as it does with optical illusions. It is the very contrariness of extreme, traumatic events which cries for a messenger to distribute the opium to a public longing for a good night\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s sleep. Just as the visual cortex seeks an image at all accounts in a chaotic pattern, and even forces an image of reality, the cerebrum seeks a story in place of chaotic information. Better yet for the mind if a story is presented to it. It all depends on the capability of an idea to dominate the chaos Then, the desired meaning can be easily perceived in the chaos. In a state of shock the brain is even more than willing to dispense with rational thought. As a result of the time pressure that an emergency creates, the brain is willing to make do with spotty information. Even the Neanderthal Man had to form an idea in his mind of what might be approaching when he heard the noise of underbrush breaking in the bushes. The brain then goes, so to speak, into emergency mode. The cynical \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Shock and Awe\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 strategy that the American government used at the beginning of the Iraq War was already being used for 9/11. The goal was to universally traumatize and emotionally disarm the populace. The most unsupportable aspect of 9/11 is that their scenario, engineered by deranged intellects, has since then dominated the minds of the public \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac children included. Especially in the wake of such a shock, it is not so simple to change such a solidified interpretation. Change calls for imagination and change is more resistant when the mind is forced to see what it has never seen before. That is why the mind is content to imagine that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by Arabian hijackers. Any other view must initially be rejected. What would a secret, elite conspiracy look like altogether? How could it work? How does such a conspiracy proceed? Oh, please stop with all this nonsense! The brain is irritated and upset. It just can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t conjure up that kind of image. It is no accident that almost every second letter I receive from readers of Operation 9/11 informs me that the reader is suffering sleepless nights since reading my book. It is because the opium of pseudo information has become impotent, and because a new dosage is not administered. Yes, the new image is anything but reassuring.

I don't know if it's available in English meanwhile. If so, it's really worth a read. I have the German version here, in the book-shelf behind me. But I am too lazy to translate parts of it, so I googled for finds in English language. And I found some. Even on the web-site of the author. [Here](http://www.gerhard-wisnewski.de/modules.php?name=Inhalt&sop=showpage&pid=10) is a part of an English language summary: But based on the findings of some of Germany's most respected experts of crime technology, graphology and linguistics, the authors come to the conclusion, that the BKA's assertions regarding the authenticity of the texts concerned are unscientifical and biased. In a rare access of honesty the BKA itself admitted that the thermoprinter used for the letter of self-accusation in the Herrhausen case lacks any particular characteristics permitting its identification. Regularly confronted with such lack of usefull evidence, a regrettable consequence of modern printing technology, the BKA developed \"TEXTOR\", a computerised text matching program. By screen-matching all existing texts imputed to the RAF it was hoped to detect the \"individual\" stile (orthographic, grammatical, linguistic particularities) of a whole group. Writings of a number of individuals suspected to be sympathisers of the RAF were screened for ressemblances with the computerised \"RAF-stile\". One suspect, Andreas S. was held on remand for two and a half years, because of his habit to write the German abbreviation z.B. [in English: i.e.] with small letters, a current mistake in alleged RAF texts. The TEXTOR-expert's credibility only broke down, when critical colleagues discovered the criminal z.b.in one of his own writings. The court later found that many of the alleged letters of confession had simply been copied and compounded from old pressarticles and leaflets from various sources. This was, for the time being, the end of TEXTOR and the legend of an anonymous terror squad's \"personal handwriting\". [...] In 1978 a bomb explosion tore a hole in the in the prison of Celle, a town in Nieder-Sachsen. The attack was immediately presented as a terrorist attack aiming at the liberation of \"RAF\"-convicts detained in the prison. As a result, the prisoners rights were massively restricted and the bombing served as a justification for more pro-active policing. The truth about the bombing came to light eight years later, in 1986. It had been planned and carried out by the VS in cooperation with GSG-9, a German anti-terrorist unit created with the support of the British SAS. None of the high officials involved was ever sanctioned. In contrary: The then chief of the VS of Nieder-Sachsen was named vice-president of the federal VS and Gerhard Boeden, then vice-president of the BKA, is now head of the federal VS. [...] The political effect of the \"third generation's\" attacks is clear: The head of Deutsche Bank,Herrhausen, is murdered at a time of growing criticism of the role of the banking world in the impoverishment of developing countries, a machine gun attack against the American embassy in Bonn is carried out at the height of non-violent mass protests in Germany against the USA's role in the Gulfwar, Mr. Rohwedder, the chief of the \"Treuhand\" is shot dead only weeks before a planned mass rally of union members in Berlin against the brutal dismantling of East German economy by the \"Treuhand\". In all cases the effect is the same: The \"acts of solidarity\" of the \"RAF\" with popular mass movements deprives the latter in of their credibility and leads to the criminalisation of legitimate poitical opposition. In several chapters the authors investigate the backgrounds and roles of some of the prominent victims. Alfred Herrhausen, for instance, is presented as the man who attempted to make the Deutsche Bank a \"global player\" in direct rivalry with mostly American financial institutes and as a strong advocate of cancelling the debts of Third World countries. Both policies are resented as a threat by US bankers. As for Rohwedder, the chief of the \"Treuhand\", he was facing growing criticism from neo-liberal financial circles in and outside Germany for placing social considerations before ever to hasty privatisations leading to mass unemployment. After Herrhausen's death, Deutsche Bank gives up its ambitions as a \"global player\", the new chief of the \"Treuhand\" proceeds with the ruthless liquidation of East German enterprises. In other words, the acts of the \"third generation\" inflict heavy dammage to precisely the aims they pretend to serve: Improved conditions for the \"RAF\"-detainees, the preservation of civil liberties, peace in the Gulf region, Third World solidarity, employment in East Germany...

Which would you rather? A justice system that may convict an innocent person by mistake or a justice system that my set free a guilty person by mistake. Think carefully. Especially when the death penalty is involved. Once a life is taken it can not be given back, no matter how much it is desired. Of course the above does not apply in the RPG or MMORPG worlds where people can bring you back or in most other games, where you can just hit reload/load... I would rather have a guilty person free than an innocent one in jail. This is why we have strict laws about the proceedings to convict. There are some crimes where the perpetrator should never be free again. Of course if you convict the wrong person, it would be good to be able to free the wrongly convicted and appologize. I would like to note the innocence project that is using DNA evidence to prove that some people were wrongly convicted and put on death row. That's why I mentioned in one of my posts (don't remember if it was here or on another board in a thread about the same subject): If someone is guilty of murder or rape beyond any doubt (means guilty proven to 100,0%, by DNA evidence & whatever tests possible), then --> execute the monster! I think this statement implies to not execute that person as long as there is any doubt or any missing evidence. | 1432) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hey Beets, do what I did after I got a Trojan.

And for Microsoft Office: Why does one need Microsoft Office, when there is Open Office, which is able to save one's files in the same formats as M$ Office as well, plus the Open Office file formats plus several other formats?

Have a read of this [article](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6087894103.html) by a Linux person - it may help you understand better why Micro$oft keeps winning... There's some good comments in there, especially about people 'not caring other than it simply should just work' and if not then it must be 'trash', and about the reluctance for change. Most people never even get to hear of Linux, let alone gain the motivation to try it out for themselves. Unless they get kicked by other reasons... I'll admit that the 'kick' that pushed me off Windows and onto Linux were problems with Windows at that time for multi-user operation, (lack of) security, and a forced upgrade from the development system of the time. (Strangely enough, years later those problems seem to be still there still unfixed!) After moving into Linux, you soon wonder why the hell you didn't make the change way way sooner! Good luck, Martin I second that. I still can't thank that friend who gave me a copy of SUSE 8.1 enough for introducing the world of Linux to me. Since the day I installed it I've realized how insecure MS Windows really is if you don't want to or can't afford to pay a third party Firewall. And how little Windows offers if you don't want to or can't afford to buy extra software in general. Ok there are a lot of free-ware programs meanwhile for Windows, but if you look more closely, most of them have been adapted from Linux programs and are part of the Linux system. See OpenOffice. See Gimp. See a lot more of them. Even most if not all routers and hardware firewalls run on Linux - ask yourself why they don't use a Microsoft system for that! And why is Apple Mac so secure in relation to Microsoft Windoze? Because it's a Unix-like system, a \"cousin\" of Linux, that's it. | 1446) . . sErvin' UP an EXtrEMEly HOT & POTeNT ESPReSSO for EaCh of You Thank you very much.

Now now Monday, We can't be to Old to Learn can we? ;-) No but we can be too dumb! MY sister gave me her dead computer(the puter shop told her it was RS) I put a new HDD in it and installed Linux on it .I couldn't even figure out how to install Boinc on it and when I tried to study upon how it worked all I found was alphabet soup And abbreviation diarrhea. I found some good Linux beginners stuff,And did get it running BOINC for awhile.(TO SLOW for me) I searched heaps but didn't find any good beginners stuff so I gave up and sold the puter for $350.The purchaser had a windows XP OS disc which I installed for him plus some other useful stuff and he is very happy. What was the distro that you used? I have UBUNTU on my box in a dual-boot config and it works fine. UBUNTU has the info on installing just about everything on it's website. Hi robert Kinkead the linux distro i installed dual boot was Susie . It was the 1 that most people recomended. And I would like to say that i I agree with With you that it works really well with the programs that come with it . It is really amazing that Linux will automatically connect to my internet connection and you can easily use all of the downloaded programs ....but when it comes to trying to Get it to do what i want to do....iTS JUST NOT ACHIEAVABLE I must challenge this. I've been running SUSE on Dual Boot since I have a computer to use for my OWN to experiment with, that means my first SUSE was 8.1. Now I'm using openSuSE 10.2 (the base of my actual system on this computer was a DVD coming with a computer magazine, I even can tell the title if it's allowed here - and I got the rest by just adding the right sources to the online updates), and I am so content with that I let it run as my main system, removed the Dual Boot Windows XP and run Windows only via VMWare, really using it more seldom than never besides crunching. If you have a look on the computers I use you will see that I also run BOINC on Linux. It's quite easy to install - and I am also not a friend of the command shell, I rather prefer the rpm files to install with yast... I can tell you, in all the years I used the command shell may be a dozen times in total. I also have a book where I can find the commands, but... well, may be later - still I am too used to just click and it works. On my step-son's computer where I installed SuSE 10.0 I even could install a Windows XP driver for a Lexmark scanner/printer and an USB WLAN stick, because at this moment there were no Linux driver for these ones. The drivers were \"wrapped\" into the system, and they worked. As it is now, I never will install any other Windows system instead of my Linux. Linux is in steady development no matter which distribution, and get better each year - but look at Microsoft: One version of a system remains for years and years. Windows is running without any major difference for 14 years now. Still computers are running on Windows 2000 or even 95 and 98. Of course - the pure OS without any additional programs is so ridiculously expensive you must run it long time for a pay-off. When you take a Linux distribution as you can buy it in a shop together with Windows XP (or Vista) system as you can buy it in the shop, without installing any additional software - besides of the price: which one can you use better right from the installing, to start with? I mean, it takes you about the same time to install them if you're lucky. But if you need a good office program for Windows you have to go get it, while you have some office suites already being a part of Linux. You want a good picture rendering program and run Windows? Go get it first - while it's already inside Linux. You want games, 3D rendering, electronic circuit simulation, even teaching programs for your little ones? What, games? LOL! On Windows we have 4 simple games plus their online version right from installation *baaah!* You want to change the look&feel of Windows? Install the pay-to-use software first, while you have lots of possibilities at Linux. Windows even refuses updates if you haven't a registered system number for each single one of your machines, while it doesn't matter whether you have your Linux copy from the shop or from your friend: YOU ARE EVEN ALLOWED TO COPY IT! You gotta pay so much money per computer for Windows, plus more money for the added software... What is that? Getting the Buick's chassis for the price of the whole car, plus extra payment for everything else?

Again, from the \"ABC\" by A. Berkman: In a nutshell, then, the meaning of Communist Anarchism is this: the abolition of government, of coercive authority and all its agencies, and joint ownership - which means free and equal participation in the general work and welfare. This, in a nutshell, is why anarchism will not provide the utopia you wish for. See below. \"You said that Anarchy will secure economic equality,\" remarks your friend. \"Does that mean equal pay for all?\" It does. Or, what amounts to the same, equal participation in the public welfare. Because, as we already know, labour is social. No man can create anything all by himself, by his own efforts. Now, then, if labour is social, it stands to reason that the results of it, the wealth produced, must also be social, belong to the collectivity. No person can therefore justly lay claim to the exclusive ownership of the social wealth. It is to be enjoyed by all alike. The problem here is that I, and people like me, will hire and pay the better people more for their labor. And since in anarchy you have abolished \"government [...] of coercive authority and all its agencies,\" you will not be able to stop me. \"But why not give each according to the value of his work?\" you ask. Because there is no way by which value can be measured. >snip pure ignorance< You can't. See below. A loaf of bread will be worth a great deal to you when you are hungry, and much less when you are not. Therefore the real value of a thing cannot be ascertained; it is an unknown quantity. But the price is easily found out. If there are five loaves of bread to be had and ten persons want to get a loaf each, the price of bread will rise. If there are ten loaves and only five buyers, then it will fall. Price depends on supply and demand. Once again, since I can think freely, and there is no way you can stop me, those that think as I do will charge as they wish for their bread. I will make a profit. And since it's anarchy, I can. The exchange of commodities by means of prices leads to profit making, to taking advantage and exploitation; in short, to some form of capitalism. If you do away with profits, you cannot have any price system, nor any system of wages or payment. That means that exchange must be according to value. But as value is uncertain or not ascertainable, exchange must consequently be free, without \"equal\" value, since such does not exist. In other words, labour and its products must be exchanged without price, without profit, freely, according to necessity. This logically leads to ownership in common and to joint use. Which is a sensible, just, and equitable system, and is known as Communism. Except that this denies reality. Generally, EVERYTHING has a value, and that value is flexible. The value is the price that the seller is willing to part with it and the buyer is willing to buy it. A seller may think his loaf of bread is worth $1000. But he'll have a hard time selling it. Anoter quotation, from the same book (and since you & R/B also like to quote from your idols, let me quote from one of mine): No, there will be no buying or selling. The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people. Land, machinery, and all other public utilities will be collective property, neither to be bought nor sold. Actual use will be considered the only title-not to ownership but to possession. The organization of the coal miners, for example, will be in charge of the coal mines, not as owners but as the operating agency. Similarly will the railroad brotherhoods run the railroads, and so on. Collective possession, cooperatively managed in the interests of the community, will take the place of personal ownership privately conducted for profit. \"But if you can't buy anything, then what's the use of money?\" you ask. None whatever; money becomes useless. You can't get anything for it. When the sources of supply, the land, factories, and products become public property, socialized, you can neither buy nor sell. As money is only a medium for such transactions, it loses its usefulness. \"But how will you exchange things?\" Exchange will be free. The coal miners, for instance, will deliver the coal they mined to the public coal yards for the use of the community. In their turn the miners will receive from the community's warehouses the machinery, tools, and the other commodities they need. That means free exchange without the medium of money and without profit, on the basis of requirement and the supply on hand. But back to your response: Because you couldn't make profit from it. That's the whole thing. \"But is it just that all should share alike?\" you demand. \"The man of brains and the dullard, the efficient and the inefficient, all the same? Should there be no distinction, no special recognition for those of ability?\" Let me in turn ask you, my friend, shall we punish the man whom nature has not endowed as generously as his stronger or more talented neighbor? Shall we add injustice to the handicap nature has put upon him? All we can reasonably expect from any man is that he do his best - can any one do more? And if John's best is not as good as his brother Jim's, it is his misfortune, but in no case a fault to be punished. There is nothing more dangerous than discrimination. The moment you begin discriminating against the less capable, you establish conditions that breed dissatisfaction and resentment: you invite envy, discord, and strife. You would think it brutal to withhold from the less capable the air or water they need. Should not the same principle apply to the other wants of man? After all, the matter of food, clothing, and shelter is the smallest item in the world's economy. The surest way to get one to do his best is not by discriminating against him, but by treating him on an equal footing with others. That is the most effective encouragement and stimulus. It is just and human. And it is also the reason you will have to build a wall. Why? Because I, and everyone that thinks even remotely like me, will leave. Again: I don't need your system. [/quote]And it would be fine indeed, if you and people like you did not participate. IMHO nobody who wishes such a society would miss such kind of people. Is that really such a bad system? If you're happy with it, go right ahead. I will not be participating, which is fine, too. | 1501) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & REFURBISHMENT](forum_thread.php?id=42287) 640344](forum_thread.php?id=42287&postid=640344)) Posted 13 Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Ok, here comes your coffee :D That is wrong on so many levels. :) eeeeeeeek!

Berkman: In a nutshell, then, the meaning of Communist Anarchism is this: the abolition of government, of coercive authority and all its agencies, and joint ownership - which means free and equal participation in the general work and welfare. \"You said that Anarchy will secure economic equality,\" remarks your friend. \"Does that mean equal pay for all?\" It does. Or, what amounts to the same, equal participation in the public welfare. Because, as we already know, labour is social. No man can create anything all by himself, by his own efforts. Now, then, if labour is social, it stands to reason that the results of it, the wealth produced, must also be social, belong to the collectivity. No person can therefore justly lay claim to the exclusive ownership of the social wealth. It is to be enjoyed by all alike. \"But why not give each according to the value of his work?\" you ask. Because there is no way by which value can be measured. That is the difference between value and price. Value is what a thing is worth, while price is what it can be sold or bought for in the market. What a thing is worth no one really can tell. Political economists generally claim that the value of a commodity is the amount of labour required to produce it, of \"socially necessary labour,\" as Marx says. But evidently it is not a just standard of measurement. Suppose the carpenter worked three hours to make a kitchen chair, while the surgeon took only half an hour to perform an operation that saved your life. If the amount of labour used determines value, then the chair is worth more than your life. Obvious nonsense, of course. Even if you should count in the years of study and practice the surgeon needed to make him capable of performing the operation, how are you going to decide what \"an hour of operating\" is worth? The carpenter and mason also had to be trained before they could do their work properly, but you don't figure in those years of apprenticeship when you contract for some work with them. Besides, there is also to be considered the particular ability and aptitude that every worker, writer, artist or physician must exercise in his labours. That is a purely individual, personal factor. How are you going to estimate its value? That is why value cannot be determined. The same thing may be worth a lot to one person while it is worth nothing or very little to another. It may be worth much or little even to the same person, at different times. A diamond, a painting, or a book may be worth a great deal to one man and very little to another. A loaf of bread will be worth a great deal to you when you are hungry, and much less when you are not. Therefore the real value of a thing cannot be ascertained; it is an unknown quantity. But the price is easily found out. If there are five loaves of bread to be had and ten persons want to get a loaf each, the price of bread will rise. If there are ten loaves and only five buyers, then it will fall. Price depends on supply and demand. The exchange of commodities by means of prices leads to profit making, to taking advantage and exploitation; in short, to some form of capitalism. If you do away with profits, you cannot have any price system, nor any system of wages or payment. That means that exchange must be according to value. But as value is uncertain or not ascertainable, exchange must consequently be free, without \"equal\" value, since such does not exist. In other words, labour and its products must be exchanged without price, without profit, freely, according to necessity. This logically leads to ownership in common and to joint use. Which is a sensible, just, and equitable system, and is known as Communism. \"But is it just that all should share alike?\" you demand. \"The man of brains and the dullard, the efficient and the inefficient, all the same? Should there be no distinction, no special recognition for those of ability?\" Let me in turn ask you, my friend, shall we punish the man whom nature has not endowed as generously as his stronger or more talented neighbor? Shall we add injustice to the handicap nature has put upon him? All we can reasonably expect from any man is that he do his best - can any one do more? And if John's best is not as good as his brother Jim's, it is his misfortune, but in no case a fault to be punished. There is nothing more dangerous than discrimination. The moment you begin discriminating against the less capable, you establish conditions that breed dissatisfaction and resentment: you invite envy, discord, and strife. You would think it brutal to withhold from the less capable the air or water they need. Should not the same principle apply to the other wants of man? After all, the matter of food, clothing, and shelter is the smallest item in the world's economy. The surest way to get one to do his best is not by discriminating against him, but by treating him on an equal footing with others. That is the most effective encouragement and stimulus. It is just and human. \"But what will you do with the lazy man, the man who does not want to work?\" inquires your friend. That is an interesting question, and you will probably be very much surprised when I say that there is really no such thing as laziness. What we call a lazy man is generally a square man in a round hole. That is, the right man in the wrong place. And you will always find that when a fellow is in the wrong place, he will be inefficient or shiftless. For so-called laziness and a good deal of inefficiency are merely unfitness, misplacement. If you are compelled to do the thing you are unfitted for by your inclinations or temperament, you will be inefficient at it; if you are forced to do work you are not interested in, you will be lazy at it. Is that really such a bad system? | 1518) |[Message Post: I'm really shocked!

But since they possess some kind of aerodynamics, they most probably glide down and will hit the ground in a more flat angle and ending up surfing on the ground on touch down. Helicopters on the other hand with no aerodynamic abilities drop like a rock... I have to agree.

Here's the introduction to this book: I want to tell you about Anarchism. I want to tell you what Anarchism is, because I think it is well you should know it. Also because so little is known about it, and what is known is generally hearsay and mostly false. I want to tell you about it, because I believe that Anarchism is the finest and biggest thing man has ever thought of; the only thing that can give you liberty and well-being, and bring peace and joy to the world. I want to tell you about it in such plain and simple language that there will be no misunderstanding it. Big words and high sounding phrases serve only to confuse. Straight thinking means plain speaking. But before I tell you what Anarchism is, I want to tell you what it is not. That is necessary because so much falsehood has been spread about Anarchism. Even intelligent persons often have entirely wrong notions about it. Some people talk about Anarchism without knowing a thing about it. And some lie about Anarchism, because they don't want you to know the truth about it. Anarchism has many enemies; they won't tell you the truth about it. Why Anarchism has enemies and who they are, you will see later, in the course of this story. Just now I can tell you that neither your political boss nor your employer, neither the capitalist nor the policeman will speak to you honestly about Anarchism. Most of them know nothing about it, and all of them hate it. Their newspapers and publications - the capitalistic press- are also against it. Even most Socialists and Bolsheviks misrepresent Anarchism. True, the majority of them don't know any better. But those who do know better also often lie about Anarchism and speak of it as 'disorder and chaos'. You can see for yourself how dishonest they are in this: the greatest teachers of Socialism - Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels - had taught that Anarchism would come from Socialism. They said that we must first have Socialism, but that after Socialism there will be Anarchism, and that it would be a freer and more beautiful condition of society to live in than Socialism. Yet the Socialists, who swear by Marx and Engels, insist on calling Anarchism 'chaos and disorder', which shows you how ignorant or dishonest they are. The Bolsheviks do the same, although their greatest teacher, Lenin, had said that Anarchism would follow Bolshevism, and that then it will be better and freer to live. Therefore I must tell you, first of all, what Anarchism is not. It is not bombs, disorder, or chaos. It is not robbery and murder. It is not a war of each against all. It is not a return to barbarism or to the wild state of man. Anarchism is the very opposite of all that. Anarchism means that you should be free; that no one should enslave you, boss you, rob you, or impose upon you. It means that you should be free to do the things you want to do; and that you should not be compelled to do what you don't want to do. It means that you should have a chance to choose the kind of a life you want to live, and live it without anybody interfering. It means that the next fellow should have the same freedom as you, that every one should have the same rights and liberties. It means that all men are brothers, and that they should live like brothers, in peace and harmony. That is to say, that there should be no war, no violence used by one set of men against another, no monopoly and no poverty, no oppression, no taking advantage of your fellow-man.

It is claimed that driving a car 5km adds 1kg of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; walking however, uses about 180 calories which is roughly equal to eating 100g of beef and producing that beef releases a total of 3.6kg of carbon dioxide. Interesting huh? Not sure if it all checks out but thank god for cars ey? hehe I also read similar conclusions. But: They only fit as long as the guesstimates are close to the wanted results. Otherwise I must agree to you: that industrial-like stock-farming IS polluting. It'd be better for the environment if they held the animals in their natural surroundings: meadows instead of concrete buildings, free movement instead of small barns, eating grass (or whatever these animals normally eat) instead of chemically produced pellets.

What is property, what is capital in their present form? For the capitalist and the property owner they mean the power and the right, guaranteed by the State, to live without working. And since neither property nor capital produces anything when not fertilized by labor - that means the power and the right to live by exploiting the work of someone else, the right to exploit the work of those who possess neither property nor capital and who thus are forced to sell their productive power to the lucky owners of both. Note that I have left out of account altogether the following question: In what way did property and capital ever fall into the hands of their present owners? This is a question which, when envisaged from the points of view of history, logic, and justice, cannot be answered in any other way but one which would serve as an indictment against the present owners. I shall therefore confine myself here to the statement that property owners and capitalists, inasmuch as they live not by their own productive labor but by getting land rent, house rent, interest upon their capital, or by speculation on land, buildings, and capital, or by the commercial and industrial exploitation of the manual labor of the proletariat, all live at the expense of the proletariat. (Speculation and exploitation no doubt also constitute a sort of labor, but altogether non-productive labor.) I know only too well that this mode of life is highly esteemed in all civilized countries, that it is expressly and tenderly protected by all the States, and that the States, religions, and all the juridical laws, both criminal and civil, and all the political governments, monarchies and republican - with their immense judicial and police apparatuses and their standing armies - have no other mission but to consecrate and protect such practices. In the presence of these powerful and respectable authorities I cannot even permit myself to ask whether this mode of life is legitimate from the point of view of human justice, liberty, human equality, and fraternity. I simply ask myself: Under such conditions, are fraternity and equality possible between the exploiter and the exploited, are justice and freedom possible for the exploited? Let us even suppose, as it is being maintained by the bourgeois economists and with them all the lawyers, all the worshippers and believers in the juridical right, all the priests of the civil and criminal code - let us suppose that this economic relationship between the exploiter and the exploited is altogether legitimate, that it is the inevitable consequence, the product of an eternal, indestructible social law, yet still it will always be true that exploitation precludes brotherhood and equality. It goes without saying that it precludes economic equality. Suppose I am your worker and you are my employer. If I offer my labor at the lowest price, if I consent to have you live off my labor, it is certainly not because of devotion or brotherly love for you. And no bourgeois economist would dare to say that it was, however idyllic and naive their reasoning becomes when they begin to speak about reciprocal affections and mutual relations which should exist between employers and employees. No, I do it because my family and I would starve to death if I did not work for an employer. Thus I am forced to sell you my labor at the lowest possible price, and I am forced to do it by the threat of hunger. But - the economists tell us - the property owners, the capitalists, the employers, are likewise forced to seek out and purchase the labor of the proletariat. Yes, it is true, they are forced to do it, but not in the same measure. Had there been equality between those who offer their labor and those who purchase it, between the necessity of selling one's labor and the necessity of buying it, the slavery and misery of the proletariat would not exist. But then there would be neither capitalists, nor property owners, nor the proletariat, nor rich, nor poor: there would only be workers. It is precisely because such equality does not exist that we have and are bound to have exploiters. This equality does not exist because in modern society where wealth is produced by the intervention of capital paying wages to labor, the growth of the population outstrips the growth of production, which results in the supply of labor necessarily surpassing the demand and leading to a relative sinking of the level of wages. Production thus constituted, monopolized, exploited by bourgeois capital, is pushed on the one hand by the mutual competition of the capitalists to concentrate evermore in the hands of an ever diminishing number of powerful capitalists, or in the hands of joint-stock companies which, owing to the merging of their capital, are more powerful than the biggest isolated capitalists. (And the small and medium-sized capitalists, not being able to produce at the same price as the big capitalists, naturally succumb in the deadly struggle.) On the other hand, all enterprises are forced by the same competition to sell their products at the lowest possible price. It [capitalist monopoly] can attain this two-fold result only by forcing out an ever-growing number of small or medium-sized capitalists, speculators, merchants, or industrialists, from the world of exploiters into the world of the exploited proletariat, and at the same time squeezing out ever greater savings from the wages of the same proletariat. On the other hand, the mass of the proletariat, growing as a result of the general increase of the population - which, as we know, not even poverty can stop effectively - and through the increasing proletarianization of the petty-bourgeoisie, ex-owners, capitalists, merchants, and industrialists - growing, as I have said, at a much more rapid rate than the productive capacities of an economy that is exploited by bourgeois capital - this growing mass of the proletariat is placed in a condition wherein the workers are forced into disastrous competition against one another. For since they possess no other means of existence but their own manual labor, they are driven, by the fear of seeing themselves replaced by others, to sell it at the lowest price. This tendency of the workers, or rather the necessity to which they are condemned by their own poverty, combined with the tendency of the employers to sell the products of their workers, and consequently buy their labor, at the lowest price, constantly reproduces and consolidates the poverty of the proletariat. Since he finds himself in a state of poverty, the worker is compelled to sell his labor for almost nothing, and because he sells that product for almost nothing, he sinks into ever greater poverty. ...

Imagine being brought up in a home where you hear your parents and grand parents talking about being beaten by people because of the color of their skin. Your Grandmother, old and frail, telling of days where she was thrown to the asphalt for not giving way to white people who were walking on the sidewalk near you. Hung and shot for no other reason than being a different color. Stories and documentaries about your people being abducted from their homes around the world to be sold to the highest bidder. The lies of 40 acres and a mule, share cropping, segregated water fountains, bathrooms, restaurants. Then going out to school to be harassed by police because you live in a certain area. Then hearing and seeing people like BrainsmasheR spouting further hate. Imagine having no food and no medical. No school because the school sucks for whatever reasons; teachers are prejudice, don't care, or getting to the antiquated school is a life or death problem in itself. Imagine having no job opportunities because of this. What would you do? What option is left to you? Gang Banging and crime are the result of these social inadequacies. If you were constantly looked down on, beaten, turned away, and swept under the rug... What would you do? What would you have to do to survive? News reports about Mel Gibson, Martha Stewart, ENRON, and yes... Paris Hilton, walking from charges, hours after being arrested, while people they know have been locked up for years, even if it was their first offense. Due and speedy process being non existent. Do you think the Kennedy family always had money? Do you remember reading about Irish and Italians being shunned by American society? Crime is the result of these issues and is simply the only way people in these situations can empower themselves to survive and help their families survive. These people are not evil by birth or nature. They are forced into it by being beaten mentally and physically so that they gladly turn to crime. I do not blame them for trying to live outside the matrix and live life. So, now people of the upper, middle, and lower white classes, (and others.) have a big joke running for a couple hundred years here in America. It's not funny or realistic. They go out of their ways to promote and perpetuate the construct, not realizing they are wrong and that it is the cause of suffering on both sides of the line. Separate and conquer. Rich vs poor, Black vs White, beautiful vs unattractive, the list goes on. Meanwhile, 10% or less of the rich have aquired 80% or more of the worlds real property and wealth with the consent and adoration of their population who value money over all things. Capitalism has run amok with those below the elite rooting them on as heroes. The system is failing because we have allowed it to fail. Whether by not doing anything or not knowing any better, we have become consumers; sheeple. America is not the same place I was born in, but I will not sit with my hands folded while we are run into the ground any longer. I will not perpetuate the problems. I will not condone that which is socially condoned. I will not view the system as a monster that can not be changed. Checks and balances need to be installed before it is too late. We Americans are no longer in control of our freedom. Think about it a little. Just a little. Not for me but for yourselves and your families. If the majority is wrong or acting in their own self interest while causing perpetuation of human suffering, I will speak out. I will not live in the matrix silently. If the system is failing: modify or place it. This is my right as an American. (If you've read all of this you have my thanks.) Time for lunch.

In my opinion, no kind of work is worth less or more than the other one (besides extra-pay for overtime, shifts, danger, or working abroad). Example: a skilled construction worker at a building site works not harder than an unskilled construction worker, so why gets the unskilled worker less money by the hour + less benefits? I'd like to advocate an equal salary for each job, high enough that the worker can afford his family, house, car etc. while working even just 30 to 35 hrs a week. Again, Thorin. This is why they needed a wall. The higher skilled workers will simply LEAVE. They can make more money and a better life for themselves somewhere else. The people you need the most will leave you to your silly ideas without a wall.Why should they? If they knew they can live a good life with working 30 - 35 hrs a week, and have to worry about their standard of life even with working 40 hours or more a week elsewhere - why should they leave? This is why your precious gov't built a wall, to keep people IN.Never seen that Cuba had a Wall, except if you count the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean as walls. Oh, and except the wall the USA built to divide Guantanamo Bay from the rest of the Cuban island. And the USSR also had no wall. There is one, in the south, on the border to China - but this belongs to China and is older than the Russian nation, so it doesn't count. And the DPRK has no wall either, there is only the heavily armed border between South Korea and the DPRK. As well as there is a border between the USA and Mexico. Do they have a wall there too? It's why Germany had a wall, why the Soviets had a wall, why the DPRK has a wall, why Cuba has a wall. I only call the VAT on food and other, daily needed basic products too high. The tax on luxury goods and stocks and assets can't be high enough. For me, money is only a medium of exchange for things and services (as it is supposed to be), so I see no reason to count any person who has more of it better than a person who has less, and why it HAS TO have the ability to be stored at all. Introduce a high Torbin tax, a tax on assets, a high tax on all luxury goods, so that the rich lose the same part of their income (in percentage) to the community as the poor do. And the rich take their assets out of the country to avoid your taxes. Well, unless you use gov't force to prevent this. Then they still do it, they just do it faster. Imagine: here, a worker pays 1/2 to 2/3 of his salary for mortgage, then come the costs for insurances, electricity, his car (if they can afford one - else they have to pay the high prizes for train tickets), then comes food (with 19% tax on it which is day-light robbery),... Heh heh. Funny, you calling taxes too high. How else will you pay for all your precious social programs? and if they have kids the costs for school stuff or the fee for kindergarten or university... - after all these necessary payments they can think about saving some money, if there is any money left to save. So if the average worker has to give away the most part of his money, why not also the rich ones? On the contrary, they get benefits in tax reliefs, even gifts from the government when they give people what everyone should have a right to have: a job. \"A right to have.\" Heh. How many jobs are you providing, Thorin? How many is the UAW providing, Thorin? Total: zero. All your totalitarian crap up there has to be forced onto people because it sucks. Because it has to be forced, you need a wall. Hence the dilemma. That's even less totalitarian than what your loved capitalistic market-ruled system does to us every day.

But I know, in professional lending of money, no-one gets a cent without having to inform the person or institution lending them the money about name, address, income, assets, everything. But still I think that when I lend someone any amount of money, this person should pay the same amount back. And yes, banks exploit their customers , letting them pay back more than they borrow them. Interests ARE unjust. No, interest isn't unjust because some of those people won't pay back the loan. The lender takes that risk and charges interest and that return on their money is why they loan money to people that they otherwise would not. Did you miss this part? I already did. Well, not a person I never met before, but a person I met maybe 4,5 times before. The only things I knew of this guy was his nickname, and the place he used to hang around, and that his word to pay the money back after 2 weeks. I lent him the money, went to his place after two weeks, and got the money back with no problems. And do you think that would always be the case? Nope. But until now my common sense never left me. Especially not in matters of money. What if you had 1000 people borrowing money from you? This only would be the case if I won the next lottery. Even then I would - as I do now - exactly note how much, to whom, under which conditions, etc I lend money, and I would also know whom I could say: pay back as you can, and whom I had to tell: my rates are \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac\"xx\" a month, on the \"xx\". of each month. I always have an overview about whom I owe how much, and who owes me how much. I never met a private person who borrowed ME any money with interests. They wanted the same amount back I borrowed from them as I want the same amount from people I borrow money. If I lent you my bike I'd also want it back without added extras - in the same condition like I gave it to you. I have more problems to get paid back with my neighbor next door who sees me everyday. She still owes me \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac30 from her share of the August telephone bill. And frankly, if you even ask her to pay it back, you're being the locust you so decry. She has more \"need\" than you as she defines it, and therefore you're exploiting her. Nope. I know she has the exactly same income as I have, and the money she isn't paying back to me, is missing when I come to buy food or other needed things. I don't exploit her. She knew I have an ISDN connection with a few unused phone numbers, so asked me to join. I allowed it and connected her to one of these unused phone numbers. I pay the entire basic fee for the connection and the calls I make with the phone number I use, and let her pay for the calls she makes with the phone number she uses, exactly as shown on the calls list sent me by my provider. No exploitation there. | 1589) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: And yes, banks exploit their customers , letting them pay back more than they borrow them.

There were 15 or 20 major events stopped including airport bombings, plane hijackings, chemical attacks, dirty bomb attacks, hits on military bases, subway trains, Brooklyn Bridge demolition, etc etc. Are we supposed to take the governments word that they stopped these attacks? Do they have proof they stopped the attacks? Why didn't they stop other attacks? Shouldn't they be stopping all attacks? Why aren't they stopping all attacks? These people were all arrested and are in custody awaiting trial. All attacks in the U.S.A have been stopped so far since 2001. Why aren't we stopping all the attacks? What do you mean? Many attacks in England, Germany, Asia, Canada, etc have been stopped through international intelligence cooperation. They're stopping all the ones they can. Stopping all the one's they can? Does that mean there are one's out there they can't stop? Who's planning those and why aren't we trying to stop them? The government hasn't stopped any terrorist attacks on US soil because there haven't been any to stop. The attacks that they say they stopped were not attacks by terrorists but by terrorist wannabes. It the real terrorists that we have to watch out form but we can't find them. Oh, you can find the real terrorists, and you can easily find them in the USA. The PR division of one group is in Washington D.C., 20505; another group runs a R&D division in Fort Meade, Maryland; some other groups and persons are elsewhere. Some of these terrorist groups even have the word \"security\" in their official names.

The cash could be stored under his mattress if he chooses. Or he could put it in the bank. The bank will pay him interest that I assume he does not refuse.

In my opinion, no kind of work is worth less or more than the other one (besides extra-pay for overtime, shifts, danger, or working abroad). Example: a skilled construction worker at a building site works not harder than an unskilled construction worker, so why gets the unskilled worker less money by the hour + less benefits? I'd like to advocate an equal salary for each job, high enough that the worker can afford his family, house, car etc. while working even just 30 to 35 hrs a week. For me, money is only a medium of exchange for things and services (as it is supposed to be), so I see no reason to count any person who has more of it better than a person who has less, and why it HAS TO have the ability to be stored at all. Introduce a high Torbin tax, a tax on assets, a high tax on all luxury goods, so that the rich lose the same part of their income (in percentage) to the community as the poor do. Imagine: here, a worker pays 1/2 to 2/3 of his salary for mortgage, then come the costs for insurances, electricity, his car (if they can afford one - else they have to pay the high prizes for train tickets), then comes food (with 19% tax on it which is day-light robbery), and if they have kids the costs for school stuff or the fee for kindergarten or university... - after all these necessary payments they can think about saving some money, if there is any money left to save. So if the average worker has to give away the most part of his money, why not also the rich ones? On the contrary, they get benefits in tax reliefs, even gifts from the government when they give people what everyone should have a right to have: a job. | 1606) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 10 Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning, having found a picture of the REAL coffeeman :) Gibbs' Rule #23: Never mess with a Marine's coffee if you want to live.

Deseret Morning News editorial Published: September 10, 2007 Tuesday will mark six years since what so far has been the worst day of the 21st century for the United States. Given the number of lives lost and the general fear that spread after the terrorist attacks that day, Americans have a right to expect their government has by now made strides to protect them from a repeat of such a thing. However, a new report from the Government Accountability Office, generally considered to be a nonpolitical, credible auditing agency, says that may not have happened. In fact, the 320-page report says the United States is safer today than in 2001 but that the Department of Homeland Security, which was established after the attacks, can take no credit. Specifically, the auditors found that Homeland Security has done little to identify places where people illegally cross the border into the country. It hasn't done enough to remove criminal aliens. The outer perimeters of airports are not secure. Standards are lacking for nonaviation transportation. And, perhaps most alarming, it has not succeeded in coordinating a response plan to emergencies that would combine the efforts of all agencies, nor in forming strategies to counter chemical, biological or nuclear attacks. An Associated Press report said experts have warned it would take five years or more to make a department as large as Homeland Security effective. The problem, of course, is that Americans don't have the luxury of waiting while bureaucrats get their act together. Recent arrests in Britain and Germany are stark reminders that terrorists remain committed to attacking the West. The 9/11 attacks took years to develop and involved elaborate deceptions and training. People were stunned by the audacity of using jet airliners as missiles to attack key sites, something that seemed to come straight from a science fiction movie. There is little reason to believe terrorists have lost their initiative or that they are not currently hatching at least one similar plot. The good news, of course, is that the United States has remained free from further attacks since 9/11. If Homeland Security can't take credit for that, surely intelligence and law-enforcement agencies can. A number of plots have been thwarted and exposed. Perhaps many more have been foiled in secret. But the GAO has made it clear that much more can be done, and Americans should demand it be done quickly. \u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 2007 Deseret News Publishing Company | All rights reserved | 1622) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good morning, folks I'd like the strongest coffee possible, please :) | 1624) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Am Fenster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQc7opdsT28) auf Attempt of a translation: I saw in my dream tonight a house of glass I myself invisibly in there sat trapped Around me there was Above me, under me was And even I myself was And also my hair - glass And when i looked through the walls There were flowers in the grass But when I made just a step I pushed against glass Glass dream, when do I wake up Glass dream, How do I get out Glass dream, when do I wake up And in the night when moon light fell In my house of glass I felt that my shadow was away And I grew hate.

Many company owners don't do even that. They are managers according to the paper but spend their days on golf courses, on travels, or in restaurants, and just pay short visits at their offices to show they're there. And those locusts who own companies because they bought their stocks don't even care about visiting their achievement. For them it's just another investment object, like a piece of art or real estate, or jewelry or gold are just investment objects to them: a number on a list, a post on their account bill - nothing more, Most people here who run small businesses and hire people don't forget to work by themselves, while many people who run big businesses just invest instead of working by themselves, they let the money work for them... There is no 2 sides. It's only one: is the amount of money one owns reached by work, or by cheating & exploiting others. Thats IMHO not necessarily so. It's a good reason to work hard to be able to enjoy your money later. Actually that's what I am doing right now - I am going to live from what I have built up and want to have a lot of time to spent with my son (and the other children we plan to have). I see nothing wrong in this. But your arguments are probably directed towards the elites. And I can understand your ranting. But I see it rather the way \"let them do what they want as long as I have my freedom and are able to live my life the way I like to\". As stated above I am worried, though, that the system gets out of hand because the elites, getting too greedy, lost their rational sense and try to force dictatorship on all of us - again. It's so useless, illogical and fatal and will probably lead to another big catastrophe as WWII was. All people who love their freedom - socialists, capitalists and whatever have to be on guard. The borderline, as I see it, is between a) hiring people for a job you can't manage alone (as hired helpers, like @moving your household, or @running a small shop) or by yourself (being not qualified enough or being not capable to do it), and b) hiring people for a job you are capable to do or qualified enough to do by yourself but which you just find too inconvenient to leave your armchair for doing it by yourself. If I were in the situation to have a dream of mine fulfilled, all currencies would become [Freigeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freigeld). This also would be one step on the way to the right thing. Well, I have no problem with b - you might for example simply want/have to do something else. In my company I have learned to fill in almost every position in case it's absolutely needed, but the company won't prosper if I do so - because I have to care about tax declarations, wages, coordination, stock, hiring people, bills, whatever. If I don't do so the company will crash and people have no work and I loose not only my work but everything I own. Personally a system where work pays out and a man could afford a house, car, holiday trip and a woman @home (if she chooses so) and children is the way to go. A system where freedom and values are honored and people help each other freely. A system where politicians care for their citizens and not only for their own purse. I guess Soziale Marktwirtschaft in Germany came close to such a system, not much of it left, though.There it is what fits into point a) of my little list: you can't be 24/ available for your business, and your family - you need \"helpers\" to manage family and business and your personal needs - so you hire persons to get some relief yourself - nothing wrong with that. But I also know examples where the hirer does nothing at all. For instance: a couple with no kids, he has a position where he's away most of the day, but brings home his 15k per month - and his wife stays at home. She is so busy doing nothing, that she hires a woman to clean up the house, and also hires a gardener to look for the little garden. In my eyes, she exploits both of them - and she exploits also her husband, using his money to pay for jobs she is able and has the time to do by herself. You IMHO indeed need to think about freedom. Telling me if I am allowed to hire someone to do work I don't want to do myself or not is for example no freedom at all. In fact he AND myself would be pretty much angry about you because I need a few hours to spent with my family and he loves his job and wants to earn his living and YOU are denying him this freedom and income. And besides all social thoughts: work has always to pay off more then welfare. Plus abuse of welfare has to be minimal to make sure there is enough money for the ones in real need of help and their daily rate is high enough to live decently.sure venture capital do make startups possible, as soon as you have some capital yourself instead of debts. About capital: I don't have a problem with it since venture capital makes startups possible and such. But a problem is speculation.

Gesell founded his economic thoughts on the self-interest of people as a natural, healthy motive to act, which allows the individual to follow the satisfaction of his/her needs and to be productive. The economic system must do justice to this pre-condition, otherwise this system would undoubtedly fail. This is why, Gesell called his proposed economic system \"natural\". This stance put him in a clear opposition to Karl Marx, who called for a change in the social conditions. Taking selfishness into account, Gesell called for free, fair business competition with equal chances for all. This included the removal of all legal and inherited privileges. Everyone should rely only on his personal abilities in order to make a living. In the \"natural economic order\", which he aimed for, the most talented people would have the highest income, without forgery by interest and rent charge. The economic status of the less talented would also improve, because they wouldn't be forced to pay interest and rent charge. According to Gesell, this would lead to an equalization between the poor and the rich. Further, there would be more means available to help the poor, because the higher average income would mean that everyone would have enough money to spare what is necessary to help. | 1642) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) and more?](forum_thread.php?id=42250) 637133](forum_thread.php?id=42250&postid=637133)) Posted 9 |[Message 2007 by [thorin Post: good morningafternooneveningnight to all of you :) 14:23 early afternoon here, cool shivery 17\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0C, and some little clouds over here.

Unfortunately the system named socialism has been perverted by people like Mao Tse Tung, Stalin, or Ceaucescu, and has been corrupted by egocentric people who can't see the big picture by only focusing on their very own little self. Normally, the idea behind socialism (and as the higher level, communism) does not intend to use any force at all - except \"moral force\", or, the common opinion.

I think that the life of the mother is more important than that of her unborn child, especially if the mother already has other children. Other than that, most of the things the Pope says are nonsense, at least to me, because I simply don't understand what he's trying to say.

Is that what you meant to say? If so, any idea why? Their excuse is, that they had to pay too much money for the German re-union. If this is true, it's just another sign of the incompetent politicians here, who take money from everywhere else just to fill holes they digged themselves by supporting the big locusts too much. | 1663) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 8 Post: Hm.

That's the biggest chuckle I've had in a week. Really, you should be in charge of the Jokes threads. 'Like you I'm an advocate of freedom' ??? You want to be free to deny others their freedoms is what you are stating. Are you not capable of realizing this? You want to force people to part with their property. You want to FORCE people to associate with those they choose not to associate with. You want to FORCE people to work where you say they should work under terms you wish to FORCE upon them. You want to FORCE people to use their property as YOU see fit. What kind of freedom is this? Freedom from reality? All collectivists like you are mystics through and through. You and the religious zealots are cut from the same cloth. You can't abide what the nature of reality is on a fundamental level and you try to cheat it. You try to cheat it by denying man his nature and right to exist. The mystic does the same but through rain dances, astrological charts, channeling of spirits or Sunday Mass.The man's nature is not egocentric. It's charity. That's why people who show charity are called HUMAN. You're ideology has been the main source of suffering the world over since the dawn of man natural disasters included. Just remember that your collectivism is designed to benefit the incompetent and immoral at the expense of the able and good. Egoists don't need you. Rush has a good idea.

Living in Britain we do have one of the best healthcare systems in the world and we are proud and happy to pay for it. In fact most Britains would happily pay more taxes if they were sure it would go to the National Health service. We wouldn't have it any other way. During the Thatcher years the health service was underfunded and run down in an effort to convince people that a public health service was not viable. Attempts were made to privatise parts of it. Cleaning contracts were given to private companies and as a result hygiene standards plummeted as profit because the driving agenda rather than patients well being. Although I am not a fan of Tony Blair the health service has improved dramatically since more funding was put into it and more focus was put into primary care and sickness prevention. It is not perfect... but it has saved my life several times. ..and not left me financially destitute as a result. I know that my parents are going to always receive the medicines they need. I know that at any time day or night I can access a competent doctor and get the treatment I NEED..not the treatment I can pay for. Rush seems obsessed with the idea of 'choice'. What choice does someone have when they are dying of a heart attack? Do you think they care? They just want someone to help them and make them better. That is not a matter of choice. You can't decide that you aren't going to go to the doctor because you are a little short of cash that month..or that you are going to go an extra 50 miles to the better hospital.. choice is a chimera in this instance because when you need a doctor you need a doctor. If socialised medicine works and delivers a better service to the most people then what does it matter? I think the Americans need to stop being so scared of 'the red menace' and start being practical. People are suffering. Socialised medical care has been proven to work very successfully. I can assure you that should any government try to scrap the National Health Service they would find the rioters at the gates. I hope it were so.

Is Minister of the Interior Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble crazy? Daniel Neun | 2007-09-06 Berlin: It did not occur in the history of the Federal Republic so far yet that a Minister was explained because of its internal condition for incapable of holding office. Also the Basic Law planned no psychological examination of Ministers by independent specialists. Nevertheless this step should be discussed now in the public. Minister of the Interior Dr. Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble became obviously mad. Even at the press conference of yesterday it could be regarded that the tension of the last years was obviously too much. He acted erratic, got muddled, did not finish sentences, began new in the middle of them, often did not know where he was, seemed leached out and tired. Thereby he could clarify none of the urgent questions about the arrest of the presumed terror-suspicious, how these - although supervised since 2005 by the secret services - came to military exploders, could escape GSG 9 with the arrest first and shoot then at a Federal BKA officer with his own weapon. (1) Now however he shows continued loss of reality in service. Who now repeatedly demands a legal basis for on-line searches, thus housing openings and mobile phone espionage without court order (2), although the Basic Law literally reads: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The dwelling is inviolable\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, has to understand that this could mean only a constitutional amendment, and won't be done with the government party SPD as it was explained to him several times. The argument, terrorists would use the Internet more strongly, is confused. One could say as well, terrorists would fall back to personal discussion and forbid this then. Whether it is telephones, letters, e-mails, hand signs, movies or music-mp3s, anywhere where humans communicate with each another there could be a hidden message of terrorists making dark plans. Such is called a control mania and paranoia. Furthermore it is no longer logical, when the Minister of the Interior of this country sits there and says, the danger by the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"international terrorism\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 is comprehensible \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"real\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, a danger would exist however not, but \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"we also must not let us drive crazy\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. (1) The Plural, which Minister of the Interior Dr.Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble uses here, seems likewise more than absurd. When there are further persons in the executive, who demand an extension of their competences and authority, as for instance that reasonable known \"adopted son\" of Edmund Stoiber, the former Minister of the Interior G\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcnter Beckstein, or when the competitor of the largest police union Union of Police, the DPolG, runs their member advertisement with the help of this affair publicly on (1), then these are the edge features of an affair, which meanwhile damages the reputation of this republic. It must being able to require high-ranking executive officials such as Ministers that they not constantly endanger the internal security of the citizens concerning their liberty and rights, particularly if it were actually their task to retain which protects the citizens - and that is not the police, military, secret services, Minister and chancellor (inside) but the rule and value order \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Basic Law\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, of which these Herrschaften get their instructions. The SPD chairman Kurt Beck said it clearly - first the judgement of the highest instance of the 3.Gewalt in the state is waited for. In 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court decides on the constitutionality of inland espionage without court order, the so-called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"on-line search\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. The FDP interior expert Gerhart Baum raised constitutional challenge against on-line searches taking place in North-Rhine/Westphalia in the framework from simple laws, it will also decided about them already soon. Baum has terminated unconstitutional activities of the executive - which were covered by unconstitutional resolutions of the parliament - several times (3). With complaints before the Federal Constitutional Court he not only tilted the substantial inland espionage in the context of in such a way called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"large wire-tapping\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2, but also the permission for killing innocent by the German military in the context of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"air safety law\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 for shooting passenger planes. This permission had given the German parliament and the Merkel executive to the military. Only the condition and its court protected us, the citizens, against arbitrary, national murder for the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"terror defense\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2. By the way, illegal - or worse: unconstitutional - inland espionage by the military secret service NSA and their cover-up had cost the US Minister of Justice Alberto Gonzales his office recently. The avowed friend and partner of the Merkel government, US vice-president Dick Cheney, had to out-talk himself recently in its emergency even not to be part of the US Government in order to refuse publication about espionage documents to the committees of inquiry of congress of US. (4) The question about the 2.Gewalt, the executive, which is hiving off, should actually employ the legislator parliament also in Germany for long. At least however the state of health of a Minister of the Interior, who confuses realities constantly, speaks confused speeches, and then says \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 should not let us make crazy. Also we should be careful regarding still some other persons, who for years have possessed of military material and been under control of the secret services, but still freely to run around. They could serve as chessmen of even these military, secret services and their superior Ministers for the enforcement of further authority. I hope you can understand it now.

Well, then, why isn't the UAW building and selling their own cars? You have plenty of excuses on why the UAW can't seem to build cars, yet every car manufacturer in the world manages to get past your silly excuses and build and sell cars every day. So there is no reason the UAW couldn't do the same. Yet they don't... No one is forced to work for GM, or anywhere else.

As I repeatedly stated, it's not a matter of force to reach a better system, it's a matter of social education.

It is this meaning of exploitation which is discussed below. In political economy, economics, and sociology, exploitation involves a persistent social relationship in which certain persons are being mistreated or unfairly used for the benefit of others. This corresponds to one ethical conception of exploitation, that is, the treatment of human beings as mere means to an end \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac or as mere \"objects\". In different terms, \"exploitation\" refers to the use of people as a resource, with little or no consideration of their well-being. This can take the following basic forms: * taking something off a person or group that rightfully belongs to them * short-changing people in trade * directly or indirectly forcing somebody to work for you * using somebody against his will, or without his consent or knowledge * imposing an arbitrary differential treatment of people to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others (as in ascriptive discrimination) Most often, the word exploitation is used to refer to economic exploitation; that is, the act of using another person's labor without offering them an adequate compensation. colonialism - exploitation by a stronger country of weaker one; the use of the weaker country's resources to strengthen and enrich the stronger country And: The system I advocate has killed no-one.

Now, everybody is jumping at shadows. Why? I can't answer that. But while yes many would not have 'worried' about it once upon I time, had I left it by mistake somewhere, someone then handed it in and they then discovered a gas cylinder I could have been charged/fined/slapped on the wrist for not being responsible enough/lack of care because of the perceived danger/hazard/safety risk should something happen. I do not know if this is the same in Germany, but in Aus you leave something 'dangerous' around you can be held responsible. This was before the war on terror stuff and new anti-terror laws. Today you probably get in more trouble. As I have said at least twice before (but it seems you do not understand me saying this) I am not agreeing or disagreeing on whether this is a terrorist act/potential terrorist act or a honest mistake or a setup. All I am saying that it is not safe for a gas/fuel cylinder to be left lying around exposed. There are many ways that it could turn into an accident or disaster etc through deliberate/malicious or accidental actions. After all, why are you taught not to leave household cleaners or medication within reach of children. Because they (the objects) pose a danger. Especially if the person near them does not recognize the danger. This little gas cylinder was not exposed. It was stuffed deep in that misplaced backpack. I mean, what size you can carry in a backpack? Must be more of a cartridge size. Heck, When I was in the States in the 90's I had an [Esbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbit) cooker with me without getting into trouble: Solid fuel tablets! | 1754) |[Message 6 Sep 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I can understand that there is a danger about gas in the 40- 50\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0C hot days of an Australian summer, but not at the 25\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0C warm days of an average German summer. 2) a suitcase containing a gas bottle for camping, a gallon of fuel, and some personal stuff (Dortmund); 3) a bagpack, containing a camping size propane gas cylinder, a bottle of benzene lighter fuel, a clock-watch, and some personal stuff supposed to be used for camping (Koblenz)...

Note the phrase \"financed by a payroll tax on current workers' wages\". It's not a voluntary program, it's mandatory. All for the greater good of the People. That's socialism. Well, that how you imagine socialism. Socialism is, according to Wikipedia, \"a socio-economic system in which property and the distribution of wealth are subject to control by the community for the purposes of increasing social and economic equality and cooperation.

Better to worry about the homefront than to worry about what's happening across the channel. You don't need to form a union of nations under one currency to trade back and forth. Being part of the EU is completely different to being the centre of the British Empire (which they still are, only somewhat less committed). The EU is a completely political institution with no land and resources other than that of its constituent members. It provides uniformity of policy and regulation to enable efficient trade between members. Not to mention the benefits that come from being part of a larger community.

Normally, this would have been treated as attempted arson. The next day, July 31, police raided 4 houses in Berlin and arrested a forth person, claiming he was connected to the other 3. When they were brought to the investigation judge(?), he decided to accuse them not for arson, but for a terrorist act and membership in a terroristic organization, \"though there is no discoveries by the police, this doesn't oppose the assumption of a suspect of a membership in a terroristic organization, ...as it arises from the scripts of the \"militant group (mg)\" this complies exactly to the requirements this organization lays on their members\". And the 4th person who was arrested later was added to the same accusation, because \"An essay of him contain phrases which are also used in texts by the \"militant group\"\", and \"... as a graduated political scientist he is intellectually able to write the rather sophisticated texts of the \"mg\", and as an employee of a research center he has access to libraries which he can use to do the research needed for writing the texts for the \"mg\" [...]Furthermore it speaks for a membership in the \"militant group\" that in an article written in June 2005 he reported about a failed attack by the terrorist group \"RZ\" in 1972, and the same attack has been a topic in a text of the \"mg\" in spring 2005\". *** So if you attempt something criminal, you have to care whether or not your deeds \"meet the requirements of a terroristic organization\". And if you're an intellectual person who only knows such \"wannabe criminals\", you even have to care whether or not your essays and articles are containing phrases used by terrorists!

IMHO the problem in Germany is that you can't even address serious issues because you are instantly labeled a Nazi. It's a vicious circle: many people are fed up because problems with immigration and lack of integration are not addressed. This creates tension and results in violence - from my experience the violence of immigrant gangs simply don't make it into the news, which creates even more anger. When then violence against immigrants takes place the media is full of it and the journalists ride on a wave of political education.

That's #1 Resident aliens can of course apply for citizenship after several years of living and working here (and all permanent guest workers are what you call resident aliens), but no-one of the bureaucrats tells them that they have this right: they have to inform themselves (being hindered by the clerks), when, where and under which circumstances they can apply. That's #2 Many of these \"resident aliens\" are just so sick of their current bureaucratic fights, that they just don't want to struggle even more just for the line \"Citizenship: German\".

Der Zugriff [translation] Attacks in Germany impeded German security officers arrested three terror suspects last afternoon, defeating \"massive bomb attacks\" by islamic terrorists in Germany according to the words of Federal General attorney Monika Harms. The arrested were according to Harms, two Germans and a Turk who belong to a German cell of the \"Islamic Djihad Union\". This organization stands close to Al Kaida. ... According to Harms the planned attacks were the one of the heaviest threats in Germany by the international terrorism. Potential targets had been American facilities, as well as discotheques, pubs, airports and other places frequently visited by US citizens. But Harms emphasised that there was never a danger for the German people because the security officers had been informed about the activities of the supposed terrorists in good time. The suspected have been watched for months. They had planned to build car bombs and bring them to explosion in front of the facilities. At house round-ups in 30 objects in Germany, 30 barrels with in total 730 kg of hydrogen peroxide solution were secured in a holiday house in the Sauerland. According to Harms, the effect of this explosive would have been the effect of 550 kg of TNT. BKA president J\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6rg Ziercke added,the amount found had been enough \"to construct blasting compositions with a higher power than used at the attacks in London or Madrid\". The access would have happened because the suspected had started to build the bombs yesterday. Ziercke told of a police operation never happened in this dimension in the history of the BKA. Almost 300 officers would have been in the field day and night for over six month. Even despite these arrests there were no reason to signal all clear. It has been shown that Germany were not only rest area but also target for the international terrorism.

Rush has you by the short hairs on the 'If GM can, why can't the UAW' argument. This is a great illustration of the fact that 'labor' is basically worthless without 'capital'... You know... All those pesky shareholders that you seem to hold in contempt. Nowadays, it not only 'takes money to make money', it 'takes money to make ANYTHING of any value whatsoever'. In fact, nothing is stopping the membership of the UAW from starting their own automobile except a lack of desire for them to do so. Of course, they would have to raise some capital to buy/build/rent a factory, hire engineers to design their product line, secure adaquate raw materials, secure a dealer network, etc. etc. etc. But, with an organization the size of the UAW union, that wouldn't be much of a problem. A number of years ago, a major US airline was in financial trouble. They were losing money left and right, primarily due to high wages/salaries to their unionized workers and high fuel costs. Instead of letting that airline go totally bankrupt and shut down, the employees of that airline, in cooperation with their unions BOUGHT the airline. Of course, once that happened, they realized that they all had to take pay cuts, but at least they all still had jobs. As far as I know, that airline is still in business, but still has money problems. Perhaps in this fictional scenario, the UAW might find its best interests served by buying some factories from the financially struggling US auto companies (GM and Ford). I bought a new car earlier this year, and I wish that I could have 'bought American', but their products were just way out of my price range. If the UAW could buy a few factories, I am sure that they could make a good go of it if they could build a car that was inexpensive yet fuel efficient and reliable. However, knowing Union politics like I do, I am not holding my breath waiting on it. Wow, buying an entire airline - if that's not risky business, what else? Well when I see what I've read meanwhile about US unions, and where the German unions have developed to since 1989, I see no real chance that this will ever happen.

Because GM is involved in enough different business that one car factory more or less doesn't cause them any real damage.

But that's interesting that you say: \"paying the workers even usual wages could be more than the Union can bear.\" Note the irony there? It's OK that they UAW may decide that the \"usual wages\" are more than the union could bear, but it isn't OK that GM would decide the exact same thing. Could it be that those workers aren't worth such wages? That the amount of work they do isn't enough to be paid that amount? Hey, do you think that when GM was founded, a hundred years ago or so, that a billion dollars was peanuts to them then? Or did they do what the UAW should be doing, start small and keep building cars? I mean, you keep saying that the workers don't need managers, or stockholders, or the market, but you keep coming up with excuses why the UAW can't do what GM does as a matter of routine, every single day. If those worthless managers, shareholders, and stockbrokers can do it, shouldn't those laborers you seem to love be able to as well? Some risk a fortune, some do not. Some put all their money on the BlackJack table, some don't. I m one of them who only invest if I see low risk. And you wanted me to tell why I think they don't open a business by themselves. I just couldn't imagine that unionists as far as I know them (most of them who I know are very careful with money) ever would start business without a very intensive risk assessment. Otherwise, as I read now, the UAW has a joint venture with GM, \"dedicated to the quality of life needs of employees in 1985. The UAW-GM Center for Human Resources in Detroit is dedicated to providing GM salaried employees and GM UAW members programs and services related to medical care, diversity issues, education, training and tuition assistance, as well as programs related to work and family concerns, in addition to the traditional union-employer health and safety partnership.\" (Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors#Social_policies)) So why should they risk all that and start a competitor factory by themselves?

My experience of the local British trains are on par with the physical condition of the trains in third world countries...filthy and of poor maintenance. Well, when I compare the Deutsche Bahn (the German Railways) now to before it was privatized, the service hasn't become any better. On the contrary, it's less personal service now because they replaced ticket booths with ticket machines & outsourced several customer services, and the trains are also maintained less often due to less maintenance personnel, they closed down connections with the excuse of being not - but the ticket prizes raised to ridiculous. They cost 2 to 2.5 times more now than before the privatization due to the annual prize raising, while the wages of the employees have raised only by 0.5% a year, hardly following the overall inflations. But: two months ago, the railways employees went on strike on a weekend, to reach 3% higher wages.

These are either invasions or acts of pure provocation, nothing else. You really believe what your media say, do you? I would ask the same for your media. I'm sure the answer is the same. Otherwise, I say that I read media from across the globe (all praise the internet) and gather what sense that I can. What have the US military to do in Bangladesh, Africa, Middle East, Middle America, South East Asia? What has the US military to do in South Europe (Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania)? What has the US military to do in any other country of the world except when it comes to NATO maneuvers? What are they up to? Is it for destabilization? Demoralization? Monetary interests? Industrial interests? Political interests like the fear of the bad bad Commie? Or is it just bullying like: \"Look how mighty we are, we can do whatever we want, wherever and whenever we want. If you challenge this our operation it'll become serious for you.\"? You need no military for police work. You need no military for humanitarian work. The only thing military is \"needed\" for is killing or at least threatening to kill people wearing the \"wrong\" uniform. My main point was you lumping together a mish mash of operations (good or bad) into a common group to seemingly bolster your standing on the evils of American Big Oil and politics. \"You need no military for humanitarian work.\" Tell that to the people helped in Bangladesh. Or is this biased media that I linked to and we actually went there to make sure we have a continued source of cheap shirts? Well, this help could have been provided by civilian people/organizations, too. Adequate emergency supplies existed either in government storage houses, called \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Go Downs,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 or stored and owned by nongovernmental organizations (NGO) such as Cooperative American Relief Everywhere (CARE) and the Red Crescent. The GOB, however, was hindered by the lack of cooperation from the NGO, which remembered martial law and were wary of the new regime. Further, the bureaucrats that controlled the grain in the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Go Downs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 were similarly reluctant to hand over control to other agencies.Of course: Who really wants the evil ones to take over control? The US Navy should have supported the NGO's at helping these people, or be there as civilian persons to help, not as easily recognizable military troops. I have nothing against soldiers helping others - but they should do this as civilians, not in form of a military operation demonstrating the US super power.

You should see one of mine. Day-glo yellow, blue, green, and pink all over the place. Just like mine :) The only reason why my King James Bible is not as colored as my German Luther Bible or my German Einheits\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcbersetzung is that I read more often in the last one (naturally). Only when I prepare for a special topic, I use the advantages of all three of them: The huge appendix of the King James Bible, the better reading in the Einheits\u00c3\u00c5\"bersetzung, and the better spiritual understanding through the Luther Bible. :). Each copy of my Holy scriptures is used for study. My German Scriptures are even the 2nd copies I use, my first ones became too worn-out during the first decade after my baptism. That either tells something about the poorly-made editions, or how often I studied in them :) To me, the message is more important than the paper it is written on. That's why I use my copies of the Scriptures to study in them quite frequently, and I attached tabs to find the single parts easier, I underlined, highlighted, even footnoted verses I found important or interesting. To me, my copy of the Bible is not a sacred thing. It's the message in there which is holy, not the hardcopy of it. But I admit, my copy of the Q'ran, and of the Bagavat-gita, and of several other Scriptures of non-Christian beliefs are also full of pencil underlinings and remarks. I studied in many different of them on my spiritual Quest before I decided to stay with the Bible. In my parent's house I should still have all of them in a shelf. All but three: the only books I ever threw away after having read them: Hubbart's Bible\".

Absolutely wrong. War, being the worst of all violence, is only an option either of people who are too greedy and corrupt that they don't care about lives and healths of others, or of people who have no clue how to communicate (which is not really wise and is a sign that they are in positions they definitely don't fit into), or of people who see no possibility anymore to find another, more peaceful solution. History has told ME that mostly wars have been started and kept running by the first and second ones. The only situation where I tolerate violence is in form of immediate self-defense, when being attacked personally. But when some single persons attack a country, the most reasonable answer would be to punish these persons (if they're dead already, fine with that) instead of finding a scapegoat country to start war. Did you try diplomacy with the bullies when you were going to school? How did it turn out, if you did? I tried, and I even used \"service boycotts\" and other non-violent measures. I had had enough violence at home, I didn't really need that also in school. They knew I was among the smartest in class, and they quickly learned: When I was bullied or beaten or when I saw that they beat or bullied younger ones, the bully or beater got no help from me even despite the teachers' orders to help them who had worse notes, no matter what violence I had to suffer as result. I rather ate my own homework than let one of the beaters and bullies copy it. And I rather got trouble for not obeying the teachers' instructions to help one of those who were bullies and beaters. I reacted like: \"You don't leave me (or them) in peace? So I will leave you in peace, see who helps you now.\" Or I said: \"You left them (or me)in peace, now I can help you again\". I got my punishments for this, from all sides (trouble @home, beat-ups by the students I didn't help, trouble from the teachers who ordered to help the \"weaker\"), but they finally learned to respect me. It took me some years though, to teach them this lesson. Not always the stronger or the more violent is the winner. Because of my stubbornness against these people, because I rather accepted bad consequences for me than helping those who didn't want to change their bad behavior, I finished my school only with a \"B\" note.

War, being the worst of all violence, is only an option either of people who are too greedy and corrupt that they don't care about lives and healths of others, or of people who have no clue how to communicate (which is not really wise and is a sign that they are in positions they definitely don't fit into), or of people who see no possibility anymore to find another, more peaceful solution. History has told ME that mostly wars have been started and kept running by the first and second ones. The only situation where I tolerate violence is in form of immediate self-defense, when being attacked personally. But when some single persons attack a country, the most reasonable answer would be to punish these persons (if they're dead already, fine with that) instead of finding a scapegoat country to start war. | 1852) |[Message 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: EEK!!!

Okay John, I'm no math wizard either but it's got to start with the properties of adding the same 3 digits to the first three. Let's consider the number \"100\" Adding the 100 to the hundred gives you 100100 (that's 1001 x 100) If the number were 200, it'd be 200200 (that's also 1001 x 200) In fact (and I tried a few different numbers) the result of repeating the numbers after each other is the same as multiplying the original number by 1001. I'm too lazy to go through the rest of it, but I'm sure it has to do with the special properties of the number 1001. If you divide the number 1001 by 13 the result is...surprise, surprise...7. And that's why the orignal number appears when you finally divide by 7. The reason you can't cheat by doing it in one step, is because there are two seperate multipliers involved. The first is the 1001 multiplier. The next two steps are based on the property of 1001 (1001 = 13 x 7) What do you think of that? :) you forgot the 11. 7 x 11 x 13 = 1001. 1001 : 13 = 77. 77 : 11 = 7. | 1873) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 1 Sep 2007 by [thorin Post: Winning again Aw c'mon... | Post: Consider it done!

According to a statement issued by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the law, which goes into effect next month and strictly stipulates the procedures by which one is to reincarnate, is \"an important move to institutionalize management of reincarnation.\" But beyond the irony lies China's true motive: to cut off the influence of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual and political leader, and to quell the region's Buddhist religious establishment more than 50 years after China invaded the small Himalayan country. By barring any Buddhist monk living outside China from seeking reincarnation, the law effectively gives Chinese authorities the power to choose the next Dalai Lama, whose soul, by tradition, is reborn as a new human to continue the work of relieving suffering. At 72, the Dalai Lama, who has lived in India since 1959, is beginning to plan his succession, saying that he refuses to be reborn in Tibet so long as it's under Chinese control. Assuming he's able to master the feat of controlling his rebirth, as Dalai Lamas supposedly have for the last 600 years, the situation is shaping up in which there could be two Dalai Lamas: one picked by the Chinese government, the other by Buddhist monks. \"It will be a very hot issue,\" says Paul Harrison, a Buddhism scholar at Stanford. \"The Dalai Lama has been the prime symbol of unity and national identity in Tibet, and so it's quite likely the battle for his incarnation will be a lot more important than the others.\" So where in the world will the next Dalai Lama be born? Harrison and other Buddhism scholars agree that it will likely be from within the 130,000 Tibetan exiles spread throughout India, Europe and North America. With an estimated 8,000 Tibetans living in the United States, could the next Dalai Lama be American-born? \"You'll have to ask him,\" says Harrison. If so, he'll likely be welcomed into a culture that has increasingly embraced reincarnation over the years. According to a 2005 Gallup poll, 20 percent of all U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all born-again Christians, embrace it as their favored end-of-life view. A non-Tibetan Dalai Lama, experts say, is probably out of the question. | 1921) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : time forward](forum_thread.php?id=41997) Posted 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Oh that's sooo old news.

For a Lefty-Lib to admit that a person on the right just might actually be right would be enough to make their mush-minds explode. Its too bad that the Lefty-Lib is FAR more dangerous than religious fundamentalists. The odds that the Lefty-Libs will get the government to enact yet another socialist program and fund it by tax-rapeing your wallet are MUCH higher than the odds that a religious fundamentalist will turn terrorist and blow you to bits with their explosive wardrobe. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't even TRY to de-program and un-brainwash them. What's wrong with a more HUMAN society? A society where humans count more than the money they own? Where the wealth of the normal Mr.& Mrs. Average is more important than the wealth of a few locusts? Where employees aren't exploited? Where the employees don't have to pay for their own security? Where jobs are put up there where the people are, instead of people being forced to move across the entire country to find a job? I must admit, I don't exactly know what you mean with \"Lefty-Lib\". I know left-wings, and I know liberals, and both are entirely different political and economical directions. To throw them both into one basket shows me how right-wing you are. | 1932) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I'm afraid the leaves are most definitely not maple leaves.

And even the unions could get a place to rise a new plant, and get the machines to build cars: the former employers of the car workers would give false statements that these cars were built by industrial espionage, using the \"insider information\" of their former employees. And they will get away with these false accusations because they have more and better lawyers. [quote]I've heard a LOT of complaining that it is not possible to live and support a family on a single minimum-wage job. Guess what? That is CORRECT. The 'minimum wage' was never intended to be anything more than a short-term, entry-level, training wage. It is not SUPPOSED to be possible. And this doesn't make you think? The minimum level should be high enough that it's worth working: that the workers can begin to earn their living even if they can't change the job. The minimum wage WAS intended to give young people without work experience or training a way to gain some work experience and training for a few months so that they qualify for a higher paying job. Heck, even burger-flippers at the local burger joint START at about $2.15/hr more than minimum wage. This only shows me how LOW the minimum wage level must be. Again: According to the U.S. numbers in 2004: \"According to Current Population Survey estimates for 2004, some 73.9 million American workers were paid at hourly rates, representing 59.8 percent of all wage and salary workers.1 Of those paid by the hour, 520,000 were reported as earning exactly $5.15, the prevailing Federal minimum wage, and another 1.5 million were reported earning wages below the minimum.2 Together, these 2.0 million workers with wages at or below the minimum made up 2.7 percent of all hourly-paid workers.\" Get that? Those \"tariffs\" meant nothing to 97.3 percent of hourly workers because they WERE PAID MORE THAN THE MINIMUM. In other words, the market price was higher than the minimum wage. This is why big eeeevil Walmart supports a higher minimum wage; they already pay far more than the minimum wage and forcing it higher drives costs up for smaller businesses that can't afford it. Eek! Oh that pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor employer! Who does all the work? The employer? WTF! They pay to get the job done that they don't have to do it them selves, that they don't have to make their exploiter-hands dirty. Well, they want a job done? Then they better pay fairly! If a worker 'earns' $18.00/hrs he should get paid AT LEAST $8.00/hrs. I agree the employer need some money to re-invest, to pay pay-roll taxes, etc pp... BUT: Does the profit they make of the business has to be hundred or even thousand times the salary they pay their workers who need second or third jobs to earn their living? NEVER! Does that mean the first thing employters think of when cutting costs have to be salaries? NEVER! They want the job done, they get the job done by their employees who leave their families to give their power and time, sometimes even their health to the company - Well, the employers just OWE their employees enough money to pay their bills and support their families. One more time: We've had this discussion before and you didn't respond, but I'll put it here too. An example: There are plenty of empty auto factories. If those workers don't need the managers, or the shareholders, or the exchange, why aren't they running those plants themselves? Why doesn't the United Auto Workers Union and the AFL-CIO, instead of just bitching about their rapidly declining numbers, just build and sell cars themselves? What are they waiting for? There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of former members that could be building cars. Why aren't they? Why doesn't the UAW just stop bitching and hire all of those guys and pay them more than they were demanding from GM? I mean, nothing is stopping them now, all the managers, shareholders, and brokers are out of the way, so it should be easy, right? The big companies do everything to make such things like union-owned factories never become true.

On topic: I can't speak for other large cities, but Dallas, Tx seems to be somewhat quiet of late re: racist incidents. The city's population is majority-minority, and so is the police force. The last one I heard about was years ago, when Mr. John Wiley \"King\" Price (one of the Dallas County Commissioners) was staging a protest. I think it was at one of the local TV stations, where \"King\" Price was leading a protest over the station not employing enough African-Americans nor showing enough shows featuring African-Americans. I can't be sure, because \"King\" Price held several protests in succession back then, at that TV station, City Hall, and the local County (charity-case) Hospital (Parkland Hospital). Anyway, \"King\" Price's protest was partially blocking the street, and when a woman attempted to get by in her car (in a peaceful, non-threatening way), \"King\" Price hopped up on the hood of her car and vandalized it, ripping off the car's windshield wipers. Why did he, a supposedly responsible Government Official, do this? The woman wasn't African-American. If she had been, they would have let her pass. This senseless act of racially-motivated violence helped to tone down \"King\" Price's high popularity, although he remains in office. Now, there is still some racial tension in Dallas, but it is between the African-American and Hispanic communities, as the Hispanics have supplanted the African-Americans as the largest minority group in Dallas. Selection of the Superintendent of Dallas ISD tends to be quite lively. But the Dallas PD is very racially balanced, and I can't recall any 'racist incident' involving them in quite a number of years. There may have been a few, but if so they didn't receive wide press coverage. I never said, that racism comes only from the white men. The other ones can be racist too. Heck, there are [Nazis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazi#Neo-Nazi_organizations) & [racists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_by_country) all over the world, in all colors!

I'm an absolute supporter of minimum wages - in the meaning of: there has to be paid at least a minimum which lets the employee afford their needs working 40hrs a week. I met many people in the States having one job 8hrs a day 5 days a week to afford their rent and the car necessary to get to their jobs, and another job 6 hrs a day to earn the needs for their family. Ain't this slavery? No. The U.S. has a middle class that dwarfs both the poor and the rich. You call it market, I call it exploitation. Tariffs are the only way to have at least a certain amount of justice for the workers. And every company should be bound to them. That's why I support tariffs which have the same power as laws: tariffs every employer has to accept. Tariffs which say: same wages for the same work, which say people who are equally qualified and have an equal position have to be paid equally! And of course I also support sympathy strike actions - and even the idea of an General Strike to reach this goal. Here in Germany, some companies offer temporary worker jobs in areas of high unemployment with 3, 4 Euro an hour knowing that's below the minimum tariffs, but also knowing that ppl take every job to get out of welfare. Yep, more evidence that there is always a market, regardless of what you think. What? You support such exploitation? Here the officially lowest salary for a temporary worker (according to tariff) is 7 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac per hour which hardly can be called an appropriate salary. And many employers, especially security companies, some retailers, and many gastronomy companies expect their employees to work a lot over-time - officially to give them more time-off or holidays, but in fact it's unpaid if you can't take this time-off until March of the next year. A buddy of mine had worked 156 hrs of over-time (= more than one month) in 2006, when he insisted to take his time-off in February to have his afforded benefit of the hours he worked - and the result was: he was fired.

If foreign HGV drivers come into the United Kingdom they should be able to read road signs and their meaning. After all, HGV drivers are expected to do the same when driving in Europe. Regarding the use of SatNavs which may point a driver down a narrow lane: if the lane gets narrow and gets narrower doesn't that tell the driver something? We have a dead-end road leading to bridleways in our village which SatNavs told drivers are away to get across to the main roads like the A1. After 2 miles the road ends in a choice of three directions all of which are signs \"unsuitable for motors\". I take great delight in watching 44 tonne articulated HGV having to reverse 2 miles down a narrow country lane, with several extremely tight bends, because they've been stupid. I can only assume that the adage that drivers have had to rely on SatNavs is -- we have a mapping system that tells us where to go, so we don't have to think! friend of mine relied on her GPS, that told her the wrong turn-off, and she stood wrong way in a one-way-road... An ex- colleague of mine relied on the vocal command \"after xx meters turn right\" - he listened to that thing and landed in a hole, 25 meters before the actual turn-off has been. As long as this satellite navigation system is not as accurate as I with common sense, a compass and a map, I will not rely on that modern thing. | 1972) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [NORTH AMERICAN [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: \"Hey man, could I bum a couple of your NADs?\" LOL Sorry man, I just deposited what I had in a Virtual Automatic Government Investment No-risk Account.

Here, in exalted and unforgettable phrases, Jefferson expressed the convictions in the minds and hearts of the American people. The political philosophy of the Declaration was not new; its ideals of individual liberty had already been expressed by John Locke and the Continental philosophers. What Jefferson did was to summarize this philosophy in \"self-evident truths\" and set forth a list of grievances against the King in order to justify before the world the breaking of ties between the colonies and the mother country.

How, exactly, is this a bad thing? I thought the USA was supposed to work together, diplomatically, with the other nations of the world. Why does the 'left' have their undergarmets twisted about this? One, and only one, reason: they are not the ones in the White House. In other words, politics. After all, the Democrats blocked and stalled NAFTA... until Clinton got into the White House. Then all of a sudden they became for it. This stuff is the same. They object to it only because its Dubya in the White House. Just wait and see... When a Democrat gets into the White House in '08, this stuff will suddenly become the greatest thing since sliced bread according to the lefty-libs. That's the same here in Germany: topics are stalled or blocked just because the other party came up with them, and later they are the best and newest themes...

Here in Germany there is an equal percentage (I think it's anywhere between 12 and 14% of the monthly salary) to be paid by both the employer and the employee - so it doesn't matter whether the employee is older or younger. Age only matters at private health care insurance premiums... Wow, another GLARING error, that's a surprise, huh? Say there's an 18 year-old who will be earning $10K, that 14% is $1400. Say there's a 60 year-old that will be earning $100K, that 14% is $14,000. Exactly 10 times higher--the employer will be paying $12,600 more. So it seems that in reality it DOES matter whether the employee is older or younger. That difference is more than the kid's entire salary. Also NOPE. Many employers search for a compromise between expertise and low salary. I think it's just that the younger ones can be more \"flexible\", can work more hours a week, they easily can be exploited. The older ones on the other side don't only have their work experience, they also know which work belongs to their job, which rights do they have and which duties, what is their work really worth... they even can teach their bosses about their job, duties and rights. They can't be exploited so easily. That's why none of those greedy employers wants them around. Maybe some of the stupid ones are that way. The smart ones will jump at the chance for the expertise.

The US becoming a dictatorship, Russia and China more or less already are. Can't imagine, that the citizens of the nordic countries or Germany let themselves brainwash to give up their freedom the same way it happens in the US right now. But that leaves only a few countries vs the rest of a dictatorship world. To be honest I am not even surprised the elites use propaganda to control the masses. It probably makes you feel pretty superior over the \"average dumbass\". And also quite a lot of people simply don't care what's going on around them. The only problem is that over time the elites seem to get too greedy, strive for total control and concentration of wealth and power in the hand of only a few. That results in the life standard of the non-elite drastically declining with negative effects on social stability and economy. In the end it might lead to uprisings, wars, terrorism, recession and instead of enjoying their wealth they might risk it all. Pretty dumb for such intelligent people, don't ask me why they do it. This entire system is dumb, based on stupid greed and envy. | 2013) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 27 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning, again :) Yes I am.

The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together. [...] During the long lane of the history yet to be written, America knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That table, though scarred by many past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield. Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn how to compose differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp and apparent, I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war, as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years, I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight. [...] To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America's prayerful and continuing aspiration: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings. Those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; and that the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth; and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love. | 2026) |[Message 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Miss Teen USA 2007 - South Carolina answers a question: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww) Huh?

The RAF Typhoon from Number XI Squadron followed a Russian Bear-H aircraft over the North Atlantic Ocean last Friday August 17. The incident occurred on the same day Russian President Vladimir Putin placed strategic bombers back on long-range patrol for the first time since the Soviet breakup. Typhoon F2s took on their first operational duties in June, when they assumed the Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) responsibility for UK and NATO air defence. Typhoons, the RAF\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s newest fast jet aircraft, currently cover the UK's QRA commitment together with Tornado F3 aircraft. An obviously fake photo.

When you let the market rule on everything (like it seems to be now) you have the rule: \"The more you desire for something, the more you have to pay for it.\" No matter if you can afford it. I know it's OT... But if I could change the system, I simply would say: all medicals and all medical treatment have to be \"off the market\", with no chance to raise fees nor prices on a whim. Which is pure idiocy. It's not possible to take anything \"off the market,\" ever because everything is always part of the market and regulations just drive the costs up. That's like when you offer food to the starving and say: those who bid the most money get this food! As I often pointed out, the Wall has absolutely nothing to do with it. In opposite I would strictly cut medicine prices down (and if it were by subventions) and suggest a nation-wide real social insurance system, with no allowance to treat \"private\" patients otherwise than Social insurance patients. One patient is as needy as the other one, and no person should be treated worse only because the social insurance pays their medical treatment bill. (Emphasis added.) These types of silly comments are substantial evidence of the fact that you truly don't understand why they had to build that wall. You not only want to \"help\" (heh) the poor, you actually want to take personal choices away from everyone else in the process, based solely on what you think is best. That is force, and that's why you need guns, a wall, and why the machine gun nests have to point inwards.Wrong. Force is to let people die though there are enough resources to let them live. You don't need a Wall and guns to give a country justice. Health care isn't provided by fiat, there are costs involved--costs that can't be avoided or lessened by gov't orders.I know that medical treatment and medical research, personnel and hospitals cause costs. I may be biased but I'm not silly. But I also know that the gov't so hated by you has the power and the resources to let the costs for the patients go down unto zero just by subsidies (you know what I mean, don't you?). It's just a matter of relevancy: Is it more relevant to be social to the own citizens, or more relevant to be seen as war-monger... Did you know that to achieve and maintain one single fighter jet costs as much as to build and maintain one average hospital? What is more important? Instead of cutting the costs for med personnel and medical treatment, they should cut down costs elsewhere (example: military achievements) and invest into medicine to give everyone the same standard of medical treatment as only the rich private patients can afford by now! And into education of course, into an entire social life. The govt you hate so much, has the power to get rid of this two-classes-system. Just a little change of the relevancies in politics. | 2061) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 25 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: just winning, while being discontent with the Noodles... ...turn it into sushi.

Morristown on Saturday was no different. After the July 28, 2007 anti-immigrant rally in Morristown, NJ, two neo-Nazis attacked antifascists behind town hall. The neo-Nazis, 40-year old Frederick K. Williams (\"Erick_K_W\" on Stormfront) and Annette Williams of North Bergen, NJ, jumped from their pick-up truck armed with baseball bats and knives and assaulted pro-immigrant counter-protesters. After taunting the anti-racist activists who had outed them earlier at the rally itself, Williams and his wife stopped their truck, exited the vehicle and pulled a knife on the activists. He lunged at them but was quickly disarmed and his knife fell to the pavement. A local resident saw the fight between the older couple and the younger activists and joined in to support the neo-Nazis, shouting obscenities and dragging one activist who had just been standing there to the ground. Williams then pulled out a baseball bat from the rear bed of his pick up truck and began attacking the anti-racists with it. By this point, more antifas began rushing to the scene. Williams got back in his truck and tried to flee, but not before other activists blocked his Ford pick up from leaving. Moments later, police rushed in, found Williams' weapon in the back of his pickup and confiscated it. Staying true to their fear of authority figures, the Williams' story quickly changed, telling police they were the victims of an unprovoked assault, but other witnesses at the scene and a video of the attack prove otherwise. After initially handcuffing the bat-wielding Frederick Williams and detaining his wife Annette, police then decided to take his word for it and rounded up several anti-racists who were detained several blocks away from the incident. Although they had the bat, the knife and other evidence of the actual assault right in their hands, no action was taken by police against Frederick Williams. They then let Williams choose which activists he wanted to be arrested. Frederick Williams suffered no more than a few scrapes and bruised ego, and his wife Annette a bloody lip, while one of those arrested was beaten with a baseball bat and sustained injuries to his knee and leg. Again: the neo-Nazis were not arrested by the police. The New York Times erroneously printed an article using the police report, based entirely on Williams' story of the event in direct contradiction to the statements of other witnesses and the evidence found on the scene. Where police reported ten activists targeted in the assault, less than four were involved, and no mention was made in the article of Williams' possession of the weapons. The charges against the activists reflected this: one was charged with two counts of unlawful possession of a weapon, yet fingerprint analysis will clearly show that the items were wielded by none other than Frederick Williams. Other charges include simple assault, disorderly conduct, improper behavior and causing bodily injury. Bails were set ridiculously high, one with a $5,000 bail with 10% bond, and two of $2500 cash bail without bond - all for non-indictable offenses (NJ's equivalent of a misdemeanor). Police themselves obstructed the release of the activists, first saying that they would be released without charges, then that they would have charges but be released on their own recognizance, then informing the arrestees supporters of the bail amounts eight hours after the initial arrests while not stating any of the charges against them. All of the activists were bailed out within three hours of being transferred to the Morris County Jail through the efforts of devoted friends and the support of a strong, dedicated, broad-based and growing movement committed to standing up in the face of racist attacks, harassment and lies. Their spirits are high and they are confident that they will win in court. The organizers of the anti-immigrant rally, including Mt. Olive blogger Robb Pearson and the mayor of Morristown, Donald Cresitello, publicly distanced themselves from charges of racism but seemed to have no problem with the two dozen or so openly neo-Nazi rally participants at the event, including Williams. Mayor Cresitello at one point even stopped his prepared speech to launch a tirade against \"Communists and Marxists.\" Throughout the rally, antifascists made their presence known in sight and sound of the racist rally, calling out and exposing the neo-Nazis present. At one point during the day, after anti-racists identified and called out several neo-Nazi boneheads in the crowd near town hall, the boneheads walked over to confront the protesters only to be swarmed. A tense but non-violent face off ended with the boneheads realizing they were out of their league. One ran into the local Kings' supermarket to hide, while others made a hasty retreat to their car, and drove off. Perhaps to make up for his less-than-glorious battle for the purity of the white race, Williams began posting to white supremacist website Stormfront begging for money and support from other white supremacists, claiming that antifas dragged him and his wife from his truck and seriously injured them. Nothing could be further from the truth, a pathetic cover-up by a neo-Nazi who picked the wrong day to try and start his own racial holy war on the streets of Morristown. But now, the neo-Nazis have gone even further, sending anonymous threats to activists and college students who were not even at the counter-rally and had only reposted already public calls to action. They have even begun targeting family members of the arrestees. Several of these threats have already been received from anonymous email addresses. Neo-Nazis have also begun posting photos of other activists online and calling - not for them to be outed to the public, as anti-racists have done for Nazis - but to be singled out for assault and perhaps worse. This only shows exactly what follows when neo-Nazis are allowed to take the streets or organize unopposed: brutal and cowardly assaults on unarmed protesters who stand up to their hate. The neo-Nazis' actions, their organizing, and their rallies will continue to be disrupted and shut down in the months to come. There is already a treasure trove of information on specific and active white power organizers, including the participants of Saturday's assault, and any move or further assault by them will lead us right back to the source. They will be exposed, they will lose their jobs, and they may face years behind bars like white supremacist Matt Hale if any harm comes to the activists, their friends or loved ones. Neo-Nazis will not be allowed to take one step in their communities and towns without being vilified, exposed to the light and put in their place at every turn. After shutting down the World Church of the Creator, after forcing the National Alliance off the streets, after countering the National Socialist Movement at every turn and exposing every tiny white power faction trying to mainstream itself for what they are, they will not pass. Further organizing by neo-Nazis in the mainstream will only bring down the movements they try to infiltrate, ruining the careers of any public figure or politician who flirts with fascism. Further organizing out of the closet as white power organizations will be dealt a swift defeat. Never again means never again. | 2070) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 25 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: last win before going to bed | 2071) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Post: [It's intermission time...brought to you by the friendly folks in Russia.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfoQsZa8F1c) [Long version...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiyUSv2Z07A) delivered by a Tupolev Tu-95 bomber - NATO Code name: Bear.

In opposite I would strictly cut medicine prices down (and if it were by subventions) and suggest a nation-wide real social insurance system, with no allowance to treat \"private\" patients otherwise than Social insurance patients. One patient is as needy as the other one, and no person should be treated worse only because the social insurance pays their medical treatment bill. Then, to bring research and stuff as a reason to hold medicine costs high is just a poor excuse for making big money by supplying the needy. | 2078) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 25 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This was the very first computer I worked on: A [KC 85/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC_85).

All were injured, one seriously. The police deny there was a political motive behind the attack despite calls of \"foreigners out.\" Despite a mob's calls of \"foreigners out,\" police are denying there was a far-right motive behind an attack on a group of Indians in eastern Germany this weekend. The eight men were attacked by a mob of around 50 Germans at a street party in the early hours of Sunday in the small town of M\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcgeln in the eastern German state of Saxony. The trigger for the violence was a brawl on the dance floor in a party tent shortly before 1 a.m., police said. The reason for the brawl was not yet clear. The Indians left the tent where the dance was being held but were then attacked by the mob, which chased them across the town's market place until they took shelter in a pizzeria run by an Indian. The owner let them in, but the mob tried to kick in the doors of the restaurants as a large crowd looked on. The restaurant owner's car was also seriously damaged. Seventy police officers were called in to restore order. Fourteen people were injured in the incident, including the eight Indians, four of the attackers and two police officers. One of the Indians and one of the attackers were taken to hospital for treatment. Two of the attackers, aged 21 and 23, were arrested on Saturday night but later released. The police have set up a task force to investigate the incident. In remarks to the German news agency DDP Monday, a police spokeswoman in Leipzig denied there was a neo-Nazi motive behind the attack, despite eye-witnesses accounts of people calling for \"foreigners out.\" There were reports Monday that the police had been warned in advance of the attack but had done nothing to prevent it. Mayor Gotthard Deuse told the German news station N24 that there had been warnings of possible problems at the street party. However, the police spokeswoman denied this, saying that the warning in question had been sent to a youth club in the town, warning of a robbery. This had \"absolutely nothing to do\" with the attacks, the spokeswoman said. The mayor said there were no neo-Nazis in the town and that, if the incident did have a far-right motive, it was most likely caused by people from outside the city. Some of the men were merchants living in the area, police said. \"They just wanted to take part in the celebrations,\" a police spokesman told the Associated Press. Attacks on foreigners are far from unusual in eastern German states such as Saxony, where there are concerns that far-right groups are gaining in strength and taking on institutional roles in some places. The far-right, neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD) holds several seats in Saxony's state assembly, having won over 9 percent of the vote in the 2004 state election. dgs/ddp/ap/dpa | 2119) 2007 by [thorin Post: Some German war victims I could find: 08/15/07 NAME NOT RELEASED YET Police Major German Federal Criminal Investigation Office Sicherungsgruppe Hostile - hostile fire - IED attack Kabul 08/15/07 NAME NOT RELEASED YET Police Sergeant German Federal Police GSG9 der Bundespolizei Hostile - hostile fire - IED attack Kabul 08/15/07 NAME NOT RELEASED YET Police Sergeant German Federal Police GSG9 der Bundespolizei 05/19/07 Standfu\u00c3\u00c5\u00b8, Matthias Captain 31 German Army Hostile - hostile fire - suicide bomber Kunduz 05/19/07 Diebel, Michael Technical Sergeant 28 German Army Hostile - hostile fire - suicide bomber Kunduz 05/19/07 Neumann, Michael Technical Sergeant 48 German Army Hostile - hostile fire - suicide bomber Kunduz 08/07/05 NAME NOT KNOWN German Army Non-hostile - vehicle accident Kabul (southeast) 06/07/03 Kuehlmorgen, Carsten Master Sergeant 32 German Army, Hostile - hostile fire - suicide car bomb Afghan National Army training facility in Kabul 06/07/03 Beljo, Andreas Chief Warrant Officer German Army, International Security Assistance Force Hostile - hostile fire - suicide car bomb Kabul 06/07/03 Jimenez-Paradis, Helmi Sergeant German Army, International Security Assistance Force Hostile - hostile fire - suicide car bomb Afghan National Army training facility in Kabul 06/07/03 Baasch, Joerg Junior Sergeant German Army, International Security Assistance Force Hostile - hostile fire - suicide car bomb Afghan National Army training facility in Kabul 05/29/03 Kamins, Stephen Private 1st Class German Army, International Security Assistance Force Hostile - hostile fire - mine Kabul (12 kilometers south of) 12/21/02 Kaiser, Bernhard Main Sergeant German Army 15th Army Aviation Regiment Non-hostile - helicopter crash Kabul (near) 12/21/02 Deininger, Friedrich Captain 53 German Army 25th Army Aviation Regiment Non-hostile - helicopter crash Kabul (near) 12/21/02 Ehrlich, Frank Junior Sergeant.

What are some of the dangers associated with DHMO? Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are: * Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities. * Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage. * Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects. * DHMO is a major component of acid rain. * Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns. * Contributes to soil erosion. * Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals. * Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits. * Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes. * Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions. * Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks. * Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, and in hurricanes including deadly storms in Florida, New Orleans and other areas of the southeastern U.S. * Thermal variations in DHMO are a suspected contributor to the El Nino weather effect. :D | 2134) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Posted 20 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: If I could change the world I would only let people reach certain \"higher positions\" who are neither ignorant nor bullying others. | 2135) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41426) 20 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: ah!

[...] Rove helped Bush start a war, and now hundreds of thousands of American GIs (and millions of Iraqi civilians) have no choice but to live with the consequences of that decision. Why should Rove -- and not they -- be allowed to say, Sorry, now I have to bug out to spend more time with my family? How nice for the Roves that he can walk away from the war.

One single fighter jet costs about $ 45Million, plus fuel and weaponry. And no country buys only one fighter. One aircraft carrier: about US$4.5 billion each to achieve, + average annual operating costs: US$160 million. That's like money thrown away - If they burnt the money instead, those in need wouldn't get no help likewise. Imagine: with $160Mio per year, for the costs to operate only one of those unnecessary (because only good for aggression) aircraft carriers only one year, they could lessen the poverty for many people. * One third of all deaths - some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day - are due to poverty-related causes. That's 270 million people since 1990, the majority women and children, roughly equal to the population of the US. * Every year nearly 11 million children die before their fifth birthday. * In 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day * 800 million people go to bed hungry every day | 2183) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) & RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41426) 617173](forum_thread.php?id=41426&postid=617173)) Posted 9 Aug 2007 congratulations, boards](forum_index.php) : & RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41426) 9 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: wionning, trying to prepare some rice :^O ) | 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Respect = tolerance.

Love, tolerance, and respect have in common that you have to give them to others before getting them. Respect is nothing someone has to earn. According to the definitions I found, respect is: politeness, honor and care shown towards someone or something; polite expressions of greeting, friendship, or sympathy (--> neither friendship nor sympathy are things to be earned for a tolerant person); admiration for someone or something that you believe has good ideas or qualities; to admire (an ability or good quality), or to admire (someone) for their ability or qualities.

In Internet communications, it means talking to someone as if you were talking to them face-to-face, and as if (this is important) that person is much bigger, stronger and angrier than you. Respect is all too rare in Internet communications, because many people think it is not important, or because many people get away with the lack of it, or because many people have suffered from a lack of it and think that justifies them giving back the same. I agree to Qui-Gon's post in most parts. The only thing I disagree is the part I underlined. I rather would say: \"...as if (this is important) that person is much more sensitive than you.\" Because: while strong big angry people can be calmed down, you can hurt sensitive persons a lot even by being misunderstood. And hurt persons either become angry beyond a chance of being calmed - or just suffer & leave. FUBAR both ways. So: hurt no-one because you don't want to be hurt. And you never know who is behind the nick-names (except this person reveals it on the boards). Since you can't use all of this \"non-verbal communication\" when posting on Internet message boards, which you use when communicating face-to-face, like gesture or mimic for example, you have to express your \"sub-messages\" otherwise to get the messages the way you mean them. But, Qui-Gon is right, there is a lack of respect on many Internet boards. To me, mutual respect is mutual attention & esteem, and has nothing to do with the fear of a bigger, angrier, stronger person. I just try to see a person being at least the same level (of knowledge, experience, wisdom...) as me. I always use to give persons quite much respect in advance, just because they are human beings like me, my \"brothers & sisters\" in a spiritual way. Though this respect to a particular person can even rise by learning more of them, it's also possible that I can lose the respect to a certain person by learning more of them. But my respect to certain people is up to them and their behavior. It's a matter of my self-respect, how much I can respect myself more than I respect the other ones. | 2204) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe [thorin Post: Message 615857 - Posted 6 Aug 2007 19:53:02 UTC In general: If I am addressed in a polite and respectful way, I answer back the same way.

August 4, 2007 Editorial A Surer Way to Feed the Hungry Globally, about 800 million people are chronically hungry, and the number rises every year. The Bush administration is pushing what should be an obvious policy change to help those most acutely in need \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac victims of catastrophe or some other emergency. Instead of shipping American-grown food abroad, Washington would send American dollars to buy food from local farmers. The present food aid system is a favorite of American farmers. But it is also cumbersome, slow, expensive and leaves people hungry who could easily be fed. President Bush has rightly proposed shifting $300 million from farm subsidies to enable governments and relief groups to buy food locally. This plan struck a responsive chord almost everywhere except the Congress. The House omitted the idea from the farm bill it passed last week. And prospects for the Senate approving anything more than a pilot program seem dim. This is sad but unsurprising. Farm policy continues to be dominated by farm-state legislators who prefer the traditional approach of sending surplus food abroad, further enriching heavily subsidized farmers as well as the shipping industry. A recent article by The Times\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s Celia Dugger shows why that makes so little sense. Starving Africans in the arid reaches of northwestern Kenya desperately needed food. Kenyan officials did not want surplus American corn because they feared driving down the prices for local farmers. The obvious answer was for the Americans to buy local corn, but American law prevented this. So the corn was never shipped and people continued to go hungry. The United States is the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s most generous provider of food aid, amounting to $2 billion annually. But too much of that aid is wasted in overhead, mainly shipping costs. At the other end of the pipeline, subsidized American food can hurt local farmers, while local procurement gives them a commercial outlet. Administration officials also note that food purchased here usually takes four months to reach its destination. Food purchased locally takes days. The virtues of Mr. Bush\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s idea are self-evident. What it needs is full Congressional support, not pilot programs. It would be nice if, for once, America\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s farm bloc could think of interests other than its own. | 2266) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 614700](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=614700)) Posted 4 Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good morning, afternoon, evening, night to everyone! winning after finally having chosen the winner caption for my pic. | 2267) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Okay.

But I guess convincing all those people over there to do that is harder than jumping over the Moon. Maybe there's a way but I don't know it. best way to reduce world hunger is to share all resources with everyone. There is enough on Earth to feed twice the actual population, it only has to be alloted to everyone instead of a few. I have to disagree here, too. If you don't fight the problem first you just cause a even bigger desaster, when finally the resources run out. It's my believe that for example - as paradox as it sounds - the help is the reason. Colonialism has disrupted the societies and the traditional life. The societis were forced into our style of living but also received some healthcare systems. Newborn have a higher chance to survive now, hence population growth increases, even if the ressources don't allow it. Hunger is a result and international help is easing the pain to some degree. But in the end there are just more mouths to feed, next time the catastrophe is even larger. What is needed is helping the local farmers to produce (which can't sell their stuff if help is for free, making them leave their lands, desert takes over, increasing the problem even more). Meanwhile more and more organisations have admitted that food help can not solve the problems in the long run, but that they have to help lastingly by supporting farmers and so on. Sorry, thorin - just sharing sounds good, but is not well thought out IMHO. There also has to be increase of female rights and contraception for example. Global birth rates fortunately actually slow down. [Birth rate declining](http://www.uwsp.edu/business/economicswisconsin/e_lecture/pop_sum.htm) [UN report PDF](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2002/WPP2002-HIGHLIGHTSrev1.PDF) I haven't said that they just have to be fed, and nothing more. I think first they need to be fed to avoid them starving, and they need to be fed unless (and this is the main point) they are helped enough to be able to help themselves. This means helping them with education, with tools, with machines, with money. I read of a group spending no money to the poor countries but food, and water pumps, and seed, and medical help, and help to prevent deserting - both by deed and teaching; and tools and books and clothes and a lot of more teaching. Governmental help programs can be wrong on the other hand, when they are run by bureaucrats. I read of hundreds of trucks and harvester machines been sent to an African country for example some decades ago, but the bureaucrats who sent them didn't think of the corrosion due to the other climate zone, and that the particular country had no own mechanics to repair them, and no parts to replace broken or corroded parts. They just sent the trucks etc, sent some ppl to make them run after the transport - and then, when they run and the ppl began to teach the Africans how to use them, these ppl were sent back, because teaching was not part of their contract! | 2269) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 614686](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=614686)) Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good morning!

As I told many times before: In the last centuries there has been nothing like a real communist state anywhere in the world -- How these states named themselves or were seen by right-wing and arch-conservative people, that's another subject. But except some local experiments (even in the States) there has no communism appeared yet in the \"civilized\" part of the world. No, I advocate communism because I think it's the best possible system, because it puts solidarity over egoism, mutual respect over arrogance, inner wealth over financial wealth ... Yeah well there's this thing called History that PROVES your opinion of communism being the \"best\" possible system, as being 100% wrong Well, the richest persons I've met and discussed in real life had an income between 0.5 and 2 millions a year, one person I had a 30 minutes discussion with even had more, being a successful actor/producer. I think that's rich already, ain't it? And the poorest people I met had to spend their nights in Rescue Missions or Shelters or on the streets. Btw: There is no direct relationship between wealth and character. People don't get automatically a better character the wealthier they are. Sometimes it's quite the opposite. I met poor people, and I met rich people. There were less righteous people among the rich ones. Guess why. >> Hint: Scrooge Ummm, I'm a yard crew supervisor for government housing, either our ideas of being rich differ greatly, or you're an uninformed foreigner making assumptions. My income is about $25k a year....if the converter was right, about 18603.97 German Euros. You don't have to be rich to own a home and a car, but you do have to make sacrifices....did you catch the hint?I know about such sacrifices. I even sacrificed my family against a job. Well you don't have to be rich, but when you aren't, the house or car don't belong to you as long as the last rate and interest ain't paid off. You see, I work in the projects making life better for the \"less fortunate\" in our society....which is easily comprised of nearly 50% slackers like you and Jeffery. Fully capable of holding down some type of job but they choose not to, because even in a bassackwards country like America, we don't let people starve and freeze in the street....we provide them with brick homes and food stamps at the expense of the WORKING man....but as I've indicated before, THEY have to get off THEIR lazy ass, apply for housing, and follow the rules. Provide them with a job, with money, with an existence worth the name, with a future - and you'll help them more than with food stamps and Shelters. And, more important: listen to them instead of just judging them. You'll learn a lot about how your beloved system really works.

You don't do that, so you seem to think it's okay to see them spend your tax money for dictatory stuff Well, If I had money to share I would share it. I don't know where you take your paranoia of being forced from. Better the government invests into education and health care than into secret services, war and SDI. Well, that's what you think, but you always seem to conveniently forget the second part: that the system that provides dollars for education and health care is the same system that provides dollars for secret services, war and SDI. That's the fatal flaw. There's no paranoia at all. You want to force me to pay for your silly education plan, others want to force me to pay for their silly wars. That's not paranoia, that's simply reality. Maybe there is a misunderstanding due to missing vocabulary on my side. I would use no force, but I would teach by example, and would talk the people into spending their money likewise. As I pointed out above, I, personally , am not able to - if I were I happily would do and enforce it. No, you aren't able to. So you can't. But, even though you aren't able to earn the type of money that would allow you to provide such things, others are supposed to follow your ideas? They should accept it on your word alone? I mean, what possibly gives you the rights to enforce such ideas on others that do not agree with you? That you would use force to \"enforce it?\" Of that I have no doubt. I know why it was \"necessary\" - I learned it from history, from all sides: the official East German side, the official West German side, and from several independent sides. While Wall and borders were right (dividing two different countries using two different systems from each other), the machine guns and mines were just wrong - after a couple of years. Hint: this is why there had to be a wall with the machine guns pointing inward... I think I don't have to comment this one. I'm over the state of being too blinded to see that this was wrong. You need to see not only that it was wrong, you need to see why such a wall was necessary. That is the important part. But still they have debts, and still some have to work to afford their own education. Sure, student loans - and how high are the rates and interests when it comes to pay them back? Those students have debts as soon as they finish studying! Sometimes I suppose they deliberately put the education standard lower for public schools than for the expensive private schools - because a stupid People is more manipulatable. Oooh, next we move into paranoid fantasy... \"The gov't provides student loans to keep the proles DOWN!!!\" Well, let's see. The average rate is 4%. Until recently it was 2.3%. Most of mine are locked in at 2.3%. So yes, they are loans. And they are about the cheapest loans available. And they are signature loans, no credit check necessary. No minimum income necessary. Will they pay for Harvard? No. Will they pay for state schools? Yes. That they have debt when they finish studying? Who cares? The loans have a minimum 6 month deferment period, easily expandable to 9 months. There are further forbearances after that. There are forgiveness programs for those that go into helping professions. Well - that's the difference between American and German unions: German unions help the employees in general, but unfortunately they lost much of their influence, too. Knowledge is power. They who have more knowledge have power over those who have less knowledge. Now think again and tell me why it should be the leftists who want this negative trend. Most simply: because you advocate for BS gov't programs that are poorly run, have no accountability, crush those that need them the most, and remove the ability of people to choose. Take for example, public education. Like we are talking about in this thread. It is the left that fights any change here. They fight removing unions, they fight vouchers, they fight accountability, they fight everything except the status quo. That's why. If the unions are really deputizing for the workers - so why should they be fought against? The unions are for maintaining the status quo at any cost. They don't care as long as their members cannot be fired, held accountable, cannot be punished--in other words, they are for the union. That is not the best way to teach children.Why? What's wrong with solidarity, mutual help, a save job, more rights for employers? Well, if you don't have to pay for school you can change whenever you think it's right. Just send your kid to another school. There's still the free choice. mentioning the vouchers: If they provided generally free education, from kindergarten up to university - there were no need for them. Ohferchrissakes. There is a need, regardless of the cost. The vouchers are a way of providing a public school system where the parents can choose schools for their children, and remove their funding from those skools that fail them. Kinda like how you get fed up with your mobile phone provider and go somewhere else. Okay, then the misunderstanding was on my side once more. mentioning accountability, I can only think of corporate accountability, and that each company should be called to account for their incomes (including wins and subventions) vs their investments and salary risings, their hirings and firings (and their reasons of firing - they better had good reasons!), and especially their wins. And why they think not to share their win with their employees. This kind of accountability is something to fight for :-) Ummmm, that really has no bearing on what we are talking about. If you don't want to finance a corporation, don't buy it's products, or it's stock. Since you are free to do that, there is no need for any of the above. If you disagree with how it is run, don't deal with them. The only people who have any interest are the shareholders, if they're happy, nothing else matters.That's the main failure in economics. Not the short-term raise of the shares matters but the middle- or long-term progress of the company. Too many companies have been closed down because of a momentary weakness of the shares though they had enough turn-over and/or enough export orders to get over it. In my opinion they should forbid this entire stock-exchange biz -- or treat it worse than gambling. I mean, if Nike knows you won't buy their product, don't own their stock, don't work for the company, et cetera, why the hell would they even think to listen to you?To get me as their customer? I learned that each non-customer is a potential customer. You only have to find a way to reach them. With public education (the topic at hand), you are forced to pay for it, even if you don't have kids. You can't walk away. You can't refuse to pay.That's what taxes are for: to pay for things everyone can have their use from. And education is a thing everyone can use. Be it \"first education\" (kindergarten, school, university) or \"secondary education\" (like evening classes for adults - the way I study at the moment). Education brings advantage to everyone. What use are secret services, wars, the SDI program for Mr. Average American Guy? They brought only evil according to what I learned. ________________________________ See, I don't even own a car nor a house. And the fridge in my kitchen is part of the flat I rented. If it breaks I have to ask my landlord to have it repaired -- and it has nothing to do with communism. But it has to do with poverty. Well, If I had money to share I would share it. I don't know where you take your paranoia of being forced from. Better the government invests into education and health care than into secret services, war and SDI. Guess what, if I had extra money, I'd share it too, but my fridge died 2 weeks ago, the brakes on my car are starting to squeal, and I found a leaking water pipe under my house this morning....not to mention I'd like to retire one day instead of working until I die.

Who ever becomes the next President never should forget this. Sheesh, more empty naivete. This stuff has gone on since the beginning of time. No one in their right mind thinks that the leader of Burkina Faso or someone like Idi Amin is by any sense of the word on the same level of stature as the President of the United States or the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Rarely indeed do any of them get the full royal treatment, and those that do, get it because they actually are close to the same \"political level,\" or are friends of the U.S. No one in their right mind thinks that the President and the head cheese of Lesotho are the same diplomatically. Mostly because no one else can match something like Air Force One. The issue with Sum Yun Guy wasn't a lack of diplomatic skills, it was a carefully calculated plan to pressure him. They wanted it to be a slap in the face--that was the point. That you happen to disagree doesn't mean it wasn't diplomacy. If this was deliberate then it's even worse than just a lack of diplomatic skills, then it's pure arrogance and priority thinking; a thing no government today can afford. Does this GWB guy think the Americans are the new Herrenrasse? Do you think it? To be American is not more special than to be German, or to be French, or to be Chinese or to be African. We all are citizens of the Earth, we all are humans. Btw: I don't know exactly whom you meant with the insulting title \"head cheese of Lesotho\". If you mean the King of Lesotho, this man has a similar political position like the British Queen Elizabeth II: just representation of that tiny country. But if you mean their Prime Minister - he is the head of government and army, and has executive authority. He is to Lesotho what Bush is to the States -- so they really are on one political position. That he rules a much smaller and much poorer country should not matter. And mentioning Idi Amin: You sure know that he lost his political position as the President of Uganda in 1979 when he absconded to Libya, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, after losing the war he began with invading Tansania; and that he died in 2003. I think any head of any country (I mean head of government, head of authority) is worth as much as the other one. No \"head cheese\" is worth more than another. Be it Bush, be it Merkel, be it Putin, Blair, etc... No matter where they come from, they are the heads of their countries. So they are on one political level. Even when a country belongs to the poorer or poorest countries in the world they are not worth less than the USA. | 2309) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 613789](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=613789)) Labbie, Misfit, Qui-Gon, who I may have butted heads with: [This is not an excuse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk58p1jeCCA), nor an explanation, Sorry, but it is what it is.

In fact, scarcely any one at all escapes. Now and then, in the course of the century, a great man of science, like Darwin; a great poet, like Keats; a fine critical spirit, like M. Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand \"under the shelter of the wall,\" as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world. These, however, are exceptions. The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism - are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this. The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man's intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought. Accordingly, with admirable though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease. They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor. But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life - educated men who live in the East End - coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins. There is also this to be said. It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair. Under Socialism all this will, of course, be altered. There will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags, and bringing up unhealthy, hungerpinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings. The security of society will not depend, as it does now, on the state of the weather. If a frost comes we shall not have a hundred thousand men out of work, tramping about the streets in a state of disgusting misery, or whining to their neighbours for alms, or crowding round the doors of loathsome shelters to try and secure a hunch of bread and a night's unclean lodging. Each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society, and if a frost comes no one will practically be anything the worse. Upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to Individualism. Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material wellbeing of each member of the community. It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment. But for the full development of Life to its highest mode of perfection, something more is needed. What is needed is Individualism. If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first. At present, in consequence of the existence of private property, a great many people are enabled to develop a certain very limited amount of individualism. They are either under no necessity to work for their living, or are enabled to choose the sphere of activity that is really congenial to them and gives them pleasure. These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture - in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation. Upon the other hand, there are a great many people who, having no private property of their own, and being always on the brink of sheer starvation, are compelled to do the work of beasts of burden, to do work that is quite uncongenial to them, and to which they are forced by the peremptory, unreasonable, degrading Tyranny of want. These are the poor, and amongst them there is no grace of manner, or charm of speech, or civilisation, or culture, or refinement in pleasures, or joy of life. From their collective force Humanity gains much in material prosperity. But it is only the material result that it gains, and the man who is poor is in himself absolutely of no importance. He is merely the infinitesimal atom of a force that, so far from regarding him, crushes him: indeed, prefers him crushed, as in that case he is far more obedient. Of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule of a fine or wonderful type, and that the poor, if they have not culture and charm, have still many virtues. Both these statements would be quite true. The possession of private property is very often extremely demoralising, and that is, of course, one of the reasons why Socialism wants to get rid of the institution. In fact, property is really a nuisance. Some years ago people went about the country saying that property has duties. They said it so often and so tediously that, at last, the Church has begun to say it. One hears it now from every pulpit. It is perfectly true. Property not merely has duties, but has so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore. It involves endless claims upon one, endless attention to business, endless bother. If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable. In the interest of the rich we must get rid of it. The virtues of the poor may be readily admitted, and are much to be regretted. We are often told that the poor are grateful for charity. Some of them are, no doubt, but the best amongst the poor are never grateful. They are ungrateful, discontented, disobedient, and rebellious. They are quite right to be so. Charity they feel to be a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution, or a sentimental dole, usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over their private lives. Why should they be grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table? They should be seated at the board, and are beginning to know it. As for being discontented, a man who would not be discontented with such surroundings and such alow mode of life would be a perfect brute. Disobedience, in the eyes of any one who has read history, is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion. Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less. For a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral. Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal. He should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing. As for begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg. No; a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty, discontented, and rebellious is probably a real personality, and has much in him. He is at any rate a healthy protest. As for the virtuous poor, one can pity them, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them. They have made private terms with the enemy and sold their birthright for very bad pottage. They must also be extraordinarily stupid. I can quite understand a man accepting laws that protect private property, and admit of its accumulation, as long as he himself is able under these conditions to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life. But it is almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance. However, the explanation is not really so difficult to find. It is simply this. Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering. They have to be told of it by other people, and they often entirely disbelieve them. What is said by great employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably true. Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community, and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them. That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary. Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilisation. Slavery was put down in America, not in consequence of any action on the part of the slaves, or even any express desire on their part that they should be free. It was put down entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitators in Boston and elsewhere, who were not slaves themselves, nor owners of slaves, nor had anything to do with the question really. It was, undoubtedly, the Abolitionists who set the torch alight, who began the whole thing. And it is curious to note that from the slaves themselves they received, not merely very little assistance, but hardly any sympathy even; and when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free, found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to starve, many of them bitterly regretted the new state of things. To the thinker, the most tragic fact in the whole of the French Revolution is not that Marie Antoinette was killed for being a queen, but that the starved peasant of the Vendee voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause of feudalism. It is clear, then, that no Authoritarian Socialism will do. For while under the present system a very large number of people can lead lives of a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness, under an industrial barrack system, or a system of economic tyranny, nobody would be able to have any such freedom at all. It is to be regretted that a portion of our community should be practically in slavery, but to propose to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish. Every man must be left quite free to choose his own work. No form of compulsion must he exercised over him. If there is, his work will not be good for him, will not be good in itself, and will not be good for others. And by work I simply mean activity of any kind. ... | [Oskar Wilde](http://www.sterneck.net/cybertribe/utopia/oscar-wilde-socialism/index.php) wrote: In old days men had the rack. Now they have the press. That is an improvement certainly. But still it is very bad, and wrong, and demoralising. Somebody - was it Burke? - called journalism the fourth estate. That was true at the time, no doubt. But at the present moment it really is the only estate. It has eaten up the other three. The Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it. We are dominated by Journalism. In America the President reigns for four years, and Journalism governs for ever and ever. Fortunately, in America journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme. As a natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt. People are amused by it, or disgusted by it, according to their temperaments. But it is no longer the real force it was. It is not seriously treated. | 2331) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 613603](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=613603)) Aug 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: If it's before coffee, it's got to be drivel, for any of us. :) I agree.

Oh no! These ignorants! Tea must be loose, and there is a real ceremony in tea making. The only convenience I accept is a tea strainer - but no tea egg or even tea bags. A lot of the folklore surrounding teamaking is just that, folklore, ingrained with custom and traditon. This is of course fully supported by the tea companies. As a tea drinker you basically have two choices, looseleaf tea or teabags. Looseleaf tea properly brewed and prepared will always give the best possible taste and flavour. Some of the more aristocratic of teas like Assam, Orange Pekoe, Darjeeling, Lapsang Souchong, etc can only usually be bought in looseleaf form. For convenience, most of the general public prefer to use teabags due to savings in time and disposal. And to be honest the average palate wouldn't be able to tell much difference betwen the blends anyway. Yes some of the cheaper teabags do contain some dust which is evident on the surface of the tea, but if you buy medium to good quality tea you dont get that. Tea is produced all over the world, but mainly from China, India, and Ceylon, and in recent years there have been certain UK speciality teas that have become popular. English Breakfast - Traditionally a blend of Assam and Ceylon teas to create a pungent and flavoursome tea to help digest a full english breakfast and give a good brisk start to the day. Afternoon Tea - A blend of delicate Darjeeling tea and high-grown Ceylon tea to produce a refreshing and light tea, Afternoon Tea also makes an ideal companion to cucumber sandwiches, cream pastries and fruit cake. The essence of Afternoon Tea blends is not their strength but their flavour. House Blend - Some tea places offer a 'pot of tea', others have a 'pot of house blend tea'. This tea is equivalent to - if not better than - the type of tea most people buy to use at home. In tea trade language, it is known as a 'popular brand leading blend' . In catering terms it will be a Quality Award tea. It may be a loose leaf or tea bag, either way it's a work of art and can contain 15-35 different teas. These are blended to achieve a consistent quality flavour. Interesting to note that the London Tea Auctions only finished in 1998 after over 300 years of being at the centre of the wrlds tea trade. Loads more interesting stuff here.

No. As to 'thinking and feeling'... In my opinion, people need a lot more of the first, and a lot less of the second. Far too often, the urge to help others that we feel sorry for gets in the way of reason, and we do things that at best could be termed 'unwise'.

The best system is IMHO like Germany approx thirty years ago - a worker could earn enough to afford a house, car, wife@home, children and holidays. The money spent would strengthen the economy and crime rate would be low. Yes, dictatorship is always a danger, no matter whether on the right or the left. Out of curiosity, 'Germany approx thirty years ago'... Would you mean East or West Germany? Both.

The report reveals the US was interested mostly in cash assistance and materials, rather than direct aid from foreign relief workers and doctors, after Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005. \"A review of the State Department documents reveals distressing ineptitude,\" CREW's executive director Melanie Sloan said in a prepared statement. \"Countries were trying to donate desperately needed goods and services, but as a result of bureaucratic bungling and indifference, those most in need of these generous offers and of aid never received it.\" Offers to help came from 145 countries and 12 international organizations. The US did accept help from its top allies around the globe, but CREW's report shows it left unclaimed hundreds of thousands of prepared meals, water pumps, doctors and medicine. Many of the offers were turned down because of a strict adherence to bureaucratic regulations, the report reveals. For example, questions about medical licensing prevented foreign-trained doctors from helping in the Gulf Coast. \"All, The (sic) word here is that doctors of any kind are in the 'forget about it' category,\" read an e-mail from the State Department responding to an offer of assistance from Argentina. \"Human assistance of any kind is not on our priorities list ... It's all about goods, not people, at this point.\" A ban on British beef in place over fears of Mad Cow disease prevented Meals Ready to Eat from the UK being given to Katrina refugees. The uneaten MREs were kept in a storage unit at a cost of $16,000 per month, according to the report. The disorganization that plagued Katrina cleanup efforts also strained diplomatic relations, when the US ignored offers of aid from other countries. \"It is getting downright embarrassing here not to have a response to the Estonians on flood relief,\" Jeffrey Goldstein, a U.S. Embassy official in Estonia, wrote in an e-mail to several State Department officials. \"... We know that what the Estonians can offer is small potatoes and everyone at FEMA is swamped, but at this point even 'thanks but no thanks' is better than deafening silence.\" An Israeli plane filled with supplies for the relief effort sat fully loaded on an airport tarmac for more than 48 hours because of a lack of communication from the US, according to another e-mail released with the report. \"The vendors are getting restless. They offered this stuff 48 hours ago, and the government hasn't responded,\" wrote an unidentified State Department official. \"I've been on the phone with the [Israeli] attach\u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 every couple of hours since noon ... they're patient, but not amused by our delay, obviously.\" just another proof of the arrogance and superiority thinking of some government people. | 2383) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Can Obama perform on world stage?I agree. It is ridiculous. Communication and diplomacy are the most important things today worldwide - and meeting between the leaders of countries with (at least) different points of view are important to bring back peace or at least co-existence. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER THE WASHINGTON POST July 28, 2007 For Barack Obama, it was strike two. And this one was a right-down-the-middle question from a YouTuber in Monday night's South Carolina debate: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Would you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I would,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 responded Obama. His explanation dug him even deeper: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac is ridiculous.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 From The Nation's David Corn to super-blogger Mickey Kaus, a near audible gasp. For Hillary Clinton, next in line at the debate, an unmissable opportunity. She pounced: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I will not promise to meet with the leaders of these countries during my first year.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 And she then proceeded to give the reasons any graduate student could tick off: You don't want to be used for their propaganda. You need to know their intentions. Such meetings can make the situation worse.She is wrong - and right. Sure you need to know their intentions first. And sure no-one wants to be used for propaganda - that's the points I agree. But propaganda and misquoting already happens, even ignoring the government is taken for propaganda, like: \"Look what they do to us, and America doesn't even protest - so they must support them\". Such meetings would make things clear instead of worse. Just to make sure no one missed how the grizzled veteran showed up the clueless rookie, the next day Clinton told The Quad-City Times of Davenport, Iowa, that Obama's comment \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"was irresponsible and frankly naive.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2That IS a slap in the face and tells about Bush's total lack of diplomatic skills: all leaders of countries are officially on one level no matter what system they represent, no matter if they are named President, Prime Minister, King, Chancellor or General Secretary: as long as their position means to be the leader of their country they are on ONE POLITICAL LEVEL with the President of the USA, and earn to be treated likewise. Who ever becomes the next President never should forget this. To be on the same stage as the leader of the world's greatest power is of course a prize. That is why the Chinese deemed it a slap in the face that President Bush last year denied President Hu Jintao the full state-visit treatment. The presence of an American president is a valued good to be rationed \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac and granted only in return for important considerations. Moreover, summits can also be traps if they're not wired in advance for success, such as Nixon's trip to China, for which Henry Kissinger had already largely hammered out the famous Shanghai communique. You don't go hoping for the best, as Hillary's husband learned at the 2000 Camp David summit, when Yasser Arafat's refusal of Israel's peace offer brought Arafat worldwide opprobrium \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac from which he sought (successfully, as it turned out) to escape by launching the second intifada. Such can be the consequences of ill-prepared summits.Even a summit is using diplomacy. If summits are needed to bring back peace and stability in these \"rogue states\" (which are \"rogue\" because the Bush administration said so) without killing more people so why not? Obama may not have known he made an error, but his staff sure did. In the post-debate spin room, his closest adviser, David Axelrod, was already backpedaling, pretending that Obama had been talking about diplomacy and not summitry with rogue state leaders. Obama enthusiasts might want to write this off as a solitary slip. Except that this was the second time. The first occurred in another unscripted moment. During the April 26 South Carolina candidates' debate, Brian Williams asked what kind of change in the U.S. military posture abroad Obama would order in response to a hypothetical al-Qaeda strike on two American cities. Well, what's wrong with that? First take care of the victims, then you can find out who it was and punish them. Strange that they need months of investigation when people are murdered to get all evidences to get their killer; but on 9/11 the killers were \"known for sure\" just a couple days later... Obama's answer: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Well, the first thing we would have to do is make sure that we've got an effective emergency response \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac something that this administration failed to do when we had a hurricane in New Orleans.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Asked to be commander in chief, Obama could only play first-responder in chief. Caught off guard, and without his advisers, he simply slipped into two automatic talking points: emergency response and its corollary \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac the obligatory Katrina Bush-bash. When the same question came to Hillary, she again pounced: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I think a president must move as swiftly as is prudent to retaliate.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2That's BS. Retaliation leads to retaliation, to a mere coil of violence - Hillary wants war? This way she never stops it. Retaliatory attack did not come up in Obama's 200-word meander into multilateralism and intelligence gathering.Is that so bad nowadays? Haven't the USA lost just more than enough lives? Aren't all the deaths caused by US troops in the wars and invasions since 1945 not enough? The next USA President should stop seeing themselves as a war president but rather should be \"The President Who Brings Back Peace\" These gaffes lead to one of two conclusions: (1) Obama is inexplicably unable to think on his feet while standing on South Carolina soil, or (2) Obama is not ready to be a wartime president. During our 1990s holiday from history, being a national security amateur was not an issue. Between the 1991 death of the Soviet Union and the terror attacks of 2001, foreign policy played almost no part in our presidential campaigns.Big mistake. But post-Sept. 11, 2001, as during the Cold War, the country demands a serious commander in chief. It is hard to imagine that with all the electoral tides running in their favor, the Democrats would risk it all by nominating a novice for a wartime presidency.(/quote]Time to stop that war started by Bush. Even if [quote]Do the Democrats want to risk strike three, another national security question blown, but this time perhaps in a final presidential debate before the '08 election, rather than a midseason intraparty cattle call?

But this the Washington Post and other media of right-wing people can't understand. Post: About the \"chemical weapons\": These were just a bunch of different chemicals that some scientists in Japan said \"when combined, they can be harmful\". That doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t prove anything. There are a lot of items in the U.S. that you can buy, combine, make into a bomb or deadly agent, etc. I can concur. Some years ago, after a discussion about the need of having water supplies secured, a friend of mine showed me a copy of his dissertation in Toxicology which he made in the 80's, proving that it's possible to kill an entire town by using simple stuff everyone can buy in Grocery stores, Do-It-Yourself stores and other shops: he named several different harmless materials, which, solved in water and mixed in the right combination, would produce a poison within a few hours he claimed to be \"LD100 50MG/L\", being not detectable anymore after 24 hrs... Don't know what kind of poison this may have been but it sounded evil. But anyway: With the right knowledge and intention, each town in each country has WMD -- I wonder that the terrorists haven't used them yet. | 2385) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 610942](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=610942)) Posted 29 Jul 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while having my pre-breakfast Not over $36,900 15% of taxable $36,900 but not over $89,150 $5,535, plus 28% of the excess over $36,900.

I have to disagree, Thorin. All that would happen is that the corrupt officials in the countries that the majority of illegal aliens are coming from would pocket that money that they don't have to pay back. None of it would go to improve the conditions in the country itself. Why do you think that America looks so good to all those Mexicans that cross the border?

It's the same way I do in civil matters: I make contracts when I think they are right, and I quit them when I think they base on false [or missing] information. Both with all consequences. IMHO even soldiers should use their heads to think for themselves, and not just as a holder for their helmets. They are having their finger on the triggers, not their superiors. And if it comes to a law-suit about war-crime, the soldiers are the first being sued, not their superiors - as it's the soldiers not their superiors who die in the field first. In such a militaristic country I think it takes much more than a coward to desert from military service.

I do find it strange to decide at what point someone becomes legal and when they are illegal. Welcome to gov't. It's called \"by fiat,\" which means, because they said so. I also thought that the whole basis of capitalism was to have a freely moving workforce so that workers could go where the work is. Eh, you're right in theory, but no rational person makes the claim that the U.S. or the U.K. are purely capitalist societies. They're socialist/mixed economies based on the imposition of force upon whim. Well, I would say I'm rather rational (not by objectivistic definition though, but by common sense) And based on my experience with socialist systems, there are a lot of improvements needed to call the US a socialist economy - even more than in the UK which is a capitalistic economy. I agree that if employers weren't so keen to employ the cheaper (and because of the law) easily exploitable labour there wouldn't be such a problem. Do you understand why no one pays the paper boy $110K per year? Do you get why even the venerable Michael Moore himself doesn't pay the kid that mows his lawn $500K (besides the fact that his multi-million dollar condo doesn't have a lawn, it's just an example)? Besides the fact that your examples were ridiculous, I think there is a need for minimum wages. It's only just that a person working 35 to 40 hours a week don't need a second or third job to earn enough for a scanty life. I also suspect that if the more affluent Western countries didn't interfere with their governments, blockade, impose trade restrictions, demand repayment on ridiculous loans disguised as aid and didn't destabilise, sell arms too, over throw governments and generally pirate and bully their way around the less well off countries, there wouldn't be so many people living in such bad conditions that they were so desperate to work illegally in America in the first place. You're right. But oh, hey, well, this is what gov'ts all over the world do, by very nature of the fact that their populace has generally begged them to meddle in the affairs of others. Boy HOWDY do they meddle, they do. And the gov'ts that these south of the southern U.S. border countries have got, well, they ain't no picnic.

Too many people mean pollution and deforestation. This may be causing global warming, too.No. not necessarily. Make people pollute less - and especially make the industry pollute less, since they are producing the main sources of the pollution: one-way packages, throwaway products; low quality stuff so when it`s broken you have to throw it away and buy a new one. deforestation is mainly because of 1)the huge mono-culture fields or meadows enforced by companies - and too little planting of new trees; 2) today almost nothing really needs to be made out of real wood. especially tropical wood. You can gather the brushwood, or take the sick or dead trees when you need wood only for burning. AFAIK, to avoid deforestation it's needed to plant at least 10 young trees for every old tree taken. It's not the population, it's the irresponsible way we people, and especially the industry(!) treats Nature. People rape Mother Nature just for making money. Here, in the US, the population continues to grow, mostly because of the immigrants, illegal and legal. If the kid's not here it's not necessary to watch out for its welfare. LOL! Here in Germany, the population decreases despite of immigration. In 2005 Germany had 0.1% less people than 5 years before - though the number of immigrants has risen! And at least 10% (7.4 millions) of the entire German population already are officially Alien Residents (okay we don't give babies born here in Germany automatically the German citizenship, so there are a lot alien residents of the 2nd and 3rd generation). But without children there is no future, no growth. Everywhere in this country there's incessant development that takes away the trees, replaces them with asphalt and wrecks the environment. see my reply to the second part: It's mainly the industry, the Big Business, which destroys nature. | 2424) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : thread for RECONSTRUCTION](forum_thread.php?id=41103) ( 608393](forum_thread.php?id=41103&postid=608393)) Posted Jul 2007 by [thorin Post: good night kenzie! winning while 2425) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Great post, Jeffrey!!!

A technician was asked about his opinion to the so-called \"1 liter car\" (1 liter fuel per 100km). This man laughed out loud and said that there would have been inventions and technologies existing since the 80's which were enabling a car to need less than an ounce of fuel per 100km without any loss of speed or horse-power and without putting the trunk full of batteries, but were only locked away by request of some big companies. I only can imagine these technologies could have something to do with hybrid drives: a small petrol or Diesel engine running a generator, this giving power to electric motors in the wheels for example.

When I see a 25-year-old girl that's had five children I think she should be sterilized and put in jail. The young (and maybe not so young) men are to blame, too, and should also be sterilized and jailed. Each kid that's born today will want a car in 16 years, a house in 20 and more kids of his/her own. This kind of stuff's not regulated enough. When somebody has that fifth (or more) child, he/she is congratulated. That image should be reversed, just like smoking was. I've heard somewhere that the Supreme Being said \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" We've already done that 60 times in the last 2,000 years. Isn't that enough? Nope. According to what I read on several sources, the Earth has enough resources to feed twice it's nowadays population - the resources only have to be shared the right way. And about cars: if car-sharing were popular, you wouldn't need a car for everyone. A nation needs as much as 2 children per family to keep the population on an equal level, more than 2 to let the population grow. Most nations in the Western hemisphere have statistically only 1.25 to 1.4 children per family. So why should families not be encouraged and supported to bring new life into this world, to let the nation grow again?

Can the idea of freedom of the will be reconciled with the scientific outlook or is free will an illusion?

This is done because no one in thier right mind thinks that any single drug company should have exclusive rights to life-saving medications. That's a monopoly. Drug companies have used the protections to keep development costs high. Development costs they have been intentionally overstating. Shortening the amount of time a drug is protected under patent will lead to more competition, while making the companies reduce their development costs. I disagree with your statement on entry costs. It's too speculative. Too speculative for you maybe. Economists are well aware of the relationship between entry costs and market participation. As far as the rest, well, you're entitled to your opinion. What actually happens, given the high entry costs, and the massive R&D costs, and the high regulatory costs, is that if you take away the rights to the physical product, it never gets invented in the first place. Why would anyone bother with producing it to begin with? In other words, you put downward pressure on creating these things. Pharmaceuticals especially, given the exposure to liability. So taking these all into account, they're all disincentives to creating new drugs and bringing them to market. Taking away more of that incentive, i.e., \"stripping away some of the rights drug companies have on drug ingredients,\" and adding a more onerous burden is not a recipe for improving the system--it's just more of what created the problems in the first place. The original drug developer may be compensated by the generic manufacturer. Drug companies could also be exempt from paying any taxes. Fair, since they produce things that help us stay healthy. Few people would object to that I think. Oh clearly, that's all it would take. Thank god the lemmings won't object. The bad thing is that Pharmaceutical companies and even more and more Hospitals, MDs, and medical staff don't follow the Hippocratic Oath (everything to the benefit of the sick) but do more and more just for the benefit of their bank accounts. | 2476) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Interesting that there are nationalists/chauvinists even here on this board.

I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God. I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick. I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.

What about equality of chances? One of the reasons for the contracts in Law between the state and an individual called Intellectual Property. The restrictions on others to use the knowledge of a Patient will protect the inventor, and holder, for 20 years, provided the license fee is paid. In this case, subject to paying the fees, the inventor will have spent much effort and resource to bring their idea to market. This is censorship of a different kind. I know one (the Electrics and Physics teacher in a former job training I attended) who was sued because of violating patent laws, only because he went public with an invention of his own one (1) week after another guy in another part of Germany brought a similar device to the patent office and paid the expensive patent fees. Both had invented similar things independently at nearly the same time. But the other guy was faster. If they'd entered that office in their different areas at the same time - whose intellectual property would this invention be? | 2500) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Jul 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning before leaving. c boards](forum_index.php) : in 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Having looked at Google I found one ;) Follow [this link](http://blog.orbmu2k.de/sidebar-gadgets/boinc-gadget/) :D | 2502) Jul 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: sorry, but although there have been socialist countries, there still haven't been any country which had communism in which \"...houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished.\"(Kropotkin) The constitutions of the socialist and \"Communist\" countries defined that these countries were \"developing towards communism\" Heh. They had all the guns they needed and they had near absolute power. That was all they needed for this workers utopia. According to theory \"communism stresses egalitarianism and the abolition of social hierarchy and class distinctions that arise from unequal wealth distribution, the abolition of capitalism and money, and the collective production and distribution of wealth by means of voluntary associations. In [...] communism, the state and property would no longer exist. Each individual and group would be free to contribute to production and to satisfy their needs based on their own choice. Systems of production and distribution would be managed by their participants.\" And that was such a kool idea that massive walls needed to be built, to force the worker to acknowledge that someone else knew better what was best for him. It's also why the system will always fail if people are forced to participate: while they are \"free to contribute\" at the point of a gun, they are also free to do nearly nothing and ride the system. I don't know where you got that picture from. I've never seen anyone pointing guns on somebody in a factory back in that time. But I saw that people who were against the system were arrested - like in every other system. An example about \"force to work\" Everyone had a right to get a job - and everyone who had a job had the duty to do their job. According to Constitution, and according to the Laws. When someone didn't come to work without an obvious reason (vacation, day-off, sick...), they got a visit by their union representative to see what's going on. If that person wasn't at home and not in a hospital around, or was just too lazy to work or too busy doing private work, this person was asked to go to work again asap, getting unpaid day-offs for the time missing -- or in case of lack of co-operation, the person was picked up and accompanied to work by a police officer for a certain time, using no violence at the first time, as long as there was co-operation. About The Berlin Wall: You forgot maybe, that there were 2 separate German countries. The Federal Republic of Germany (called West Germany) - founded on 23 May 1949 out of the French, British and American Zones (declared \"fully sovereign\" 5 May 1955), and the German Democratic Republic (called East germany, or \"the Zone\"), founded 7 Oct 1949. West Berlin (which was enclosed by the Wall in 1961) was in fact [occupied until 1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Berlin). And doesn't have a country the right to secure their borders?

I'm fine with the fact that one is earning more than the other one - according to a different amount of work and to different responsibilities; and I'm even fine with the fact that people earn money doing business - that's all okay. But I think the surpluses should be shared: Those who have a lot shall give a lot, those who have little shall give little... that all who can will participate into the growth of the entire nation. That there is an equality of chances as well as an equality of rights and duties. Like a chain being as strong as its weakest link, a society can be judged in how they treat their weakest people. Actually, surprisingly, this approach is an industrial capitilist one. To explain, with examples such as Henry Ford, and Friederich Krupp, who recognised that the needs of workers did include money, but were not always the biggest motivator. Friedrich Krupp, for example, provided health care, subsidised housing and pension programs for workers. His workforce grew from 1, to over 20,000 by the time of his death in the 1800's, the biggest company that had ever been in that time. [This was when child labour and slavery was commonplace, he made use of neither] Henry Ford initially had problems that 100 positions in his company would need 300 people hired per year. Very high costs for retraining, lost production and seeking new workers. Better working conditions ( and pay, twice the going rate) as well as meeting the psychological needs for personal growth safety and welfare, meant these costs actually dropped and productivity was vastly increased. In other words industrial capitalism, in its purest form, recognises its workers as a major investment. In many many companies this is not recognised and those 'bad businessmen' generate a lot of heartache, and end up going bust due to only getting bad workers, a bad reputation, and losing business. These companies generally go broke. Take a look around at successful companies and how they treat their workers. You'll find the most sucessful, have the best conditions. Unbridled capitalism has its problems mainly in the form of monopolies. Once a monopoly has been established, there is a much lower incentive for that monopoly to either improve service, or to avoid price gouging. Quite often a monopoly will have a war chest large enough to drop prices and improve service for long enough to put any new competition out of business. Then it is back to the high prices and poor service. A truly competetive market is much more efficient at providing service. Communism has its problems mainly in the form of ineffiency and motivation. If there is no personal benefit for working harder, many people won't (some people will work hard just because the like to, but not enough to make the system work). There are some services that are best provided by governments or heavily regulated monopolies. There are other services best served by a competitive market. sorry, but although there have been socialist countries, there still haven't been any country which had communism in which \"...houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished.\"(Kropotkin) The constitutions of the socialist and \"Communist\" countries defined that these countries were \"developing towards communism\" According to theory communism stresses egalitarianism and the abolition of social hierarchy and class distinctions that arise from unequal wealth distribution, the abolition of capitalism and money, and the collective production and distribution of wealth by means of voluntary associations.

In my opinion all countries will develop from capitalism to socialism to communism, when the time is right. So Marx believed. He believed the shift would be permanent. However, history has shown that there is a strong tendency to 'swing back' towards capitalism because of economic efficiency. A current case in point is the People's Republic of China. They are overcoming the effects of many decades of economic inefficiency due to Communism and are expanding the size of their economy many-fold by adopting some 'capitalist' reforms. Like children who are taught to grow out of \"have, have, have\" and into \"let's share what I have\" by their parents, I think it should be taught to the entire humankind to grow out of greed towards voluntary sharing. In my opinion it's all a matter of education. Well, that is a nice idea, and I am NOT being sarcastic. It would be a very good thing if ALL of humanity could do this. Many of us do already, its called donating to charity, or even just 'helping out a friend'. If all of humanity could be convinced of the wisdom of giving part of their surplus to those that are needy, it would be positively wonderful! But then, why would we then need to make it mandatory by having a socialistic or communistic government/economy? Would it not be better then to enjoy the economic efficiency of a capitalist system, knowing that the needs of needy would be taken care of by our common generosity without it being mandated by the government through force-of-arms?

In my opinion it's all a matter of education. | 2520) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Just sneaking in to say: I'm sorry, Mr. Gray, that this thread became off-topic. | 2521) |[Message by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Well - I can also explain you this if you want.

And I see, from your 5 posts in these SETI forums, that your intentions here are generated by something quite different, yet transparent. Keppler is a big name in science history. Out of respect for your family I say only this: There is more to life than meets the eye on TV. Nice intro Keppler, Any thoughts on the topic or just your comment about my analogies? yes, my thoughts are that you will take up any socialist argument that you read in the blogs or get from left wing tv. yes, my experience comes from real life. when you were in diapers i was patroling your wonderful sociailst iron curtain with a machine gun in my hands. believe me, that fence was not to keep our troops out but was to keep their people from escaping that wonderful socialist utopia. I - being grown up there - can you even tell why. There was actually no reason except the blinding fairy tales seen on West German TV channels and told in West German radio channels that made East German people believe they had it better in the Western part. When the Wall came down, and Germany united again, those who believed these fairy tales were the first ones who wished the Wall back asap. They'd never believed stories about the gap between poor and rich, about unemployment, about homeless people, about people begging in the streets unless they saw it themselves. We in East Germany had no unemployment, no poor people (well not that gap between poor and rich) and a social system earning that name. You remember the East German uprising in June 1953? The West Berlin based radio station RIAS, together with some other West German senders, jammed all East German radio channels and first made the East Berlin workers discontent with the actual conditions; then after they began to strike, RIAS spread the lie that the East German government had surrendered and left their country alone. This lead to a rebellion which only could be stopped by the help of the Soviet Army and their tanks. Now tell me who controlled RIAS back in the cold war. | 2523) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : [Coltan..the hidden computer and mobile phone.](forum_thread.php?id=40870) ( [Message 604816](forum_thread.php?id=40870&postid=604816)) Posted 17 Jul 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: It was US banks with the help of the CIA changing young republics especially in Middle America into banana republics, totally depending on export of fruits produced in mono-culture.

Have you not seen us try to work with moderators? We've tried, only to be confronted with mods sticking up for each other. Moderators are not bad, but the actions of a few give mods a bad name. I cannot complain to the moderators about other moderators because of a perceived \"Good old boys club\". The only way you can get attention to your plight is by going nuts. Probably what happened to M****y. Yes, going nuts about a perceived problem is a good way to get banned. Politely taking your request to the SETI Mods email list will get it discussed. But it will not always get the action changed. Has everyone that emailed a request gotten an answer, or have some been left hanging in limbo? Would it help if there were always an answer after consideration? Note that consideration can take quite a while as it is all by email. Well, I made some complaints, for example. I even used the red X on inappropriate posts. And you (and even the ex mods among the participants in this thread) may remember that I responded to almost all of the forum moderation notices sent to me; mostly agreeing, sometimes asking if I could re-post something without the moderated quotation (when I was moderated because of quoting stuff later deleted), sometimes even questioning decisions. Fine with me. But I expected more replies to my responds than I actually got... Back to the recent incidents: Strangely at least some mods knew exactly whom I meant when I critized someone's bad behavior without naming names. I got my punishment for that, fine with me. I didn't get angry about it (would have reacted likewise), but I expected that these persons were made to stop it. Neither in this paragraph nor in the posts involved I didn't mention any behavior of mods. It was read into the message. Correctly.

Nice to see you here again! *hug* :O Oh I missed to meet you :-(( by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I find it strange that a deliberately general discussion has changed into one that is assumed to be a specific one. Of course there are some single cases which seem to destroy trust into the setimod list, because some single mods don't seem to obey the moderation policy. But, I think it's not possible to generalize. Most mods I experienced are at least good. But I think, MK, it's quite difficult for a user who got emails showing they came from someone of the mod list to trust the mods in general. Whether or not the header was spoofed before it arrived at this user is another question in this moment. I think I am kind of a computer freak myself, but I'm no hacker - so I must admit I have no idea how a complete email header could be spoofed except by some huge effort photoshoping the screenshot which can be easily found out by comparing the screenshot to a forwarded copy of the mail itself. In my opinion a mod should try to avoid even to seem unjust. Moderators are on a level where all users ought to trust them. So even when it only seems that a mod did something wrong, he or she should either resign (IMHO) or proof that he or she is not guilty. Not for judgment (which says that an accused person is innocent until it's proved otherwise) but as a matter of honor. In principle, it's not the single mod who then is affected by such incident but the entire mod-list. Like if one police officer was watched taking money from a civil person, in the eyes of the watcher it's not officer X who took money but \"the police\" who is corrupt. You understand my point? IMHO a mod should try as hard as they can to be a shining example. Most of you do try already, and I appreciate that very much. I know many of you add a comment to a forum hide notice or forum move notice when a post was moderated to explain why it was done -- and I think this is a very good idea. It shows us users that there was a reason for this action, that this action was not done on a whim. Please keep this as a general rule. Unfortunately some don't give any reasons so that users have to search for reason by themselves why their post could have been affected. I'd like to ask you to keep writing reasons in these action notices. | 2533) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: [Here](http://www.consciousmedianetwork.com/movie/america.htm) you can find a trailer of and information about \"AMERICA: Freedom To Fascism.\" In her review, Devra Hill wrote: I don't know anyone who enjoys paying income taxes but most people think it's the law. This eye-opening film exposes the fact that there is no law saying the average American citizen has to pay income taxes. Aaron Russo is an award winning filmmaker who produced \"The Rose\" and \"Trading Places.\" Recently, he decided to discover the truth behind this \"no law\" rumor concerning the ratification of the 16th Amendment also known as the \"Tax Amendment.\" He interviews government officials from the IRS, FBI, Politicians and tax attorneys and authors to find out exactly what is the Federal Reserve. Even he is surprised that the Federal Reserve is not part of our federal government but is a private banking corporation operated by unidentified private bankers. The Federal Reserve has the right to counterfeit money because now money is not backed by gold! The Federal Reserve is a banking cartel. Thus the government works for a private bank and the bank works for its owners. The Federal Reserve is an illegal corporation. Many people think we have to pay income taxes to help pay for government services but there are many other taxes that pay for those services. This tax is what the English fought against, \"Taxation without representation.\" Income taxes could be compared to paying for protection against the government so they won't put you in jail but if every citizen stood up and said \"No, I'm not paying income taxes\" the government would have to change just from the overwhelming population of protesters. The jails are so crowded now that they couldn't possibly put all the law-abiding citizens in also. Recently our so-called Democratic government is talking about forcing everyone to carry a National ID Card and having a computer \"Spy Chip\" placed under our skin to track every move we make. We must fight back against this. Watching \"America: Freedom to Fascism\" was like watching a true life horror film. A Fascist Nation is one in which big government and big corporations work together to stifle the people and Mr. Russo says he hopes he can wake up Americans to the myth that America is NOT still the land of liberty that it started out to be. | 2534) |[Message 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: even though I do buy cheap, I always try to buy no GM products.

In a much disputed master-plan, all the glacial rivers and geothermal potential of the largest wilderness of Europe would be harnessed for aluminium production. Activists from around the world have gathered to protect Europe's largest remaining wilderness and oppose Rio Tinto/ALCAN, ALCOA, Century/RUSAL and other transnational companies. Icelanders were joined by activists from Africa, South and North America and Europe for an international conference 'Global consequences of heavy industry and large dams' organized by Saving Iceland. \"Progress is painted by some as huge projects, large scale development. In all our countries, these have become disasters, socially, ecologically and economically. Progress is a plenitude of small solutions. We should let a thousand flowers bloom,\" states a declaration from the conference, formulated by consensus by participants. The conference looked at the effects of large dams on ecosystems, climate and communities, on the role of aluminium in the arms industry and military and on 'green-washing' strategies of large corporations. Activists also recognized the remarkable similarities in corporate strategies between their different countries and continents, on how communities and governments are manipulated and environmental impacts covered up. A next conference is intended in Trinidad and Tobago, where local communities oppose an ALCOA aluminium smelter. Other campaigns that were presented included the Movimento dos Atingidos por Barragens (Movement of Dam Affected People, Brazil), Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada Movement, India). This week there have been a number of protests in Reykjavik. A dam was built in front of the prime ministers office and Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping held a sermon in Reykjavik's largest mall, connecting heavy industry with consumerism. Activists have now set up camp in Mosfellshei\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0i, South-West Iceland, near a Century aluminium smelter. Further direct actions and a street party have been announced for the 14th of July. Saving Iceland held direct action camps in the east of Iceland in 2005 and 2006 opposing construction of the Karahnjukar dams and a smelter in Reydarfjordur. | Jul 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning again, and pondering what I may prepare for lunch...

When I entered a cow stable the first time working there, I was badly surprised. It was total different from the cattle stable I saw as a child in the village where I grew up. Here they had really little place per animal; the cattle slept on rubber covered concrete instead of hay; they almost never were driven outside - and the workers (I deny to call them farmers) touched the cows as seldom as possible, almost only when attaching them to the milking machine. Totally in opposite to the farms I remembered as a child. Similar were all the other animal stables I visited while working for that company... Everything changed into heartless, efficient \"meat and milk production\", no real farming anymore. They don't ask what's best for the animals: they ask what's best for their wallet. It took me a couple days to be able to eat meat again after I started to work there - but then I saw that even crop are treated in industrial measure: I saw then that either I would become poor buying crop and meat from traditional farmers or I would starve.

Opposition is strong. By MARK LANDLER Published: July 13, 2007 FRANKFURT, July 12 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac Germany, fearful of being the next major target for Islamic terrorists, is edging away from its deep aversion to intrusive and harsh enforcement tactics, provoking a storm of protest from those who recall the official brutality of Nazism and Communism in decades past. Sensing a growing threat, Germany\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s top security official, Wolfgang Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble, is breaking down resistance within the government to surreptitious online searches of computers belonging to people they deem suspicious. He is pushing for a law to allow security forces to shoot down a plane commandeered by hijackers. And he said this week that Germany should consider detaining potential terrorists and approving the killing of terrorist leaders abroad. Such proposals are anathema to many in a country that has sought to eradicate any vestiges of state-sanctioned savagery by erecting a legal framework that enshrines the rights of the individual over the state. Critics say the changes would erode civil liberties and jeopardize Germany\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s hard-won rule of law. Yet by all accounts Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble, the interior minister and a canny conservative politician who has used a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990, has Chancellor Angela Merkel\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s staunch backing to shift the debate, even as she has made it clear that she will not endorse detentions or targeted killings. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We have threats that we didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t even know 10 years ago,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 she said Tuesday on German television. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I want an interior minister who will grapple with these new threats.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Germany\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s debate underscores the growing conviction of security officials here that German cities will not escape the kinds of attacks that have bloodied London, Glasgow, Madrid and Istanbul since 9/11, a plot hatched by militant Muslims who used Hamburg as a refuge. Last month Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble warned that Germany faced a heightened threat of attack, possibly even a suicide bombing, because of its military engagement in Afghanistan. His deputy, August Hanning, said the danger level was comparable to that of the months before 9/11. The debate also comes at a time of rising tension within Germany\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s large, mostly Turkish, Muslim population. On Thursday, four major Turkish groups boycotted an annual meeting on integration held by Mrs. Merkel, to protest the recent tightening of German immigration laws. Given the growing concerns, several experts here said, it is time for Germany to re-evaluate the balance between personal liberties and collective security in its counterterrorism policy. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We need this discussion about how far we have to go, and how far we can go legally,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Guido Steinberg, who advised the previous chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6der, on terrorism issues. Mr. Steinberg, now a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said some of Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s proposals, particularly targeted killings, went too far. But he said Germany needed to close other loopholes in its laws, including one that distinguishes between giving material support to a terrorist group, which is a crime, and simply promoting its message, which is not. While few here want to set up a German outpost like the Guant\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1namo Bay military prison, current laws in Germany prevent the authorities from detaining people who they believe might be terrorist conspirators but whom they cannot extradite. Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble has been calling for more muscular policies to combat terrorism since he joined the current government in 2005. A seasoned Christian Democratic leader, Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble, 64, is regarded as a shrewd tactician and one of the political heavyweights in Mrs. Merkel\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s cabinet. In January he said he would seek a constitutional amendment to allow authorities to shoot down a hijacked airplane to head off a terrorist attack. The Federal Constitutional Court struck down a similar law proposed by the previous government in 2006. He also has not hesitated to seize on terrorist threats, at home or abroad, to press his agenda. Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s latest public-relations campaign came days after the botched car-bombings in London. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The old categories no longer apply,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said in an interview in the German weekly Der Spiegel. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We have to clarify whether our constitutional state is sufficient for confronting the new threats.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Describing a situation in which Osama bin Laden\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s exact whereabouts were discovered, Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble said, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The Americans would execute him with a missile, and most people would say, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbThank God.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 These remarks, which were confirmed by a ministry spokesman, brought heated criticism from opposition leaders and even some Social Democratic members of his own \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"grand coalition\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 government. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He would lead the country down a very dangerous path,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said the co-chairman of the opposition Green Party, Reinhard B\u00c3\u00c2\u00bctikofer. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He is advocating the exact opposite of what Prime Minister Gordon Brown has demonstrated so admirably: a combination of determination and equanimity.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 No other European country has publicly debated its terrorism laws since the failed British attacks. One of the few responses of any kind has come from France\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who reiterated his support for installing 1,000 closed-circuit surveillance cameras in Paris. The timing and nature of the debate in Germany troubled some experts. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"One of the time-honored tactics of terrorists is to draw governments into overreacting,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Gijs de Vries, a Dutchman who is the former counterterrorism coordinator for the European Union. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Governments should resist public pressure to pile on new measures after each incident.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 But Germany is also debating this issue now because of its deep involvement in Afghanistan. Germany has 3,000 troops there, part of a NATO force that has battled a persistent Taliban insurgency. With the Parliament scheduled to vote in October on whether to extend the deployment, security officials worry that Germans, either in Afghanistan or at home, could become targets for attacks. Last July Germany narrowly avoided a potentially deadly attack after a pair of suitcase bombs failed to explode on commuter trains. The suspects, from Lebanon, were said to be enraged by satirical cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper. That close call, Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble said in Der Spiegel, shows, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We could be struck at any time.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Still, for now, he is facing a German public that treasures its liberties at least as much as its security. Already, his campaign has drawn unflattering historical parallels. On the Internet, a group promoting data privacy has sold T-shirts with Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s image above the slogan \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Stasi 2.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac a reference to an \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"improved\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 version of the reviled State Security Ministry of the former East Germany. Peter Waldmann, a terrorism expert and emeritus professor at the University of Augsburg, said even a major attack would not overturn the German consensus in favor of protecting individual rights. The shock of learning that the 9/11 attacks had been plotted in Hamburg was not enough, Mr. Waldmann said, because Germans comforted themselves that the threat was directed against the United States, not at Germany itself. Now, authorities say the threat is directed squarely at Germans, which may make it tougher for people here to dismiss Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s arguments. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"If something happened, the same people who are criticizing him for going too far would criticize him for not going far enough,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Eckart Klein, a professor of law at the University of Potsdam. Some experts suggest that the real goal of Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s campaign is to win agreement on rules allowing secret searches of computer hard drives \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac something that seems within reach after officials from the Social Democratic Party said this week that they were open to a dialogue on the issue. As for his more draconian proposals, Mr. Sch\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4uble\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s aides said he welcomed the sharp reaction. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s trying to force our society to face up to these really difficult questions, for example, killing a terrorist,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Christian Sachs, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The German public has tried to stick its head in the sand, ignoring this dimension of this unorthodox war.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 | 2577) |[Message [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: A number of studies have suggested that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently.

Otherwise, scientific theories are treated like a source of faith as long as they aren't proved 100%, and there IS a kind of inquisition going on in science. Scientists whose theories differ from the accepted ones can lose their reputation, even their career, even though their theory is proved true later (see the arguments about 10 or 11 dimensions which eventually ended up in the \"M-theory\" after the scientists involved gave up their ignorance). Even the research all of us are participating in by crunching here is based on the faith in the possibility to find radio signals from some extra-terrestrial intelligence by listening into space with this huge radio telescope in Arecibo. As long as there is no proved signal we still trust that there must be a sign, we believe that it is possible. That's nothing but faith. Faith is not only religious. To have faith means to believe, and to trust. You, R/B, might believe in pure science and in neo-liberalism, I believe in other subjects.

As he frequently did, he telephoned his friend, Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, curator at East London's small museum to see if she wanted to look over the contents of the catch for anything interesting. At the harbour Latimer noticed a blue fin and took a closer look. There she found what she later described as \"the most beautiful fish I had ever seen, five feet long, and a pale mauve blue with iridescent silver markings.\" Failing to find a description of the creature in any of her books, she attempted to contact her friend, Professor James Leonard Brierley Smith, but he was away for Christmas. Unable to preserve the fish, she reluctantly sent it to a taxidermist. When Smith returned, he immediately recognized it as a coelacanth, known only from fossils. Smith named the fish Latimeria chalumnae in honor of Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer and the waters in which it was found. The two discoverers received immediate recognition and the fish became known as a \"living fossil.\" The 1938 coelacanth is still on display in the East London Museum. Coelacanths first appear in the fossil record in the Middle Devonian, about 410 million years ago. Prehistoric species of coelacanth lived in many bodies of water in Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic times. Although now represented by only two living species, as a group the coelacanths were once very successful with many genera and species that left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction, and past which point no fossils are known. It is often claimed that the coelacanth has remained unchanged for millions of years but in fact the living species and even genus are unknown from the fossil record. Coelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards and belly up to locate their prey presumably utilizing its rostral gland. Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that they can slow down their metabolisms at any time, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of hibernation mode. In accordance with the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species treaty, the coelacanth was added to Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in 1989. The treaty forbids international trade for commercial purposes and regulates all trade, including sending specimens to museums, through a system of permits. In 1998, the total coelacanth population was estimated to have been 500 or fewer, a number that would threaten the survival of the species. | 2617) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Politics](forum_forum.php?id=23) : political forum??](forum_thread.php?id=40807) ( 601673](forum_thread.php?id=40807&postid=601673)) 11 By it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s nature, SETI can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t help but be political.

I think since we all are humans, our success must be measured in this order: Are we as good as we can be to ourselves, to our friends, to our family? Are we a good father / mother to our children? How much time do we spend with our family and how intense do we spend it? Are we doing as many good things as we are able to (both in money and time, without taking it away from the needs of the family)? Are we as good as we can be at work without becoming antisocial? In a nutshell: I measure success in how human is the person, not how addictive in working or how rich he or she is. A mother and house-wife can be more successful to me than a workaholic top-manager who is hated by everyone. What do you think? | 2621) |[Message 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Jeffrey, your answers just help prove the point of the author of that news story that Misfit quoted. For all you employers out there: Once hired, young people too often come in on Day One wanting to be vice president Odd, I've never wanted to advance, simply because I've never wanted to become like my boss... What? You don't wish to be successful like your boss? I, actually, consider success not in the bank account but whether or not I can look in my own eyes when seeing my face in the mirror. My boss can be wealthy like Gates, but to be seen as successful in my eyes they also have to be human. An \"Ebenezer Scrooge\" is not successful in my eyes, but just a poor lad. I met a former top manager the other day, who signed up a contract in the 90's to save a company from closing down using a strategy enabling him to run business without getting rid of any employer; but he nullified this contract after the owner (a bank) changed their mind only one week later & wanted him to fire 90% of the employers which meant to close down the factory. He not only gave his reasons to resign from the contract to his CEOs, but also went to the press and told them why he resigned. Even now, after all these years, he still is respected by the people in that town just because he didn't want to be the evil one. That's success. but not wanting to pay the dues to get there. Better phrased: In 5 years you'll advance so we'll work you like a slave and lay you off in 2. HeHeHe... If you equate 'doing your job (what you were hired to do), and doing it well' with 'slave labor', it is a wonder you lasted 2 years. Generally, businesses don't lay off their best employees if there is any way to avoid doing so. The best employees typically get offered other positions in the company. I experienced that too often it's not the best ones who are promoted but those who are most convenient to the bosses. This next one is a good one. They want to know what the company is going to do for them My only 3 interview questions: 1. What do you want me to do for you? Short answer: Improve the business'es profit. This is, indeed, the only reason why private sector businesses ever hire additional employees. Longer answer: you should at least have a good idea of what the job you are interviewing for entails. Asking this question indicates a lack of preparation and research, and would make me think twice about hiring you. Not necessarily. Sometimes the informations available are quite generally, so my question also often is: What exactly do you want me to do? Example: I am hired as an \"office worker\" - my job though is to call people from out of a call-center. Sometimes companies ask me in the interview what I am expecting to be paid. I usually answer to expect wages similar to the salary tariffs for that job. Though this expectation is a just one, it's mostly reason enough to say Good-Bye for them 2. What are you going to pay me for it? A brief discussion of this subject is ok. But try not to appear to be too curious or insistent on this topic. 3. Who will I have to put up with? This question is a huge red flag in the interviewing process. It indicates that you have difficulty with your interpersonal skills in the workplace. It indicates that hiring you would be a disaster waiting to happen, either with the other employees or with the customers of the business. I would terminate the interview as early as politely possible, wait a few days, then send you a 'we are sorry, but...' letter. Why? If the job description remains unclear in this subject, the question is a just one, isn't it? See my example of the \"office worker\". and they rarely think about what they intend to do for the company. See interview question number 1... In fact, the whole notion of working often seems like an inconvenience Yes, 60 hours a week at 10 bucks per hour is a major inconvenience to our personal lives... Oh... Joy... You try being an owner of a small business sometime. Having to work 80 to 100 (or more) hours a week is brutal. 60 hours per week is no big thing. Its only 5 12-hour days per week. But, at least if you are paid by the hour, most businesses are not going to want to let you work that much. 60 hours per week = 20 hours of overtime (1.5x pay rate) per week. In your example, that is an extra $100/week to help make up for the loss of your precious 'personal time'. I'm glad that the laws here in Germany do give the workers some rights, making a 60hrs week at least difficult. Well some companies find ways to bend these rules though. And I still hardly understand why it should be impossible to let 100 people work 6 hours a day instead of 50 people working 12 hrs a day. The computer program doesn't care how many posts are on its list. something they'll tolerate until they get a minute, between YouTube and iPods You've got a point there... Imagine how I feel being their coworkers... Goofing off at work? When an employee is 'on the clock', they need to be concentrating on their job. An employee who lets their attention wander away from their job at best is not contributing effectively towards their employer's profit. At worst, in some jobs, a distracted employee can get themselves (and others) severely injured or killed. I once saw a forklift driver who was listening to a 'walkman' (yeah, this was years ago) while he was driving his forklift. He was really 'getting into' whatever music he was listening to, twitching around like he was at a disco. He picked up a pallet from an upper shelf, and made a sharp turn while rapidly backing out. His forklife tipped over, and he was fatally crushed beneath it. Talk about a 'Fatal Distraction'... While, on the clock in an office job, things like accessing the internet for personal reasons or talking with one's S.O. on the phone are not usually dangerous to life and limb, they do stop (or greatly slow down) one from performing the tasks for which one is employed, thereby hurting the business that one is working for. Such distraction i think are fair reasons to fire somebody. But some companies are firing employees because they do such private things during lunch break! IMHO that's not okay. So can I have a job?... ;) The work ethic in this country has, for the most part, hit the skids. It had gotten bad a couple of decades ago, and is even worse now. You should see the bunch of bozos at my wife's job. If I was the manager there, at least half of them would be getting a pink slip. Standing around talking among themselves instead of waiting on customers (who are lined up waiting on them). Same thing with yacking on cellphones. Sneaking off and finding a seat somewhere and reading a magazine while they are not on break. Finding any excuse at all to not do their jobs. Argh. You want a job? Fine, but no business out there 'owes' you a job or anything else. You must not only convince an interviewer that you can make the business more profit, but also you must keep on demonstrating it. What goes around, comes around. If you do an excellent job at your job, your employer will do right by you (after all, he/she wants to keep you). When you get a job, you are selling your labor to the business that hired you. Nobody wants to buy an inferior product. Work is, in addition to being a four-letter word, well... work. It is not supposed to be easy. At the end of the day, you can either take pride in doing an excellent job or you can plot new and improved ways to slack off. Guess which group is going to get raises, promotions, and avoid being laid off or fired, and which group isn't.

Thus free music is either in the public domain or licensed under a public license. It does not mean that there should be no fee involved. The word free refers to freedom (as in free software), not to price. The above is from the Wikipedia entry you linked to. What that says to me is that, even though the music is in the public domain, the RIAA could still very well decide that they wanted to charge me fees for using it on an Internet Radio Station. I may be misreading it, but I don't want to wind up with the RIAA knocking on my door in six months or a year telling me I owe them a boatload of money. Most artists who put their art under Free License don't want any money for it - and as you see: you also have the right of free distribution. And isn't playing it on a website a kind of distribution?

Even to forbid smoking in general is stupid. People do a lot for their convenience. I know of people who worked in buildings where smoking was forbidden, who just went on a balcony or the fire stairs (right word?), or just leaned out of the window to have their smoke. What happened when they had forbidden alcohol? People had their drink served in tea cups declared it as tea - or had their bottles of booze and beer hidden in bags (like it's still seen in many towns). I think information serves more than restriction.

YAY! | [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: The GPL (for software) - Free Licenses about Music, Texts, Art, etc. are existing in similar manner, based on the same idea: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

But didnt I read that the founder of mothers against drunk drivers got popped for a 502 ? I didn't hear that. Who are you talking about? The woman who had her kid killed by a drunked driver. Who started madd. Dunno her name I think the question was surrounding the phrase \"Popped for a 502.\" ??? A 502 is a drunk driving ticket. They cost at least $10,000 and stay on your record for ten years. And your insurance just perhaps might go up a TAD !!!!! Here in Germany, when you're caught driving under the influence, you only lose your driver's license for a year or so, have to pass a \"medical-psychological exam\" and can drive again after that year after getting your driver's license back. Last year ago (or was it two years ago? Times fly...) a drunken, professional test driver drove a car too fast through a town, hit and killed a mother, fled from the place - and did not even have to pay a refund! The judge said: \"He is punished enough knowing to have killed someone, and having lost his income as a professional driver\"!!! | 2768) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [TLPTP may W # 38 - Grolsch Het Kanon, Black Beer & Theakstons all week end](forum_thread.php?id=40507) ( [Message 595040](forum_thread.php?id=40507&postid=595040)) Posted by Post: good night labbie. i'm pretty sure thorin never sleeps... almost...

In the parts of Greece that had 'democracy', only the citizens could vote... not all 'the people'. The citizens were composed of adult men that owned at least a certain amount of property. Not all that different from here and now in the USA, where it all too often seems that the 'rich guys' run the place. 2. All other problems with it (and they are legion) aside, public referendums instead of representative government as we have now would cost even more money. Putting on a national election is expensive, which is one reason we only do it once every two years. Not to mention all the political advertisements and additional bureaucracy that would go with it. Urgh! first: I meant according to the definition and not how it was done... second: No political advertisements or additional bureaucracy needed. Just simple easy to understand explanations as objective as possible with a multiple choice question (for example as an article in the News, or like a flyer), and some possibility to count the results (for example via a telephone or Internet hot-line), that's IMHO even cheaper than all these bureaucratic 2777) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Preparing breakfast after having spent the night in front of the computer, and having answered phone calls... | 2779) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Wouldn't be a real democracy be a good idea?

My first album I bought from a worker in the factory where I was during apprenticeship, who was about to sell away all albums and books of his deceased son. It was AC/DC: Highway to Hell. I even had no record player to play it at that time, the album simply stood on my cupboard for two years. My 1st CD was Carmina Burana - I bought it when I bought a new HiFi system with CD player.

Thomas Cearley Director, LDS Family Services, Louisiana Agency J. Thomas Cearley, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Stop Using Words That Hurt,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Ensign, Mar 2006, 58\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac61 What is verbal abuse? How can we avoid being verbally abusive with children? \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I probably yell at my children too much\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 was the contemplative response of a faithful Latter-day Saint mother to my ecclesiastical interview question \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Is there anything in your home that is not in harmony with the teachings of the Church?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Her response surprised me. This pleasant, soft-spoken sister was an exemplary member of our ward, as was her husband, and her children were well mannered and well liked. They were a stalwart Latter-day Saint family. We proceeded to discuss her answer further. She spoke of feeling overwhelmed at times by family and parenting responsibilities and of shouting at her children. She was concerned that her yelling might border on \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"verbal abuse.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 This faithful Latter-day Saint is not alone in her struggle. Many parents yell at their children, belittle them, or criticize them. Even parents who genuinely love their children and are sincerely trying to do their best may engage in this behavior. Parents do not always realize the emotional damage they may be inflicting upon their young ones. What Is Verbal Abuse? According to the Church publication Responding to Abuse: Helps for Ecclesiastical Leaders, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"abuse may include such acts as threats of abandonment, cursing, demeaning comments, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 and other such deprivations.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 This publication further explains that abuse \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"can deeply affect the mind and spirit, destroying faith and causing confusion, doubt, mistrust, guilt, and fear.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Verbal abuse can include blaming (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"If you would behave, I wouldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t have to yell\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2), threatening better rejecting good\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2), or comparing (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Why can\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t you be as smart as your brother?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2). Or a parent may communicate to the child in ways that indicate the child is hopeless (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You never \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You always \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2). The home should be a safe, sacred place of refuge for children. But this is not the case when parents are verbally abusive. Control the Tongue [Church] President David O. McKay (1873\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac1970) spoke about the necessity of controlling one\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s communication: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"He is a weak man who will curse or condemn some loved one because of a little accident. What good does it do him? He [must] develop his spirit and control that anger, control his tongue. A little thing? Trace it, and you will find that not yielding and not controlling it bring many an unhappy hour in your home.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Stories regarding the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"many unhappy hours\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 in homes are truly tragic. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"If I could do it all over again,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 wrote a mother from Glendale, Utah, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"I would commit to never raising my voice. Ironically, as a young mother, I remember hearing an older woman say that she never raised her voice to her children. I thought to myself, How impractical! \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Yelling goes way back in my family tree. Everyone yells, I thought. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s just part of life. I had often given myself over to my emotions and expressed my anger at the top of my voice at my children. Then I became frustrated by their lack of cooperation and yelled my orders even louder at them. I have even screamed to them that I could not tolerate their yelling and quarreling any longer, not realizing that they had learned to yell from me. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Raising my voice invited the spirit of contention into our home. Once it was there, the children learned to call each other names and say cruel things to each other. I would respond with more anger and accusations, and the negative feelings would continue to escalate. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"After yelling at my kids for the better part of 20 years, I have learned what 3 Nephi 11:29 means: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00cbHe that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 Allowing the spirit of contention to enter our home allowed darkness and depression to enter. It fostered meanness and self-centeredness, and nearly destroyed unity, love, and family relationships.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Using demeaning, threatening words and shouting can leave indelible impressions on a child\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s mind. Hurtful words can be used like a weapon to inflict injuries that are difficult to overcome. A child who is continually criticized can begin to believe the negative messages. Children who suffer repeated emotional or verbal abuse may experience depression, develop feelings of low self-worth, and have difficulty in their interpersonal relationships. All of these effects may extend into adulthood. Preventing Verbal Abuse Some years ago, in an effort to encourage positive communication, my family decided to discuss during family home evening ways we could improve our verbal communication with each other. We agreed to pay attention to our language and to avoid name calling and using negative labels, which we began to call \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"garbage-can words.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Some of those labels and words were stupid, ugly, dummy, lazy, spoiled, crybaby, and others. We all knew which labels and words were negative and hurtful. And, interestingly enough, new ones seemed to creep into our communication and had to also be thrown into the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"garbage can.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 As I have counseled families throughout the years, I have used a one-page handout for parents on how to stop using words that hurt and start using words that help. Some of the words and phrases that help are: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Good job!\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You did that by yourself? sorry.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Can way.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"You\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re or not you consider yourself to be a verbally abusive parent, listen carefully to the language you use with your children. Be receptive to feedback from others about your parent-child interactions. Be aware of any negative, hurtful verbal responses and reactions, including negative words, tone of voice, and overall approach to communicating with your children. When you feel tempted to engage in abusive verbal behavior, stop what you are doing and remove yourself temporarily from the situation. See the sidebar \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Instead of Yelling\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 for more suggestions on avoiding abusive verbal behavior. If you are finding it difficult to change your actions, seek counsel from your bishop. If further help is needed, he can refer you to a qualified therapist. [Church] President Gordon B. Hinckley has prescribed love and respect as the most effective tool in curing abuse and other family problems: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The prescription is simple and wonderfully effective. It is love. It is plain, simple, everyday love and respect. It is a tender plant that needs nurturing. But it is worth all of the effort we can put into it.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 On another occasion he said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"My plea\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acand I wish I were more eloquent in voicing it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acis a plea to save the children. Too many of them walk with pain and fear, in loneliness and despair. Children need sunlight. They need happiness. They need love and nurture. They need kindness and refreshment and affection.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Let us treat our children with \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"kindness and refreshment and affection,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 knowing as we do so that the Lord will bless our efforts. Our relationships with our children will then be closer, and they will be farther along the road to becoming happy, well-adjusted adults. Instead of Yelling 1. Pause and reconsider what you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re going to say. Then think of a better response\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acor no response at all for the time being. 2. Remember the last time you felt like yelling, and concentrate on what you did that helped you then. 3. When tempted to yell or use demeaning or threatening words, count to 20 or more before you yell. 4. Put your child, and even yourself, in a time-out chair. Just sit there and cool off for a few minutes. 5. Sing or hum a favorite hymn. 6. Call a friend to talk or to even temporarily relieve you of childcare, if necessary. 7. Go outside for a breath of fresh air. Look at the sky to get the bigger picture. 8. Write a brief list of your immediate feelings of frustration. Then write feelings you think you may still have in 10 minutes or so. Abuse Is Not Compatible with the Spirit \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We should not lose our tempers and abuse one another. I want to say that nobody ever abused anybody else when he had the spirit of the Lord. It is always when we have some other spirit.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 President George Albert Smith (1870\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac1951), in Conference Report, Oct. 1950, 8. | 2936) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: No Chaos here anymore winning SETI@home member since 29 Sep 2006 Country Germany URL http://de.geocities.com/zwerg8_thorin/index2.html Total credit 5,156.05 Recent average credit 6.25 Team Calm Chaos :P Computers View Message boards 3707 posts Contact Send private message Profile View hey I think I'm less chaotic than you are :-P I'm simply more of the calm kind LOL I'm actually so calm that I need to go to bed :-D | 2939) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : No Chaos here anymore belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning, talking Beets into leaving 2941) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning while watching Law&Order New York (does this show have the same name in the US?) | 2942) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning again, after finishing to read the book \"The Hunt for Red October\". | 2943) |[Message [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: double post - but the connection to here is veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery slow atm | 2945) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) is Right?](forum_thread.php?id=40241) 588048](forum_thread.php?id=40241&postid=588048)) Posted 17 Jun 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: In Germany we had a similar show to your \"The Price is Right\".

As misinformation is a key weapon in war, collateral damage can sometimes also be used for intended damage, as a way to obscure that it was intended. If, for example, the intent was to kill a lot of skilled workers in war factories, telling the truth may not help your war effort. It has been said that Truth is the first casualty in war. Maybe your misquote here is unintentional, Thorin, but the article actually says, \"Traditionally, collateral damage is a result of weapon system malfunction, human error, desperation in the fog of war or because it was intended. In more recent warfare, it occurs when an adversary\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s strategy includes concealment among the civilian population.\" By leaving off the word \"traditionally\" you make it seem that Reynolds was using this as his actual definition, when he was talking about what had \"traditionally\" been used as a definition in the past. The next sentence clarifies this even further, pointing out that it can occur when soldiers intentionally target combatants who hide among the civilian population. In fact, Reynolds used the current DoD definition at the beginning of his article which says, \"The U.S. Department of Defense [hereinafter DOD] defines collateral damage as, 'unintentional or incidental injury or damage to persons or objects that would not be lawful military targets in the circumstances ruling at the time. Such damage is not unlawful so long as it is not excessive in light of the overall military advantage anticipated from the attack.'\" Maybe you posted misleading information because you don't understand English well enough. I hope you weren't intentionally trying to deceive us. The quotation I posted was from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage#Analysis). See the article below \"Analysis\". No misquoting here, the only thing was that I didn't mention the source. About my English skills: I'm convinced that I do understand English well enough to get through in most cases - though of course there are some words and phrases I still don't understand, and maybe my grammar is not perfect either. But I'm sure I'm getting better every day. :-) And: still the saying is true that \"Truth is the first casualty in war.\" I learned from eyewitness reports I read and watched that soldiers did kill civilians intentionally - just because they were suspected to be rebels. A wrong gesture (for example: the attempt to get an ID from inside the jacket) is enough, and the person is killed. Still \"Collateral Damage\"? Or already murder? \"First shoot them then ask them\" seems to be the motto. I read an eyewitness report lately about a heavily injured civilian woman who was lying on the street for half an hour because the neighbors didn't dare to leave their houses; and when the soldiers came by on their patrol, they just emptied an entire magazine shooting at her although she was crying for help. And the eyewitness reported that the soldiers would always do that, with the excuse that the persons lying on the streets probably could have hidden a grenade underneath. Human error? Exaggerated caution? Or just intentional killing for the purpose of killing? | 2950) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hi Stacey.

Well then, rocket scientist, shouldn't the original rocket scientist have said something along the lines of \"I want to know why there is a double-standard between x and y?\" I mean, that would have been the most accurate way to do it--you know, using words to accurately convey your meaning? In general, there is no double standard between collateral damage and common law murder because murder requires evidence of malice aforethought as directed at a specific person whose identity may or may not be known, e.g. a husband planning to kill the man who is sleeping with his wife. The elements of murder are there, he had an intent to kill (mens rea), he planned it in advance, against a specific person, and then carried out the act. By contrast, this is normally not the case when a cruise missile loses it's targeting lock and causes innocent deaths, or urban warfare results in civilian deaths. While the result is still the same, those deaths are homicides, not murders. Well, as big as the military people are talking about the target accuracy of the missiles, that they were able to target a certain window in a certain building, and the missile would go exactly there - and then, in reality the missiles hit a hospital or a school quite far from the palace or the target they claim to be intended - then you can suspect that this \"collateral damage\" was in fact either intended or that they just were talking big, exaggerating the accuracy. | 2952) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: you had enough time on the podium, Sarge - now it's my turn. winning while chatting elsewhere :-) | 2953) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I'm wondering why it's called [snip] You actually need someone to explain the difference [snip] He wasn't asking for your definition of the terms...

Webster Griffin Tarpley wrote in his book \"9/11 - SYNTHETIC TERRORISM MADE IN USA\": A key feature of this study is its approach to the roots of 9/11. I do not see 9/11 as an event growing exclusively or even primarily out of conditions in Afghanistan or the Middle East. Rather, I see 9/11 as the culmination of a decade-long crisis of economics, finance, politics military affairs, and culture in the United States. In the broadest sense, 9/11 is the wages of a disastrous decade of economic globalization, and of the impoverishment and weakening of an entire society. 9/11 does not grow out of US strength, but represents a desperate flight forward in an attempt to mask US weakness. 9/11 fits within the tradition of NATO geopolitical or spheres of influence terrorism as it was practiced in Italy and West Germany during the years from 1965 to 1993. I reject the na\u00c3\u00c2\u00afve or sociological explanation of terrorism. This approach says that misery, oppression, and desperation give rise to terrorist organizations which spontaneously express these underlying moods. But we live in an era in which political and social reality are incessantly manipulated by huge and pervasive intelligence agencies \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac CIA, FBI, MI-6, FSB (KGB), Mossad, BND, SDECE, SISMI and the like \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac whose cumulative effect is to over-determine or sur-determine observed reality. I therefore contend that the more reliable conceptual model for understanding terrorism is one that situates the secret intelligence agency, or factions thereof, in the center of the process, recruiting prospective terrorists from the immiserated masses and forming them into clandestine organizations which are henceforth subject to guidance from outside, behind, and above. High-profile international terrorism is not spontaneous; it is artificial and synthetic. It requires expert terrorist controllers. Because of this, the starting point for realistic appraisal of 9/11 is not primarily the sociology of the Middle East, but rather the historical record of NATO and CIA state-sponsored terrorism in western Europe and elsewhere in the post-World War II period. For it is here, and surely not in some distant cave of the Hindu Kush, that we can find the methods and personnel which produced 9/11. If the term grotesque originally meant something that came out of a cave, we can justifiably dismiss the official explanation of 9/11 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac Bin Laden with his laptop in an Afghan cave \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac as the grotesque theory of terrorism. Synthetic terrorism is a strategy used by oligarchs for the purpose of waging war on the people \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac that is to say, on the middle class in Machiavelli\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s sense of popolo. Terrorism must therefore be opposed. My own understanding of these events is informed by having experienced first hand, as analyst, journalist, and author, the Italian and German terrorism of the 1970s and 1980s. <snip> Another early official fingering of Osama Bin Laden as the guilty party came from Secretary of State Colin Powell on September 13. At this point Powell was competing for attention with the fulminations and Schrecklichkeit of neocons like Wolfowitz, who was ranting that the US would \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"end states harboring terrorism,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 and would do so unilaterally, without reference to the collective security of the United Nations. Already voices of caution were being raised about another ill-prepared rush to judgment. Professor Paul Rogers, of Bradford University's peace department, warned against assuming Middle East extremists were behind the tragedy. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We've been here before. With Oklahoma, everybody assumed it was Middle East [terrorists], then it turned out to be home-grown Timothy McVeigh,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Again with the pipe bomb in Atlanta, it turned out to be domestic.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 (Guardian, September 11, 2001) In any event, this was the same Colin Powell, who in February 2003, before the United Nations Security Council, perjured himself on the question of Iraq\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s alleged weapons of mass destruction. This was the same Colin Powell who alleged mobile biological weapons labs, chemical weapons dispensers, and tubes being used for centrifuges in the process of uranium enrichment. This was the same Colin Powell who committed the most spectacular perjury in the history of the United Nations Security Council. On September 14, the FBI, which had known nothing about anything before the attacks, published its infamous list of nineteen hijackers. As we will soon see, the mortality rate among those supposed kamikazes was less than 100%, with no less than seven of the suspects named turning up alive and well in the days after this list was published. More importantly, this was a list prepared by the same FBI which had been responsible for the Waco massacre of men, women, and children in 1992, the agency that illegally withheld documents in the capital murder trial of Timothy McVeigh, an abuse which ought to have caused his conviction to be thrown out, but which only caused it to be delayed. This is the agency whose vaunted Crime Lab turned out to be a sewer of incompetence and corruption. This is the same FBI which clumsily attempted to entrap and frame up the innocent Richard Jewel during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games, while the real culprit went free. This is the same FBI which persecuted the Chinese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee without any grounds, accusing him of having transferred secrets to the People\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s Republic of China. This is the same FBI which permitted the Soviet mole Robert Hanssen to operate inside it for fifteen years. This is the agency which ostracized John O\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2Neill, and which ignored the Phoenix memorandum and Colleen Rowley\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s warnings from Minneapolis. This is the same FBI which could not capture the Unabomber over decades, until his own brother turned him in. This is the same agency which, over the previous months, in the words of Governor Kean of the 9/11 Commission, \"failed and failed and failed and failed and failed.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Are we then to believe that on September 14 this troubled and incompetent agency enjoyed a brief interlude of success, as represented by the list of the 19? And if they did succeed that day, they must have soon lapsed back into incompetence again, as seen in their utter failure to prevent the October 2001 anthrax attacks, or ever to identify the perpetrator, perhaps because the anthrax in question was weapons grade material which had come from a US military lab, probably Fort Detrick, Maryland. This was the same FBI whose main activity after 9/11 seemed to consist in confiscating relevant evidence and tampering with witnesses, telling them that had not seen what they knew they had. Anyone familiar with the record will have a very hard time taking seriously such allegations coming from the discredited, dysfunctional FBI. BUSH AS INVETERATE LIAR The definitive identification of Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda as the authors of the atrocity came only on September 20, in Bush\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s address to a joint session of Congress. Bush stated: The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are the murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole. [\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6] This group and its leader \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac a person named Osama Bin Laden \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction. The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s vision for the world. [\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6] And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: deliver to the United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land. [\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6] These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act, and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share their fate. [\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6] Our war on terror beings with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated. (Bush 10-11) Here we can see how inextricably the naming of Bin Laden and al Qaeda is bound up with the unilateral preventive war doctrine, the attack on Afghanistan, and the aggression against Iraq. But let us put these remarks into contact. Some months later, delivering his January 2003 State of the Union address from the same podium in the well of the House of Representatives, this same Bush intoned: The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. (January 28, 2003) These infamous sixteen words added up to one Big Lie in Dr. Goebbel\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s sense, as has been amply demonstrated. In the same speech this same Bush claimed: We\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2ve also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons across broad areas. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re concerned that Iraq is exploring ways of using these UAVs for missions targeting the United States. (January 28, 2003) No such vehicles ever existed. This same Bush also alleged: From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs. These are designed to produce germ warfare agents and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors. Saddam Hussein has not disclosed these facilities. He has given no evidence that he has destroyed them. (January 28, 2003) Mobile labs of the type described by Bush have never been found in Iraq. Experts have speculated that these wildly exaggerated reports were based on vans used for public health purposes, or perhaps on ice cream trucks. On another occasion the very same Bush asserted: The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has had numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group he calls his \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"nuclear mujahedeen,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 his nuclear holy warriors. (October 7, 2002) But the renewed nuclear program turned out to be a chimera, most likely invented by the neocon darling, convicted bank embezzler, and betrayer of American state secrets, Achmed Chalabi, to justify his $400,000 monthly stipend provided by the American taxpayer. This was the same Bush who had conjured up the specter of an Iraqi nuclear attack on the United States: Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud. (Cincinnati, Ohio, October 2, 2002) The internet teems with web sites dedicated primarily to keeping up with Bush\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s legendary, picaresque mendacity. Bush has lied about the cost of his prescription drug boondoggle, about nonexistent economic reports he claimed had buttressed his economic prognostications, about all spheres of policy. He has lied about funding first responders, grants for port security, payments to children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s hospitals, and veterans\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2 benefits. The tenant of the White House has a troubled relation to the very concept of truth. This is the man who has acquired an unparalleled at home and abroad reputation as a liar \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac at least, in those quarters, like the Office of Canadian Prime Minister Chretien, where he was dismissed as a moron. This is an administration in which blatant lying has become part of the daily routine \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac in part because of neocon guru Leo Strauss\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s theory that truth is dangerous for the masses, and rulers therefore have to be esoteric, that is, lie through their teeth. But whether Bush is a cretin or a liar, his statements offer no sufficient basis for falling in with the neocons in their march towards endless war against the entire world. Knowing what we knew as of late 2004, no person of good judgment could ever accept statements from the current regime at face value. Nevertheless, otherwise intelligent people who would not dream believing Bush about Iraq or other issues are content to swallow his biggest whopper of them all: his 9/11 story. This doublethink must end. The Bush regime is a castle of lies and fabrications, and the keystone of all of them is the 9/11 myth. It is now proverbial in Washington to remark that there is no proof linking Saddam Hussein to 9/11, and this is certainly true. But, by the very same token, there is also no proof in the public domain anywhere that adds up to a case against Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. We should point out that we hold no brief for the misfit sheikh and his sociopathic followers. Bin Laden was a creation of the CIA, and his al Qaeda followers, to the extent that they exist at all, are doubtless individuals characterized by a surfeit of criminal intent. But we must not join the anonymous CIA agent author of the recent book Imperial Hubris in portraying the inept and unstable Bin Laden as a genius. Taken by themselves, Bin Laden and his band represent supermarket-caliber terrorists, capable of bombing a shopping center, or of destroying a bus. Any capabilities above and beyond this can only be explained through assistance provided by intelligence agencies, primarily but not limited to the American ones. There is no doubt that Bin Laden and his benighted gaggle would have desired to inflict destruction on the scale of 9/11. What is at issue is their physical and technical capability of doing so on their own in the universe as we otherwise know it to be constituted. From this point of view, Bin Laden and company emerge perhaps as actors in the plot, but playing the parts of patsies, dupes, fall-guys, or useful idiots. The main point remains that Tenet, Clarke, Powell, the FBI, and Bush have produced no convincing evidence to establish the 19 Moslem men, al Qaeda, and Bin Laden as the authors of the crimes.

Oh the irony... ;) (I'm referring to the 'powers that be', not the 'common criminals'.) I think you're the only one who hasn't noticed that \"the paranoid warmongers\" don't plant bombs in cafes. ;) Right. The warmongers themselves don't plant bombs. They only make others make others do it - either by order or as reaction on any kind of provocation (which again came by order of the warmongers). It's like when a weapon dealer sows mistrust and fear between neighbors to sell his weapons and security stuff to each of them via front men. As long as those neighbors don't realize that it's the same person (either natural or legal) who is responsible that they are opponents/enemies now, the violence coil will turn and turn and the weapon dealer will have their turn-over coming from each of the neighbors. Right. As you admit, \"Right. The warmongers themselves don't plant bombs.\" Good, we agree on something. Now, as for your wild claim that the Western countries \"make others do it\", I want a specific, concrete example, that you can prove. Just speculating and accusing doesn't make it so. One example of Western countries \"make others make others do it\" (I repeated this deliberately) is Israel. Until the six-Days-War, supported by Western countries, Palestinians and Jewish settlers lives as neighbors together. Even when Israel called itself a state, they still lived in peace. But since Israel, with the tolerance and support of the Western countries, had annexed more and more Palestinian soil, taking more and more property from the Palestinians and even their neighbors to give it to their own settlers, the Palestinians have quit to just suffer it, they repulse, strike back. So it's a coil of violence there: repression -> revenge -> more repression -> more revenge (terror). Another example: Go 200 to 100 years back in time, the USA - no wonder that some Indian tribes terrorized some forts and towns. The white settlers made them do it: by stealing them their land and property, by ignoring their sacred places, by taking them their source of food away. A 3rd example: Bin Laden and (indirectly) his colleagues were trained by the States, and established in Afghanistan by the States - to fight the Russians out (who btw. were called in for help by a part of the gov't). Because of the several US actions over there (gulf war, etc) he thought this couldn't be tolerated, and did his to \"strike back\" -and trained by the States, he knew their weak points, knew where to hurt best. | 2976) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I wanted to post something into the Political thread, but I'm too tired for it.

But I do think that to prevent illegal immigration from Mexico, it's not enough to reinforce the border, but to improve the living situations of your direct neighbors could be a better alternative for your gov't - since they already have some decades' of experience in setting up and removing foreign governments anyway. I once (in 1991) met a US citizen who told me that he earned a fortune smuggling GDR citizens to West Germany. When I asked him if he would give Mexicans the same kind of help to get to USA, since also this means bringing people from a poorer country into a richer country, he became provoking - he thought smuggling humans were different depending on the \"where from\" and \"where to\". But I do know that many people actually do smuggle people from Mexico to USA - and back, just to supply farmers and other entrepreneurs with cheap workers. | 2984) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Post: Daniel Michel wrote: Last again. winning! doesn't [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: the \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Constitution does not allow the President to order the military to seize civilians residing in the United States and then detain them indefinitely without criminal process, and this is so even if he calls them 'enemy combatants.' \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Am I the only one to notice that everything the paranoid warmongers have 'falsely accused' Muslims of doing, they themselves are guilty of?

Humans are social beings, selfishness is seen as evil in many cultures. It's like \"I'm against it because my parents and everybody who tried to influence me are for it\" To me, the theories of Ayn Rand which put selfishness as the highest virtue of all and which call altruism a danger to individuals are totally misled. OK. Why? Why are those theories \"totally misled?\" Reason this out for us. You're right. I can't reason why anything must by sacrificed to killing people except in a case of self-defense. But I can reason others why they should sacrifice to help those in need. >snip brief statement of O'ist ethics< This is the antithesis to everything I'm convinced of. To me, the highest virtues of all are: altruism, selflessness, mutual respect to each other people (no matter if black or white, man or woman, straight or gay, healthy or not, poor or not). The problem here is that you cannot demonstrate why you think this way. You cannot reason to others why they must sacrifice themselves to others. You can't demonstrate why, for example, a family must sacrifice food, or health care, or education, or retirement in order to buy another B-2, lay the keel for the USS Ronald Reagan, or kill Iraqis in Iraq. Since people are social beings (no, not because I say so, but because a lot of other philosophers, religions etc say so), there are things like empathy, respect, compassion, sympathy etc in everyone of us, given us by Nature / God (depending on your conviction) - and you can't just ignore them: each one of your oh so objective thoughts are soaked with emotions and feelings (well, at least as long as the left half of your brain works alright). You can hide yourself and your origin expressions behind other expressions, like arrogance is hiding self-consciousness, and aggression is fear in disguise; and you can try to block your emotions - But to call such behavior healthy and normal is a BIG LIE to yourself. Just ask the closest psychologist. Since when is an \"As far as I know\" a proclamation? Selfishness and egocentric behavior are things I'd like to see being taught to all mankind to get rid off. And AFAIK it IS a matter of education whether or not people become selfish or not. More empty words. You seem simply incapable of posting except by proclamation. But ok: I saw a lot of documentaries on TV and read a lot of books about behavior and education in the past (and if I had all of my books here where I live instead of 500km away, where I used to live until last year, I could look up and name authors and titles). And these showed me that social competence and also our behavior toward others have been trained to us, either by others teaching us (directly or by example), or by our own trial-and-error -- and therefor it is a matter of education and training persons get during their life-time whether they become selfless or selfish. And that's why I even think that a person can be trained to change from selfishness to altruistic, to love others like him/herself. Well - how easily these 2 simple sentences can be misunderstood... If individuals can't work and produce towards goals they can't pursue happiness. If one can't consume the product of one's effort, one cannot live. So everyone who is unable to work or to trade is doomed? Are disabled people who never can be \"productive\" not allowed to pursue happiness? Are they not worth to live? No. No one is doomed. You don't even have the slightest understanding of Rand, O'ism, or o'ism, and yet you say these things as if they are self-evident. What is self-evident is that you simply don't understand what you are talking about. Yes I don't have any understanding of Rand. As I said before she taught the antithesis to what I am convinced of.

Typical empty Thorin post. If you think so... I just typed the words selfishness, egoism, capitalism into the search box of Google. The first pages showed links to websites about Ayn Rand. What else can you expect of a person described as being anti-social by her own mother? To me, the theories of Ayn Rand which put selfishness as the highest virtue of all and which call altruism a danger to individuals are totally misled. The Objectivist ethics, in essence, hold that man exists for his own sake, that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose, that he must not sacrifice himself to others, nor sacrifice others to himself. The Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and upholds rational selfishness--which means: the values required for man's survival qua man--which means : the values required for human survival--not the values produced by the desires, the emotions, the 'aspirations,' the feelings, the whims or the needs of irrational brutes... The Objectivist ethics holds that human good does not require human sacrifices and cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone. It holds that the rational interests of men do not clash -- that there is no conflict of interests among men who do not desire the unearned, who do not make sacrifices nor accept them, who deal with one another as traders, giving value for value. This is the antithesis to everything I'm convinced of.

Dr. Onkar Ghate is a senior fellow at the Ayn Rand Institute. Typically \"libertarian\" Ayn Rand theories. What would happen if they really removed all controls?

But I believe the American people would want to avoid this, they would stand up to fight and bring a more human system to rule. In my opinion basic right things like education, health-care, food and housing space (besides real luxury things like private education, medically unneeded operations, luxury food, more housing space than needed for the persons living in there for example) should have to be treated out of any market concurrence. As I stated before, as long as there is so much egoism (and the theories of Ayn Rand are full of egoism) there has to be a control of each kind of market, just to prevent a national \"eat or be eaten\", to achieve at least a bit of fairness. | 2995) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 0057 [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Winning while seeing another friend leaving. | 2997) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Post: G'd evening @all! I just had supper after I returned from evening classes; and the evening classes seem to be the cause of me getting no job. :-( To get a job fitting my experiences and skills I should be willing to work in turning shifts(: 0600 to 1400 / 1400 to 2200 / 2200 to 0600) - though I know that they search also people for day-shift jobs (0700 to 1530). But even though the companies I applied for did offer such jobs they seem to think that people who don't want to work in turning shifts simply don't really want a job... Since my evening classes start at 1740 and end at 2210 it would be very difficult to be punctual for night shift (2200 to 0600) (especially when it takes me one hour from home to the working place), and impossible to go to late shift -- or it would be impossible to go to evening classes during the days of late-shift, and I had to leave classes much earlier during days of night shift.

G8 Protest: More than 10,000 block Heiligendamm 05.06.2007 - 18:45 The second day of blockades started as the first day had ended - with thousands of people back on the streets, attempting to reach the fence and blocking all gates and routes leading to Heiligendamm. Two blockades had continued throughout the night. While the blockade at the east gate continued on Thursday (and ended on Friday), confrontations occurred at the west gate, with police violently dispersing protesters. However, because of the presence of thousands of activists in the fields around the gate, the access route was effectively blocked for most of the day. People were protesting directly at the fence - police were not able to enforce the ban on all protests in that area. Temporarily, G8 delegates were locked inside Heiligendamm. As hundreds of G8 delegates arrived in the area on Wednesday, mass blockades interrupted their arrival at the fenced security zone. Thousands of activists blocked most of the routes leading to the G8 meeting venue in Heiligendamm. Over 10,000 people blocked the fence gates and 'breached' the newly declared no-demonstration zone around the fence. In the evening, police violently dispersed one of the blockades, while others were continuing with several thousand people still on the streets. Other activists were protesting in the streets surrounding the Rostock-Laage airport. Late in the evening, more than 1,000 people on three blockades decided to stay overnight. Don't you think that 10,000 protesters easily could overwhelm some 2,500 cops if they wanted? Don't you think they even were able to breach through the fence if they had wanted? The protesters showed the will of the nation, using their right to gather and to demonstrate. In our German constitution there are NO exceptions where to not meet. Even if they insisted to demonstrate IN Heiligendamm, right in front of the meeting building - it would be (theoretically) legal according to the constitution (strangely not during this G8 meeting!) | 3029) |[Message 8 Jun 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: How will you know that I am a real person?

I'm done. This is a complete waste of time and effort. You truly need some economics and critical thinking classes because you don't provide any reasoning for your positions, i.e. \"I think 'x'... because 'y'....\" you just repeat your own empty opinions that show no depth or clarity of thought. Only because I think that each business should be a win-win situation for both parties, and not just that one party exploits the other one? Exploitation is caused by greed and egoism. Fair trade is caused by respect and reason. All's fair in love and trade. It's a mistake to discount human nature and want to force people into living by theoretical designs. If it promotes people's self-interest, it will succeed. How do you think the big businesses started out? They started out small, and grew because they served other people's self-intersts. No, not all is fair in love and trade. Mutual respect is the most important thing in love, and trade. The relationships which last longest are those full of mutual respect. And the most successful salespersons and service-persons are those who respect their customers. But I think with the right amount of money on the bank account some people lose their respect against those who have less: They become less human. So the Big Business locusts get away with non-respect: there are so many lemons to squeeze, they don't care if one dozen or a hundred of their customers are leaving. Less customers? So what? The other ones will pay more - and they will pay and pay as long as it's still cheaper than in the small corner shops. | 3040) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) Jun 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Here an independent report what happens really Thursday!

It was the Big Business doing that: Stock Exchange, banks, all those greedy nerds - the little farmers are also told to produce less, or are paid to leave their acres alone, just to keep the prices steady, because (excuse published by government, and Stock Exchanges, banks etc. - in short, Big Business: \"it's too expensive\") ... I saw how milk, butter, meat was dumped \"to hold the prises steady\" And who did the dumping, as a rule? Did whoever produced the stuff do it? Or did something buy it from them and dump it? Or did something order them to do so? Did the little farmer that produced the meat just one day decide to dump it to keep prices artificially inflated? By the way, did you miss the rest of the post?No. The greed and egoism of those who have the big money? 1.) There are enough resources to feed everyone on Earth - though these resources are mainly in private property. It can't be that some persons own millions and billions of Dollars while others have to live on the street because they have nothing to buy anything. Actually, that IS how it is. Why is that do you think? What's preventing people from selling food in Cuba, or the DPRK, or selling extremely cheap rice in Japan. What prevents the Sudanese from getting badly needed relief supplies? Big Business? Stock Exchange, banks, other greedy locusts with a lot of money who are too greedy and egoistic to think about other things than their ever growing bank account. Dispossession is a possibility many constitutions are giving. It can't be that food is thrown away in amounts of kilotons just to hold its prices high, while others are starving. Giving the pluses away for a symbolic price would meet two points: avoiding that people do starve, and selling it for a symbolic price to the poor countries would be more cost effective than simply throwing it away. Who is doing that do you think? Do American farmers throw away their grain, or does something buy it from them and then destroy it? Who or what does that, do you think? Humanity. Fairness. Justice. 2.) I think letting the poorer countries produce stuff in license for their own market is okay, but letting them produce what they don't need, what doesn't even reach their own markets (except via expensive re-import from the original home country of the company) is strictly modern slavery and should be boycotted by everyone. Except that it's not. Almost no one does that right now. Why should they? Greed and egoism? 3.) AFAIK the left don't want the economics of the rich nations decline. They only want them to pay just salaries that the workers can afford their daily needs, and that there is more social welfare and more tax justice. Which, of course are mutually exclusive. The reasons for which have been previously explained. Here I caught you talking nonsense. What a country cannot produce themselves, they have to import - but what they can produce themselves, why should they not do it, without being dependent from others ? 4.) Why should the companies not remain competitive when they stayed in their own country? Wouldn't it be better - both, for the companies' reputation, and for the entire nation (\"Made in USA\", \"Made in Germany\" ...) - if they just remain in the country where they belong, and simply export their stuff to the other countries, or let them produce it themselves in license or as a Joint Venture, or as a kind of Franchise for their OWN market? This would have three advantages: a) they still would have enough turn-over, b) there would be less unemployment in the richer nations, and c) the poorer nations still had the possibility to grow. You ~really~ need to take some economics courses. This is absolutely stupid. Say, for example, if you wanted to grow bananas in Siberia. Sure, everything is pirated. Of course. 5.) What would happen to the oil prices? And to the CO2 levels in the atmosphere? Good questions. Do you know that there IS technology enough to build cars with the same power and acceleration (even better) then the usual cars needing less than 1 (ONE) ounce of fuel per 100 kilometers, even no fuel at all? This technology is deliberately put under lock and key, or sold exaggeratedly expensive to enable the oil companies make more money. How's this work? Some people in Asian countries will sell pirated everything. Cars, VCRs, you name it, it's pirated. And yet, not one of them sells this car you speak of. Not one. And when the technology itself is put under lock and seal how should it be pirated? In the beginning of the year they interviewed a R&D expert what he would think about a 1-liter-per-100km car (which was shown as a \"study\" - he just reacted bored and told the interviewer that this were 80's technology, that they easily could build a 1-Ounce-per-100km if their bosses would allow it, and that it could be made with technology already used. I'm not a nationalist, but I'm against the way of globalism as it is now. Today it's like a modern day colonialism. I'm for giving everyone on Earth equal chances to grow, to work, to study, to live. Then you had better get busy and give it to them. Because no one else will. Even those that think as you do can't be bothered. Why is that do you think?

That depends on your perspective (both where you live, and your economic-political philosophy). It is the stated goal of the left to move society towards a more 'equitable' (in their eyes) distribution of wealth, hence their rhetoric of 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer under right-wing governments'. They apply this both to within a nation and to the global community of nations. However, there are just not enough resources to move everyone in the world up to the standard of living enjoyed by the USA and a select few other nations. Examples of this include what is happening to the price of crude oil due to increased demand from the PRC as they industrialize. Also, in light of the discussion of global warming in another thread, just imagine what would happen to CO2 levels in the atmosphere if all nations spewed it out like the USA and a few others do? So, what does the left plan to do? Their plan is to boost the economies in poorer nations while allowing (even forcing) the economies of the rich nations to stagnate and even decline. What is the number one method they are using to do this? Globalism. How is the right reacting to this? Well, as has been stated elsewhere, one of 'big business's' prime responsibilities is shareholder dividends. The success of labor unions in increasing wages and benefits to their workers in the developed world, combined with excessive (even punitive) governmental regulations have effectively priced many workers in the developed world out of jobs. It does not make economic sense to, for instance, pay someone in the USA $20/hour to make something when paying someone in the third world $5/day to make the item and then shipping the finished good to its destination is cheaper. To the 'big business' corporations, Globalism is a godsend. It allows them to be competitive, and continue to deliver value to their shareholders. But wait! Can it be that both the right-wing capitalists and the left-wing socialists agree that globalism is a good thing? Of course they do, else why do you think that globalism is happening so fast? Now, that said, what do I think of globalism? I don't like it, not one little bit. As Adam Smith once said, wealth in a nation is created by manufacturing finished goods out of raw materials. Selling each other shoes does not create wealth, but making the shoes does. I remember when 'Made in USA' was a commonplace sight. Now, it is all but extinct. I would rather buy products made in this country, but the few that do exist nowadays are way out of my price range, are of poor quality, or most commonly both. I enjoyed growing up in one of the richest nations in the world (back in the '60s and early '70s). I bemoan the fact that my kids will grow up in a nation in decline, without many prospects for high paying employment. What is my particular 'philosophy'? Nationalist is probably the best term for it. So, to summarize: 1. Socialists like globalism. It promotes what they see as a more equitable distribution of wealth worldwide, and it increases the people dependent on them domestically. 2. Capitalists like globalism. It ensures their continued profits. 3. Nationalists hate globalism. It tears up the nation they were once proud of. This is the way I see it. Let me put some points in which I disagree: 1.) There are enough resources to feed everyone on Earth - though these resources are mainly in private property. It can't be that some persons own millions and billions of Dollars while others have to live on the street because they have nothing to buy anything. Dispossession is a possibility many constitutions are giving. It can't be that food is thrown away in amounts of kilotons just to hold its prices high, while others are starving. Giving the pluses away for a symbolic price would meet two points: avoiding that people do starve, and selling it for a symbolic price to the poor countries would be more cost effective than simply throwing it away. 2.) I think letting the poorer countries produce stuff in license for their own market is okay, but letting them produce what they don't need, what doesn't even reach their own markets (except via expensive re-import from the original home country of the company) is strictly modern slavery and should be boycotted by everyone. 3.) AFAIK the left don't want the economics of the rich nations decline. They only want them to pay just salaries that the workers can afford their daily needs, and that there is more social welfare and more tax justice. 4.) Why should the companies not remain competitive when they stayed in their own country? Wouldn't it be better - both, for the companies' reputation, and for the entire nation (\"Made in USA\", \"Made in Germany\" ...) - if they just remain in the country where they belong, and simply export their stuff to the other countries, or let them produce it themselves in license or as a Joint Venture, or as a kind of Franchise for their OWN market? This would have three advantages: a) they still would have enough turn-over, b) there would be less unemployment in the richer nations, and c) the poorer nations still had the possibility to grow. 5.) What would happen to the oil prices? And to the CO2 levels in the atmosphere? Good questions. Do you know that there IS technology enough to build cars with the same power and acceleration (even better) then the usual cars needing less than 1 (ONE) ounce of fuel per 100 kilometers, even no fuel at all? This technology is deliberately put under lock and key, or sold exaggeratedly expensive to enable the oil companies make more money. I'm not a nationalist, but I'm against the way of globalism as it is now. Today it's like a modern day colonialism. I'm for giving everyone on Earth equal chances to grow, to work, to study, to live. | 3112) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday!

It's also about industries. There are some internet-only industries now, like social networking, web hosting, communication tools and methods, and all this about Web 2.0. For example, at the moment, most of my income comes through my free photo sharing website, FotoFly... that is my main source of income, and I get the money when people click my adsense ads - which of course, I really appreciate. BUT, there is so much more to do online... you see lots of young people, like myself, Im 18, and some at 20 are millionaires - because of something they have done online what nobody else has thought of. I'm not saying want to become a millionaire, of course we would love to, but I am very realistic and down to earth though. Me a millionaire? maybe one day :) But, do you see how I mean, with online businesses and start-ups... In my opinion, this is the future. What do you think to how online businesses are replacing physical walk-in shops? James I'm afraid this day will come sooner than expected. Still I prefer personal service. I'm always annoyed when calling a service hot-line and have to hear: \"If you have problem A dial 1, if you have problem B dial 2...\" I want to have a human on the other end of the line who can give me answers! Shopping and ordering things via internet - though being comfortable in the first place - has its disadvantages: the personal advising, testing and the flair of the shops in general are missing - and if something which finally arrives after a week or longer doesn't fit, you have to bring it to the post office and send it back, waiting 2 more weeks for an eventual replacement. I just love personal service, personal contacts. No internet and no machine can give you that. | 3116) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 7 Jun 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Globalism....

Unfortunately, my boss had to learn it the hard way, as well as many other bosses that I've had in the past...

That either shuts em up, or I head for the unemployment line... ;) I feel so sorry for your former bosses. I'm sure you're deeply missed. It gives new meaning to the term \"work ethic\". I even was fired a couple years ago (it was before the Euro currency, in Frankfurt) because I was the first one who insisted in meeting the official health and safety standards on the building lot I worked! An old office building was to be removed, and we had to empty it totally before. They said nothing when I came there in work coveralls unlike the others - but when a wooden ceiling was to be removed, I didn't know what to expect and put on a dust mask which I bought on my own expenses, and since i was the only one wearing a dust mask (on a real dusty job) I was fired. I was right due to the health and safety standards - they even had to admit that there was asbestos in the building, but it was not right due to their own standards: After they fired me, they offered the other workers some more money per hour if they worked further without any safety suits or masks... Within a week half the staff was exchanged to Czech (or Polish?) workers because 1.)no one wanted to handle asbestos without at least a mask for no more than DM 14 (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac7) gross salary per hour; and 2.) the Czech workers were cheaper than \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac7 per hour anyway. | 3132) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Thursday!

Shall they meet on Robinson's Island, half a day before a Tsunami meets it! If being a 'righteous person' makes you secure from the crowd, why does the Pope require bodyguards? There are zealots of all stripes who would murder leaders just for the publicity they would get. But the pope has no fear to shake hands with the crowd, he doesn't expect an 8 miles radius security area around where he meets people (like in Rostock), or that the canalization lids be welded closed, or that an entire town be staffed with twice as much cops as inhabitants, just for paranoid reasons. I think it's the lower ranks who require that people in higher positions have to be secured that much by bodyguards etc. Like some submissive: \"Look how I take care for you, and remember me please...\" I remember an anecdote my mother and my grandparents used to tell about how they met the first East German president Wilhelm Pieck (whatever history will tell about him) in person: It was a habit of him, that, when he was visiting a site, he always ignored the \"security protocol\". Once (I don't know when, but it must have been between 1957 and 1959) he visited the factory were my mother and my grandparents were working, and told his driver to follow a truck obviously heading into the factory. So he arrived on a different gate than expected, and got into it with a normal visitor card, just being accompanied by his driver, and a normal worker who even didn't recognize his face. When the worker left these two visitors to get to his own working place, they just went into the different departments, and talked to as much employees as they could, my grandparents, and my mother among them. Pieck and his driver just watched the working conditions, and went to the employees when they had a moment of a break to talk with them. Some were glad to see him, some not so glad - but nothing happened except that he learned the different, real opinions about his regency: what was good, what could be better. My grandfather told me that, when they realizing their visitor, the workers were taking care of each other that nothing bad happened. Like a kind of self-disciplining. It took the Officials one hour and a half until they learned that the President already was walking around in the factory, talking to the workers - away from each protocol route, away from each security guardians and the press people, away from what was \"appropriate to the President\". Of course they tried to find out who told what to the President after he left the site again, but I think they simply were afraid of bad political consequences. For Pieck, it always was very important to learn first-hand (without any services or agencies inbetween) what the people were thinking, and since he has been a worker himself before he went along his political career, he is told to have always been thinking close to the workers. But most politicians nowadays live in their ebony tower, knowing NOTHING about what REALLY is happening in their country except from the biased media and their biased advisers - and mostly they're corrupt themselves and taking no care of any other interest than their own full bank account! | 3153) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Thursday!

Nope - no larger government, no adding more laws - just a stricter interpretation what fraud, bribery, or - in general - corruption is. \"No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.\" (Matthew 6:24) As impossible as it is to serve God AND the mammon at the same time, it's also impossible to serve the people AND Big Business at the same time. Either they're serving Big Business, or they're serving the citizens. I'd prefer to see them serving the citizens. | 3161) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday! back...Where did Thorin go?

(The Holy Qur'an, al-Ankabut, 29:46). Your Holiness, WITH REGARDS TO YOUR LECTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF REGENSBURG IN GERMANY ON September 12th 2006, we thought it appropriate, in the spirit of open exchange, to address your use of a debate between the Emperor Manuel II Paleologus and a \"learned Persian\" as the starting point for a discourse on the relationship between reason and faith. While we applaud your efforts to oppose the dominance of positivism and materialism in human life, we must point out some errors in the way you mentioned Islam as a counterpoint to the proper use of reason, as well as some mistakes in the assertions you put forward in support of your argument. There is no Compulsion in Religion You mention that \"according to the experts\" the verse which begins, There is no compulsion in religion (al-Baqarah 2:256) is from the early period when the Prophet \"was still powerless and under threat,\" but this is incorrect. In fact this verse is acknowledged to belong to the period of Quranic revelation corresponding to the political and military ascendance of the young Muslim community. There is no compulsion in religion was not a command to Muslims to remain steadfast in the face of the desire of their oppressors to force them to renounce their faith, but was a reminder to Muslims themselves, once they had attained power, that they could not force another's heart to believe. There is no compulsion in religion addresses those in a position of strength, not weakness. The earliest commentaries on the Qur'an (such as that of Al-Tabari) make it clear that some Muslims of Medina wanted to force their children to convert from Judaism or Christianity to Islam, and this verse was precisely an answer to them not to try to force their children to convert to Islam. Moreover, Muslims are also guided by such verses as Say: The truth is from your Lord; so whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. (al-Kahf 18:29); and Say: O disbelievers! I worship not that which ye worship; Nor worship ye that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which ye worship. Nor will ye worship that which I worship. Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion (al-Kafirun: 109:1-6). God's Transcendence You also say that \"for Muslim teaching, God is absolutely transcendent,\" a simplification which can be misleading. The Quran states, There is no thing like unto Him (al-Shura 42:11), but it also states, He is the Light of the heavens and the earth (al-Nur 24:35); and, We are closer to him than his jugular vein (Qaf 50:16); and, He is the First, the Last, the Inward, and the Outward (al-Hadid 57:3); and, He is with you wherever you are (al-Hadid 57:4); and, Wheresoever you turn, there is the Face of God (al-Baqarah 2:115). Also, let us recall the saying of the Prophet, which states that God says, \"When I love him (the worshipper), I am the hearing by which he hears, the sight by which he sees, the hand with which he grasps, and the foot with which he walks.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari no.6502, Kitab al-Riqaq) In the Islamic spiritual, theological, and philosophical tradition, the thinker you mention, Ibn Hazm (d.1069 CE), is a worthy but very marginal figure, who belonged to the Zahiri school of jurisprudence which is followed by no one in the Islamic world today. If one is looking for classical formulations of the doctrine of transcendence, much more important to Muslims are figures such as al-Ghazali (d.1111 CE) and many others who are far more influential and more representative of Islamic belief than Ibn Hazm. You quote an argument that because the emperor is \"shaped by Greek philosophy\" the idea that \"God is not pleased by blood\" is \"self-evident\" to him, to which the Muslim teaching on God's Transcendence is put forward as a counterexample. To say that for Muslims \"God's Will is not bound up in any of our categories\" is also a simplification which may lead to a misunderstanding. God has many Names in Islam, including the Merciful, the Just, the Seeing, the Hearing, the Knowing, the Loving, and the Gentle. Their utter conviction in God's Oneness and that There is none like unto Him (al-Ikhlas 112:4) has not led Muslims to deny God's attribution of these qualities to Himself and to (some of) His creatures, (setting aside for now the notion of \"categories\", a term which requires much clarification in this context). As this concerns His Will, to conclude that Muslims believe in a capricious God who might or might not command us to evil is to forget that God says in the Quran, Lo! God enjoins justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and forbids lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorts you in order that ye may take heed (al-Nahl, 16:90). Equally, it is to forget that God says in the Qur'an that He has prescribed for Himself mercy (al-An'am, 6:12; see also 6:54), and that God says in the Qur'an, My Mercy encompasses everything (al-A`raf 7:156). The word for mercy, rahmah, can also be translated as love, kindness, and compassion. From this word rahmah comes the sacred formula Muslims use daily, In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. Is it not self-evident that spilling innocent blood goes against mercy and compassion? The Use of Reason The Islamic tradition is rich in its explorations of the nature of human intelligence and its relation to God's Nature and His Will, including questions of what is self-evident and what is not. However, the dichotomy between \"reason\" on one hand and \"faith\" on the other does not exist in precisely the same form in Islamic thought. Rather, Muslims have come to terms with the power and limits of human intelligence in their own way, acknowledging a hierarchy of knowledge of which reason is a crucial part. There are two extremes which the Islamic intellectual tradition has generally managed to avoid: one is to make the analytical mind the ultimate arbiter of truth, and the other is to deny the power of human understanding to address ultimate questions. More importantly, in their most mature and mainstream forms the intellectual explorations of Muslims through the ages have maintained a consonance between the truths of the Quranic revelation and the demands of human intelligence, without sacrificing one for the other. God says, We shall show them Our signs in the horizons and in themselves until it is clear to them that it is the truth (Fussilat 41:53). Reason itself is one among the many signs within us, which God invites us to contemplate, and to contemplate with, as a way of knowing the truth. What is \"Holy War\"? We would like to point out that \"holy war\" is a term that does not exist in Islamic languages. Jihad, it must be emphasized, means struggle, and specifically struggle in the way of God. This struggle may take many forms, including the use of force. Though a jihad may be sacred in the sense of being directed towards a sacred ideal, it is not necessarily a \"war\". Moreover, it is noteworthy that Manuel II Paleologus says that \"violence\" goes against God's nature, since Christ himself used violence against the money-changers in the temple, and said \"Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword ...\" (Matthew 10:34-36). When God drowned Pharaoh, was He going against His own Nature? Perhaps the emperor meant to say that cruelty, brutality, and aggression are against God's Will, in which case the classical and traditional law of jihad in Islam would bear him out completely. You say that \"naturally the emperor knew the instructions, developed later and recorded in the Qur'an, concerning holy war.\" However, as we pointed out above concerning There is no compulsion in religion, the aforementioned instructions were not later at all. Moreover, the emperor's statements about violent conversion show that he did not know what those instructions are and have always been. The authoritative and traditional Islamic rules of war can be summarized in the following principles: 1. Non-combatants are not permitted or legitimate targets. This was emphasized explicitly time and again by the Prophet, his Companions, and by the learned tradition since then. 2. Religious belief alone does not make anyone the object of attack. The original Muslim community was fighting against pagans who had also expelled them from their homes, persecuted, tortured, and murdered them. Thereafter, the Islamic conquests were political in nature. 3. Muslims can and should live peacefully with their neighbors. And if they incline to peace, do thou incline to it; and put thy trust in God (al-Anfal 8:61). However, this does not exclude legitimate self-defense and maintenance of sovereignty. Muslims are just as bound to obey these rules as they are to refrain from theft and adultery. If a religion regulates war and describes circumstances where it is necessary and just, that does not make that religion war-like, anymore than regulating sexuality makes a religion prurient. If some have disregarded a long and well-established tradition in favor of utopian dreams where the end justifies the means, they have done so of their own accord and without the sanction of God, His Prophet, or the learned tradition. God says in the Holy Qur'an: Let not hatred of any people seduce you into being unjust. Be just, that is nearer to piety (al-Ma'idah 5:8). In this context we must state that the murder on September 17th of an innocent Catholic nun in Somalia -- and any other similar acts of wanton individual violence -- `in reaction to' your lecture at the University of Regensburg, is completely un-Islamic, and we totally condemn such acts. Forced Conversion The notion that Muslims are commanded to spread their faith \"by the sword\" or that Islam in fact was largely spread \"by the sword\" does not hold up to crutiny. Indeed, as a political entity Islam spread partly as a result of conquest, but the greater part of its expansion came as a result of preaching and missionary activity. Islamic teaching did not prescribe that the conquered populations be forced or coerced into converting. Indeed, many of the first areas conquered by the Muslims remained predominantly non-Muslim for centuries. Had Muslims desired to convert all others by force, there would not be a single church or synagogue left anywhere in the Islamic world. The command There is no compulsion in religion means now what it meant then. The mere fact of a person being non-Muslim has never been a legitimate casus belli in Islamic law or belief. As with the rules of war, history shows that some Muslims have violated Islamic tenets concerning forced conversion and the treatment of other religious communities, but history also shows that these are by far the exception which proves the rule. We emphatically agree that forcing others to believe -- if such a thing be truly possible at all -- is not pleasing to God and that God is not pleased by blood. Indeed, we believe, and Muslims have always believed, that Whoso slays a soul not to retaliate for a soul slain, nor for corruption done in the land, it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether (al-Ma'idah 5:32). Something New? You mention the emperor's assertion that \"anything new\" brought by the Prophet was \"evil and inhuman, such as his alleged command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\" What the emperor failed to realize--aside from the fact (as mentioned above) that no such command has ever existed in Islam--is that the Prophet never claimed to be bringing anything fundamentally new. God says in the Holy Qur'an, Naught is said to thee (Muhammad) but what already was said to the Messengers before thee (Fussilat 41:43), and, Say (Muhammad): I am no new thing among the messengers (of God), nor know I what will be done with me or with you. I do but follow that what is Revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner (al-Ahqaf, 46:9). Thus faith in the One God is not the property of any one religious community. According to Islamic belief, all the true prophets preached the same truth to different peoples at different times. The laws may be different, but the truth is unchanging. \"The Experts\" You refer at one point non-specifically to \"the experts\" (on Islam) and also actually cite two Catholic scholars by name, Professor (Adel) Theodore Khoury and (Associate Professor) Roger Arnaldez. It suffices here to say that whilst many Muslims consider that there are sympathetic non-Muslims and Catholics who could truly be considered \"experts\" on Islam, Muslims have not to our knowledge endorsed the \"experts\" you referred to, or recognized them as representing Muslims or their views. On September 25th 2006 you reiterated your important statement in Cologne on August 20th 2005 that, \"Inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue between Christians and Muslims cannot be reduced to an optional extra. It is, in fact, a vital necessity, on which in large measure our future depends.\" Whilst we fully concur with you, it seems to us that a great part of the object of inter-religious dialogue is to strive to listen to and consider the actual voices of those we are dialoguing with, and not merely those of our own persuasion. * * * Christianity and Islam Christianity and Islam are the largest and second largest religions in the world and in history. Christians and Muslims reportedly make up over a third and over a fifth of humanity respectively. Together they make up more than 55% of the world's population, making the relationship between these two religious communities the most important factor in contributing to meaningful peace around the world. As the leader of over a billion Catholics and moral example for many others around the globe, yours is arguably the single most influential voice in continuing to move this relationship forward in the direction of mutual understanding. We share your desire for frank and sincere dialogue, and recognize its importance in an increasingly interconnected world. Upon this sincere and frank dialogue we hope to continue to build peaceful and friendly relationships based upon mutual respect, justice, and what is common in essence in our shared Abrahamic tradition, particularly `the two greatest commandments' in Mark 2:29-31 (and, in varying form, in Matthew 22:37-40), that, the Lord our God is One Lord; / And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment./ And the second commandment is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. Muslims thus appreciate the following words from the Second Vatican Council: The church has also a high regard for the Muslims. They worship God, who is one, living and subsistent, merciful and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has also spoken to humanity. They endeavor to submit themselves without reserve to the hidden decrees of God, just as Abraham submitted himself to God's plan, to whose faith Muslims eagerly link their own. Although not acknowledging him as God, they venerate Jesus as a prophet; his virgin Mother they also honor, and even at times devoutly invoke. Further, they await the day of judgment and the reward of God following the resurrection of the dead. For this reason they highly esteem an upright life and worship God, especially by way of prayer, alms-deeds and fasting. (Nostra Aetate, 28 October 1965) And equally the words of the late Pope John Paul II, for whom many Muslims had great regard and esteem: We Christians joyfully recognize the religious values we have in common with Islam. Today I would like to repeat what I said to young Muslims some years ago in Casablanca: \"We believe in the same God, the one God, the living God, the God who created the world and brings his creatures to their perfection\" Insegnamenti, VIII/2, [1985], p.497, quoted during a general audience on May 5, 1999). Muslims also appreciated your unprecedented personal expression of sorrow, and your clarification and assurance (on the 17th of September) that your quote does not reflect your own personal opinion, as well as the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone's affirmation (on the 16th of September) of the conciliar document Nostra Aetate. Finally, Muslims appreciated that (on September 25th) in front of an assembled group of ambassadors from Muslim countries you expressed \"total and profound respect for all Muslims\". We hope that we will all avoid the mistakes of the past and live together in the future in peace, mutual acceptance and respect. And all praise belongs to God, and there is neither power nor strength except through God. \u00c3\u00c2\u00a9 2006 SIGNED (listed in alphabetical order) 1. H.E.

So their Imam/ priest/ preacher/ whatever preaches and says: \"Each non-believer is a pagan and the penalty for that is death, and death in the scripture just means physical death\", and adds \"The Scripture says so\" - no single one of these zealots (or popinjays/nutjobs what ever you call them) question this. They just obey and repeat the words of the verses or of the preachings like an hypnotic mantra without questioning it, without looking up for the context, or just reading in the scriptures with their mind switched on. Though I sometimes may sound like a preacher myself, I have gone through this. I have questioned every chapter of every Holy Book I read, compared it with secondary literature, compared it with cross-references - it came to following the footnotes zig-zag through those scriptures until I understood them at least a bit. But others don't do that. I know a Christian couple - who do go to church every Sunday, and even go door to door on Saturday trying to convert people - who never ever had opened their own precious Bible because it's a holy book to them. Once I asked them they admitted that their priest would teach them better to understand the Gospel than their own reading would teach them... But - they're going door to door with brochures. WTF? Do they even know what they try to tell the people? Have they studied what they reach? No, they just repeat the old same waltz of arguments like some living gramophones. And I tend to compare those murdering d*%$#sses with these guys in a spiritual sense. Just believing what their preachers are saying, they don't even think about looking it up, and say for themselves: \"The preacher told us that God said so. He is a wise man, else he wouldn't be a preacher - so he just can't lie. And we have to obey God's will.\" And BANG, another suicide bombing, BANG another assault... Otherwise there are some real redneck fundamentalists, who study their Scriptures and take them seriously - too seriously for my concerns, and also without questioning or argument. They say \"It's in the Scriptures, so it's spoken by God, we have to obey God.\" They are so close-minded and ignorant, but they rather operate from behind - being the preachers. These guys are more dangerous than the actual murderers, because they breed always new ones. | 3212) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday! belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning , almost leaving the house heading to my classes :-( | 3213) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday!

If one decides not to follow Gods laws they are welcome to move to a country more suitable to their new found belief system, such as one in the western world... I've always thought that America could have saved themselves billions of dollars by 'rescuing' those in the Islamic societies who have decided to oppose Gods laws with a plane ticket to America and welfare support for the rest of their lives... If that sounds expensive to you, consider the overall cost of our current strategy to 'help' those people... ;) Some Islamic countries / societies are showing us where a theocracy-like government can lead to, when religious leaders are not as true to the Scriptures as they should be.

I prefer the kind of marriage which doesn't even end with the death of one of the partners. One of my grandmothers hasn't married again since her husband died (he died in the 70's) and she even avoided sexual relationships to other men, because she believed that even this would be adultery. I believe that the only sexual relationship should be marriage. That the principle of the \"True Love Waits\" movement is a good one, and should be a general principle for everyone, everywhere, accepted by everybody. Isn't it even a Commandment of God that \"Thou shall not commit adultery\"? Haven't even Jesus and His apostles preached against promiscuity? So why are persons who claim to be Christians not willing to obey this commandment? Is it so difficult to avoid prostition and pornography, to avoid a sexual relationship unless you are sure that the person you love is the person you can live your entire life with?

And approximately 40% of all marriages get divorced. And this although there is a tax advantage for married people... There were 1,357,000 children born 40 years ago, compared to 780,000 in 1975, compared to 685,000 in 2005. A decrease by 50%! 150,000 more people died then were born, only in 2005. Our population shrinks by 0.2% per year despite of immigration. (All data by \"Statistisches Bundesamt\" - the German federal statistics office) There are already people who count the day when the last person switches the lights off here... On a website someone has stated that my former home-town (a town of still about 200,000 citizens) will be empty in 2084, because more people die or move out than people are born or move in. IMHO too many people simply see marriage and children as a fun-killer. That's why they remain single and childless, and have fun with their ONSs or short-time relationships. But life is not only party and fun, it's also responsibility and work and being together. In my opinion, the laws about divorce are too week. They should put some strict requirements which should be met before it comes to a divorce: physical/ psychic violence, or adultery - such things. Not only \"I'm fed up with my spouse - I want a divorce\". The same thing with abortion: I know there are heavy discussions throughout the States, and even protests for and against them - but it's easy here to abort: Don't want to bear this child? Off it goes... Even teens leaving school having had their first or second abortion! IMHO there should be more requirements too. I know, it became political now - but marriage, divorce, promiscuity, and abortion are a subject which should be discussed also here, from the religious point of view. | 3228) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday!

I only hope that he didn't go among the wrong group (on the other hand, once the police is running their amok and beating up demonstrants, every group is the wrong group...) :( From a first hand source I learned that policemen are ordered to training-camps several weeks ahead of such demonstrations, until the demonstrations begin (like against G8, against the transport of nuclear waste - all this stuff) without the possibility to go home, just to make them more aggressive (like, \"Blame these demonstrants that you have a hard time here, not us!\"). Since a permission is needed for each demonstration, they know the exact day and time and place where it begins - so the authorities can prepare their strategies... | 3231) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Thursday!

Looking them up in the Koran itself, I saw that almost the half of them (the most violent ones) were quoted wrong, or even were invented (for example, there were verse numbers not fitting into the numbers of verses in the surahs, or some \"verse quotations\" totally in opposite to each real translation I looked up).

Except in the opera-hall no-one says \"Dich teure Halle\" here anywhere. I have heard a story about an early English Russian computer translation program. When handed \"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\" the program translated that into Russian and back into English, and what came back was \"The vodka is fine, but the meat is rotten.\" P.S. I am going to move an interesting thread hijack to here. Good one, John! LOL Thanks for moving these posts. Much appreciated. The Germans have a saying, \"Dich teure Halle!\" which Babelfish translates to \"You expensive resounds!\". Actually the phrase translates better as \"You precious hall!\". It's the first part of a famous opening line of an aria by the character Elizabeth in Wagner's opera Halle, gr\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcss Ich \"You greet you again!\". So, the phrase \"Dich Teure Halle!\" actually has the English meaning of \"Home Sweet Home!\". But I agree there are some sayings which make no sense when translated literally. For example: \"(jmd.) einen B\u00c3\u00c2\u00a4ren aufbinden\" would mean \"to bind a bear on (someone)\", but I don't know if there is such a saying in English. The meaning of it is: to tell a bold lie to somebody. Another one is a more funny saying: When my father tells my mother to hurry up, he often adds: \"Es ist h\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6chste Eisenbahn\" which translates literally into \"it is highest train\". Makes sense, doesn't it? This is a phrase I also heard often elsewhere in Germany, and it comes from an old theater-play, where an absent-minded postman says, leaving angekommen!\" (\"It is highest train, the time has already arrived three hours ago\") - so the meaning is \"it's high time\" 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: there has been cases of threats posted, but no actual violence.

We strive for the unity of Mankind through the elimination of Islam, the most insidious doctrine of hate. Islam can't be reformed, but it can be eradicated. It can't be molded, but it can be smashed.

We are growing exponentially. The days of Islam are numbered and world peace is around the corner. Many of us will see that day. We might have to go through very tough times meanwhile. The storm is approaching. Does anyone else see the irony? Yes... The truth about Islam is out there... And it's free: Here: [The of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a common word between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (God), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take one another as lords besides Allah (God).\" Then, if they turn away, say: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have submitted to the will of Allah (God)).\" ~Qur'an 3:64 Say : \"Oh you that reject Faith (The Disbelievers)! I worship not that which you worship, Nor will you worship that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping, Nor will you worship that which I worship. To you be your religion, and to me my religion.\" ~Qur'an 109:1-6 This war is about 'ethnic cleansing'... plain and simple... Discuss? ;) I know similar arguments from German boards... These ignorant people confuse normal Muslims with those zealots who are terrorizing others. I read the Qur'an myself, and find it much less aggressive than some people want us to believe. They forget that Jihad means not only fight with weapons, but also the fight against one's own bad habits and each struggle to improve one's own life. According to all definitions I read it just means \"Holy Struggle\". When I go to work and attend evening classes after that in my spare-time, it's a Jihad, because I have to fight my laziness and tiredness to get good notes. And it IS a fight. When you work all day and enjoy to sleep long at weekends it is a struggle to get up early to go to church each Sunday morning. When you wish to go to Church to learn from the preachings and to meet others who believe in the same like you, and you have to struggle, to fight with yourself to reach this, you're on a Jihad. Alliterate people who learn to read and write are on a Jihad. People who use drugs and struggle to come over it are on a Jihad, according to the Qu'ran. But these ignorant people read \"Jihad = fight\" and yell how evil the Qu'ran is, and that all Muslims shall become ex-Muslims asap. Otherwise, they forget, that Allah is just the Arabic translation of \"The One and Only God\" and even the Christians and Jews in Arabic speaking countries call God Allah, and that Jesus (\"Isa ben Maryam\") is appreciated as a prophet in the Qu'ran. | 3300) |[Message belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hi at all!

Others become religion-haters, like my mother did, when my brother died on cancer. By coincident, the last hospital where he was treated was a Christian one, and when the nurse came to tell my mother the sad news, she added: \"God has taken your son away to deliver him from his suffering.\" From this moment on, God was - in the mind of my mother - the Bad Guy who stole her son.

NOTE: This is not necessary a belief or a following, just simply a point of view and summary of what I think it means. From my understanding what could be meant with \"what is seen was not made out of what was visible\" is that it was an attempt to explain that the world around us was made (or: it developed - for the atheists among you ) out of stuff we cannot see with only the eyes (i.e. atoms and smaller stuff) and that you can understand this by faith even without having scientific knowledge. | 3408) |[Message [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: but if you lose it's your fault | 3409) |[Message [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Off the podium you go.

Look again at my response to you in my post 570428. Moore ends up inviting you and all his dull-witted, unquestioning fans to watch his movie when it opens in June. The rest of the faux news leading up to this advertisement was simply meant to pique your interest. I think that you took the reports of the trouble he had (and he even had trouble during planning and shooting the movie, as he wrote some letters before) as an advertisement. I am such a \"dull-witted\" fan, but not unquestioning. Since I am interested in the USA, and after being there myself 2times for four weeks (and not in tidy hotels and tourist centers) I even plan to immigrate as soon as I get the chance. Nonetheless I call myself critical, and do not take every word of the official media as granted. I never did in GDR times, I don't do it in my nowadays home country Germany, and I won't do it in my hopefully home-to-be USA. When I'm reading a newspaper (and i do not read only one), or see news on TV or in the 'net I compare the articles to several topics with other media, and even look for the same topics in independent media to get my own point of view. But I trust the independent media more than the mainstream media business.

But, on the other hand, about as many people who read or watched his reports do not believe them, they think that's just exaggerated crap. AFAIK, such a constellation is meant when someone is told to be polarizing, isn't it? But anyway, another part of the people will either say \"Um, Michael - who?\" - or if they know his name, they aren't interested in his works because he is \"too political\" for them. | [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This is a winning post. :-) This also. :D | 3483) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) SICKO is this? An being investigated and had to \"spirit out\" a master copy of the film he made that it ain't confiscated! Don't film-makers, even investigative ones, have the same rights as other US-citizens anymore? This morning, at 5:00am Middle-European Summer Time I got an e-mail by (because I'm on the mailing-list of) \"The Enemy\": \"Sicko\" Is Completed and We're Off to Cannes! May 17, 2007 Friends, It's a wrap! My new film, \"Sicko,\" is all done and will have its world premiere this Saturday night at the Cannes Film Festival. As with \"Bowling for Columbine\" and \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" we are honored to have been chosen by this prestigious festival to screen our work there. My intention was to keep \"Sicko\" under wraps and show it to virtually no one before its premiere in Cannes. That is what I have done and, as you may have noticed if you are a recipient of my infrequent Internet letters, I have been very silent about what I've been up to. In part, that's because I was working very hard to complete the film. But my silence was also because I knew that the health care industry -- an industry which makes up more than 15 percent of our GDP -- was not going to like much of what they were going to see in this movie and I thought it best not to upset them any sooner than need be. Well, going quietly to Cannes, I guess, was not to be. For some strange reason, on May 2nd the Bush administration initiated an action against me over how I obtained some of the content they believe is in my film. As none of them have actually seen the film (or so I hope!), they decided, unlike with \"Fahrenheit 9/11,\" not to wait until the film was out of the gate and too far down the road to begin their attack. Bush's Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, launched an investigation of a trip I took to Cuba to film scenes for the movie. These scenes involve a group of 9/11 rescue workers who are suffering from illnesses obtained from working down at Ground Zero. They have received little or no help with their health care from the government. I do not want to give away what actually happens in the movie because I don't want to spoil it for you (although I'm sure you'll hear much about it after it unspools Saturday). Plus, our lawyers have advised me to say little at this point, as the film goes somewhere far scarier than \"Cuba.\" Rest assured of one thing: no laws were broken. All I've done is violate the modern-day rule of journalism that says, \"ask no questions of those in power or your luncheon privileges will be revoked.\" This preemptive action taken by the Bush administration on the eve of the \"Sicko\" premiere in Cannes led our attorneys to fear for the safety of our film, noting that Secretary Paulson may try to claim that the content of the movie was obtained through a violation of the trade embargo that our country has against Cuba and the travel laws that prohibit average citizens of our free country from traveling to Cuba. (The law does not prohibit anyone from exercising their first amendment right of a free press and documentaries are protected works of journalism.) I was floored when our lawyers told me this. \"Are you saying they might actually confiscate our movie?\" \"Yes,\" was the answer. \"These days, anything is possible. Even if there is just a 20 percent chance the government would seize our movie before Cannes, does anyone want to take that risk?\" Certainly not. So there we were last week, spiriting a duplicate master negative out of the country just so no one from the government would take it from us. (Seriously, I can't believe I just typed those words! Did I mention that I'm an American, and this is America and NO ONE should ever have to say they had to do such a thing?) I mean, folks, I have just about had it. Investigating ME because I'm trying to help some 9/11 rescue workers our government has abandoned? Once again, up is down and black is white. There are only two people in need of an investigation and a trial, and the desire for this across America is so widespread you don't even need to see the one's smirk or hear the other's sneer to know who I am talking about. But no, I'm the one who now has to hire lawyers and sneak my documentary out of the country just so people can see a friggin' movie. I mean, it's just a movie! What on earth could I have placed on celluloid that would require such a nonsensical action against me? Ok. Scratch that. Well, I'm on my way to Cannes right now, a copy of the movie in my bag. Don't feel too bad for me, I'll be in the south of France for a week! But then it's back to the U.S. for a number of premieres and benefits and then, finally, a chance for all of you to see this film that I have made. Circle June 29th on your calendar because that's when it opens in theaters everywhere across the country and Canada (for the rest of the world, it opens in the fall). I can't wait for you to see it.

The only problem with that is that the socialistic/communistic systems have been failures in the long run wherever and whenever they have been tried. Well, actually I suggested to substitute it with communes, which already is partly communistic. The philosophy is seductive, but it only works if every member of the society is totally selfless. This will never happen and, worse yet, it ignores the reality of human nature as it is and has been throughout recorded history and as it was passed down in legends and tales from prehistory.That's wrong. As I read lately, selfishness, greed and envy are a matter of education, not of human nature. You can teach people to become selfless and humble when you start early enough, like you can teach them another language, philosophy or a certain belief... In my studies of historic and present day cultures, I have found that, over time, a communistic style system invariably ends up as a classic dictatorship. Indeed, most of them start that way. In a socialistic system, over the long haul, it is an even bet for either a dictatorship or the eventual breakdown of aspects of the society. And in both, the culture is fragile and crumbles if stressed. That's what I meant when I said \"That's not within my experience so it's impossible\" [Edit:] after re-thinking it, I must admit that selfishness is a part of the human nature, like, when you see the Freudian [Id, Ego and Super-Ego](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id%2C_ego%2C_and_super-ego), selfishness represents the Id, while selflessness represents the Super-Ego.

There is no virtue in holding that one's moral worth or standing is dependent upon his charity..... Noone seems to claim that the citizens of Suriname are non virtuous because none of their dollars go to charity...... Virtue is something that arises out of a virile spirit.....the outcome of this is often that we, the virtuous nations, lend a hand to those in need.....virtue is a means to an end...not the final end. Altruism means that you give to charity what you can give, without thinking of profit. Just helping out for the honor of helping, for the joy to have done something good to one or several in need. With a grateful smile and a \"thank you\" as the only turnover. If it's money you have a plus of to spend, spend the money to charity. If you have time and manpower, spend your time and manpower to do good. But unfortunately voluntary work is seldom counted in such statistics. Only because people have neither enough money to earn their living, nor enough spare-time to do some voluntary work, doesn't mean they're not altruistic.

You're so predictable. He is one of those german philosophers that helped propel nazis into power. He believed in the 'Hegeleian super logic'....noone's ever been able to understand quite what that means except you and a few high level nazis. At one point even he gave up after receiving a letter and declared that the perfect Hegellian dialectic had been achieved and perhaps the warfare should cease....He traces his background back to Immanuael Kant and further than that back to Plato (like the marxists do) I think you've made a classic case for yourself. Hegel a father of Nazism? You can state as well that Jesus had been the father of the Inquisition. Only because some people misunderstood and perverted his teachings you can't blame him. And he couldn't have helped the Nazis into power himself, since he lived from 1770 to 1831, died a hundred years before the Nazis came into power. Long time enough to pervert his teachings. A lot of later philosophers called themselves Hegelians though they agreed to just some few points but were in total opposition to his central teachings. \"If Nietzsche and Hegel serve as alibis to the masters of Dachau and Karaganda, that does not condemn their entire philosophy. But it does lead to the suspicion that one aspect of their thought, or of their logic, can lead to these appalling conclusions\" (Albert Camus) IMHO even the Marxists misunderstood Marx the same way as the Hegelians misunderstood Hegel, since Marx himself didn't see his own teachings as solid axioms, but as theories to be reviewed and revised. Sure I quoted Hegel - but only with this one phrase. And also just because I had the phrase in mind before and had to look up who stated it. So I looked up the author, and then added him. R/B wrote: Earlier you posted a brief descriptive model of how society should be arranged. Your prescription is %100 fascist by definition. My brief imagination of a society how it should be arranged is a model mixture of what I read about anarchy, about communism, about several communes, about the former Mormon \"Law of Consecration\", about the Jewish Kibbutzim - and of my bad experiences and observations in both, the \"Socialist\" and the capitalist society. You see, no fascistic teachings in there. Would you accuse the early Christians to have had fascistic thoughts? Acts 2:44 and following: \"And all that believed were together and had all things common. And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" Is a commune, is sharing your plusses to the good of all, a fascist ideology? Is it fascistic to accuse people, who are not willing to give their share to the society which they are part of, egocentric? In my opinion there should never be such a huge gap between those who have the least income and those who have most. And in my opinion any rich nation should not allow poverty within their own boundaries. As I read the other day one eighth of all US citizens live in poverty according to US poverty limits! One out of eight! And you accuse me to be fascistic when I want these conditions to vanish?

You advocate slavery and freedom. Whatever system this is will never ever work. There are no diametrically opposed positions there. Everybody has their rights (for example: their right of property) and everybody has their duties (for example: to serve the needs of the entire community). Only a system where the rights and the duties are balanced, and where to fulfill the duties doesn't need any restriction to anybody, is a just system. There is a phrase, saying \"Freiheit ist von Gott, Freiheiten sind vom Teufel\" (or, in English, translated by me): Freedom is from God, liberties are from the devil. I advocate freedom instead of slavery. But freedom also in the sense of free from poverty, free from exploitation, free from privileges over other ppl. Hegel said: freedom is the insight into necessity. For humanity means, for the entire mankind, it's necessary to become more altruistic. Even the so-called \"rule of the jungle\" (to eat or to be eaten) seldomly is inside the same species. Wolves help the weaker of the pack, as long as they can at least help a little bit to drive the prey. Apes do that. Dolphins care for their sick and weak. When animals can be altruistic who are not slaves of any rule except the necessity to survive, why should it impossible to humans? | 3562) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning, sipping the third mug of coffee since the beginning of my breakfast/brunch/whatever :D | 3563) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Have no fear Ultra Man is Here to win this Post!!

Since the discussion of ours spread over the Religion Thread as well, I will answer political topics only here, and religious topics only there. At first. fascism as I understand it, is an unjust system with repressions, terror, racism, brutal police force, persecution of people who are for freedom and justice. Mussolini's Italia was fascism. Hitler's Germany was fascism. You wrote: You've already plainly advocated economic fascism and the denial of a people's/person's right to exist for his own sake.

The farmland or the cattle to feed themselves, the house they live in themselves, everything they really need for themselves should be their own. But all plus, and everything else, should belong to the community as a reserve fund for bad times for all members of the community, and to finance things which are good for the entire community (like schools, hospitals, day-care centers etc.). And I think that a government or administration should be not made of parties but of the most competent persons, and, as well as those who are chosen to be their control agents, to do this in kind of turns as a honorary job. Turns long enough, that they are able to manage things but too short to not let them some project become their pet project. And I think that each law, each new rule, each price or salary change should pass a plebiscite before it becomes legit. I also do not like that there is the need of a rigid government. But if a country has a government (and almost every country has one), it should kind of control the market. Like in the old times there also have been market supervisors on each market place, who checked the weights and lengths and set the price-spans and rates and profit margins, which were valid for this market. Those who put their prices above these rules were banned and boycotted as usurers... And I think that markets (also global ones - especially those) should be supervised to guarantee a fair trade.

You quote a historically racist and fascist economy as a model in several of your above posts then do the artful dogdger routine like a coward and then blame a nation that is CLOSER to fulfilling freedom minded economy over your own as if it is somehow at fault for following the very precepts you wish for!!!! You are insane. Just come out of the closet and admit what it is you are advocating.... Don't act as if capitalism is a virtue then criticisize it for when it is compromised by the fascism of economy YOU support.... I cannot stand dishonest men. I never said capitalism were a virtue, did I? But I also do not support fascism because fascism for me is equal to racism, injustice, police brutality, persecution of people who are thinking politically otherwise. If there is a society living the system I'd like to advocate, it's not yet been found - or I don't know of it. May be it worked already in small communes, or in some small areas. And I must admit that many things I do advocate are a mixture of theory and bad experience, so to speak: I know how it shouldn't be, and only imagine how it could be. I know by myself that power corrupts people. So give people no power over other people, so they won't become corrupt :) After long pondering about I think I can agree with this: \"There is no valid way of measuring the value of any one person's economic contributions because all wealth is a collective product of current and preceding generations. For instance, one could not measure the value of a factory worker's daily production without taking into account how transportation, food, water, shelter, relaxation, machine efficiency, emotional mood etc. contributed to their production. To truly give numerical economic value to anything, an infinite amount of externalities and contributing factors would need to be taken into account. (...)Any economic system based on wage labor and private property requires a coercive state apparatus to enforce property rights and to maintain the unequal economic relationships that inevitably arise from differences in wages or amount of property. (...)Markets and systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical values to worth of an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption and distribution.\" \"Human evolutionary tendency is for humans to cooperative with each other for mutual benefit and survival instead of existing as lone competitors.\" And these were theories older than those of Marx and Proudhon. | 3603) Post: There#s nothing else for 3604) 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: More and more advocacy for fascism by zwerge....amazing, but not surprising.

For instance, one could not measure the value of a factory worker's daily production without taking into account how transportation, food, water, shelter, relaxation, machine efficiency, emotional mood etc. contributed to their production. To truly give numerical economic value to anything, an infinite amount of externalities and contributing factors would need to be taken into account. (...)Any economic system based on wage labor and private property requires a coercive state apparatus to enforce property rights and to maintain the unequal economic relationships that inevitably arise from differences in wages or amount of property. (...)Markets and systems of currency divide labor into classes and assign arbitrary numerical values to worth of an individual's work and attempt to regulate production, consumption and distribution.\" \"Human evolutionary tendency is for humans to cooperative with each other for mutual benefit and survival instead of existing as lone competitors.\" If you want, you may discuss. :-) I kind of tend to agree with at least two of [Proudhon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proudhon)'s ideas, who once said: \"Property is theft!\" \"The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people . . . will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants.'\" And, very important to me - as well as to the libertarians ;) - he also wrote: \"To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.\" And with my experiences with a Socialist government, I must agree with [Bakunin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), who once said: \"They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac their dictatorship, of course \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.\" If you want, feel free to discuss :-D | 3637) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 564739](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=564739)) Posted 10 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: And you got over 2 hours doing so.

Newell](http://www.musicandthespokenword.com/messages/display.php?message=206) We all have moments in life that can change us forever. Somehow we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re never quite the same after certain experiences. And more often than not, such pivotal moments can be relatively simple and small. In the late 19th century, a young American of Scottish descent traveled to Scotland to live and work for a number of years. The work was difficult, the hours long, the discouragements frequent. During his time in Scotland, far away from his beloved home and family, he had occasion to spend a day touring the magnificent Stirling Castle in the countryside near Glasgow. Later that evening, he happened to notice an inscription chiseled in the stone arch over the front door of a house: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"What E\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The message penetrated the young man\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s heart. Invigorated and renewed, he determined to \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"act well his part.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 He later returned to America and went on to become a great leader, revered by all who knew him. His discovery of an old Scottish proverb was a turning point in his life. The simple message, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"What E\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2er Thou Art, Act Well Thy Part,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 became his personal motto. He never forgot its challenge to always do his best, whatever the task. We all have such pivotal moments, if we just recognize them. They often come unexpectedly, when we\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2re struggling or discouraged, when we need them most. We suddenly notice something we haven\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t seen before. It sparks a new insight that inspires us and motivates us. We discover a new resolve to do better and to be better. We change forever in that moment. And for the rest of our lives we look back to that moment for strength and inspiration. | 3669) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Unfortunately for me it was not up to this school to decide whether or not they could keep me instead of the other man, but to the communal school administration.

The effort, called the Encyclopedia of Life, will include species descriptions, pictures, maps, videos, sound, sightings by amateurs, and links to entire genomes and scientific journal papers. Its first pages of information will be shown today in Washington where the massive effort is being announced by some of the world's leading scientific institutions and universities. The project will take about 10 years to complete and fill about 300 million pages. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It's an interactive zoo,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said James Edwards, the encyclopedia's executive director. The MacArthur and Sloan foundations have given $12.5 million to pay for the first 2\u00c3\u00c2\u00bd years of the effort, but it will be free and accessible to everyone. The pages can be adjusted so that they provide useful information for a schoolchild or a research biologist. While amateurs can contribute in clearly marked side pages, the key detail and science parts of the encyclopedia will be compiled and reviewed by experts. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It could be a very big leap in the way we do science,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Cristian Samper, acting secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, one of seven museums, universities and labs to launch the encyclopedia. Other institutions helping head the undertaking include Harvard University, Chicago's Field Museum, the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, the Biodiversity Heritage Library Consortium, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Atlas of Living Australia.

If they want the tithing of your incomes, you'll give them the tithing. If they want a fifth you'll give them the fifth - and so on. It's the right of any government to draw taxes. A) The gov't didn't make it. They standardized it and printed it. Each individual contracts freely with others to trade his labor for it, thus creating wealth. B) There are no \"laws in a manner that you can get money for the work you do,\" that is called the free market, not the gov'tallowsyoutoworket. C)Gov'ts do have the \"right\" as you use it there to charge taxes for the proper roles of gov't. What they do not have the right to do is tax people on a whim for non-proper roles of gov't based solely on who has the most pull in gov't. That gets you the WHISC and War in Iraq. But you have to support that system. Because without it, you wouldn't get your welfare programs and handouts. You simply seem incapable of understanding that money was taken by force from poor Soviet citizens so that they could bankroll your flat and SS-18s. What did they get out of that? Nothing. Which is why they never would have done it voluntarily. Money was taken from you to bankroll the Stasi. Yay. Again, because it is based on nothing more than force, it is immoral and wrong. I suppose you know as much about the former \"socialist\" system as I know about the American \"free market\". Both, the Soviet workers, and the workers in GDR got their wages which were put as tariffs. On the pay slips there (if I had one of my old ones here I could scan them and put it here via photobucket) was written just the working hours and the salary, and the fee for the health-care insurance, nothing else. Sure the governments drew taxes, but they didn't inform the people about it. The Soviet citizens had - at least before Gorbachev - almost as high a living standard as we in East Germany. But it all broke together when they privatized the communal and state owned factories. Then poverty came over the Soviets. Sure my mother paid a ridiculous mortgage of 35 GDR Mark for our apartment. And sure food and beverages were exceptionally cheap. But even in 1988 a simple walkman-copy had the price of 250 GDR Mark, a small Russian color TV set (the size you may use while camping) cost 3500 GDR Mark (as much as I earned in 3.5 months without spending any money elsewhere), a real size one was at 7500; and if you needed something repaired at the house (or the car you waited for 18 years) and didn't want to wait half a year you spent a fortune paying them for work they did during their spare-time. A simple oven for your kitchen? Almost 8000! New furniture? Work a year that you can afford it! It was a simple measure. things you need daily were made cheap while things you buy once in a while were extra expensive. I know someone who had inherited about 5000 DM from West German family members, and he wanted to have his house repaired. The guy who worked for him officially took the 5 GDR Mark which were allowed as amount for qualified work as \"neighborly help\", plus 10 DM per hour. - This was cheap compared to cases I only heard of, where craftsmen took 10/15 per hour, and their \"clients\" had to go and exchange their money into DM to pay them. And the man with the DM could do nothing against it. Admit to the authorities that he paid dearly for \"neighborly help\" and risking that this man was arrested and each other craftsman refuses to work for him? Refuse the DM and risking to not get the job done? It was a shadow economy which also destroyed that system. Not only the politics of the old men in the Politburo. | 3716) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562491](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562491)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: nothing, except that I happen to have winning shift :) | 3717) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562487](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562487)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hi Thorin.

Hate: Usage: Our Savior is said to have hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes; his language shows that he loathed the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans; he detested the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees; he abhorred the suggestions of the tempter in the wilderness. [1913 Webster] Are you a follower of Jesus, or a follower of 'the other jesus'... ;) But do you have to hate the entire person when you just hate what he/she does... ? I mean, a mother doesn't hate her child even when she just realized that he/she were committing a crime - he/she is still her beloved child. But she (the mother) hates what her child has done in this case. I think, it's meant similar. You shall love the persons, not their deeds. | 3719) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562474](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562474)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Returning for a win 35 minutes before midnight.

And also fifth time: I think money is always spend better to help people than to kill them. Right. Taxes. And it doesn't matter what you think. Any more than it matters what Dubya thinks. He disagrees with you, you disagree with him. However, you both support the same immoral system: that being that it's OK for each of you to initiate force take money from others to make them support your pet projects that those people otherwise would not have supported. They would have used that money to raise their kids, or pay for retirement, or help a loved one through a tough time, donate to charity or support their church, build a better home, live a better life and provide for their family. Whatever they chose to do with it, they would have done so freely. But they can't, because you want to take it from them. You and Dubya on the other hand, can't fathom that. You must take it from them, by force, and spend it whatever you two think is best. Except that you disagree on what to spend it on. Just like everyone else does. So, since the only basis for deciding is the initiation of force, that system is immoral. There have been taxes for many thousand years. When Jesus was asked whether or not it was righteous to have to pay taxes, \"he said unto them, Whose is this image and the superscription? They said unto him, Caesar's. Then said He to them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\" (St. Matthew 22:20-21) IMHO this means: You get your money from the government (they made it, and they made the laws in a manner that you can get money for the work you do), you have to give them as much money as they want you to give. If they want the tithing of your incomes, you'll give them the tithing. If they want a fifth you'll give them the fifth - and so on. It's the right of any government to draw taxes. | 3723) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562450](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562450)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: back from school, back to winning 3724) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562240](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562240)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: last post to win before going to class. 17:50 | belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: 17:49, and I have to go to evening class. one last post over there in LPTPW, then I have to go. | 3726) |[Message There's a world of difference: unborn embryos aren't impertinent!

A living, almost fully developed, but tiny human being. I'd tolerate no abort - except out of some really serious reason (be it that the pregnancy were too risky for the mother, be it that the pregnancy was caused by rape, be it other, also medical reasons). These are reasons even I would say: do it. Everything else is not acceptable for me and IMHO it shows a lack of respect against the gift of life. There are so many ways to choose for a woman who doesn't want to have a child: she can have the little embryo passed over to a surrogate mother if the pregnancy itself will be too much for her, or she can give the little helpless newborn baby away to some orphanage if she realizes that she won't be able to handle to be a mother, etc. There's no need to murder a helpless child. | 3728) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562225](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562225)) Posted 7 May 2007 by winning : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562211](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562211)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Now it's time to go off the podium, Richard, Sir of Nobody :) Let me win | 3730) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562160](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562160)) Posted 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: 225 winning, while listening to 3731) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) THREAD CLOSED DAY!](forum_thread.php?id=39292) ( [Message 562152](forum_thread.php?id=39292&postid=562152)) Posted 7 May 2007 by to 7 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: But I think, that's a unfair, to prefer the one project over all the others.

MfG, MEX HP: The blockage of this topic has nothing to do with your interest in Folding@home coincidentally? I just wanted to post a message with links to other projects, and because of your blockage the entire straight provided text with all links is lost! I suppose you can imagine how angry I am about your blockage? How would it have been with the Small-talk area? L.G. Silent bass There is no Small-talk area in the PS3 forum! And since there is a sticky topic for the Folding@home Community in the General PS3 forum, even right at the top, I see no rational reason why I shall not open a a topic for SETI@home, too, in this forum! Otherwise also the Folding@home Community topic should not be tolerated in the general PS3 forum, because one @home project would be preferred on one side. MfG, MEX P.S.: I also have the Linux kit for the PS2, if one would talk about SETI@home in the general small talk thread, they always had to add, for which Platform: PS2 or PS3! Then they can add it in the thread title. L.G. Silent bass What's up now? Will you unlock my SETI@home topic? Or do you shift it together with the still open Folding@home topic into the general small talk thread of the entire HP Community? Or will you now close the Folding@home topic for reasons of equal treatment also? MfG, MEX P.S.: What I do not intend to suggest is a one side preference of Folding@home, which goes so far that topics about other @home projects in this forum are made mute by blockage while it's still possible to discuss about Folding@home! I will not unlock it. The one thing is an official topic for the good of the entire mankind, the other one is aliens, which has nothing to do with the PS3. So it has nothing lost (?) in the PS3 General Forum. If you want to complain about, you can do this here. L.G. Silent bass | 3747) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 7 2007 by [thorin Post: Ah.

Is it taking care of people to allow that they sure get their wounds bandaged, but are sent home if they are real sick only because they are poor?

You just said that all libertarians want to stop both corporate and other wellfare. You have to decide on one of them. Forgive me if I was unclear. They want to stop welfare, of all sorts, from the gov't. What individual corporations or people choose to do on their own is entirely up to them. Their choice. Or not. The Futurist Manifesto was written by Marinetti. I think you should read it. It says the same things you do just a lot better. Thank you for the recommendation. That's why I said that this philosophy is egocentric. Rather you watch humans starve than let the gov't give them enough to eat, and a possibility later to earn their meal. Rather watch homeless people die in winter than let the community give them a warm place to sleep if not an entire home. No-one chooses to starve. Almost no-one chooses to be poor, to be homeless, to be unemployed. The system made the very most of them become this.

He meant somehow moral causes of diseases and ailments. Reminds me of the christian flaggelant movements. Your earlier comments about people having 'diseases inside of themselves' don't need further references. I'm sorry, Robert, but I didn't read Thorin's comment like that. I can partly agree with him, that some people are more predisposed to get illnesses, and certain cancer forms are hereditary, like a certain form of breast cancer, where women, who have relatives, mothers and sisters, who had breast cancer, have chosen to have preventive mastectomies done as the probability of themselves getting it is very high. It's a common perception mostly in the New Age circles that we cause our illnesses ourselves through negative ways of thinking, and that you also can cure yourself through positive thinking. But this is actually a problem for people who suffer from some very aggressive lethal illnesses, such as certain forms of cancer, and it can create a lot of guilt feelings in the patients, that they themselves are responsible for their condition, that they themselves have brought them into their situation. And some of them are taking measures in trying to heal themselves through alternative healing, some very painful and always extremely expensive. So, besides fighting a serious illness, they also have to fight those feelings of being alone, of having caused their own situation. And that is inhuman in my opinion. Interesting what people can read in my posts ... Robert I did not mean that diseases have moral causes. Some are triggered by poisons coming into our bodies, that's true. But it does NOT mean that there is ANY moral cause for ANY disease! Remember, I stated somewhere (wasn't it even in this thread?) that twenty years ago my own younger brother died painfully on cancer, 15 of age! Was this his own fault? Never! He just had the bad luck to get that piece of genetic heritage from his great-grandfather who also died on a similar cancer. Please do not even assume I would mean such a fate had moral causes! I know that psychic problems can make you physically sick, too, or make healing slower. But also these conditions have nothing to do with moral. (Except handling moral makes you sick - attempted joke) they are to christian right-wing [snip]. That is why they think you are trying to euthanase people. For them god created them to obey his will and have money in the wallett and babes in the bank while they are naked around hemp-growers. By their standards, the Apostle Paul sure did get a shady deal...

Okay. I understand. Well - I know, only a few vocabular problems, just expression problems. I hope this time it sounds not too confuse. But what I wrote (I have re-read the post you meant), at least what I meant while I wrote them, has nothing to do with eugenics. Do not connect my comments with this insane, evil \"Race hygienic\" stuff. But it does have to do with genetics. Because, I learned in Biology that some diseases, and also the - like I said: affinity - for other diseases are given by parents to their children via genes. Some of them are dominant, these are given directly from the parents to the kids - and some are recessive, they may lack a few generations. So that - say my great-grandfather can have suffered from a cancer (so the affinity to get it is in the genes), and not my grandfather after him was suffering from a cancer, neither my father after, it was \"carried\" hidden, recessively, to my brother. My Grandfather, and my father had the disease in their bodies, but it didn't come out in them, they were healthy - they just \"carried\" it. Similar but worse like when you \"carry\" flu viruses from one sick person to \"give\" them to another without getting the flu yourself. So my thought was, that people can't know whether they got the \"bad\" genes or just \"carry\" them to the next generation. So, if there is any substance triggering something of your genetic heritage, you can become sick, and your brother not, though he had the same substances around. You (becoming sick) had that gene, he (remaining healthy) didn't have it or is just \"carrying\" it maybe to one of his children or grandchildren. It's like with the blood groups: When parents have A, and the other B, they can - depending on their recessive Genotype - give birth to children with A, B, AB, and 0. That's why the blood test is sometimes complicated. | 3772) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning here while installing Mandriva2007 on my Laptop I hope it works well for you on the first try.

Mostly I simply was to lazy for that (or to tired) and just tried to express myself without using this dictionary. | 3784) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Back to the bottom.

No I cannot understand that. The WHISC, or former SOA, has not been called \"School of Assassins\" without reason. It is the most fascistoid facility since the Napola in the \"Third Reich\". Each cent the US government is spending for them is one cent too much. SOA graduates include former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson, and former dictators of Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. SOA graduates were also responsible for the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, the El Mozote massacre, the Uraba massacre, and the assassination of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Vladimiro Montesinos, another graduate of the SOA and right- hand man of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, has been implicated as the leader of the Grupo Colina death squad responsible for numerous massacres in Peru. And for such an institution the US government is spending Millions of Dollars? Incredible. It's a shame! Both, the WHISC and the Klan - but also the ideologically similar NSDAP(AO) belong banned and forbidden. To let them do their anti-human things, even to let them publish and congregate, is a perversion of the constitutional rights.

What is universal is just culturally derived from common practice in the beforementioned culture. For instance it is okay for an american leader to be pro executions, but that is not okay for a european leader since in europe consensus is against the procedure. So for that there is no universal value. And I would be seriously surprised if you or anyone else could come up with something that is a universal value, because that would also have to be TRUE for ALL.Surprise: Truth, Righteousness, Reliability are three out of many universal values which are appreciated in every culture. Normally here a swede for instance will come up with that it is a universal value to not spank children. An american will come up with that it is not okay to eat children. Most cultures will come up with that sex is not okay with children. But there is probably somewhere out there a spanking cannibalistic pedophile who will go \"Oh yeah! Says who?\". IMHO a too exaggerated example to be taken serious. So the only viable option is to say \"that freedom is the abillity to live by the majority values\". Which is actually the system behind most cultures way of instigating laws. But it is not TRUE freedom in every sense of the word. And thusly true freedom is a chimera sought after by lesser souls without contact with reallity.Sad that you are believing this.

Only a couple of us post comments in favor of freedoms. The other couple of posters posted dissenting views from one side or another. One side believes religion should be in control of these affairs. The other side believes that government should control all of these spheres of life. Interesting that these are really the same ideas in meaning. I believe YOU should control and make these decisions. AFAIK freedom is not: \"Do what you want and do not care about others\". That's too similar to what LaVey was preaching. Or rather: \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\"? But freedom IS: Wikipedia wrote: * the ability to act in accordance with the dictates of reason; * the ability to act in accordance with one's own true self or values; * the ability to act in accordance with universal values (such as the True and the Good); and * the ability to act independently of both the dictates of reason and the urges of desires, i.e. arbitrarily (autonomously). So even my suggestions were in accordance with this definition of freedom: to act in accordance with universal values (here: equity / justice) Of course my thought about caring for the general public as a duty for every-one depending on their abilities is a part of my ideological heritage, but I think it's a good principle. Humans are social beings, so the social conditions are a matter of every part of the society - even of the companies and corporations. | 3806) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Time for me to win :) good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good nite! | 3807) |[Message belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Oh my - I can't have a nap without some trouble here.

Did it ever cross your mind that there is more to the world than your empty ideas about it? <snip> Here also more money is given for military stuff by the government than for human needs like health care or for education. I can't understand why killing people (and weapons are built for killing) should be more important than welfare, healing or teaching. I think life and health and education are much much more important than military stuff, so - logically - there should be spent more money for them. But once again, you seem to beg for the collective to take care of you. If you can understand why you think for yourself that social programs are more important than \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"killing people,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 you can understand why other free thinking people think it is more important to provide for national defense\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acto protect the very country that provides those social programs. And, since the only standard is who at any given time can convince some politicians to take some more dough from other people to pay for their pet programs, sometimes you get health care, sometimes you get weapons systems. That is the system you support. You just disagree about what to spend the stealin's on. Well, I'm afraid that you'll never get people in charge who are absolutely incorruptible, who will never take money from companies to do them favors. In my opinion, most of the \"democratic\" government are corrupt using [this definition](http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9358009). Isn't the weal of the people the original duty of a government? Unfortunately, they accept that politicians get paid at the same time for some CEO job and for their senator or representative job. In my opinion one position collides with the other one. Changing a verse of the Scriptures slightly: You can't serve the Mammon and the country. You will either serve the Mammon or the country. So I think, each of them in government should quit all of their industrial posts to be full-time representatives. If I had the money for a bunch of lawyers, I would sue half of our government - and (I'm afraid) at least half of our industry for bribery. The industry because they bribe the representatives, and the representatives because they accept the posts and the money. beater? Obsolete? The Eurofighter had worse data at everything than the MiG-29, though the MiG-29 was 10 years older. It would have been much much cheaper for Germany to buy planes instead of develop a new one which showed up to become a flop. If something is working, and works fine, why spend money to \"re-invent the wheel\"? When I see this Euro-Fighter junk: they spent billions for its development, and sold full-functioning MiG29 Fulcrum and other modern military stuff to Poland and other countries for one single Euro a piece! An entire fighter jet, fueled and armed, for \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac 1,-! Can you dig that? Are they nuts? I think they are. Totally. This often happens with beater and obsolete military systems. Those planes aren\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t worth much, but the repair parts, upgrades, and servicing contracts are worth FAR more. They dump the plane for 1 Euro to get the maintenance contracts. That's just business. If I were in charge, I would totally change the priorities in spending tax money: the main part for the people (R&D; cost-free education, cost-free health-care, better welfare, security; state-wide tariffs for each profession: that the same job with the same responsibilities and difficulties is paid with the same salary everywhere in Germany); at most half of the remaining budget for military stuff, and nothing as present for those who already have enough. Then you simply become Stalin. Or Mr. DPRK. You become the dictator you seem to dislike. Why? Because people disagree with your empty ideas. There is no such think as \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"cost-free education,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"cost-free health-care.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 Or with \"cost-free education\": paid 100% by the community, without the students or their parents having to pay extra fee for studying. In my opinion, no parents should have to pay that their kids can attend a school. No student should have to pay for education. Okay, except for the books and materials. And I imagine \"cost-free health-care\" as being fully paid by the fees of the health-care insurances plus the communities. So no-one who have to go to the physician or dentist or any other medical treatment had to pay once more for the treatment itself. [/quote] I think that there should be no legal difference between a person and a \"legal entity\": They have money? They have to pay taxes for it. They wanna have others pay for them? They will be punished. Simply as that. I simply can not understand how it's possible that each worker and employee has to pay taxes - which is a lot compared to the income, while huge companies which count their wins in Millions per month do not have to pay even one single cent! And worse: they even get money from the government! How sick is that? Workers financing their own job via taxes, or what? It would be just if EVERY legal entity and legal person had to pay taxes according to their income: the more income, the more taxes to pay. The more you have, the more you have to give - also taxes. But reality shows that those who have much income pay less taxes (in percentage of their income) than those who have less income. Blatant injustice. Sheesh is this empty. This is very simple: corporations do not pay taxes. Ever. Nothing. Zero. Individuals pay every single cent of corporate tax. Charge the corp 5%, charge them 100%, it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2t matter, individual citizens pay every penny. Taxes on corporations are just another cost. Take Nike for example. To make shoes, they add of the cost of the labor, the overhead, the leather, the rubber, and the laces, and whatnot and determine the price of the shoes. If you tax them, that tax just becomes another cost, added directly to the cost of the shoes, just like leather. Which means that individual citizens pay every cent. Since tax rates are set for all corps, every shoe company has to do the same thing. So if you charge them 30%, Nike raises their shoe price by 30%, but so does Reebok, Puma, and everyone else. The price jumps by the exact amount of the tax, just as it does for the amount of rubber or laces or whatever. If I were in Charge (even as \"dictator\"! ) I would force them to pay their taxes - and to stay in the country. I would judge \"legal entities\" and their representatives the same way I'd judge normal persons. The representatives of the companies fully responsible for what the company is doing. | 3824) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: 470 and is mathematics |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Actually, R/B, appalling or not, he's quite right.

His point was that disease is somehow inherent in the body and is awakened by sin or other such. You twisting it this way is horrid...........absolutely horrid. I'm quite sure that I never said the disease would be awakened like by sin. I said, that the disease which is already sleeping in you, will come out: if there's no affinity to cancer (or whatever) in your body already, you will not get these diseases even if you smoke 50 cigarettes daily, for 70 years. If you have this affinity - well, sickness comes. But: unless you check your genome you'll never know whether or not you'll become \"sick by smoking\". But even the affinity to using drugs (alcohol, tobacco among them) is told to be fixed in the DNA. Sure it looks like the \"original sin\" argument. But a lot of things - among these our affinity to get certain diseases - is fixed in our DNA. This doesn't mean you have to suffer these diseases: only that there is a certain probability for you to get them. And you even can carry (recessive) diseases inside you to pass them over to one the next generations. And I tried to state that the probability for these diseases to come out can raise by the poisons we inhale when smoking. Sure on the first view it looks cruel, and I tried to express it otherwise, but couldn't.

But he is supposed to pay for a container and a weekly garbage collection like everyone, which he disagrees. So the garbage collection company sued him to accept the container and to pay for its collection. In this report a representative of this company said: \"Garbage splitting - okay, but if anyone did it like this man, where would this lead to?!\" Here also more money is given for military stuff by the government than for human needs like health care or for education. I can't understand why killing people (and weapons are built for killing) should be more important than welfare, healing or teaching. I think life and health and education are much much more important than military stuff, so - logically - there should be spent more money for them. When I see this Euro-Fighter junk: they spent billions for its development, and sold full-functioning MiG29 Fulcrum and other modern military stuff to Poland and other countries for one single Euro a piece! An entire fighter jet, fueled and armed, for \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00c2\u00ac 1,-! Can you dig that? Are they nuts? I think they are. Totally. If I were in charge, I would totally change the priorities in spending tax money: the main part for the people (R&D; cost-free education, cost-free health-care, better welfare, security; state-wide tariffs for each profession: that the same job with the same responsibilities and difficulties is paid with the same salary everywhere in Germany); at most half of the remaining budget for military stuff, and nothing as present for those who already have enough. I simply can not understand how it's possible that each worker and employee has to pay taxes - which is a lot compared to the income, while huge companies which count their wins in Millions per month do not have to pay even one single cent! And worse: they even get money from the government! How sick is that? Workers financing their own job via taxes, or what? It would be just if EVERY legal entity and legal person had to pay taxes according to their income: the more income, the more taxes to pay. The more you have, the more you have to give - also taxes. But reality shows that those who have much income pay less taxes (in percentage of their income) than those who have less income. Blatant injustice. | 3833) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 4 May 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: One of my grandfathers never smoked a day in his life but worked in a factory and died of lung cancer in his 30s.

Well, actually I decided to quit drinking that day in spring '93. The day before I had 2 bottles of Johnny before I rode my bike 10 kilometers to my favorite disco club; there I had about a liter more booze plus 3 glasses of \"Hiroshima\" (which is brandy, schnapps, egg-liquor, cherry-liquor and portwine) and a 0.4l glass of beer, then I rode my bike back home, changed clothes, had breakfast, and went to work. When I realized that my employees only smelled the rest of booze which was not covered by the odor of tooth-paste and the chewing gum, and that they didn't realize that I was drunk - I decided to quit drinking. Thinking further, I thought it were a good idea to quit smoking as well, so I simply didn't smoke anymore, drank only juices and soda and herbal teas - I even realized when I took my jacket out of the wardrobe in fall 93 that there still was the same half-full pack of cigarettes in one of its pockets! Okay, my ex could admit that I was quite difficult that time, nervous and edgy, and I grew from 95 to 112 kg in only 2 months, but I got used to not smoking anymore - - until that sad day in October 2004 when I took a cigarette in an emotionally real stressful situation.

I know plenty of nonsmokers that will let you smoke while riding in their car, I don't know a single former smoker that will let you do the same... I also realized that most of the former smokers become really militant. When I quit smoking first time in 1993 I even was told that I was incredibly tolerant against people who smoked. - Well, I just didn't care. Sure, I put a \"Please don't smoke\" sign on the glove-box in my car, but I used to tell my smoking friends that I wouldn't mind if they ignored it. Otherwise, in '94, I had an annoying colleague whom I used to give a ride since both of us worked some hundred kilometers away, and out of our colleagues I was the one who lived closest to him. And he smoked a lot. I told him not to smoke in my car - and even made more stops that he could have a smoke outside. Once he didn't respect my wish. It was weekend, we were on the way home - and he had had some beer, and became rude - and lit a cigarette. Because of the temperature outside it was not really appropriate to open the windows, and I told him to wait for the next stop. He just didn't care. When he finished it and lit the next one, telling me not to be so intolerant, it was time for me to make an end. So I just drove the car to the next truck-stop, pretending I wanted to buy something to drink. When he went inside the shop before me to buy more beer, I returned to the car, started the engine again, and left the truck-stop without him. For me, it was too much to know a rude drunken guy in my car who didn't respect my order (yes, I insisted on not smoking!). And since then I used to decide spontaneously whether or not to give some colleague a ride. But since I started smoking again in fall 2004, I always used to respect the wishes of people who gave me a ride. It's their car, at last. Of course I'd ask if they won't mind - and without their allowance, I'd just wait for the next opportunity. | 3850) 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: And not even I who grew up in East-Germany and should recognize one...

And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barab'bas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, \"Whom do you want me to release for you, Barab'bas or Jesus who is called Christ?\" For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, \"Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream.\" Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barab'bas and destroy Jesus. The governor again said to them, \"Which of the two do you want me to release for you?\" And they said, \"Barab'bas.\" Pilate said to them, \"Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?\" They all said, \"Let him be crucified.\" And he said, \"Why, what evil has he done?\" But they shouted all the more, \"Let him be crucified.\" So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, \"I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.\" And all the people answered, \"His blood be on us and on our children!\" Then he released for them Barab'bas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. Apparently, 'invoking ones conscience' is a terrible crime... ;) Well, Barab'bas - though he was a criminal - was not near as dangerous to the power of the chief priests and the elders as Jesus, so they had just to persuade the crowd to yell that they wish Jesus being crucified. Crowds often are easy to direct: once you yell a slogan among a crowd, it doesn't take long and the entire crowd yells it. I think in front of Pilate it was likewise. Some elders as front-men among the crowd, starting the slogans - and the crowd was just echoing but much louder. | 3922) |[Message Post: Today is Saturday! <<<WINNING>>> [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: last win before going to evening class - a bit late as it seems...

I'm talking about a manned, conventional spacecraft, at maximum speed, and assuming (of course) that ample food and water is available. And just for the sake of fun, let's pretend that it's a one-way trip - so returning to Earth isn't an issue. From what I can gather, we're essentially still trapped on Earth! To use the ocean as an analogy, we've invented bamboo rafts, and we can wade a couple hundred meters out into the sea - but trans-oceanic travel is out of the question... To my knowledge it is requring of us to use generation ships. Even then and with our best prbes there is just no way to get out there. alas, we are all alone, for now Yes, I agree. Either generation ships, or taking the risk of hibernation or something similar But the bamboo-raft example doesn't fit exactly: there have been boats built of papyrus and even reed, which made it across the oceans. [(examples)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl) - so wading fits more ;-) But otherwise, the very idea of these distances in space is quite amazing.

Maybe they simply don't exist or (more likely) are simply a tiny minority. There have been enough examples in history showing how people caused to change the entire government, the entire politics of a country just by marching and demonstrating. By daring to risk freedom. Good luck with that. But unfortunately, the vast majority is mostly just cowardly. Everywhere. Nice generalization. More likely, they simply disagree with you. Or, they live their lives as best that can as they see fit. And they simply don't care what you think, your causes aren't important to them, and they never will be. Well, okay - my anti-capitalist arguments may seem a bit exaggerated. What I experienced was no good, well, except the theoretical freedom to travel, and the theoretical freedom of speach... What is this good for when the money to travel is lacking because you have to pay 20 times more mortgage (Well, according to the number before the currency) for your flat than before the wall came down? And the freedom of speech: I lost a job in 1994 because I participated on a demonstration, after work, and said on this demonstration, in my spare-time, what I thought about the subject (I thought it was transport of nuclear waste)! Freedom of speech? The right to share one's opinion without getting punished for it except what was said is against the law? There was more of it in other systems. As I realized, people mourn a lot and discuss: during lunch-breaks in their cafeterias and after work in the pubs, how inhuman and how unjust the system would be, how many hours they had to work though the tariffs say otherwise, and how little wages they got... Everyone is mourning, everyone is discontented, And they agree that what they are talking and mourning about should be changed. But if they stood up and said: \"Hey, We're fed up with this! We want more justice! We want that the company keeps the tariffs they agreed with!\" or: \"We don't want send our kids to war anymore!\" et cetera (just examples) they could CHANGE things!

But I know, the area of any given triangle is base*height divided by 2 (A= 1/2 * g*h). If I have a triangle A, B, C, with the two sides (\"a\" and \"b\") given instead of base (=\"c\") and height (=\"h\"), and the angle between these sides (GAMMA), then the formula for computing the area is A = 1/2*a*b*sin(GAMMA). And for example: if b is not given, but one of the other angles, say ALPHA instead, you can find out BETA (= 180\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0 - GAMMA - ALPHA), and can use the sinus formula to find out \"b\": a/sin(ALPHA) = b/sin(BETA) ----> b = a*sin(BETA)/sin(ALPHA) So, the area A will be: A = (a^2)*sin(ALPHA)*sin(GAMMA)/(2*sin(BETA)) Is this okay, or is it too low level? Unless I am reading it too quickly, your first situation, which we can call Side-Angle-Side, is correct. The \"level\" is fine, unless you want to look back at it and perhaps provide a different, more efficient or more elegant solution. (I make no claims as to whether such another solution exists.) As for the second, I think we need to consider whether the side is included between the angles (Angle-Side-Angle) or not (Angle-Angle-Side). If you think such distinctions are not needed, please explain why and I will try to read more slowly next time. :) okay, point taken, and accepted. Well, it's too long time ago that I messed around with such things, and I thought the symbols etc were the same everywhere. Oh, Just today i learned, that - in opposite to the German formulas - in the English language countries area has the symbol S ... sorry, my fault The triangle ABC I meant was: the angle [ALPHA] is on point A, between the sides b and c, the angle [BETA] on point B, between the sides c and a, and the angle [GAMMA] on point C, between the sides a and b.

His vision and courage brought a freer Russia To Yeltsin's eternal credit, he saw democracy and a capitalistic market economy as the proper replacement for communism. ... By the time Yeltsin resigned as Russia's president in 1999, living standards had fallen drastically for millions of Russians. For that, Russians and the world can thank Boris Yeltsin. sic! What is the advantage of freedom against the disadvantage of poverty? In my opinion Yeltsin was a traitor who sold his own entire country. It's no loss that he died. It's a loss to millions of Russians that he managed to become president! I think it's better to have a \"unfree\" society but the same high living standard for everyone, than freedom but poverty for the vast majority and extra-ordinary luxury for just a few. | 3950) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Really am going to sleep now, even if it takes nockin' my noggin againt the wall 'till things get woozy.

But I know, the area of any given triangle is base*height divided by 2 (A= 1/2 * g*h). If I have a triangle A, B, C, with the two sides (\"a\" and \"b\") given instead of base (=\"c\") and height (=\"h\"), and the angle between these sides (GAMMA), then the formula for computing the area is A = 1/2*a*b*sin(GAMMA). And for example: if b is not given, but one of the other angles, say ALPHA instead, you can find out BETA (= 180\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0 - GAMMA - ALPHA), and can use the sinus formula to find out \"b\": a/sin(ALPHA) = b/sin(BETA) ----> b = a*sin(BETA)/sin(ALPHA) So, the area A will be: A = (a^2)*sin(ALPHA)*sin(GAMMA)/(2*sin(BETA)) Is this okay, or is it too low level? | 3957) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Let there be light, and there was from ...

Nancy Grace? She's never met a defendant that was not guilty by mere presence of her/his on the witness stand. The number Jon Stewart did on her was quite funny. Remember that Duke case with those poor youngsters? Yep. She was ALL OVER THEM. Yet when it proven that the Prosecutor hid evidence that could have exonerated those guys, she didn't say much of anything about it. I guess \" Innocent until proven guilty \" doesn't apply to her. Does the world need more objective people or less? More honest ones or fewer? More rational persons or not so many? At least the world need a lot more people who are honest and kind and respectful. You can be as rational as an android and yet have a lack on kindness or respect, and you can be objective without seeing the person behind the facts. Wisdom is what counts. Honesty, empathy, respect, kindness and justice. I don't know if it is objective to have these attributes.

To make this fair: for those of you outside the US, you may already know Heron's Formula, which allows one to compute the area of a triangle just knowing the length of its three sides. So, nothing new there. (But can someone prove it in their own words, w/o looking it up somewhere? Can you provide multiple proofs? Can you use the result to help compute the area when given other information?) If I only know one side of the triangle, I need to know at least two of the angles, then I can compute the other sides, and the area of this triangle.

You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off.\"This guy stopped his killing, went to the post office and sent a package to NBC, then he returned to V.T. and continued killing! How weird is that? IMHO this was an attempt to blame the society, like: \"it's your fault that you were killed by me because you were in my way\" I think he should have brought to a shrink long time before that. Edit: Just reading that he actually HAD undergone a psychiatric evaluation. On Dec. 13, 2005, a magistrate ordered Cho to undergo an evaluation at Carilion St. Albans, a private psychiatric hospital.

I learned it by my observations, by reading the posts and the reactions in that board. It can hit every-one to fall over the edge. The surface may be normal, but beyond - even beyond your own awareness - you may be depressed, unsure, frightened; and seemingly out of a sudden all the fear, depression, unsureness comes out and you go over the edge - the one way or the other. (\"you\" meant in general, not personally) While having been moderator in a certain forum myself, I learned something about people and their feelings and minds: No-one is as stable as he or she seems to be. Not even as stable as he/she is hoping to be by him/her-self. Why, because you sez so? No. The same way you could say disease is part of being human. But: in opposite to physical diseases, mental disorders are not diseases you can be born with. No person is born unsure, depressed, tormented. The psyche is a very fragile thing, and when it's not strengthened but weakened instead by psychic tormenting, the psyche becomes sick: mental disorder But: One thing I also learned: No mental disorder comes out of a blue moon. Be it violence to the own body, be it violence to others, be it arrogance or bullying - everything has its cause. When persons have been intimidated enough (by their parents, their class mates, or other people) they become violent - either to themselves or to others, depending on who they learned to hate more: their own self, or the others. You noted it yourself: mental disorder. Which, coming full circle, is part of being human. The fact that this kid was nuts does not mean you can blame some collective for his actions. The blame belongs squarely on his shoulders, and no one else's.Sure the kid was responsible for his own deeds. At least legally. I don't doubt that. And he reached (at least when pulling the trigger) the point beyond mental sanity, that's clear. At least each single tine movement of pulling the trigger made him guilty. My intention was not to blame others instead of him. But I just wanted to say that he was not so just on a whim, there was a cause, a hate. A hate huge enough to kill. And this cause, the cause for this hate, didn't have to be aware to this guy himself. Well, not necessarily. But: I think, to a certain part, you CAN blame the society. I'd like to advice to gather some infos about [killology](http://www.killology.com/article_trainedtokill.htm), or read through the books \"On Killing\", and/or \"Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill\" by Ltd.

But the way you seem to defend the exploiters cause the impression to me, that you could be a kind of exploiter yourself, and might feel offended by my rather left-wing elaborates. This subject makes it quite difficult to me to discuss without becoming offending, especially you seem to be rather conservative. That's why I quit this discussion here and now, though I'm convinced that exploitation is the same like stealing from the poor, and likewise criminal. But I realize that this conviction is not in everyone, and that there are people who believe that taking much money for letting other people do the work were righteous. Those people are just pitiful in my eyes. IMHO people who need to exploit others to heighten themselves have no honor, no righteousness, no spine, only selfishness, greed and avarice instead.

There are some good and even wonderful independent music labels which you'll never find in the super markets and music stores, simply because they are ignored there. Mostly independent labels work for covering their own costs, so the artist has to pay for studio time, and that's where the big parasites dig in. \"Here,\" they say, \"here is a free studio, just for you. Just sign this contract and don't mind the fine print,\" They say. and they bait the artist: \"We are big, we are successful. Would you think we were big and successful if we tried to exploit those who are our partners? Once you signed we are partners.\" But that the artist, once signed, has to lay down his/her entire personality into the hands of them; that those who call themselves his/her partner are giving him/her just alms related to their own win,that's a thing only the minority is realizing. I think they are just too blended by the soap bubble of fast popularity. In my opinion, music business is the modern Mephisto. Odd that. They couldn't make a dime on their own, which you note. Obviously, they had the talent to make plenty of dimes on their own... So why weren't they making those dimes? What were they waiting for?

It seems you have a problem with the word and meaning of exploitation? Does the capitalistic system not work only by exploitation of the workers?

So the entire staff took it over, opened it up again, and since this day this factory is not only running the factory without a \"Manager\" and instead of booting out workers, they still hiring!

I even worked as a salesman, well, a short time. But I realized that I'm not a good salesman at all. To be able to sell something, I have to be 100% convinced that it's at least worth the price the customers have to pay for it. When I applied for such a job, some hours (or the day) before the job interview, I looked into the shop and looked what products I had to sell. When I felt that the products I had to sell were not worth the price the company wanted for them, or when I was not enough convinced of their qualities, I refused to sell them and searched another job offer. The last time when I worked as a salesperson, I even told one costumer to buy a product in a cheaper shop, because I knew it was exactly the same like what I sold, only with another brand label on it. Right after that, I quit the sale job and never ever applied as a salesman again. To me, brands are an illusion made by advertising, simply to make bigger money out of big money. Day-light robbery.

When someone invented something, his/her invention belonged to all. And in my feelings this is the only right way. No patented everything. When it can be of use to the world, the world should be allowed to use it without having to pay a fortune for licenses. What you feel is wrong. Most notably because others are free to feel differently from you. And they feel it makes sense to set up record companies, and publishing companies. And inventors and creators feel that they like charging for licenses.

In my opinion only the authors/ inventors/ musicians etc, and nobody else, should be able to decide how and where their novels/ inventions/ music are published; and if there must be profit involved, only the authors/ inventors/ musicians etc. should have the profit of their work, and the edition companies should have a little win from producing/publishing it.

It's not Barnes&Noble for example who write the novels, it's the authors. For me, such kind of \"agencies\" are simply parasites, becoming rich on other persons efforts. Exploitation, that's what it is. Sheesh. This isn't even worth replying to. Why? I read about contracts stating that a certain artist gets 15%, and the company 85% of the turnover. Why? They just organize some tours,and give the artist the possibility to record music or to express other art. But the idea, the creativity, most of the work is at the artist. Without the artists' creativity, the company would be nothing, but without this company, the artists still would be artists. That's why I say that it would be just fair if the artist get the bigger part of the turnover. Well, I think that's just a question of ideology. I rather believe that the interests of the public are worth more than the interests of making money, others don't believe that. That's okay.

Even when a band (or several bands) are on a concert, there's not only the paying audience able to listen to it, passers-by also. So why not saying: every music should be public property, like a kind of GPL: That no company should be allowed to make their profit of music. Okay, maybe of the concerts, but I think, music should be managed and given away only by non-profit organisations, the albums and concert tickets sold to a price just covering their costs. If I were ruling, I would decide so. Your tune would change, I think, if you had a piece of intellectual property, say a novel or a patent on a new invention.

The first part lists chemicals known to cause cancer, called carcinogens: Dimethylnitrosamine Ethylmethylnitrosamine Nitrosopyrrolidine Hydrazine Vinyl Chloride Urethane Hydrogen Cyanide, Acrolein, Acetadehyde, Nitrogen 3-Cyanopyridine. This is only a partial list. They put these chemicals in cigarettes to reduce tar while maintaining the level of nicotine necessary to keep them addictive. Keeping the tar down helps to calm people's fears about health risks. Since the companies are free of any supervision they are not compelled to reveal the chemicals they use.

Fed up with falling sales, the industry - which claims Australians download more than one billion songs illegally each year - has been discussing tough new guidelines with internet service providers (ISPs) since late last year. Record labels, music publishers and other copyright holders are involved. The value of CDs sold in Australia between January and March this year fell by more than 20 per cent - from $100 million to $80 million - compared with the first three months of 2006. This is despite big-selling albums from Australian Idol winner Damien Leith, Justin Timberlake, The Killers and Snow Patrol. The remarkable plunge mirrors the US experience. Last week, however, recording industry body ARIA put out a press release attempting to put a positive spin on the state of the industry. Overall, CD sales revenue in 2006 fell by more than five per cent, yet ARIA focused on the growth in legitimate digital downloads, and the strong showing last year by home-grown acts. The industry is now targeting those who repeatedly download music without paying. Sabiene Heindl, general manager of the music industry's piracy unit MIPI, said record labels could trace people who illegally downloaded music via so-called peer-to-peer websites such as LimeWire. They could also identify which songs were being illegally swapped. \"We can tell the ISPs the time and date people were engaging in this conduct, and what song was being downloaded,\" she said. \"We had a meeting a few weeks ago with the Internet Industry Association (about the new guidelines) but we're yet to hear back. \"We've put forward our proposal and we're hopeful they will come back with something positive.\" The music industry is lobbying for a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy to enforce their copyright. \"Under this system, people who illegally download songs would be given three written warnings by their Internet service provider. If they continued to illegally download songs, their internet account would be suspended or terminated. Those with dial-up internet could face having their phone disconnected. Ms Heindl said research showed 18 per cent of Australians engaged regularly in file-sharing, downloading an average 30 songs a month illegally. As I said: Big money is making the politics! Meanwhile I either download music from the sites of the bands I'm interested in (some do share their entire albums as mp3 or ogg), or from free mp3 download sites - or I make it as in the old times: copying from the radio. When I do have a CD friends of mine don't have, or friends have albums I don't have, we share the music tracks after having them converted to mp3, even via the private messenger or via e-mail. Why not? So on Saturday I got an entire DVD full of mp3 music. I think there should be no such thing like property on music! Even when a band (or several bands) are on a concert, there's not only the paying audience able to listen to it, passers-by also. So why not saying: every music should be public property, like a kind of GPL: That no company should be allowed to make their profit of music. Okay, maybe of the concerts, but I think, music should be managed and given away only by non-profit organisations, the albums and concert tickets sold to a price just covering their costs. If I were ruling, I would decide so. | 4196) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : hey,afternoon folks! Hey hey, Evilest of all Al's :) Hehehe ty :-) How ya doin bud?

Some scientists applaud the result \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac which had been predicted theoretically but not observed in previous studies, while others say the apparent water signal may simply be instrumental noise. The planet, called HD 209458b, is about 70% as massive as Jupiter and is scorched by the heat of its parent star, which it orbits 9 times as close as Mercury does to the Sun. Fascinating stuff. But if it is that close to its sun, wouldn't any water boil off? not necessarily. gravity is like pressure: the more pressure you put on, the more temperature you need to get water boiling. and with about 70% as massive as Jupiter the gravity of this planet could be around 7 to 10 times the earth gravity, meaning a boiling temperature of a couple hundred degrees celsius. could be interesting for the physicists there ;D | 4307) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : 2007 by [thorin Post: Life is endangering!

When you mean that I grew up in East Germany, yes. Why do you ask? During the very early '70's I was living and working in West Berlin when it was \"the Wall\" and the cold war. I used to go over to East Berlin on Sunday afternoons for beer and lunch because it was so much cheaper. I remember seeing a young redheaded East German soldier of about 19 in his dress uniform with his parents somewhere near Alexander Platz. They were so proud of him, fussing around him, and he was basking in his parents love and admiration. My first thought was that this was the enemy, but immediately I also realized that here was another human being just like me. I offered to hold their Leica camera, and take a picture of them, which they gladly accepted. They thanked me, knowing I was an \"auslander\" from my accent...I handed their camera back to them and went on my way. It's funny how memories like this pop up... I also have my funny, but also some sad memories to the time when I lived in the country called GDR... I even had been so blended that when I was drawn I insisted to serve at the border to West Germany, and was disappointed when they told me that I couldn't because of a certain uncle living near Frankfurt... So I served as an airplane mechanic near the Polish border, and it was more fun and less stress for me :D But, on the other side: I always disappointed \"THE PARTY\", because I refused to join them, saying: I will never join a party where the majority of the members are just nominal. | 4349) |[Message belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Cool!

Sure, they were the editors of the nowadays collection of books known as the Bible - but: all these books were common among the early Christians And who do you think those early Christians were? That's what makes the Roman Catholic church Apostolic... Christianity as we know it today is a product of the 60's or so... Quite contrary to what the Evangelists would have you believe... And before you make an argument, I would suggest doing some research on how many other Christian churches in America and around the globe consider the Pope to be the Apostolic leader of the entire Christian community... Exclude Mormons, they have their own Pope (Prophet), Apostles, and Holy book... ;) The early Christians were the direct followers of Christ respectively His apostles. There was no pope, no monk nor nun then; just Jesus (as a prophet ), His Apostles, evangelists, preachers, - and their followers. Only some small Christian churches now have a similar organisations. And the only theologists of the old times were the Pharisees and Sadducees, those guys Jesus had warned about. I think when the Church was established to the way it is now, it was done by people like them, and long after the Apostles have died. I respect the Pope to be the spiritual leader of the vast majority of Christians, like I respect the Dalai Lama etc. But I have a problem with seeing him as a \"Holy Father\" (because this is the Title of God), as \"God's representative on Earth\", as \"infallible\". This is idolatry in my eyes. May be I'm mislead, but this is my opinion. Since I've read the Bible, I also have a problem with celibacy, professional priestdom, and (which is usual in Germany) church-taxes! The State is drawing a church tax of 9% of the income tax from those who are Protestant or Catholic and gives this amount plus the same amount bonus to these churches... The Bible says: \"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse\" As one Protestant priest said to me when I asked him why they do not draw the tithing, \"Then our churches would be even emptier than they already are. These 9% of the Income tax already are seen as too much for some people, and are a reason to quit their membership.\" And mentioning the Mormons: their Prophet is not even similar to the Pope. No \"Your Holiness\", or \"Holy Father\" - just \"Brother X\", or president X - anything like that. President, because his position is to be the president of the church. And, unlike the Pope, his position as a seer, prophet and revealer must be acknowledged by the gathered members, just like each other position in the Church also: be it bishop, Sunday school teacher, Apostle, evangelist, just name it. As I understood that: if not the vast majority of the members acknowledge a person to become their bishop/ evangelist/ apostle/ prophet... that position remains vacant, until there is a reason why this peculiar person should not be acknowledged to this position. And they have the Bible as well, so to speak as \"Book 1\" of The Scriptures. | [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: well, you forgot one word at the end of your sentence: \"trying\" 909 and...

The Bible belongs to the Catholic church, not the people... Just be thankful that they decided to share... ;) It may give the impression... but. no, the Bible does not belong to the Catholic Church and has never belonged to them. Sure, they were the editors of the nowadays collection of books known as the Bible - but: all these books were common among the early Christians before the Catholic Church was so mighty that they needed a Vatican Council. The entire Old Testament originally even belonged to the Jews and still does. The early mighty Church just kept the Bible after having censored it inside their churches, in the hands of the priests, just to keep their \"sheep\" uninformed - haven't even the kids just 200years ago learnt their ABC from the Bible? People who are alliterate can be dangerous to the mighty, because they are more used to thinking... and thinking causes doubts, doubts cause trouble - and trouble in the flock of obedient sheep? no, that's not what the early Popes wanted.

It is called the King James Version for a reason, he was the King at the last editing! Oh my God, did I just say the Bile had been EDITED! You betcha!!! There a lot of Books that are no longer included in the Bible because of various beliefs. The Book of Mary is not in there! The Gospel of Thomas. There are almost 100 Books that have been edited out of the current version of the Bible. SOME were VERY popular in their day but later \"scholars\" decided that they spoke of things and deeds that should not be further discussed. Like the Giants! There is a list here of some of the missing Books [http://www.godlikeproductions.com/bbs/message.php?messageid=360829](http://www.godlikeproductions.com/bbs/message.php?messageid=360829) Although this one has more of a list [http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/](http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/) How about the Book that told about Jesus as a kid. Like when he shoved a friend off the roof and killed him? And then brought him back to life! How about the bird he dislike so much he squeezed it until it dies, and then when his friends yelled at him, he brought it back to life? Did you know these even exist? I thought not. The CHURCH decides HOW an WHAT you see and hear as a Christian! YOU do not get to even see the WHOLE Bible, why not? Because they are afraid you will NOT believe, that is why! They want your Earthly possessions to build bigger and better Church's!!!! And yet God says you do not need to even go to Church, \"He is everywhere and in everything\"! The internet is your friend, use it and find out about the hypocrits telling you how and what to believe!

IMHO Just a kind of calculation to show these Pharisees their own cowardness.

I also signed this petiton last night. Grown up in East Germany, I have a total reluctance against such STASI methods. I don't know what you mean by \"allowing to file up\" but here in the US ALL cell phone towers have harddrives in them that keeps the last 6 months of EVERY conversation that went thru that tower! It even shows what tower the call came from and what tower it was passed onto, if it was an ongoing call thru several towers. I have seen this used where they caught a guy that torched his car for insurance purposes. It took a Court Order for the cell phone company to release the records though. Well even though you stated that you didn't know what I meant you just hit the point. They want to make files of each call, like Chris already stated that it's happening in the UK already. Well, I'm totally against such behavior. IF calls and messages and e-mails are monitored and kept on harddrives, then they should be AFTER a special permit(?) by a judge, based on an urgent suspect that the person to be monitored is a criminal, and not just for the case that any of the monitored persons could do something out of the law. As far as I understand this, it'S the building of a world ruled by Secret Services, as if they had studied the results and effectiveness of old East Germany's STASI (who even bribed and black-mailed people to become their informers) and wanted this for their own. | 4461) male from Germany . . .](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/view_profile.php?userid=8489449) Copyrighted by zwerg8_thorin 2007 You came up with it, SIR Nobody :D, thanks.

ON THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN\" Paragraph 2. On the Third Day He Rose from the Dead [...] well - this shows me that you either are able to copy&paste huge texts, or are bored enough to type them in. (sorry for this irony) I believe you that you do believe, Jeffrey, but... I think the official Catechism you're just posting in here is about what your church teaches, not about what YOU believe. I had expected more own words and less quotes. I could also have posted the entire Holy scripture here (and sometimes I got the impression I have done it during all the years I'm posting in forums); but mostly I try to write down what I believe. It's my own conviction and testimony what I write here, or my understanding of what I was taught when I was church. I think every-one should gain their own knowledge of whether or not a belief is true for them. In my opinion, it makes discussions a lot easier, when I (for example) might say: \"As far as I'm concerned, [insert faith here] is the truth, but that's just my view on things.\" That implements that this is just my opinion and not a general dogma which everyone better has to believe in. I think, faith (or belief) is such a personal way of thinking, the Churches or Scriptures are just the skeleton everyone are building their own faiths around. Some think that this skeleton is a stiff one, and that they have to stay put on the texts; some think there is much more flexibility given, as long as the spirit of the Scriptures still remains. I think when you're watching closely, there are as many ways to believe and live any faith as there are people who have this faith. Not even two Catholic believers do understand and live the Catholic faith the exactly identical way. IMHO they would be like robots if they did, because faith is as living as the hearts and souls of the believers. | 4465) |[Message Post: Hi Folks!

One is politics and the other is religion. I will make a minor comment then leave it there. I can not prove there isn't a god, and no-one can prove that there is. Its up to each individual to decide for themselves whether or not they choose to believe, and indeed, what religion they wish to believe in. I strongly disagree with your opinion that those who are not religious, can be hostile to those that are. In my experience it's exactly the opposite. I am simply a person who doesn't NEED religion to have a fulfilling life, but apparently others do. Thats their choice and I wish them well. As long as you (and the other non-believers) don't wish to convert others to your non-belief, and as long as believers do not wish to convert others to their belief, everything should be okay, shouldn't it? By the way: in my opinion, convincing and converting are things everybody has to do for themselves. You can take the informations and arguments brought to you, and if you choose to take them, and think about them - and find out for yourself that they are true, then you convince yourself of them. Nobody can do that for you, so there's no reason for the fear many atheists seem to have: to be converted by religious people. As it is written in the Bible (Luke 22:32): \"But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" - Jesus said this to one of the apostels, Peter, who already had strong faith: so after his denial Peter had to convert himself again that he was able to help to improve the faith of his co-apostles. | 4475) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: just sneaking in after another passed test a WiNnInG!!! | 4476) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: my turn I'm on my way out the door.

Thought consequently, each Christian's answer on \"Do you swear...?\" can't be otherwise than \"No, I don't swear!\" In the end, there should be no need for even the thought about swearing if every Christian would live their faith consequently enough.

Isn't turning tap water into Holy Water magic ? Walking on water ? ...or bread and wine into flesh and blood. I'll need to check that one out with our resident Voodoo queen. Transubstantiation, changing the substance of the bread and wine (or water, depending on your denomination) into the body and blood of Christ is speaking of a deeply symbolic change, not a magical transformation. Look up transubstantiation in Wikipedia for a very good discussion on the subject. In the Roman Catholic tradition, Holy Water is water which has been blessed (infused with holiness) and set apart for baptism. The small vessels (stoups) in the front of the Roman Catholic and other churches are there for worshipers to use as a reminder of the covenants they made with God when they were baptised. You can't distinguish Holy Water from any other water and, once again, the act is highly symbolic of the intent for which the water is to be used. Sorry, no magic there either. And the walking on water thing? If you read the scripture closely you will find that this was an act of faith. Because Christ believed that he could walk on the water with absolute conviction, he was able to do so. I believe that anyone could do this if they could only have that perfect conviction. Not that I have that kind of faith, would that it were so. But it was the old \"mind over matter\" bromide made real. No spells, no special apparatus, no chanting, no magic. Well - since having faith seems to be enough for a human to heal a sick body, to even let viral diseases vanish in (literally) no time, why should a person with the powers and faith of Christ not be able to make walking on water work? Even Peter could do that, until - until he thought that it couldn't be possible to be standing and walking on the waves. Then, he sank in like all others do. I think if we were more conscious of the abilities and nonabilities of our own bodies (even down to atomar level) we could make thinks possible which ARE really magic nowadays. Each technology/ technique if only ununderstandable IS magic - as long as it is ununderstandble Arthur C. Clarke formulated the following three \"laws\" of prediction: 1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong. 2. The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible. 3. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. | 4527) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Posted 22 Feb 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: just sneaking in between bathroom and bed after a stressy day, and wondering: We're in the 21st thread already?

Odd then, that I replied in-line... Maybe coherent would be better than simpler... any Company that stays in the US will have exclusive access to all U.S.G. contracts. Big deal, they leave now, in lieu of them. U.S.G contracts are not the be-all, end-all of business. Also any Company that stays, or comes, will pay a lower corporate tax rate than they currently pay. NO MORE 36% tax rate, or 39% rate either!!!! ALL monies earned by a Company will be subject to taxes, even monies earned out of the Country. BUT as stated earlier, AT A LOWER THAN 35% RATE! I have no problem with that, but you ain't running the gov't. And even if you were, you likely couldn't get a massive corporate tax rate cut past Congress. Oh my - not this darned subject again... Okay: A simple example from East Germany, a couple of years ago: A world-wide well-known car producing company stated that they wanted to build a facility in East Germany, offering - let's say: 1000 jobs. And they spread out that they were looking for a well-prepared and good-to-reach place to build on. Three towns prepared new grounds as industrial places (paid by the tax-payers) and offered aid-money to them for each employed former jobless person (up to the same costs the company would have paid per employee). So the only cost this company would have been the material for building the facility. But: There was a Czech town heard that also. They also prepared a place paid by tax-payers, and offered them a similar amount of aid-money as these German towns - and they got it, because the wages are cheaper there. So all in all, this rich company gets paid by this Czech town to employ their people! And where do they pay their taxes? As I read last year, this well-known, famous \"German\" company had been able to manipulate the countable income down to just 10 millions - means 3 millions on taxes for Germany: less than they had to pay for their new facility in this Czech town - and even less than the difference between the costs for this factory over there in the Czech Republic and East Germany. I think, an US company should produce only in the US, a German company only in Germany, a Japanese company only in Japan etc, and they should not be able to simply buy other companies of other countries. I have nothing against producing by product licences, or by kind of franchise, but then the producers remain quite independent. Between 1990 and the fusion with Chrysler, Daimler-Benz for example haven't paid any taxes to Germany. They always managed to let it look like having no taxable income. But they couldn't managed to be not involved in the Party Donation scandal in the late 90's. | 4545) |[Message belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: IMHO there is always some better beverage than beer to get a fine intoxication :-D When I was young, there was a pretty strong mixture called Hiroshima: the absolute record until coma was 9 1/2 glasses (0.25 litres each) of it *hehe* Captain Morgan's Rum...

Here you go again Jeffery, trying to confuse the issue. I orginally was talking about the Roman Catholic Church and not \"a Christian church.\" My link was directly to the official Vatican website and not some whois generic blah blah. I just can't wait for the Bible quotions which are sure to come. Hmm... please correct me if I'm wrong... but don't you need to be baptized by someone who has the power to do so, to become a follower of Christ? And is not being baptized the way to become a member of any Christian church? So there is a real dilemma for those who want to follow Christ but not join any church. Even the old apostels in the New Testament baptized people, and also a church was organised these times (well, the buildings to meet in came a long time later). So I think, if there is a Christian church in organisation and structure, and belief as similar to the original, Biblical church of Jesus as possible, it is worth a thought at least :) But it really is like in this critique of Samuel the Lamanite in Helaman 13:26-27 (as posted by Jeffrey): Those, who do say the truth and call evil evil and bad bad, are muzzled or told to shut up, or thrown out (or at least kindly asked to visit the next head-shrinker), and those who say: \"all is well, and there is nothing bad in your deeds and even if you do evil, its because you are sick and need healing\" - these guys are welcomed and honored and have become the nowadays' prophets even though they are mostly non-religious. | 4547) belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: IMHO there is always some better beverage than beer to get a fine intoxication :-D When I was young, there was a pretty strong mixture called Hiroshima: the absolute record until coma was 9 1/2 glasses (0.25 litres each) of it *hehe* | 4548) 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: If you say you are Catholic, and don't need a/the Church...to them you are damned.

Before I decided which religion I would join in, I read everything, from Bagavatgita to Q'ran, Bible, Buddhist, Hinduistic, Asian, and other sacred, holy and unholy, and philosophic texts as well as several secondary literature to each of these texts. This, and my previous ideology (which showed up to be false) made myself wonder where I could really find the truth. Finally, I found it in the Bible, after I read it again, presuming there could be something about that Jesus... And, even before there was a missionary to ask me to try out verse 5 of the first chapter of the Epistle of St. James, I did it for myself. Strangely, days after my very first prayer, I found the Bible to be true - and later, when I read the book of Mormon, I tried the same: I prayed and got the feeling that for me this book also is true. May be it's not true for you, I don't know it. And may be you found another way to believe in God (if you believe). But what I do know is that for me, for my very person, this belief, the LDS church, is the only true one, that - as far as I'm concerned - I found the truth.

Why? Because it gives my family and I a far better life than otherwise would be the case. I have a relationship with God that that I believe gives me tangible benefits. Among those benefits are the health benefits related to prayer I have mentioned previously and a much increased ability to retain equanimity under adverse conditions. I associate with people who are committed to the welfare of my family and vice versa. Indeed, the family is considered sacred in the LDS community. Should I lose my job or become disabled, I am assured that my family will never lack for the necessities. My daughter has a far better chance of living within a traditional family than otherwise. The divorce rate among those who have married with the LSD church is between 6% and 13%, depending on your source, but in any case far lower than that of the general population. This holds true for converts or those born into the LDS church. I could go on, but that is a good start. I used to work in an LDS Church Family History Library, been a while now, and found EVERYONE to be very nice people! As I said I am not a Religious person, so when the Center decided to go with only LDS people as Librarians I was removed. Never any ill will or feelings towards me that were bad in any way. No ill feelings on my part either, just sorry I lost the key and the ability to do more research. The Library is open fewer hours now, but Security is tightened ALOT!. That's sad. But can't you research further being a customer of the Center? In the church at my old home, there were much more non-LDS members than LDS members researching in the Family History Center - AFAIK twice as many as members have been there at all. Between genealogists here, the PAF - software of the LDS Church is told to be the most-used one, and the other churches are mostly kind when helping out with data. I must say, that I experienced a kind-of-openness in this church, like: I appreciate your believe though I know that your's is the wrong one - but you have the same right to believe yours as I do have the right to belief mine. So they also help others without preaching, and just this help makes people nosy enough to ask who they are and what they believe in. Sure, like some others, the LDS church is doing missions also. But that doesn't mean they want to convince people. Okay, if some-one convince themselves because of the informations and talks to join the church later, it is a nice side effect; but mainly they just go out to spread the gospel, to inform the people: here are we, our faith is this, please listen to what we believe to be God's plan. I myself went with the missionaries more than a dozen years ago (just 7 or 8 months after my own baptism); I lived with them, went door to door with them, talked to people on the streets with them, taught, prayed, sang with them - for about two (very short) months during a short-time mission. And for each flat we were invited in to have wonderful talks, about hundred refused before to even let us introduce who we were. Pity for them, but they had the same right to not invite us - the Lord gave us the right of free decision. For me, this time was an experience I never want to miss. The most wonderful thing was, three months later, one of the persons I had taught about the gospel during this short-time mission wished to be baptized by me. That was so marvellous in the moment of baptizing this man, I really felt to be a tool in the hand of God. Pure energy ran through me, non-describable. Unfortunately, my life ran in a way which made me inactive from time to time (like kind of a sinus curve), so I never have been in a temple except when it was open to everybody...

Both is (generally) based on axioms on which a draft on truth is made. (quote)Conceptions (?) are ideological if they are comprehended as absolute truth or panacea (end quote) So, are religions rather ideological, or are ideologies rather religion-like? I got this impression (religion-likeness of ideologies) when I read in Wikipedia [the German one]: (quote) They mostly claim a draft on the truth of their basic presumptions; several theses, dogmas or basic ideas are taken as axiomatic. A change of these presumtions mostly is rejected. In ideologies, basic ideas are taken for granted, which are used to explain main ideas and other ideas. Since the appersception of the world requires basic ideas, each statement about reality would be distict ideological. Critique of ideologies is therefore the questioning of these basic ideas and basic categories, in which we are thinking.(end quote) [end of translation] Hi Red!

For the most part, your posts are no different than those on Grassfire or Moveon. Left or right doesn't matter, any thinking person dismisses ideologues. Your posts suggest that you are incapable of posting anything beyond partisan screeds. The problem with rightwing ideologists like you seem to be is their refusement to admit their being ideological and denounce every dissent from their pov as ideology. I asked several times why the agents should go unpunished for their deeds. All answers were evasive, had nothimng to do with their deeds and only with other circumstances. They don't fit in the ideolocical scheme. Border police on duty on this border can't anything wrong, any accusation is blasphemious, it's either with us or against us. The drug dealer is definitely no good person, and probably belongs in jail as well, I don't really understand why such a far reaching deal with him was made. But that's a completely different question from misconduct on duty, the crimes of the rough agents. But I also think the border patrols (and often the police, too) tend to over-react sometimes (especially in situations which can be seen as racist violence later) and should be punished in such cases. The law is valid for every-one, especially for those who are working to enforce it. (And regarding my spelink erorrs: Write the next post in perfect german, and it's OK to critizise.

And to subject of prayer: For those who are prayed for and believe in them, prayers work the same way as if the doc of your trust gave you some sugar pills telling you they are the fitting medicine. You trust your doc enough to believe that these pills do work, that's why they will work as if they were real medicine. Or like these homeopathic solutions like one drop of medicine solved in a bathtub full of water: nonetheless they work, because the patients believe that these solutions do work. It's all the same. You believe that prayer helps for you to get healthy again, and - with enough faith - you will get healthy again. Like that woman in the gospel (St. Matthew, chapter 9, verses 20-22) who suffered on some blood disease, and said to herself: If I only touch the clothes of Jesus, \"I shall be whole\". And like so often, it was not just Jesus alone, but the faith of the sick in Him which healed them: \"thy faith hath made thee whole\". And the disease left her like expected by her. But - on the other way around: If you have just little faith (or none at all) and you are sick, and hear that somebody prays for you, you may fear and believe that your disease is worse than thought, and your body will react as if your disease were worse, so your fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. It's all in the mind. If it makes you optimistic you become better, if it makes you pessimistic you become worse. Sorry that I can't explain it better - English still is a foreign language for me. :-D | 4632) |[Message belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning with no need of humbug | [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Oh, I had to have a last look in here :-) @Richard: I am studying after work, for my \"Abitur\" (a kind of graduation diploma), Monday through Friday from 4pm to 10pm, and for the next 3 or so years I will continue doing that.

Meinhof was the last real RAF member), but their slogans, signs and style of writing was still used for political murders. Otherwise, up to the 90's you could be shadowed and even arrested just for \"contact to suspected terrorists\" in Germany. For interested who can read German, I'd like to suggest the book [\"Das RAF-Phantom\"](http://www.amazon.de/RAF-Phantom-Politik-Wirtschaft-Terroristen-brauchen/dp/3426800101/sr=8-1/qid=1171324705/ref=pd_ka_1/303-2571725-4734607?ie=UTF8&s=books) which shows up that not only the so-called Bekennerbriefe (confessing letters [?]) were fake copies, and not only the murders couldn't have been done by such folks without any military (or even para-military) experience like those who had been arrested since the end of the \"first generation of RAF\" (especially when you know that all of \"their\" victims were surrounded by security guards 24/7), but in the book they also wonder about the real reason: why the heck should an organisation, claiming themselves to be left-wing, kill people who wanted to improve the social welfare, or who had plans against the increasing growing rate of unemployment? Who really HAD an advantage from the death of such people? And who really HAD the weapons, the interest, and the influence to make the security guards vanish for just the right moment? Of course, the RAF was a welcome scapegoat. They killed in the 60's/70's, they could be revived as guilty folks for each other killing, and there can be found enough suspects when you only look for them sharp enough. I actually don't know how many of the \"RAF terrorists\" who have been arrested since were real ones, and how many were just scapegoats, but what I definitely know is that there has been no real \"Rote Armee Fraktion\" anymore [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Just lurking in to congratulate nobody for the win, and to wish everyone a good night :-D Btw: I'm winning (though it might be just for a moment :-D ) | 4636) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: coming in to clean your dirty thoughts up. no dirty thoughts allowed while I'm on top :-)) | 4637) |[Message Post: And so do I? 491 Golly is the internet slow over the last few days since the release of Vista and the downloads connected with it!

You missed his point. He was explaining his path and the \"you\" he used was in the hypothetical case, not you personally. Asking questions shows that you are a thinking being. Along with the questions about religion, study sacred texts from as many different religions as you can find. Also, look into the Rationalist philosophies and into diffrerent systems or morality. Meditate or pray about the questions you have as an aid to your studies (I would suggest that you start with meditaton in the sense of meaning concentrated contemplation rather than repeating a mantra).

Sorry, I said \"maybe\" - I can't know which religion/philosophy you do believe unless you reveal it (may be you even did it during the time I wasn't here, I haven't read the entire thread). I just meant it as an example. Okay, it could be read the way you are accusing, and I'm sorry for that. If you wish, blame my lack of English vocabulary for that. I really apologize that I wrote so misunderstandable... But if you think about it, how many wars have atheists started ? Well... seeing the 19th and 20th century, most wars have been started by atheist governments, or at least without claiming religious \"reasons\", and counting them together (okay those wars I could find in historic books) it's said that there were more wars and civil wars in the last two centuries between 1800 and 2000 than in the centuries between the Medieval Ages and 1800!! And (according to the books and sites I've seen by now) between 30 and 40% of the wars and civil wars in the last 2 centuries were claimed to be \"religious wars\"... Mostly it had either political, economic or racist/xenophobic reasons. Look at the World Wars I and II: Christians shot Christians, only because they were wearing other uniforms... Or look at Korea, Vietnam, and so on... - these wars never had religious \"reasons\". IMHO no war has religious reasons. Religious differences are just misused to make people enemys who were normal neighbors before the fights have started... Like in former Yugoslavia: Bosnians and Serbians had been neighbors, until politics demanded that they had to be enemies, and then - because most of the one nationality were Catholic, and most of the other ones were Muslims, the media made a religious conflict out of a political one... Is the only true path to world peace atheism ? I can't say objectively which religion/philosophy can be told to be the ideal one for the entire world.

Correction of behaviour is a rather \"new\" invention, that's why people mostly aren't brought to jail anymore just to sit there in the cells with nothing to do than think about what they had done and repent; instead they are brought to reformatories and \"houses of correction\" and boot camps where they can have TV in their cells and sports and work and even education, to become well-trained, \"normal\", adapted persons. [A burning question about sin...](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6252463.stm) There is no question that the preacher in question is not sane. To my view the only cogent question is if he should suffer the death penalty or be imprisoned for the rest of his life. It will come as no surprise to many that I prefer the death penalty in this situation. If sanity is the range of ordinary human behavior, I don't think anybody ever kills anybody while sane. Even in cases of self defense or in wartime, people have to be worked up to an unnatural state (i.e. momentarily not sane) to kill. When they do it without cause as this preacher did, thinking he was Jesus, it can only be because his brain or its content is defective. If a school bus had defective brakes and killed some kids, would it be declared sane enough to stand trial and hauled into court? I don't see the difference between defective brakes and a defective brain. Certainly murderers have to be taken off the streets, but executing them is simply pointless vengeance. Don't most religions have proscriptions against vengeance? People are punished to correct their behavior. Murder isn't just ultra-naughty behavior, it's always insanity -- even when murderers are put to death. Execution is beyond punishment. In my opinion, the society has to be saved against those criminals in the first line. Then they can look whether or not the bad guy is able to be \"corrected\". If not - why should they spend thousands of dollars per year to keep a killer or rapist alive for the rest of his life just to risk that he (once getting out after 20 or 25 years because of an amnesty or because of \"good behaviour\") kills or rapes again, like it has happened here in Germany several times? Once the guy is guilty of rape or murder first grade, and is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, I have nothing against the final punishment, the execution. | 4688) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [.

Dec 2012 is not ending that calendar, but is just a remarkable date like our Y2K. (sorry this site is written in German) Actually the Mayans had time units allowing them to count until the year 25,600,000,000 from the beginning of their calendar: 1 day = 1 Kin 20 Kin = 1Uinal (like a month). 18 Uinal (plus 5 \"unhappy\" days) = 1 Tun (1 year). then, there was in steps of 20: Katun (20 Tun= 20 years); Baktun (20 Katun=400years) 12 Baktun 19 Katun 13 Tun 17 Uinal 6 Kin, according to the Mayan calendar); * 20 Baktun = 1 Pictun = 8000 Tun = 8000 years * 20 Pictun = 1 Calabtun = 160.000 years * 20 Calabtun = 1 Kinchiltun = 3.200.000 years * 20 Kinchiltun = 1 Alautun = 64.000.000 years * 20 Alautun = 1 Hablatun = 1.280.000.000 years * 20 Hablatun = 1 ????? = 25.600.000.000 years So, when they had those huge time units using a system based on 20, why should their calendar simply stop at 13Baktun,0Katun,0Tun,0Uinal,0Kin? That's why I think that's a huge hoax simply to make people panic. | 4708) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe 10 Jan 2007 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: winning with 501 (but not Oinki!

No wonder that East Germany was financially broke then while West Germany became prosperous. The difference in economic position was more an effect of Communist economic policy than otherwise. The Marshall Plan provided seed money to rebuild infrastructure, not total economic support. This probably halved the recovery time for West Germany, but everything after that came from the effort and genius of the German people. I think that's also the reason why East Germany could endure so much time, they rebuilt the industry, and tried to keep regular prices, though being ripped off regularly by their \"Big Friend\", the Soviets... | 4797) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) CLOSED!

The U.S. extended $4.34 billion in credit in 1945, allowing Britain to stave off bankruptcy after devoting almost all its resources to the war for half a decade. Since 1950, Britain has made payments on the debt at the end of every year except six. At the time it was granted, the loan strained trans-Atlantic relations. British politicians expected a gift in recognition of their contribution to the war effort, especially for the lives lost before the United States entered the war after Pearl Harbor. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The U.S. didn't seem to realize that Britain was bankrupt,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said Alan Sked, a historian at the London School of Economics. The loan was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"denounced in the House of Lords, but in the end, the country had no choice.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The loan was double the size of the British economy at the time. As far as I know, East Germany had paid all Germany's WWII debts to the former Soviet Union until the end of the '80s (OK the Soviets took it out of that country year by year, including interests), while West Germany not only never had to pay WWII debts to the USA but was given big money from them with the Marshall plan. No wonder that East Germany was financially broke then while West Germany became prosperous. | 4808) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) - Posted 31 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good Morning Monday.

Well, to speak of my own person: having used logic back in the early 90's, I concluded that there are things which are absolutely not explainable by logic and by science, so I added the powers greater than man known as deity to what I knew of science, and to what I knew I am about to learn - and, there was an explanation for the scientifically unexplainable.

Everyone who bought \"Deutsche Telekom\" stocks thought they were Low Risk but lost most of their investigations. The bad thing on Stock Trading is that it's not predictable in the long run, that it's only for the short-term turn-over. If I had enough money to invest, I'd rather spend it for a lower but sure and predictable long-term win, than for a higher but risky short-term win which I can not predict. Low Risk doesn't mean you can't lose money, it means you don't lose your entire savings, your kid's college fund, your house and your car if the stock falls. You start with an initial investment and no matter how high the stock climbs, you can never fall below zero. I realize that's an overly simplified explanation, but it seems you don't understand how the market works anyway. Well, it's your opinion that I don't know what I'm talking about - only because my statements are opposed to yours. It's not an opinion, it's a fact and you verified it yet again with your comments about the stock market. Well - I just saw a mistake of mine: I wrote investigation instead of investment. But okay, you read the right meaning out of the context. No, I learned enough about the stock market, and this market economy in general during the last 17 years to quite know how it works. That brokers listen to insider informations and even rumors to decide whether to buy or to sell. And that the prices are falling and rising due to supply & demand: more demand -> higher prices, lower demand -> lower prices. I know that. But I - for my own morals - can not agree with that. For me, any thing with a certain value, which is not perishable, should cost the same no matter if a few or many people want to buy it. But this is my own view on this matter, and the way I would handle things if I were in business. I can't agree with this antisocial market economy. This is in total opposite to my moral values. | 4868) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: What human would dare to know the purpose of God?

To know how (for example) a clockwork works, doesn't mean I should ignore the maker of that clockwork. Even though I personalize God, it doesn't mean that I'm not interested in science. IMHO science reveals the divine in universe. If we are to conclude this. Then what is the next question we must ask ourselves? What created God? What created the rules by which he operates? Then what created the thing that created God? And then what created the thing that created the thing that created God? Why does anything even exist at all? Sure you solved the mystery. However you created a even bigger one. Occams razor states that with all things being equal as in this case the simplest answer is to be preferred. You are all just too deep. You might admire the way mortar is mixed, and the way the ingredients chemically react to make mortar - and marvel at the bricklayer who mixed the mortar, and the way he used it to build fantastic houses. But don't you think that bricklayer has a more interesting life than just building houses? Don't you think there is more to God than 'merely' building universes? I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just wonder if you can get to go to the same parties that God goes to when he's not doing his day job. Who created God? Every living thing has a mother, a parent. God ain't dead is he? I'm convinced that He's not dead, nor is His son Jesus. And like God was the father of Jesus Christ, it's possible that He also has a father, parents. But this is so far off of our imagination - we hardly can understand the idea of an eternal God having created our entire universe, so any higher generation older than God The Father is irrelevant to us: What is older than the universe? So to work out this idea remains speculations. | 4872) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) - Posted 28 Dec [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Morning, here is the winner!!!!

Netter Versuch :D 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Yeah - and like the last time when people where down there, they had not even seen a quarter of the places they had planned to see before they were called back because the politicians wanted to make short process. That one German control guy I read about was really more than upset to have been commanded to stop and leave before he could finish his task. Was his dissatisfaction with this fact biased? The proof comes when NGO experts will be send there to control their industry and see whether or not they have nukes. That doesn't need the \"mushroom\". Even though my opinions don't affect lifes I care much about truth. That's why I look for truth everywhere I can get it. But the more those whose action do affect lifes should even more care about truth. In my opinion, each broker, each journalist, each one who counsels politicians - every person who gives information away which can affect lifes or wealth of people, should be made reliable like witnesses at a Courtyard, \"to tell the truth and nothing but the truth\". So we should wait for conclusive proof Iran has nukes and just HOPE that proof doesn't come in the form of a mushroom cloud and millions of dead civilians, right? O, you mean like when we sent inspectors into Iraq and Saddam hindered their ability to perform their job effectively for a decade? You see, we tried it that way once....of course that FACT doesn't fit into your little idea of how the wold should be, does it? Well, I know several people who lost a fortune with these \"Deutsche Telekom\" stocks when their \"worth\" dropped to a fifth of their nominal prize. Everyone who bought \"Deutsche Telekom\" stocks thought they were Low Risk but lost most of their investigations. The bad thing on Stock Trading is that it's not predictable in the long run, that it's only for the short-term turn-over. As far as brokers, the stock market is a risky business. You don't wait for the price of a stock to rise before you buy, you buy when the price is low and hope that it rises so you can then sell it for a profit....not to mention nobody dies no, people only can lose their entire existence - even though not being involved in this kind of \"trade\" themselves, just because their employees are closed down after \"Hostile Take-overs\" for example. In my opinion, stock exchange should be legally treated as Gambling because that's what it really is. If I could change things, I'd make sure that, as example $50-stocks of a certain company should cost their $50 no matter if there are more or less buyers for them. Not all stock options are High Risk. You DO have the option of losing only the money you invest in Low Risk stock, but your profit potential is also Low. Once again, reality is clashing with your fantasy. Seems you aren't a familiar with the truth as you'd like for us to believe (image that) If I had enough money to invest, I'd rather spend it for a lower but sure and predictable long-term win, than for a higher but risky short-term win which I can not predict. It's a difference between politically biased and subjectively biased. While politically biased media tend to ignore facts which don't fit to the opinions of the party/politicians they support, those media you call the \"most biased\" ones don't need to pass political/party-based taboos, they can tell their opinions and spread all facts frankly. Of course it's biased when returned soldiers say: \"in war it's like hell, and I suggest everyone to refuse\" - But: it is reasonable. Too many lost their lifes, and too many returned having lost limbs. And to get enough soldiers, too many young folks are talked into joining Army/Navy/Marines voluntarily, using false promises. And that's not biased. And too many are joining military only to come out of their poor neighborhood or to get a secure income - and that's also not biased. As far as the mainstream media....I agree, you care about the truth as much as they do, of course, most Americans realize Journalism is a business. Their job is to sell the news, not to make sure it's accurate....In my opinion, a real journalist is only giving news which are checked and accurate. Selling rumors as news is okay for the \"rainbow press\", but not for media which want to be taken seriously! That's why I cross-check the articles I read about important topics with other sources, to find out the real facts behind them, and build my own opinion upon the facts after having found them - even though they sometimes seem to be in opposition to the opinion of the mainstream press. Yeah, except you already listed some of the news outlets you browse and I've already told you they are some of the most biased sources our country has to offer Guess why most Americans don't care what foreigners think...... may be for the same reason, why some folks cover their ears with their hands during an argument, like: \"I don't wanna hear this!\" Mostly people don't like to hear things which are uncomfortable to them - and even deny them like \"No! You're lying!\". It's a way to keep their actual state of sanity... No, it's more like you don't have a clue as to what you're talking about. I'm just wondering how many times I'm going to have to point that out before you get it....[/quote]Well, it's your opinion that I don't know what I'm talking about - only because my statements are opposed to yours. It's impossible that everyone has the same opinion as the other one, but that doesn't necessarily mean that one of them doesn't know what he or she is talking about. Their opinions just are built on the experience and knowledge each one of them has made, and these are otherwise for everyone. So IMHO accusing me to have no clue what I'm talking about only because I can't agree with you in all terms seems to be quite ignorant and self-centered. | 4874) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe - Posted 28 Dec [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Morning, here is the winner!!!! 4875) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe - Posted 28 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: woke up, get in for a win, back to bed | 4876) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: How in the h--- do u know a Jesuit priest ?

I don't disregard everything that Christianity, or any other religion, believes in. Not everything. It's not black or white, yes or no. I believe there is something, called \"God\", but not necessarily the \"God\" that you or others might define. There is truth is general concepts, good and evil, a right way to live, and a wrong way to live. You don't need religion to know these things, or even have to consider \"God\" to know these things. In fact all of what you need to know is in your head. Whether \"God\" exists or not, what you do in life is your own choice, not a life that has to be lived by some rules and definition of \"God\". And if you say you are already doing that, then why do you need churches, and why do you keep on and on about everybody else having to attend a church to be able to do what you do 'naturally'? And I wonder how many parents still tell their children that if they don't go to church they will go to hell? What's with all this blackmail? And to the children? I think the blackmailing is because these parents don't know it better - they were taught the same by their parents and those by theirs and so on... Do I make the impression to want to make everybody else attend a church? Oops. I only tried to share my view. Well, I attend a church to meet people who believe the same way as I do, to learn from them etc. | 4890) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) - Posted 26 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: You mean like preached in some Christian churches? well, in the Bible is written that each sin can be forgiven except the \"sin against the Holy spirit\", and that a sin is only when you do something despite KNOWING that it's against the rules. It depends on the definition of 'religion' I guess. If it involves worshiping a god and feeling blackmailed into going to hell if you do bad, ... That all depends on which medieval monk defined the rules, or tweaked them around to suite what they wanted, and also on which preacher is trying to define what the Holy spirit is. Excuse me for being totally naive but why should I believe anything some old men conjured up hundreds and thousands of years ago, or claim what someone said 2000 years ago, a record of it recorded third hand even if not made up. What I do know is what the Christian Churches say today. Which is contrary to Darwinism. Contrary to the fact that dinosaurs existed. And generally contrary to any rational understanding. I can see your point. Darwinism is contrary to what some of the churches still preach. But that doesn't prevent me to have belief in a God. For me, Darwinism is just a theory (even one based on scientific observations); and who tells that the world as we know it hasn't developed (made?) out of the ruins of another one, that one where the dinosaurs have existed?

There have been thousands of them. My question is why are you so convinced that your one God is correct? Why are you an atheist to all other Gods except your own God? Most if not all of these other religions texts were written by man and they don't even claim to have any divine inspiration nor a specific god that they worship... These religions are all about personal fulfillment or becoming one with nature or becoming one with the universe, not God... ;) Jeffrey we are the universe. \"We are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.\" - Carl Sagan All you are and I am and we all are is just a bunch of atoms arranged in a certain way. We are all illusions. Inside the brain you have millions of synapses and million of neurons all firing at once which creates the illusion of consciouses. We came from the universe. We are part the universe. We are a result of billions of years of evolution and we have a psychological need to believe in something bigger than ourselves. In ancient times we needed Gods to help us explain phenomenon which we did not understand. As humans we need to feel a part of something bigger than ourselves. ( For me this is SETI ) We need to feel comforted because we are scared by the truth that this is all we are. Just a bunch of atoms and that when these decay we will become no more. Don't any of you see the bigger picture? Don't any of you question why? Or do you all just ignore all challenges to your intelligence and turn off your brains and say God did it? I personally think that if you believe in a God then you do not understand what you are and you do not understand our place in this universe, because if you did open your minds and understand it then you would see that there is no God. It took me over 7 months to see the universe as I do now. All the beauty of it. It took me 7 months and I am now just beginning to understand our place in it. It is much more than saying you know that you live on a planet that orbits a star, that this star is just one in our galaxy and that our galaxy is one among billions. It is more than saying you know we evolved, do you really truly understand it? If I could share this great feeling I now have with each and every person on this planet I would. However I fear that most people get too caught up in their lives and never really understand or see this universe we live in, much less to stop and question why things are the way they are. This is my last post in this thread. For me, God is behind the power which commands quarks to form hadrons, protons, neutrons and the other basic parts of matter; and which makes those basic parts form the several kinds of matter; which makes life out of matter, which makes life finally produce intelligence, able to find out the laws how the universe works.

These religions are all about personal fulfillment or becoming one with nature or becoming one with the universe, not God... ;) Some of the religions above are \"reformed\" parts of others, like the Sikhism can be defined as \"reformed\" Hinduism; others are also pagan religions, like Hinduism, or Shintoism which has several gods with the sun goddess Amaterasu above them; and others can be defined as New Religions (Cao Dai, Tenrikyu, Rastafari); or rather as ideologies like Juche, which is an invention of Kim Il Sung, the former leader of North Korea. Spiritism again, is a a quite new movement (about 1860) which also adores the Biblical God, but has no formal membership. Principally, it can just be spoken of (a) pagan or multi-god religions, (b) monotheism (based on the Bible: like Judaism, Christianity, Islam) and (c) philosophies without a God (like Buddhism, Juche or Atheism) - so you can say that, besides the natural gods of the Pagan religions, there is only one superior God as creator. And, hasn't even the Bible mentioned the adoration of pagan godheads like Baal, Belial(/Beliar) or Astarte?

That doesn't need the \"mushroom\". Even though my opinions don't affect lifes I care much about truth. That's why I look for truth everywhere I can get it. But the more those whose action do affect lifes should even more care about truth. In my opinion, each broker, each journalist, each one who counsels politicians - every person who gives information away which can affect lifes or wealth of people, should be made reliable like witnesses at a Courtyard, \"to tell the truth and nothing but the truth\". So we should wait for conclusive proof Iran has nukes and just HOPE that proof doesn't come in the form of a mushroom cloud and millions of dead civilians, right? As far as brokers, the stock market is a risky business. You don't wait for the price of a stock to rise before you buy, you buy when the price is low and hope that it rises so you can then sell it for a profit....not to mention nobody dies no, people only can lose their entire existence - even though not being involved in this kind of \"trade\" themselves, just because their employees are closed down after \"Hostile Take-overs\" for example. In my opinion, stock exchange should be legally treated as Gambling because that's what it really is. If I could change things, I'd make sure that, as example $50-stocks of a certain company should cost their $50 no matter if there are more or less buyers for them. As far as the mainstream media....I agree, you care about the truth as much as they do, of course, most Americans realize Journalism is a business. Their job is to sell the news, not to make sure it's accurate....In my opinion, a real journalist is only giving news which are checked and accurate. Selling rumors as news is okay for the \"rainbow press\", but not for media which want to be taken seriously! That's why I cross-check the articles I read about important topics with other sources, to find out the real facts behind them, and build my own opinion upon the facts after having found them - even though they sometimes seem to be in opposition to the opinion of the mainstream press. Guess why most Americans don't care what foreigners think...... may be for the same reason, why some folks cover their ears with their hands during an argument, like: \"I don't wanna hear this!\" Mostly people don't like to hear things which are uncomfortable to them - and even deny them like \"No!

For examples; quoted from the article: 1) \"But Russia, a close commercial partner of Iran's, stripped the resolution of some of its toughest measures, including a travel ban on officials linked to the nuclear programs.\" 2) \"Moscow's U.N. envoy, Vitaly Churkin, argued that sanctions should be narrowly targeted at Iran's prohibited activities while allowing development of its nuclear energy industry, including an $800 million Russian nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran.\" So to me the U.N. is pretty much a joke.

Is mead still actually produced? I've never ran across it myself. I brewed some once. Worst tasting garbage I ever brewed. I'd really like to taste the real stuff though. I'm assuming it's kind of sort of similar to beer. Is it made from hops, wheat, or what? I guess I could Google it. It's made from honey. wikipedia wrote: Mead (IPA: [/'m\u00c3\u00e2\u20acd/]) is a fermented alcoholic beverage made of honey, water, and yeast. Meadhing (pronounced: /\u00c3\u00cbm\u00c3\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba.\u00c3\u00c2\u00b0\u00c3\u00c2\u00aa\u00c3...\u00e2\u20ac\u00b9/) is the practice of brewing honey. Mead is also known as \"honey wine\", even if it is considered a separate and distinct type of alcoholic beverage. A mead that also contains spices (like cloves, cinnamon or nutmeg) or herbs (such as oregano or even lavender or chamomile) is called metheglin (pronounced: /'m\u00c3\u00e2\u00a2-th\u00c3\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2g'l\u00c3\u00c2n/). This word is derived from the Welsh word meddyglyn, meaning \"medicinal liquor\", as healing herbs were often stored as metheglin so they would be available over the winter (as well as making them much easier to swallow).

It's like in Germany, were there still are occupying forces, though the world war has been over since 1945.I can't speak for the US-Germany relationship, but the view from The Bridge is that the Cold War is still on, but alas we can not point to Mother Russia as an ally or as an enemy because we don't have an enemy like we used to. I believe it was Walt Kelley who said \"We have met the enemy, and they is us\". I might be wrong about the speaker, but not the speech. We've had a free ride since Berlin. Now it's time to pay the overdue bill, and we've got less than nothing to show for it (because Japan, China, India, Iran, France, Germany, Korea (North and South), Pakistan, the Philippines, Malaya, Sudan, Somalia, and even Palestine kicked our collective socio-, economic, military, and political butts during that free ride) Maybe if we had done to Baghdad what de did to Berlin - Bomb the living daylights outta the place (and maybe the semi-living lights as well) - followed by a 21st Century Marshall Plan... No, we should have done the same thing in Iraq as we did in Germany and Japan. We kept the Nazis and the emperor working for their country. We just changed their names. It worked. They knew how to do it. We can't impose freedom on a country that doesn't want it. There has been men from the former Center Party, or the former Social Democrats, who were more qualified than those Nazi bastards! But they were ignored by the US. \"We knew what we did. It was absolutely necessary that we used every son of a b*** as long as he was an anti-communist\". ~ Harry Rositzke, CIA-Russia expert For instance they hired the Nazi spy expert Reinhard Gehlen to build the new Germany's secret service BND - and allowed him to hire at least 6 SS and SD veterans, like Franz Six and Emil Augsburg, two SS intelligence veterans involved in the mass extermination of Jews, and fugitive war criminals. | 5015) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 488376](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=488376)) Posted [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 488321](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=488321)) Posted 23 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: coming back for a short win :-) 5017) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [thorin Post: I'm just watching a movie titled \"American Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith\" on [BYU Television Online](http://byu.tv) - it was send today, at 12:00am MST, but can still be seen on this viewer anyway. It gives an insight into the life of the founder of the Mormon church and the founding of this church, and the struggles and the persecutions it had to go through. If this is no pure propaganda (and it seems not to be, because I read similar things about this topic from both sides, Mormons and anti-Mormons) then this church seems to be one of those which are not corrupt. Didn't they have killers that attacked other wagon trains ? I forgot, I'll watch it. And the FBI is dominated by the Mormons. You gotta be one to get promoted. To many power religions in this world. What would you do if a UFO landed and an alien walked out holding \"the one true religion of the universe\"? I would shoot him and burn the book. we already have enough \"one true religions\" OK, you seem like a reasonable guy. Obviously a nonprofessional religious outlook. Here is your assignment. We are going to new planets, which \"book\" do we take ? Every planet a different religion, same problems. Or merge all religions into one space book ? Dunno Neither do I. Since you can't say that there is one human culture (like in the SF stories) you also can't say that there is one human religion. Heck, you even can't say that there is one Christian or one Islamic religion! Even when you take the \"main religions\" (like Christianity, Islam, etc.) there are a few dozens of them, and when you have a look of them as single denominations, there are several thousands of them on this planet. So if you talk about informing other intelligent beings after a possible contact about what we humans believe in, a short excerpt about these \"main religions\" would be helpful. But if you talk about settling on other planets, the \"books to take\" should be in the responsibility of those among the settlers who believe in these books. | 5018) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 488220](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=488220)) Posted 23 Dec SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 488079](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=488079)) Posted 23 Dec 2006 by [thorin steals wins without stealing :P Lester wrote: we already have enough \"one true religions\" Oh that's only too right :-( It would be sooo simple to gather them together, and make them meet in the things they have in common.But no, they insist on their differences instead...

But - as I always use to add, I put it that way that (for I am a human making mistakes) that I may have misunderstood several things. So it's up to them to explain me those things better. I don't say they talk BS, because I don't want to insult people. I rather say, \"sorry I don't understand why you teaching this stuff - I can't find it in the Scriptures\". It's an entire different statement than \"Hey you teach things different to your own books!\" Is questioning a religion disrespecting it ? All religions have gone through this phase - burning witches, inquisiton, crusades etc. But they didn't have nuke's. Well, Lester, it's not the religion who own those nukes - it's the countries led by people who hide their lust for power behind \"slightly\" changed religious teachings, who hide their lust for power even behind the religion itself. If the Koran doesn't promise heaven upon my death, why do they say so ? Don't they read the book ?Here in Germany I met Muslims whom I experienced to be the nice person next door, and even when I was in the States back in the '90s I met some nice muslims there. Normally these people do not teach that violence, it's them who fall into wrong teachings. And wrong teachings can be taught in each religion. And who of them who attend a service meeting do actually take the scriptures afterwards and read them to cross-check the preachings they heard? Who even makes notes to think about what they heard later? I'd say only a few. Most of them who go to church (or mosque or synagoge etc) bank on their preachers to tell them the truth, and sometimes they are taught subjective things which incite them to do things... evil things. Like back in the 30's in Germany the NSDAP and their youth organization, or that experiment [\"The Third Wave\"](http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/Auxiliary/Psychology/Frank/Thirdwave.html) in 1968 in Palo Alto - people who obey their authorities willingly can be manipulated very easily. Too easily. And they even don't realize to be manipulated until it's too late. Sometimes they even don't realize it even then... | 5070) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 487476](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=487476)) Posted 22 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: back from some woik, I'm ready for the race again, and say I WIN!!! | 5071) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 487430](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=487430)) Posted 22 Post: Good moaning Jerremy ... heading for Christmas now, and aside fron some food and booze, to take to the Children on Monday, all is ready.

You're alluding to Islam, don't you? That's really a strange thing with that. No-where in the Qur'an is written to kill the non-believers only because they don't believe in Allah. Also the word Jihad doesn't mean just war according to the Qur'an: it's rather meaning to strive or struggle in the way of God. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad) wrote: there are five kinds of jihad fi sabilillah (struggle in the cause of God): * Jihad of the heart/soul (jihad bin nafs/qalb) is an inner struggle of good against evil in the mind, through concepts such as tawhid. * Jihad by the tongue (jihad bil lisan) is a struggle of good against evil waged by writing and speech, such as in the form of dawah (proselytizing), Khutbas (sermons), et al. It is one weapon in the jihadi arsenal. * Jihad by the pen and knowledge (jihad bil qalam/ilm) is a struggle for good against evil through scholarly study of Islam, ijtihad (legal reasoning), and through sciences (such as medical sciences). * Jihad by the hand (jihad bil yad) refers to a struggle of good against evil waged by actions or with one's wealth, such as going on the Hajj pilgrimage (seen as the best jihad for women), taking care of elderly parents, providing funding for jihad, political activity for furthering the cause of Islam, stopping evil by force, espionage, and the penetration of Western universities by salafi Islamic ideology, in numerous Middle East Studies departments funded by Saudi Arabia. * Jihad by the sword (jihad bis saif) refers to qital fi sabilillah (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by Salafi Muslims and offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood. But in the meaning of holy war, there are strict rules in the Qur'an. [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad) wrote: People who want to remain neutral in war should be left alone and not be troubled in any way. As in Qur'an: So each Muslim who kills people who are not involved in any fight against their countries, is actually breaking the rules of the Holy Book of the Islam, the Qur'an, even though they're told to do so by their Imams and other preachers. \"Or those who approach you such that they neither have the courage to fight you nor their own people [and are such that] had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they withdraw from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not give you permission to take any action against them.\" \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acQur'an, 4:90 But: There are things - here we can write texts and post comics free as the duck takes the water, even totally respectless, there they expect, even demand respect to everything they feel to be sacred. A muslim rather betrayes his wife than his God. And even the first one is close to impossible. So insulting their religion is worse then insulting themselves, and they get blind-raged. IMHO one of the biggest disadvantages of globalism: we western people expect everyone in the world to accept our freedom of speech and our even respectless humour. But this is impossible. There are other cultures than ours, and always will be, and our media - and politicians - must have to respect that. | 5083) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Last Person WINS Part 13 - NOW CLOSED](forum_thread.php?id=36379) ( [Message 487346](forum_thread.php?id=36379&postid=487346)) Posted 22 Dec 2006 by [thorin Post: sleep well Misfit! and have fun working, Jeremy!

I've wanted to read the Mission Earth series but I never find all the books in the series for sale at the same time at bookstores. If I'm going to read a series, I want to go from first book to last book instead of a period of days or months in between books. Admittedly, I don't have the willpower to just buy a book here and there until I collect them all and then read them. I off tracked the thread somewhat. IMHO I do believe that the larger the church, the more likely it will stray from it's \"path\", because it gets mired in \"worldly\" business. Religion for money is so true in some cases. Even if a church gets involved in \"worldly\" business, it depends on their leaders (not the \"simple members\") how the achieved money is handled then. It's a huge difference if 100% of the achieved money are spent for church stuff and re-investments - or if 50% go right to the private accounts of those church leaders and the 50% are spent for re-investments and salaries, and church sites and media stuff (in this order), and they have to collect offerings for the charity stuff... If I remember right, I read that (for example) the Mormon Church had an own bank in their early days with very-low-rate credits to make sure that the members could settle and start a new existence without having to pay back twice as much due to the interests... But when the church needed money themselves, because their corporal income was not enough to maintain the buildings and to print books etc, they had to sell their own bank to another, more seculary one, to become \"liquid\" again... After that their intern and extern financial rules were revised and reformed, and now they are growing well and wealthy again... | 5135) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485976](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485976)) Posted 20 Dec 2006 by [thorin Post: Back here in my apartment /workshop/ office again! that crap lock for that fire-proof door I fixed some hours ago failed the very moment when I built it back in place - so I had to take it out again, and have to do some troubleshooting....

And he's our teammate! That's easy Sarge. As I understood it: Faith - ok, church as organisation - nope. This view is not mine, but I can accept & tolerate it. Because I experienced both kinds of churches - the kind which is \"packaging and selling a product for profit\", and the kind which is rather a club than a organized thing. --- Well, and I also don't like the idea of folks who are preaching for money. That's not my understanding of the phrase \"Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give\" (Mat 10:8) . The church I'm tending to, for example, has no priests by profession nor missionaries by profession, everything they do for church is during their spare-time or time-off, and for free. They even save money to become able to serve on a mission. It's just their offering to God. When I was in a hospital about 10 years ago, I discussed with a protestant priest. She said she grudged everyone who has strong faith, because: she had lost hers during her theological studies! For her the Bible she was supposed to preach was just like any product to sell. I couldn't understand that. How can someone honestly teach and preach who doesn't belief in what they talk about? Even I can't sell stuff I'm not at least 99% convinced of. | 5169) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485592](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485592)) Posted 19 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: zip in for a win and zip out to make some BBQ that was my text! - well except I wanted to say supper instead of BBQ *snicker* | 5170) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485439](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485439)) Posted 19 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: just came in after during a short break for at least a short win | 5171) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485418](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485418)) 19 Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485413](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485413)) Posted 19 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: my turn again for at least a short win... | 5173) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485410](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485410)) 19 Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 485395](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=485395)) Posted 19 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good night O small 1.

The Ten commandments are even 1200 years older - It is said by Historians that the exodus must have been about while Ramses II. was pharaoh over Egypt. Sure. But the source of most ethic rules is based on the Ten Commandments Moses taught to his people several thousands of years ago, means they are based in religion - so the circle closes again.Granted that some ethical standards originated in religious texts, however this does not mean they cannot be borrowed and adjusted, improved as required for modern society. The ten commandments are pretty much 'common sense' today, even if people dont abide by them, this is a problem of enforcement. However 2000 years ago, they probably weren't common sense or even common which is likely why they were created in the first place. You forgot to mention, that organised religion also seeks to conquer and convert entire populations... whilst spreading disease and killing thousands. Also how about starting wars, creating social tensions and discrimination (i could go on and on and on). In these cases it's not really religion but the interests of their leaders who want more (secular) power or want influence over treasures etc, and hide their interests behind the religion. Look at Ireland: There are fights going between those who want all Ireland to be independent, and those who want to keep Britain influnce in Northern Ireland - and because the first party is mainly catholic & the second one is mainly protestant, so in the media they say it were a fight between Catholics & Protestants. But if you look into politics & history you'll see that it's not a matter of their denomination but has political reasons - like each other \"religious\" fight. If you want to meet with your friends to talk about religion, go to their house, or meet in the park. Don't build a church, collect money, appoint positions of power and a hierarchy. Churches are just like a corporations, especially when people start talking about church sites as branches (just like a bank!).Okay - may be this was a wrong translation - but actually I know some churches calling their sites either wards or branches, depending on their size. And about the hierarchy: Even in the New Testament there was built a hierarchy of the new-found church: Jesus as the head, his 12 Apostles, the Seventies (Luk 10:1), the Bishops, Priests, and Diacons. And when you have enough members who like to meet, why should no houses be built to meet in them, and why should no money be collected to maintain these buildings and to support the poor ones among those members? I know of enough denominations where no function is paid, where all the money collected goes into support & charity, and into building, maintaining and restoring of their church sites. I meant logical reasons for strange things I experienced. Like what may be called telepathy or visions or several situations when I changed my mind without reason and would have been injured if I hadn't or when I felt to be forced to do otherwise than I had planned and it came out to my advantage - all such logically unexplainable stuff which happened too frequent to be just by incident. May i ask why you were searching for god?Sure. After I finally stopped my desperate struggle to find logical reasons, and leaned back, saying with Hamlet: \"And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\", I simply experienced that opening my mind to accepting that things simply can't explained yet, opened my mind also to others. Logical reasons for what? I don't understand. What actually motivated you to 'search for god' in the first place, why was there a need?? As I said, I mainly searched for another way to go, another idea to hold on when the ideology I had believed in before showed up to be false. Finding God was rather a side-product of my quest. It depends how long the trouble was brewing. If the government had a long history (say 100 years) of problems etc without much improvement certainly.... throw them out! Obviously they are worthless and have no idea what they are doing or are corrupt beyond repair. Let someone new have a goThat's why the Berlin Wall came down, and I had to search something new to believe in, because I had believed that the system I lived in was the only right one ... ... Corporations and Governments are accountable and if they keep screwing up, they go bankrupt and disappear or are dissolved (revolution?). Unfortunately with organised religion this is not possibly why? Because they are not accountable to anyone except god!? Has the catholic church ever had an 'ethical audit'? or an audit of any kind? Okay I don't want to depreciate the Catholic believers because I respect every faith (even the belief that there is no God at all). But - when I finally found the Bible to be true, I also discussed with catholic priests about it and their view on the matter - and couldn't agree with them. In the Bible I found nothing about Popes or paid theologists or monasteries or the adoration of several Saints... But what I found was that Jesus (who should be the foundation of each Christian church) always was agaist the establishment of the theologists (= scribes) and also stated that God should be the only person to be called \"Holy Father\". But this is my personal view - I might have misunderstood several phrases of the Bible. If some of the most cruel periods in history were because of a particular religion, why can't the entire religion be held accountable? You are suggesting that organised religion has no \"group accountability\", and this is exactly where the ethics in the bible stop and where mankind needs to start.But to declare each religious organization as manipulating etc is a wrong generalization. That would be like knowing a handful of a certain foreigners to be thiefs and peculators, and declare all foreigners to be thiefs and peculators. I don't think the bible suggests \"how to run a religion\" (this was left to man) Inside any organised religion there are politics, power and money (just like a corporation) and this is where its gets rather ugly and dangerous. This is what has led to past atrocities and will lead to future atrocities. This is why all organised religion should be disbanded. There is no need to lump all denominations together only because a handful of them made things which were (and are) definitely wrong. There are a lot of denominations which do (as organization) remain on the sidelines of politics but encourage their members (as single persons) to be involved in politics for their country as good as they can. So it may happen that there are members of the same church serving opposite parties in the town-hall etc. | 5241) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 484783](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=484783)) 18 Dec 2006 by [thorin so? 512 boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 484777](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=484777)) Posted 18 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: It looks like I and back again and winning for a short period 510 for a short one *snicker* | 5243) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 484767](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=484767)) Posted 18 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: fine for you but now it's my win.

Each scientific theory is based on axioms or postulates. But: wiktionary explains: axiom (plural axioms) 1. (philosophy) A self-evident and necessary truth; a proposition which it is necessary to take for granted; a proposition whose truth is so evident that no reasoning or demonstration can make it plainer. For example, \"The whole is greater than a part.\" 2. (mathematics) A theorem that cannot be proved and is therefore fundamental, necessary, and assumed. Axioms form the basis of a mathematical system. 3. An established principle in some art or science that is universally received. In mathematics, axiom and postulate are terms that are used as essentially interchangeable. Definition 2 is incorrect. An axiom is a statement, like a theorem, but there are no questions about trying to prove it or not. (We learned from trying to prove Euclid's Fifth Postulate.) Okay, you got me. If I'd seen it earlier, I'd rephrased this myself... It's not my intention to be suggestive of supposing all scientists were against religion, or that everyone here were a scientist. So when science is axiomatic, means based on propositions necessary to take for granted, on theorems that cannot be proved, then why are the scientists so zealous to fight religion which is also based on axiom and postulates - on the postulate that there is God, on the axiom that there are Higher Powers? I don't know if science is axiomatic, but they use our mathematical tools, so implicitly or explicitly they accept the same assumptions. Do not suppose that all scientists are arguing against religion. Do not suppose that all posters here are scientists or even close. There are some who are interested in science (or may even be scientists, who knows?), but are totally shocked by the idea of axioms in mathematics and claim they \"believe\" nothing. Over and over I try to explain it and try to understand how within any human mind there are \"no assumptions\" being made or \"no beliefs\" held. But I try to express that religion and science are not that different from each other, that they actually do have parallels, even that both of them work with belief and dogma. | 5262) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 484492](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=484492)) Posted 17 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: To give an explanation that serves to clarify.

Perhaps if viewed out of context. This quote is taken out of a text about [Socialism and Religion](http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/dec/03.htm) which explains Lenin's (and later the \"official\" Soviet) view on this topic. There may be parallels - even by coincident. I suggested that organised religion (note the word organised) and believing in GOD per se has nothing to do with sound ethics. In fact some of the most ethical people i know are agnostics or atheists. Sure. But the source of most ethic rules is based on the Ten Commandments Moses taught to his people several thousands of years ago, means they are based in religion - so the circle closes again. I also mentioned that organised religion is used as a tool to suppress (and manipulate and\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6). Note that what individuals believe is safe enough (it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s between them and their God) and cannot be used to exert control, extract money or for example start wars. I would go so far as to say that organised religion is an outright threat to the continued existence and survival of humanity period.\"Has been used\", and \"can be used\" rather are terms I would use, because to generalize this, means to lump all organized religions together, which is entirely wrong. \"Organized religions\" only are built upon the urge of people who believe the same way, to meet and teach each other. That this has led to some of the most cruel things in history can't be blamed on the organizing itself, but on the people who became the several leaders of those organizations. That it is working otherwise, you can see at least in some of those newer churches and some small religious groups. Nowadays it is said: a church is not just a building or an organization, it is meeting people believing in God the same way. Ethical practices should be established, indecently of all organised religious beliefs. Should these be adopted they can be used in all walks of life (and science for instance). People are free to believe what ever they likeAll organizations, parties and churches, have been and still are trying to establish ethical standards and practices... unfortunately they are slightly different: for some folks too out-of-date, for some folks to progressive; it takes the free decision and intelligence of each individual to meet within the extremes. What are these unexplainable coincidences?These were situations which could be explained either as PSI-phenomena by people believing in this, or as the influence of higher powers by folks who believe in that. I don't want to go deeper now, but it was enough stuff to doubt my own mental health. Luckily I had enough independent witnesses when I experienced this stuff - so at least that reason (any kind of mental illness) could be excluded. So I searched for explanations how this stuff could happen, and found not even one in scientific sources. Either things like those were totally denied, or treated as imaginations of a stressed mind, or they wrote (in more tolerating books) that stuff like this is existing but not explainable yet. May i ask why you were searching for god?Sure. After I finally stopped my desperate struggle to find logical reasons, and leaned back, saying with Hamlet: \"And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\", I simply experienced that opening my mind to accepting that things simply can't explained yet, opened my mind also to others. And when the system I had believed in, eventually showed up (after being smashed when the Berlin Wall came down) to have been just an illusion only held up by fraud and corruption, I looked for other philosophies to find reason. Well, religion is also a kind of philosophy - I read everything and spoke with a real lot of persons finding out what should be my way now. Then, '91, I was hitch-hiking through the States, and 9 out of 10 people who gave me a ride told me about how their lifes had changed since they had accepted Jesus; and they were kind and hospitable and generous, and even prayed upon me etc. So - because I knew that Jesus indeed was a historic person - I got nosy about this guy and read every book where I could find information about Him. This of course led me automatically to the Bible. And then, after having read it (plus some critical books) within a couple months, I finally stumbled over one peculiar verse: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally...\" (James 1:5) Heck, I absolutely lacked wisdom! I didn't know anymore for sure where to go, and what to follow. That song \"Where do I go\" from the musical \"Hair\" desribed exactly my own situation! So I struggled with my own self and finally went to where I knew to be alone, to ask God if He could help me out of this struggle... Strangely this my first prayer finally worked otherwise then expected, and I found myself to have become a believer only a short time later... It took me almost two more years to find a church where I could feel home, which I felt to be closer to the truth which I knew from both, my rational knowledge before and the Bible. And in 1993 I finally was baptized. Only because even governments do it doesn't mean that it's right. History has shown that government often make even horrible mistakes. As mentioned above: it's not the thing of being organized, but who leads that organization. Even non-organized preachers can be either righteous or impostors. Would you want to dissolve your entire government if you saw they were making trouble, or would you just want the president and several persons in charge to be exchanged? That's similar in organizations - and even in churches, too. It's the people, not the organization itself, who give them the direction to go. That there are people who hide their particular interests behind the coat of religion, that's clear and unfortunately not changeable. I mentioned before that you can't mangle them all together. Entire governments do it. Look at non secular governments for example. If organised religions were dissolved, this problem would go away. | 5291) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 17 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Mahlzeit :-) stumbling in for a short win before having some lunch | 5292) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 17 Dec 2006 Post: Mornin all, did I miss anything?

In fact they use their faith as a tool to manipulate (gullible) people. I wouldn't call that faith. Around here we use the term \"Sunday Christians\" to describe those who put forward a pious appearance but in fact are hypocrites. Appearance of being \"faithful\" outside is not conclusive of being so inside. I can go to any used car lot and find folks that will act as though I'm their best customer and they will do right by me but in reality \"caveat emptor\" when it comes to the contract and if there are any hidden problems with the car that should've been fixed before unscrupulously being put up for sale. In the area of my home town, there is even a worse term than \"Sunday Christians\" - \"Advent Christians\": people who only remember to have been baptized when there are Christian holidays. But here in Germany, many people are leaving churches anyway because they want to keep the \"church-tax\" which is 9% of the salary tax. BTW: I once asked a evangelic pastor why their church didn't insist on the tithing (according to Malachi 3:10) - She told me that if they did this, hardly one percent of the church-goers would remain in her branches. But there you can see who goes to church because they believe, and who goes there because of a tradition. And those who would stay away if tithings were obligatory could absolutely be called \"Sunday Christians\" who only are pretending to be good Christians. Others, who never joined a service except at their own baptism or wedding, are calling themselves Christian (\"I am member of a church that's why I can be called a Christian\") and point this at every opportune chance to get advantage from it. But I don't call these ones believers. IMHO believers stay put no matter which offers are to make, because faith is not only admitting by words, but also by deeds.

I. Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union, said a hundred years ago? This is a question I actually can answer. As I mentioned before, I grew up as a atheist before and experienced faith when I was not younger than 25. My grandparents and my parents were (are) lefties, denying any idea that there may be a god. So I grew up god-less. But: According to the ethic rules of the party they were in, and of which I learned in school and in the youth organization, there was most of the Commandments (just without anything quoting god) So: honesty against anybody and against the country were the main principles I learned in past. When I learned about the Bible, and read the 10 Commandments, and compared them to what I had learned, I experienced that I only had to add the \"divine factor\" to what I knew before - so little was the difference. I even dare to say, there are atheists who act even more Christian than some of the Christians themselves - depending on their own behaviour. So Ethics is not a matter of belief. Not always at least. Though those who are behaving unethically are mostly found among atheists and agnostics... The problem with leaving out the divine is that children do not learn that they will need to account for their entire lives to someone who cannot be lied to, cannot be fooled, cannot be distracted. In my experience, this precept provides a powerful moderating influence on people for the same reason that children do not misbehave when an adult is present. The kids I knew who were not taught this lesson while growing up tended to get into trouble because they were able to rationalize and convince themselves that doing {whatever this wrong thing was} would be OK because nobody would ever find out. For kids, especially adolescent boys, the lesson seems to be \"I'ts OK if you don't get caught!\" not \"Don't do it bacause it's wrong!\" I strongly believe that faith in a \"higher power\" or being accountable to such an entity has nothing what so ever to do with instilling sound behaviour and ethics in an individual. In fact it is a bit of a parental cop-out. Like if you do bad, it will catch up with you in the end (not now mind you or by my hand etc). Furthermore in my experience (especially in business) those individuals of strong faith are exceptionally unethical and corrupt. In fact they use their faith as a tool to manipulate (gullible) people. I also cannot fathom the value in faith as a boost to self esteem. This is quite ridiculous in my opinion. It does provide a nice crutch for certain types of individuals or entire populations that are suppressed and live in poverty. However as a crutch, it is like a \"permanent illness\" rather than face the issues at hand, they turn to the crutch and are 'forever' trapped while the \"organised religion\" is exploiting the population at hand. Look at the Spanish conquest of Central and South America for example. Some 500 years later, this organised religion still has literally a strangle hold on these impoverished people. \"Religion is one of the forms of spiritual oppression which everywhere weighs down heavily upon the masses of the people, over burdened by their perpetual work for others, by want and isolation. Impotence of the exploited classes in their struggle against the exploiters just as inevitably gives rise to the belief in a better life after death as impotence of the savage in his battle with nature gives rise to belief in gods, devils, miracles, and the like. Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven. Religion is opium for the people. Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.\" Well, as I mentioned several times before, I was not taught religion before my own quest. And I can't say to have felt impoverished or surpressed. There have been only some too many unexplainable coincidences to begin to doubt the pure materialistic, scientific view on life - and when people told me about God, I searched everywhere about religions, what they believe why and how, and I read religious books and books about religion, pros and cons, until I found out that the Bible was the one truth for me. It was not just replacing one conviction with another or being pressed into a religion. It was struggle - with the matter itself, and with what I believed to be true before. I myself converted because of my own will and my own efforts. If you had read my part of the thread, you could have read that I was treated as a traitor by my family after my baptism. That there are people who hide their particular interests behind the coat of religion, that's clear and unfortunately not changeable. I mentioned before that you can't mangle them all together. There are others, honest ones. But unfortunately those people, you, @Enigma, have experienced, don't mention that they should be the \"light of the world\" as preached in the New Testament, instead they are themselves the \"scribes and Pharisees\" Jesus mentioned with: \"...whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do, but do not ye after their works, for they say, and do not.\" Because that is what I do: I judge people by their doing, but what a single person does tells me only about that person, not about the organizations/ parties/ churches behind - even if he or she is the only representative available. I judge a church/religion whether or not they themselves teach according to their Scriptures and whether or not they act according to what they are teaching. | 5354) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Twelve Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36279) 483412](forum_thread.php?id=36279&postid=483412)) Posted 16 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good Afternoon guys!

But that doesn't mean the bah-humbug season is over yet. Every Christmas, the politically correct and anti-religion crowd gets into Scrooge mode, trying to deprive the great majority of Americans from celebrating Christmas in traditional fashion. The American Civil Liberties Union files lawsuits demanding creches be removed from public property. School districts change Christmas vacations into winter breaks and ban carols from holiday assemblies. Even some retailers have gotten cold feet about mentioning the holiday, with Wal-Mart instructing its employees that \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Merry Christmas\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 should be replaced with \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Happy Holidays.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 It would be laughable if it weren't so offensive. This year's \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"war on Christmas\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 story had an unlikely genesis. A Seattle rabbi simply asked Sea-Tac Airport to display a Menorah to celebrate Hanukkah, which begins at sundown. But the Port Authority, which runs the facility, got nervous, worrying that displaying the symbol that celebrates the Jewish victory over the Seleucid king of Syria in 200 B.C. would somehow be a government endorsement of religion. Nonsense. The story of the Maccabees' revolt against Antiochus IV \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac who persecuted the Jews and looted the temple \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac is a cultural and historical celebration as well as a religious one. The airport could easily have accommodated the rabbi's request, but chose instead to panic and remove the Christmas trees, which are certainly a secular, not religious, symbol. And the rabbi didn't exactly help the matter by threatening to sue the airport if it didn't display the 8-foot lighted candelabra. Many of us grew up in a different time, when civic centers and public buildings routinely featured not just trees, snowmen and Santa Claus, but Nativity scenes that depicted Mary, Joseph, the Baby Jesus and the Three Wise Men. No one was being asked to subscribe to belief in the divinity of Christ because of these displays, but it was an acknowledgment that the overwhelming majority of Americans celebrated the birth of this man. Should non-Buddhists be offended when cities build pagoda structures with public money, since these buildings are simply replicas of shrines to honor Buddha? Should Christians, Jews and Moslems take offense when Chinese restaurants feature statues of Buddha at their entryways? Should public buildings be forced to remove any Persian rugs that feature the prayer rug design, in fear that not doing so is somehow an endorsement of Islam? Should public museums remove any paintings that depict religious figures or themes? Should public orchestras and choruses be forbidden from playing \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The Messiah\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 this year? Should corporations similarly worry that they shouldn't be making donations that would be used to promote cultural celebrations of religious themes, in fear they will antagonize nonbelievers or those of different religious faiths? Some people, no doubt, would answer yes to all these questions. But imagine life in such a society. Instead of a nation that celebrates religious freedom, we would become Taliban-like, banning all expressions of religion in the public square. Surely common sense should prevail here. The First Amendment, of course, guarantees freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. The Supreme Court bears much of the fault for taking us down this path over the last several decades. We have become such a litigious society that anyone who feels slighted in any way rushes to court to settle his grievances. Thankfully, Sea-Tac came to its senses and put back the 14 trees it unwisely took down. And Rabbi Elazar Bogomilsky withdrew his threat to sue, opting, wisely, to work with the airport to get the Menorah put up for next year's Hanukkah celebration. Wal-Mart still encourages its employees to wish everyone a Happy Holidays, but it fired a customer service representative who sent e-mails telling those who complained that Christmas has its roots in \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Siberian shamanism.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The United States may be increasingly religiously diverse, and we should be respectful of minority religions and of those who have no religious affiliations or beliefs. But those who do not share the religious views of the majority are not entitled to ban Christianity from the public square. If they succeed, what will happen next? Remember the Taliban blowing up the ancient Buddhas of Bamiyan? Will we see the anti-religion police roaming our museums and concert halls on some future crusade? This, not a few Christmas trees or even creches on public property, could become the true threat to the First Amendment. I could understand if this BS would have happened in countries claiming themselves as atheistic, like the late Soviet Union, or old East Germany or other East Block countries - and even there Christian holidays were celebrated because of tradition (though they were not free days, except Christmas Day). What happens there in the US is not only in opposite to their First Amendmend (freedom of religion), but also a heavy insult against the vast majority of the US-Americans, against their traditions, beliefs and feelings. Imagine the feelings of children singing their carols and being stopped by some of such over-zealous folk - what will they think of their beloved home-country? I can't understand that in \"God's Own Country\", in the \"Land Of The Free\" the performance of religion in public shall be forbidden. | 5358) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Carolers told to stop singing at ice rink ASSOCIATED PRESS December 15, 2006 Taking Christianity out of Christmas By Linda Chavez; a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"An Unlikely Conservative: The Transformation of an Ex-Liberal.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 December 15, 2006 I could understand this BS in countries claiming themselves as atheistic, like the late Soviet Union, or old East Germany - and even there Christian holidays were celebrated because of tradition (though they were not free days, except Christmas).

They are not as susceptible to depression or despair. They are generally happier and claim a higher level of satisfaction with their lives. That may be true in most cases, but based on my personal experiences, I disagree. I was brought up a Lutheran, believe(d) ( not saying I do or don't at this point ) in God, knew all the things that I was taught, and I have had to deal with depression ever since I was 12. Maybe a whole lot of people are happier. I just happen to not be one of them. That's sad. Well, when I finally realized that accepting the Bible was just adding the Divine to the lessons I was taught before, it took me over a year of struggle before I prayed the first time, that I may believe. Oh my, I felt so crazy to speak to a person I could't see - but only a few days later, there were some street preachers on the shopping mile in my home town, and I went there with the intention to argue with them - like \"only fools do believe etc\". But like being a puppet on a string, my mouth spoke words I haven't planned to speak: I said there, in front of about of a dozen people including those street preachers that the Bible is the Word of God. I think this was my first testimony given. And for me this was a sign that suddenly I really had faith. Since then I've been visiting service meetings and I found a church where I felt home. Having struggled myself through the Bible in '91, I was baptized 25 years of age on July 4 1993, choosing this date because of my fav movie \"Born on 4th of July\" - so for me it was \"Re-born on 4th of July\", and that really was what I felt: like being re-born... Since then, I really changed. I became more optimistic and - after my home country was destroyed by history to become a part of the united Germany, I got a new sense in live instead of mourning about the things lost... For me, this has nothing to do with naivity or foolishness. There is a Higher Power, and I call this Higher Power God, and I adore God, always trying to understand Him more. And I learned from the Bible and from historic books I read that Jesus was a real person, and really did wonders - so there is for me no reason to not believe in Him. | 5360) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This is a question I actually can answer.

The problem with leaving out the divine is that children do not learn that they will need to account for their entire lives to someone who cannot be lied to, cannot be fooled, cannot be distracted. In my experience, this precept provides a powerful moderating influence on people for the same reason that children do not misbehave when an adult is present. The kids I knew who were not taught this lesson while growing up tended to get into trouble because they were able to rationalize and convince themselves that doing {whatever this wrong thing was} would be OK because nobody would ever find out. For kids, especially adolescent boys, the lesson seems to be \"I'ts OK if you don't get caught!\" not \"Don't do it bacause it's wrong!\" Oh boy you can't imagine, how often I have heard: \"Well, 'you shall not get caught!' is the Eleventh Commandment.\" I was glad that my grandparents were teaching me by example, and not by \"Do like I say and not like I do\" - may be that's why I have some views which can be seen as totally out-of-date for an atheist, but suitable for one who grew up in a Christian family... | 5361) |[Message 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: And another Russian fighter plane : it's a Su-47 look these strange wings :-) | 5362) |[Message by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This one a monstrosity?

Post: @Bill and NinjaD It's a pity that ethic guidelines are not taught to everybody in a systematic fashion. The point i was making was that our society is not geared towards ethics (it is easier to cheat/steal to get ahead in some societies where you are 'ranked' for want of a better word by the stuff you have collected) and that organised religion today is not sufficient to instil sound ethics. You are quite right about that. Religion alone has never been sufficient. These concepts need to be instilled in the home when the little skulls full of mush are first filling with knowledge of the world. Learning why you should be honest need not occur simultaneously with learning that you should be honest. That path is truly a school of hard knocks for most of us. This applies for other ethical concepts as well. Also, children should be able to observe adults applying ethical lessons on a day to day basis, most importantly the child's parents. Agreed. Parents get their ethics from somewhere and this would be their parents and possibly religion and other culturally acceptable norms (depending upon the type of society in which a person lives). If people start to abandon organised religion for agnosticism for example and time marches on a few generations, where will parents get their ethics? And what will be the ethical norm?

I mean, companies should have a responsibility against the country where they grew big in, so a closing down to move abroad IMHO is the same as traiting that country. I mean if I support someone enough to grow big I would have a natural interest that they remain in my territory, and be it by law. And - since I'm quite a opponent to globalism anyway, I think, each company should remain in their home-country, and either only export their products, or open subsidiaries in other countries but never should move there, traiting their home country. Well, for you were quoting my posting, I think I am supposed to put my view on this. I never read Dobbs or heared of him before, but I think he (and not that Angelo Mike) is right. Did you even read the article? Dobbs makes glaring errors, positing his opinion as economic reality. Here in Germany, unions are (though declining in their power) responsible for higher wages. There are tariffs for almost every profession (even though I wish there would be tariffs for management people too), and the government have industry and union come together to discuss the new tariffs every couple years. That's the good thing. Really? Can I work in Germany in a union shop without being part of the union? And to the point of CEOs making way too much - wasn't it Gerald Ford (that guy who produced the Thin Lizzy) who stated that the incomes of the management should be kind of limited? Where is a good reason that a CEO should earn some hundred times of a workers wages? That's not envy, but pointing out an unfairness. Work done should be paid equally. No matter what, no matter where - everyone who does the same work like another one should be paid as much as the other one. Once again, it's a principle. If it's OK for employees to bargain freely for the wages they earn, it's OK for all employees to bargain for the wages they earn. If it's OK for workers to do that, then it's OK for management personnel to do the same. In my opinion, tariffs are absolutely useful - and satisfied workers work better than dissatisfied ones, causing more turnover for the companies... Mentioning the \"confusing capitalism with mercantilism\" - I think there is not that much a difference: though capitalists want an unregulated market, regulating itself by the \"law of evolution\" (=social Darwinism) while a regulated market with strict rules (tariffs, price limits, etc) is much better for a fair competition, enabling also the entrepreneurs of small companies to remain. OK, maybe this was a bad idea. There are significant differences between mercantilism and capitalism. They aren't the same. But what I said was right: you have a problem with using gov't money to buy weapons and whatnot, but have no problem using gov't money to pay teachers. The principle is the same though: take money from people by way of force and spend that money on things they would never have spent it on. I think any government which is serving the needs of the vast majority of their citizens (and in 99,9% of all cases it's the workers and small business) instead of those few with the big money can be counted as a good government. Yes, this was a mistake. I often said, our (German) government should enforce that each company had to pay their workers according to the tariffs,and that there be tariffs for each single profession, even top-managers, to grant a minimum and maximum income for everyone. That they should change laws that no company could be allowed to close down and move abroad, that companies should pay taxes the same way like private persons, and that there have to be free education for every-one (and it could be paid if the companies and the rich ones were taxed fair). (emphasis added) This is insane. It doesn't even rise to the level of being wrong. | 5371) |[Message by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: This comment in another thread...

Lou Dobbs would probably agree with Ninjadwarf--gov't spending is OK as long as I agree with what they spend it on. But, since of course people disagree what to spend the stealin's on, sometimes you get newgen nukes, and sometimes you get teacher salaries. Hey, if people just kept what they earned, to spend as they wish, do you think more of them would choose to spend it on teachers? Or do you think they would choose to spend it on newgen nukes? Lou Dobbs Thinks You're a Fool By Angelo Mike Lou Dobbs has made himself a crusader for the middle class on his CNN show. He's just written a book, War on the Middle Class, in which he describes government, corporate, and special interest groups which have unofficially declared war on the middle class and told working people where to go. I, for one, am totally stunned at his book and his claims. In it, Dobbs manages to say that he supports American individualism, individual rights, capitalism, free markets, and a good work ethic, but that these must be upheld by policies of price and wage controls, corporate taxes, subsidies, government control of education, protectionist tariffs and trade agreements, and mass democracy. ... This Marxist delusion \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac that the state is the great enabler of capitalism \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac is the dominant theme on his show and in his book. It makes a review like this so difficult because I have to agree with him nominally on many points, disagree with the diagnosis of what causal forces are at work and his antiquated, mercantilist solutions, and then properly explain what forces and institutions should be removed to bring about true capitalism and prosperity. So I'm bewildered as to where to start with Dobbs. He goes back and forth throughout the book, confusing capitalism with mercantilism, blaming mercantilism for bad policies that he calls capitalism, and blaming free trade for the consequences of protectionist policies \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6 and then there's his actual understanding of politics itself. I hesitate to say what his understanding of economics is because there isn't any economics in War on the Middle Class. There's a lot of talk about how this nation was founded on a principle of economic opportunity, but that's as close as Dobbs comes. Dobbs begins: America has become a society owned by corporations and a political system dominated by corporate and special interests, and directed by elites who are hostile \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac or at best indifferent \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac to the interests of working men and women of the middle class and their families. Corporate America holds dominion over the Republican and Democratic parties through campaign contributions (who else will?), armies of lobbyists that have swamped Washington, and control of political and economic think tanks and media. ... Dobbs complains in his chapter, Class Warfare, about how entrepreneurs and CEOs make way too much. He never explains why these profits are too much, except as a disparity between CEO income and what people like me make. In saying that they make too much, he also says that mobility up the economic ladder has declined, while at the same time, CEOs are becoming richer by running their businesses better. But, that this is done at our expense. Somehow. He never explains how they do that. He merely gives statistics on corporate wages, profits, and job cuts, and expects us to join him in his economically repudiated theories of exploitation of the workers. Little does Dobbs know that the savings and profits of entrepreneurs are what enable the very existence of wage earners because entrepreneurs give current goods (wages) in the expectations of future goods (profits). Along the same lines, Dobbs complains that labor unions are ineffective and are threatened with dissolution. Those unions, however, are vested interests who depend on government grants of privilege to be able to extort employers out of hiring non-union workers. Dobbs does recognize part of this problem (even if he won't properly diagnose it at the fundamental level) when, in chapter nine, he complains that teacher's unions insist that teachers be paid based on length of employment and not on merit. Only one system alone pays based on merit, or more precisely, marginal productivity, and that's unfettered capitalism, where all property is privately owned, and the government's role does not extend beyond the protection of private property. No government grants of privilege, no subsidies, no price or wage controls, and no tariffs. Employers compete for employees by bidding up wages and other work-related benefits, and employees compete for employers by acquiring skills, educating themselves, and offering competitive prices for their labor. This means an inexorable tendency towards paying employees the rate of their marginal revenue product \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac the returns they provide their employer for each additional unit of labor provided. Unions systematically disrupt this system by demanding privilege with the backing of police power. They demand from the government the power to forbid employers from hiring non-union workers to do the same work they may refuse to do at a lower rate \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac or at all if they're on strike. Union organizing doesn't raise wages. All it does is ban from working those marginal workers whose marginal productivity is less than that of the legal minimum. In the case of union regulations, it is banned from those fields in which they work, and those marginal prospective employees now go into other, lesser paying jobs, increasing the supply of labor in those fields they enter, further depressing wages and escalating the demand on government to do something and, in Dobbs's view, stop ignoring the problem. Again, when unions abuse this power, in Dobbs's view, that's bad. So why give them this monopoly-backed police power to force their will over the objections of anyone they like? Dobbs also has a further problem with credit card companies and other financial institutions trying to hold debtors to their claims. For instance, he blames the Bankruptcy and Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 for forcing people to pay their debts without protection of bankruptcy laws. This is particularly egregious because \"the leading cause of personal bankruptcy is the medical and health care costs incurred by catastrophic illness.\" This is all true, and I don't know the substance of the law he talks about. But bankruptcy laws themselves are yet another disordering of capitalism in which debtors are granted government protection against having to pay their debts. It nullifies valid contracts, and all the sympathetic circumstances in the world couldn't change the fact that it's just a way of enabling theft from creditors. But even by Dobbs's own measure, if unfortunate circumstances make it necessary for the law to discharge contracts and make it artificially more profitable to go into debt, isn't it important to look at the causal forces at work that determine why health care is so expensive in the first place? Dobbs does not make a single mention of how the government has induced the cost of medical care to be so high and for the quality to become increasingly more poor. Take the example of health insurance. In chapter ten, Dobbs complains, \"The United States is one of the only industrialized nations that doesn't provide health care to all its citizens, yet we still spend more on it than any other country. Right now, forty-six million people in this country do not have health insurance\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6.\" . . . . One can imagine such a thing as free-market populism. But populism in the hands of Dobbs has yielded a case for all-around economic regimentation and growing impoverishment, which will not stop the war on the middle class but rather decide it in favor of the state. Well, for you were quoting my posting, I think I am supposed to put my view on this. I never read Dobbs or heared of him before, but I think he (and not that Angelo Mike) is right. Here in Germany, unions are (though declining in their power) responsible for higher wages. There are tariffs for almost every profession (even though I wish there would be tariffs for management people too), and the government have industry and union come together to discuss the new tariffs every couple years. That's the good thing. And to the point of CEOs making way too much - wasn't it Gerald Ford (that guy who produced the Thin Lizzy) who stated that the incomes of the management should be kind of limited? Where is a good reason that a CEO should earn some hundred times of a workers wages? That's not envy, but pointing out an unfairness. Work done should be paid equally. No matter what, no matter where - everyone who does the same work like another one should be paid as much as the other one. In my opinion, tariffs are absolutely useful - and satisfied workers work better than dissatisfied ones, causing more turnover for the companies... Mentioning the \"confusing capitalism with mercantilism\" - I think there is not that much a difference: though capitalists want an unregulated market, regulating itself by the \"law of evolution\" (=social Darwinism) while a regulated market with strict rules (tariffs, price limits, etc) is much better for a fair competition, enabling also the entrepreneurs of small companies to remain. I think any government which is serving the needs of the vast majority of their citizens (and in 99,9% of all cases it's the workers and small business) instead of those few with the big money can be counted as a good government. I often said, our (German) government should enforce that each company had to pay their workers according to the tariffs,and that there be tariffs for each single profession, even top-managers, to grant a minimum and maximum income for everyone. That they should change laws that no company could be allowed to close down and move abroad, that companies should pay taxes the same way like private persons, and that there have to be free education and health-care for every-one (and it could be paid if the companies and the rich ones were taxed fair). | 5372) was ist [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: You're right, BillHyland. To remark this seems to be ungrateful. But unfortunately the US government is known to spend much more money for killing people than for their charity: $410 billion alone were spent for the DoD in 2006, and $439.3 billion are planned for 2007 according to the [official US budget](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/pdf/07msr.pdf) \"each B-2 bomber costs approximately $2.2 billion, while each F-117 fighter costs approximately $45 million; the U.S. fields 21 B-2s and 54 F-117s.\" (source: [answers.com](http://www.answers.com/topic/stealth-technology)) Or that [F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program](http://www.defensetech.org/archives/002373.html) which is about to cost $256 billion! How much help would be able to give with this amount of money being spent for an IMHO totally unneeded thing. The Iraq War has cost approximately 350 billion dollars until now - for that money they could have provided almost 17 million students four-year scholarships at public universities, or could have hired about 7 million additional teachers! Or have could have provided medical help or re-building in a lot of places and ways. So when you see this (and everyone in the world can see this, at least by searching the internet), is it still so ungrateful to say \"Hey there is so much money you're throwing away, so why do you spend only a small part of it for good reasons?

In 2005 the US government foreign aid was more than $18 billion and the US private sector foreign aid exceeded $62 billion. This figure has already been topped in the year to date figures for 2006, without considering the enhanced private sector givin that occurs during the Christmas season. The next closest country, Japan, gave less than half of that total. Do not attempt to tell me that the US has not shown strength on \"welfare or other levels\". I know about the private sector foreign aid (like CARE etc.) But wouldn't it been better if the US government were known as a peaceful one than as a war government? I mean there were only a few Presidents who had no war during their time of duty. Mostly to \"protect democracy\" what ever it was in the view of the actual President, to be the \"world's sheriff\" - and this is why the other countries refuse to join in. IMHO the States are too much relying on their own strength no matter what others are saying. The citizens themselves are much more aware of the real needs of the poor than the government, so there are much more spendings by the private than by the government. And - those 18 billion $ of government aid - how much is it compared to the costs for military purposes? 10%? 5%? Less? To look only on the total amount does not say a thing if you don't compare it with other factors. Japan for example has much less inhabitants than the US, so this total sum is naturally less. But seeing it in comparison to the number of citizens (or to the GNP) could this \"less than half of that total\" be probably even more than the USA had spent.

SAMUELSON NEWSWEEK December 13, 2006 With hindsight, we may see 2006 as the end of Pax Americana. Ever since World War II, the United States has used its military and economic superiority to promote a stable world order that has, on the whole, kept the peace and spread prosperity. But the United States increasingly lacks both the power and the will to play this role. It isn't just Iraq, though Iraq has been profoundly destabilizing and demoralizing. Many other factors erode U.S. power: China's rise; probable nuclear proliferation; shrinking support for open trade; higher spending for Social Security and Medicare that squeezes the military; the weakness of traditional U.S. allies, Europe and Japan. By objective measures, Pax Americana's legacy is enormous. Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no nuclear device has been used in anger. In World War II, an estimated 60 million people died. Only three subsequent conflicts have had more than a million deaths (Vietnam, 1.9 million; Korea, 1.3 million; and China's civil war, 1.2 million). Under the U.S. military umbrella, democracy flourished in Western Europe and Japan. It later spread to South Korea, Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Prosperity has been unprecedented. Historian Angus Maddison tells us that from 1950 to 1998 the world economy expanded by a factor of six. Global trade increased 20 times. These growth rates were well beyond historic experience. Living standards exploded. Since 1950, average incomes have multiplied about 16 times in South Korea, 11 times in Japan and six times in Spain, reports Maddison. From higher bases, the increases were nearly five times in Germany and three in the United States. It is fatuous to think all this would have occurred spontaneously. Since the Marshall Plan, the United States has been a stabilizing influence \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac albeit with lapses (the Vietnam War, the 1970s inflation, now Iraq). Aside from security, it provided a global currency, the dollar. It championed lower tariffs and global investment, which transferred technology and management skills around the world. It kept its markets open. To Americans, the lesson of World War II was that, to prevent a repetition, the United States had to promote global stability. It had to accept short-term costs and burdens to avoid larger long-term costs and burdens. But the triumphalism following the Cold War fed overconfidence. Pax Americana would continue forever. It was \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"the end of history\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac democracy and free markets would spread. The United States was a \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"hyperpower.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The flaw in all this theorizing was to mistake strength for power. Statistically, the United States remains the world's strongest nation. Its economy is the wealthiest, triple the size of Japan's. Its all-volunteer military is the best trained and most technologically advanced. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"No other state is building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, stealth fighters or unmanned aerial vehicles,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 writes Max Boot, author of \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"War Made New.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The trouble is that strength \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac measurable and impressive \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac does not translate directly into power. Power is the ability to get others to do what you want. Here, America is weaker. Iraq has reminded us that religious and ethnic loyalties dim the appeal of democracy and freedom. Militarily, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"asymmetrical threats\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 often neutralize conventional advantages, as Boot notes. Iraq has confirmed that, too. If Iran and North Korea become permanent nuclear powers, the U.S. military edge would decline further. Any action against either country would be tempered by the possibility of a nuclear exchange. Worse, other regional powers (Japan, South Korea, Egypt, Saudi Arabia) may decide to go nuclear to have deterrence. A black market in atomic technology would almost inevitably follow \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac increasing the odds of terrorists' acquiring a bomb. The end of the Cold War probably reduced, not increased, American power. Without the Soviet threat, Europe and Japan felt less reason to follow U.S. leadership. China's emergence is altering the world balance. In spirit, its economic policies are mercantilist. It subsidizes its exports with an artificially low exchange rate; it is seeking captive oil supplies. China's policies are for China, not a stable world order. America won't retire from the world stage, but how active it will be is unclear. Iraq has reduced national confidence and credibility. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid spending are already twice defense spending. Generational attitudes are shifting. A poll of 18-to 24-year-olds finds that 72 percent don't think the United States should take the lead in solving global crises, reports Paul Starobin in National Journal. Given the rampant anti-Americanism abroad today, the fading of Pax Americana may inspire much glee. The United States is widely regarded as an arrogant source of instability, blamed for many global woes \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac from greenhouse gases to Islamic militancy to unpopular globalization. No one can know what will replace Pax Americana, but with time, the people who now celebrate its decline may conclude that its failures were mainly those of good intentions and that its successes were unwisely taken for granted. Here I only can say, having good intentions doesn't automatically mean making good decisions. Most failures in every day live and in politics came from good intentions instead of good decisions or good deeds. In the example of USA, the main failure is to show their strength mainly on a military level rather than on welfare or other levels. So it's clear that their power will decline because most of the other countries are absolutely fed of with military. | 5380) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: It is an archaic invention of ancient societies to explain the natural world which was unexplainable and to control populations through fear of retribution...it was about power over people, nothing more or less.. Now, here's something amazing! Statements such as this can be traced back to similar statements like those made by Karl Marx, at the least. Now, not discounting that there was some validity to such statements from Marx, why is it that the statement is repeated so much in what appears to be an uncritical fashion? Sounds like more of the same ... DOGMA! Why is it that even those interested in science or are in fact scientists swallow a simple story as easily as others? Why is it you are not looking for a complete picture of understanding? Case in point: the medulla oblongata. We have it as a result of evolution. If memory serves me correctly, it is a/the center for aggression in the brain. The aggressive tendencies we carry within us as a result of evolution could explain as much or more of the problems in the world that others blame on religion. Furthermore, the medulla oblongata has been around a lot longer than religious/spiritual feelings/thought. Sorry, folks, but your observations/statements/rehash of the ideas of others does not completely describe the phenomena. You make these statements about religious people as if it covers all of them. So many of them are so easy to tear apart and I have done that for some of them in another thread. So, if your statements do not cover the whole picture, it's time to perform more observations and develop a theory that fits the whole, complex, situation much better. I can't agree more. Though that evolution thing - there are too many missing links, and too many former \"proven facts\" which had to be revised, that I'd like to look forward to a better theory, fitting to the facts known nowadays... --- But there have non-explainable things happened: in medicine (what they called a \"spontaneous self-healing\" or something like that, or when people who worked OK until they died appeared to have had only a small part of a brain when they were autopsied) or that entire PSI stuff, which has even been experimented with until during the \"Cold War\" (proven), or some other things in physics: that \"ball lightning\" (is it the right word for it?) which is able to go through glass but to destroy walls and doors, and mostly rolls around humans and animals without harming them... The scientists could create normal lightnings, but AFAIK no-one could create a ball lightning yet, there are even some scientists who deny their entire existence, accusing everybody who experienced them to be a liar or to have had hallucinations or something. Telling explanations don't necessarily have to do with the ability to really explain things. Sometimes they've been only puzzling a theory around existing facts and called this a scientific explanation - well, until the theory came out to be full of mistakes and was replaced by an other one. Isn't science sometimes just another kind of religion nowadays? There is dogmatic thinking in each scientific branch, and each one who follows one theory arguments against those who follow another theory, despite both being scientific based theorys... IMO there is as much bias and fundamentalism in science as there is in religion, so only the way of explaining things is a different one. While religion admits, that a thing or situation can't be explained (and claims that God may reveal it once on a whim), scientists research to find a momentarily working theory why this thing can be like it is, and even dare to say it can't be like that, because it's impossible by the known Laws of Nature (physical, chemical, whatever). But who can claim that the Laws of nature (no matter what science) which we know now are the only ones? That there may be other ones which allow those \"impossible things\" to work? Only because something is entirely improbable it doesn't have to be absolutely impossible. | 5381) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe Dec 2006 by [thorin Post: ... you start to need two different glasses: one for reading and TV and one for everything else. | 5382) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I have a question: Is it a myth, or is it real, that B.

A study at Los Alamos National Laboratory has found that honeybees can be trained to detect explosives, even in tiny quantities. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"These bees really perform,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 said bee biologist Timothy Haarmann, the study's leader. Whether honeybees will ever be enlisted in the war on terror looks doubtful at this point. In thousands of trials conducted over the past 18 months at the nuclear weapons lab, bees stuck out their tongues when they smelled explosives. The bees even underwent field trials, successfully sniffing out explosives in a simulated roadside bomb, in a vehicle, and on a person rigged like a suicide bomber. The insects have a phenomenal sense of smell, rivaling that of dogs, Haarmann said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"The beauty of the bee is that when it has a sugar water reward, it sticks out its proboscis,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 the scientist said. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It's not a little tiny tongue. It's bigger than the antennae.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 The study was funded by a grant of about $1.5 million from the Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which studies innovative and sometimes positively strange technology that could yield national security benefits. Despite the positive test results, DARPA said it does not see a future for bomb-detecting bees in the military. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"Bees are not reliable enough for military tactical use at this point,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 the agency said in a statement last week. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We see no clear pathway to make them reliable enough to make it worth risking the lives of our service men and women.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 In a follow-up interview, DARPA spokeswoman Jan Walker said: \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"We're done in this research area. We don't plan any further investment.\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 However, Haarmann said that does not preclude another federal agency, or a private company, from refining the technology and developing other uses for bomb-sniffing bees \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac at airports, for example, or at the nation's borders. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c5\"It's not far off in the future, if somebody decides to do it,\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00c2 he said. The researchers found that ordinary honeybees can readily be trained by being exposed to the odor of an explosive, then given sugar water as a reward. After a few times, the bee, anticipating the sugar water, will stick out its tongue at the smell of the explosive. Haarmann said the study showed that trained bees can detect explosives in a parts-per-trillion concentration, even when masked by other odors. While that is similar to what dogs can do, Haarmann said, there are situations in which using bees might be preferable. The bee box, he suggested, could be held by a robotic device right next to a suspected bomb while the operator watched the laptop from a safe distance. Next time they will remember Biblical strategies and throw bee-hives among their opponents to confuse them! What a strange idea! Why don't they simply research to find an electronic (whatever) gadget to find out those explosives? Even to make them unexplodable, unusalbe? Are they afraid, so-called \"enemies\" would use the same gadgets then, too, to make the own weapons unusable? Geese I so wish it would be, that from one moment to the next all weapons would become unusable - and all soldiers were only able to self-defense anymore. | 5384) |[Message Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: It never ceases to amaze me what kinds of ideas some people are capable of coming up with.

Just as it is not the requirement in science, those that claim such and such, must be able to provide proof of such and such. I don't know about that. Yes, if someone is trying to ram religion down your throat, you're entitled to ask for proof. But nobody who quietly and unobtrusively believes in one God or another has to answer to anybody. You want them to change their minds, you prove you're right. There is also the notion that no one has to prove anything to any one. We are all born with what we need to know right there in our heads. That's true. But during time you learn to accept some things, to deny others; to believe one idea, to mistrust another one. And sometimes, when you're adult, you finally are rationally enough to accept no \"childish\" belief anymore, but only reasonable facts, facts, facts. And sure there is then the need to prove the one view or the other to justify the \"adult reason\", and why this other view is \"childish\" and not to be taken seriously.

I believe that people will believe in anything that lets them off the hook for their own actions. This may hold some truth, but there are some Christians that do not believe they're going to heaven is guaranteed. That sounds to me like a true searcher. Does that me a non believer, no. Does it make me a believer, no. It simply means that until my problem can be reconcilled, I do not believe in any God as he/she/it is now portrayed. I think we're at a similar point on this one. I learned, that - according to both scriptures (Bible and Koran) both, the \"Christian\" God, and Allah, are the same. It's only the intolerance of the peculiar teachers who let the believers think that there is a difference. The Catholics say there is the one and only true god, so do the Muslims. Both say that the other faiths god is not their god. Perhaps later I will add some insight to this, from my Christian upbringing and what I have learned from my Muslim colleagues. Not enough time to type it all out right now. Problem is BOTH religions say if you do not believe and convert to THEIR god, you will go to hell! Okay so now we the tribal dude in South America, Africa, Antartica, wherever, he has never heard of either religion. Where does he go? Does either Religions God deal with this, no! They both say he must convert or he goes to Hell. So both gods are sending people to hell, supposedly a very bad place that noone want to go to, because this dude never even heard of their god. BUT he has his own God, and it is neither of the other two peoples Gods!That#s not according to their scriptures, only human \"tradition in faith\" (was that the right word?) Dante tried to deal with this conundrum in \"The Inferno.\" Of course, it may have been speculation or he may have referred to earlier books that did not get \"canonized\" (?) into the Bible we know.That's right. He used some \"Apocryphic Scriptures\"s for it, which actually easily could have read by everybody who could read and was interested at this time. It was one of the first Vatican Councils which threw out some of the books (of the first Latin translation Septuaginta, by the way) to assemble the Bible we know now. The Apocryphes were meant to kept hidden, but thee always remained copies at those who were not willing to give them away to the Popes and their Inquisition organizations. | 5466) 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: How can you know whether or not there is a god, even a false one? A false one ? Now there is an idea - how do I know there is a false god - that much is a given truth. There are many false gods, at least this much we can agree on. @Mickey - I agree with you, on some points, however, if there is a hell, then there must be a heaven, and this would seem to say there is a god. therefore, the theory of heaven or hell is as silly to talk about as is the theory of god. Most religions teach of something along the lines of a heaven or hell. This is the power that the creators of relgions want you to believe, nothing more. They teach do this or that and you will go to heaven, don't do this or that and you will go to hell. What is wrong with common sense ? What is wrong with morality without religion? Was it not the Catholic religion that murdered thousands and thousands in the name of god ? Has not most if not all religions done the same at one time or another ? This idea of \"we are better than you because we have the true religion\" is bunk. what is wrong with living a good life just because you are a good person, why do we have to live a good life to get some reward in heaven ? How selfish is that? I thought we were suppose to do good because we wanted too, not because we are going to get a reward in heaven. Most religions believe and teach this - why ? Power. Religion has power over those that blindly follow. They teach your reward is in heaven, to hell with that!- I want my reward now! When I was looking into the several churches, searching one fitting to my own belief, there were some who said: No-one really would come to hell, except those who first had all the knowledge about, and all their blessings etc. - and then would turn away and tell everyone this belief/church etc were a fraud. All other souls would have a kind of \"imprisonment\", or a lesser stage of heaven. Sure, you can live a good life without religion, just being a good person. But (having myself been grown up as an atheist) if you have a look into the religions, you'll see that all the virtues, all those \"rules\" probing you to be a good person have their roots in religion (mostly the 10 Commandments). You can deny it as much as you want: the Bible is a part of our entire culture: even that much that some quotes from it have become sayings in our every day vocabulary. I also can't go along with this Black-or-white teaching of some churches, and I judged the religions on how close they were to their own teachings (i.e. their scriptures) and there were many, where some points simply didn't fit. Especially within the Christian churches. Simplest example: compare the Catholic church to the Bible, and try to find in the Bible something about a pope or celibacy or studied full-time theologists ... Otherwise - I must agree you - there is many \"If you don't agree us 110% you are against us\" within the churches. While Jesus (who actually was a real historical person, you can read about him at several Roman chronists, I only don't remember their names) said: \"let them do, those who aren't against us, are for us\" and preached to love the neighbor as much as yourself... | 5467) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Ten Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36154) ( [Message 479651](forum_thread.php?id=36154&postid=479651)) Posted 11 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: 1400 people have watched me win!

A true religion ? You have to be joking! Religion is man made, made up by those that wanted or needed control of others and political gain, and a million other crazy reasons, none of them true than any other, all are equally false. And let me add, only a fool would pray to a false god. How can you know whether or not there is a god, even a false one? It's impossible to prove that there is any god, but it is equally impossible to prove that there is none. So, even if there is the slightiest chance of 0.0000.....0001% probability that there might be a power which could be called god, so why should anyone who takes that probability as a fact be a fool? I mean, let's be serious: how little is the probability for our telescopes to find intelligent extraterrestrial life, and nonetheless all of us believe in finding this. Are we fools?

Only those who realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of life, can issue. What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and what a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labor in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics! Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who, surrounded by a skeptical world, have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures.

Well. In my conviction, a true religion is any religion which teaches that \"truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come\", and encourages their members to \"bring up your children in light and truth\" and to \"seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.\". What else do you study in all material sciences than \"things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come\"? And, as I said in the [other thread](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=32479&nowrap=true#468991), that - defining faith biblically: \"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\"(Hebrews 11:1, KJV) - each one starting a task has faith because they can't see the results yet, but are convinced that the results hoped for will come. None of us has seen any evidences yet that there is intelligent life out there, but we are hoping it, and go on searching. That's faith - may the atheists deny as much as they want. | 5594) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 477999](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=477999)) Posted 10 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: HAve a fine Advent Sunday, the both of you :o) | 5595) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 477996](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=477996)) Posted 10 Dec 2006 by [thorin - and boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 477846](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=477846)) Posted 10 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I win!

Then just ignore those people if you feel annoyed by them. Nobody is forced to believe in God, or even to listen to the testimonies of those who decided to follow Christ - or admit every other religion. Hey, Oprah is a show on TV, and where it is broadcasted that's not the only available channel, is it? So just switch to another channel if you don't want to hear that. You know what? I think there is something missing about you. Something important: tolerance. Your postings give me the impression of a hardliner, almost more fanatic than muslimic Imams. Of course I try to destroy religion. It's a scourge on humanity. Like I have said before, I don't mind if people want to harm themselves with it. The problem is they never ever keep it to themselves. They go out, spreading the message, spreading the word. Just look at Oprah lately. It's all 'god' this, and 'god' that. As a former atheist, I can only say that religion can stand critical thinking. Especially when you (as I did) not only read the bible and see only one church, but read also critical sources and compare the different beliefs and churches to each other and to your actual conviction. Before I decided which church I joined, I informed myself about all churches available and compared them to my own view. So I know that you can't lump all religions together - not even the Christian churches. Those of you who believe need to see if your religion can stand up when you throw critical thinking at it. Of course it can't. But somehow; science DOES withstand critical questionning. Why? BECAUSE THERE'S NO ELEMENT OF BELIEF TO IT!!!! Sure there is. Especially when there are new theories, or theories which are explaining things otherwise than the etablished ones. Even for atheist scientists, it's a matter of belief - a matter which theory they believe in, because almost for all matters there are several theories and theses and axioms, and several matters can be proved differently due to the theory you use. (For example the particle/wave - discussion about photons, or Schroedinger's theorem) Some theories even can't be proven by now and remain a theory but are used like a proven evidence, and entire sub-sciences are built upon them - so where is there no belief in science? | 5618) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 477434](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=477434)) Posted 9 Dec 2006 [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 477008](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=477008)) Posted 9 Dec 2006 by [thorin bye THE TRUE AI WINS AGAIN . . .

Which one is more able to save lifes? This is the big point so many ppl miss. Terrorism arises from dissatisfaction with conditions. Spending a fraction of a military budget on some real improvements for ppl reduces the dissatisfaction. Following from this, there will be less for the terrorist to fight about. [/edit] This doesn't explain the rise of 'home-grown' Al-Qaeda terrorists in the UK where they come from good backgrounds and have a good standard of life. The fanatasism of religion is still there 'to destroy the west' no matter what their conditions are. Oh, but it DOES explain it. It only takes one poisonous mind to spread hate, fear and loathing. What such people need, however, is examples to show their \"cause\" to be \"just\". Having a powerful military is part of their excuse, if you see what I mean. The worst part of the whole situation is that each generation passes on it's hatreds to the next. After the second generation, the hatred becomes almost traditional. It takes tremendous courage to break the cycle. War does nothing to break the cycle. I agree. Even in countries where terrible wars have ended slavery, some dumb minds still talk as if the law hadn't forbidden this since then. Simply because it became a tradition to have slaves, and to look down on them as a lesser kind of human. And in countries where there were silent antipathies against some parts of the neighborhood, it became a genocide and no-one could tell the reason except that some leader had ordered it, or why they were so eager to obey... | 5679) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 476139](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=476139)) Posted 8 Dec 2006 227 Post: What're we talking about? Well... Can somebody believe in God and be a good scientist at the same time, or is that antagonistic? Is Religion (I mean generally believing in a Higher Power) \"Opium for the people\" like Lenin said a hundred years ago? \"Religion is one of the forms of spiritual oppression which everywhere weighs down heavily upon the masses of the people, over burdened by their perpetual work for others, by want and isolation. Impotence of the exploited classes in their struggle against the exploiters just as inevitably gives rise to the belief in a better life after death as impotence of the savage in his battle with nature gives rise to belief in gods, devils, miracles, and the like. Those who toil and live in want all their lives are taught by religion to be submissive and patient while here on earth, and to take comfort in the hope of a heavenly reward. But those who live by the labour of others are taught by religion to practise charity while on earth, thus offering them a very cheap way of justifying their entire existence as exploiters and selling them at a moderate price tickets to well-being in heaven. Religion is opium for the people. Religion is a sort of spiritual booze, in which the slaves of capital drown their human image, their demand for a life more or less worthy of man.\" Or is Faith just \"the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" as the Bible says, and which can even be interpreted for atheists starting a certain task? | 5681) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 476107](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=476107)) Posted 8 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Right.

That's why you don't know the difference between a concentration camp where POW's are starved to death then buried in mass graves and American prisons where terrorists are sitting on their butt reading the Koran and gaining weight. Putting aside that I didn't mention American prisons explicitely, (there are enough \"free\" countries using such camps) - the facts I have about WW2 and Buchenwald are not biased. They are from German History school books, and from what I saw myself at the memorial place [Buchenwald](http://www.buchenwald.de/index_cten.html) when I've been there visiting this place. And the [list of 9/11 victims](http://www.september11victims.com/september11victims/victims_list.htm) is also not biased, it's just a list of all victims who were officially confirmed. If you had klicked on the links you could have admitted it. As to Auschwitz, Wikipedia remarks that Nazi Rudolf H\u00c3\u00c2\u00b6\u00c3\u00c5\u00b8 said that between 2.5 and 3 million had been killed, while Adolf Eichmann gave a figure of 2 million. Most authorities seem to agree that between 1.1 and 1.4 million people identified as Jews were killed, with 140,000-150,000 Polish victims, along with 23,000 Roma & Sinti (Gypsies). Apparently, thousands of homosexuals were also killed at Auschwitz, but those deaths were not recorded. Unfortunately, all of these data, and even the knowledge of concentration camps came out after April 1945 when the Allies were rolling over Germany. Before that there only were suspicions, conspiration theories if you want, and only told about secretly among the lefties. During WW2 there was a sub-camp of Buchenwald in my home-town, and the prisoners wre working in the local munition plant. Every-one of the citizens believed until the arrival of the Allies that Buchenwald simply was a prison for POWs... They only thought the Gestapo and SS were there just to prevent espionage or sabotage. Later they had to learn that they also prevented the prisoners to tell the truth about the parent camp. | 5704) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 475972](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=475972)) Posted 8 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: what is more down to earth then a tiny weird looking ninja Nothing. except probably a chihuahua pretending to be a bad bad wolf if you spot one let me know..

That's why you don't know the difference between a concentration camp where POW's are starved to death then buried in mass graves and American prisons where terrorists are sitting on their butt reading the Koran and gaining weight. Putting aside that I didn't mention American prisons explicitely, (there are enough \"free\" countries using such camps) - the facts I have about WW2 and Buchenwald are not biased. They are from German History school books, and from what I saw myself at the memorial place [Buchenwald](http://www.buchenwald.de/index_cten.html) when I've been there visiting this place. And the [list of 9/11 victims](http://www.september11victims.com/september11victims/victims_list.htm) is also not biased, it's just a list of all victims who were officially confirmed.

In other words, you can pretend like everything was ok and that you were equally harmed, those of us who live outside of your fantasy land know better. I don't trivialize. I just put the points right, according to the facts I have. You said no German citizens were killed in the concentration camps and gas chambers, I can prove the opposite. Though there were Jews and war prisoners killed who were from other - occupied - countries, that's all too true - but the majority of the people killed in Buchenwald (for example) were Jews and communists from inside the boundaries of Germany. I can't tell much about Auschwitz and Majdanek (both in nowaday's Poland) but as far as I know these camps were for those from the occupied areas. As far as I know, a German Jew is also a Jew, and when you have only the number of killed Jews in total, you can't tell where they came from. But in Buchenwald I saw the huge list, longer than this from 9/11 (No I'm not trivializing it!) and there was each killed person with name, and reason of imprisonment (be it Jew, communist, political reasons, Jehovas Witnesses, gay...), and their date and kind of death... A Genocide is a Genocide no matter where the victims do actually come from. In my opinion, it's been (and is) a crime to invade and occupy the countries around, it's been (and is) a crime to harm and to kill civilists during a war, and it's been (and is) a crime to harm and to kill the \"own\" civilists only because of their belief or \"race\". There's no trivializing about that. You implied no German were killed on 9/11 - there were some. It's true, the vast majority of the victims of 9/11 were US citizens, but not all. This doesn't trivialize anything, nor did I want to point it out like \"me too, me too!\" I only looked up on the list and saw that you weren't right. Nothing else. I didn't know yet that you can't stand an objective critic. I never pointed we were equally harmed. Nor that everything was okay. But as long as there are camps almost compareable to concentration camps (okay just without the medical tests and the gas chambers) where prisoners of war are held in confinement without a fair process before, the countries having such camps can't be called fair and democratic by me. | 5727) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 475784](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=475784)) Posted 7 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Crack........crack.......crack........crack.....hm....time to wake up for a win me thinks.

No, you don't know. With welfare system some people will defraud it. So what do you do? Take a way the welfare system? Defense is system that is necessary to keep the wolves at bay from devouring our babies. Take away our military and our babies get eaten. Is that what you want? The UK is currently paying \u00c3\u00c2\u00a32 million a day - TWO MILLION POUNDS A DAY - for it's involvement in Iraq. That is a lot of involvement. (Goodness knows how much the Americans are spending.) OK, so take it away, the 2milllon GBP of involvement a day, then what? What will happen to the world as 'they' overrun and head west? Good point. But: If the food for example - instead of been throwing away to stabilize the prizes - were given away to those in need, and if the money were given to the poor countries as an offer spending, instead of high rate credits they never can pay back while being honest, then they had no need to go west and attack the rich. In my opinion, each single person all over the world should have the same chances to survive and to get educated. So the rich ones should share their treasure with those who have (nearly) nothing, instead of bunkering their money on their bank accounts up to amounts they never could use themselves. If it needs a conspiracy to achieve this, I welcome it. BTW: To buy one single Eurofighter and have it fueled and armed costs the same amount as a little hospital including interior.

Wrong. Most of the Jews and \"Jehovas Witnesses\" and communists and homosexuals who died there have actually been citizens of Germany. During my school time I was visiting [Buchenwald](http://www.buchenwald.de/index_cten.html) near Weimar, once one of the bigger concentration camps, and now a memorial place - and there were lists of people who died there between 1937 and 1945. So if you are interested, you may convince yourself should you ever visit Germany. ...nor on 9/11 in New York City.There also have been half a dozen Germans (at least) killed on 9/11 according to the [official list](http://www.september11victims.com/september11victims/victims_list.htm), as well as some Brits, Mexicans, Canadians, and Chinese. Simply put, in your lifetime, your country has never been the victim of an unprovoked attack (you can thank the occupying troops anytime you please), therefore you don't see the need for taking preventative measures to ensure that it doesn't happen again.Well, because I was born in 1968 in East Germany, during my lifetime, the only unprovoked attacks (if any - even the ones before have never been officially proven) came by the other German country (the \"free\" one) and were more things like provoking border patrols, egging workers to become more disaffected , smuggling people out of the country, sabotage and espionage - just the usual secret service stuff... But - and this has been proven - there were plans made in the early 80's by the Bundeswehr using CIA data, to invade East Germany. | 5739) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Nine Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=36054) ( [Message 475653](forum_thread.php?id=36054&postid=475653)) Posted 7 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: \"Imagine there is a war, and nobody goes there\" - this (or similar) is said to be stated by John Lennon.

Swords to plow-shares: that's more important than everything else. note: the 'heat factor' will also set off any \"bombs\" that terrorists carry - so they can detonate any one of these clowns - in an area 'safe' without personnel or person's they don't want to hurt - simply put - detonate the terrorists Before they have a chance to harm others . . . SAY HELLO TO THE ' GOODBYE WEAPON ' By David Hambling The crowd is getting ugly. Soldiers roll up in a Hummer. Suddenly, the whole right half of your body is screaming in agony. You feel like you've been dipped in molten lava. You almost faint from shock and pain, but instead you stumble backwards -- and then start running. To your surprise, everyone else is running too. In a few seconds, the street is completely empty. You've just been hit with a new nonlethal weapon that has been certified for use in Iraq -- even though critics argue there may be unforeseen effects. According to documents obtained for Wired News under federal sunshine laws, the Air Force's Active Denial System, or ADS, has been certified safe after lengthy tests by military scientists in the lab and in war games. The ADS shoots a beam of millimeters waves, which are longer in wavelength than x-rays but shorter than microwaves -- 94 GHz (= 3 mm wavelength) compared to 2.45 GHz (= 12 cm wavelength) in a standard microwave oven. The longer waves are thought to limit the effects of the radiation. If used properly, ADS will produce no lasting adverse affects, the military argues. Documents acquired for Wired News using the Freedom of Information Act claim that most of the radiation (83 percent) is instantly absorbed by the top layer of the skin, heating it rapidly. The beam produces what experimenters call the \"Goodbye effect,\" or \"prompt and highly motivated escape behavior.\" In human tests, most subjects reached their pain threshold within 3 seconds, and none of the subjects could endure more than 5 seconds. \"It will repel you,\" one test subject said. \"If hit by the beam, you will move out of it -- reflexively and quickly. You for sure will not be eager to experience it again.\" But while subjects may feel like they have sustained serious burns, the documents claim effects are not long-lasting. At most, \"some volunteers who tolerate the heat may experience prolonged redness or even small blisters,\" the Air Force experiments concluded. The reports describe an elaborate series of investigations involving human subjects. The volunteers were military personnel: active, reserve or retired, who volunteered for the tests. They were unpaid, but the subjects would \"benefit from direct knowledge that an effective nonlethal weapon system could soon be in the inventory,\" said one report. The tests ranged from simple exposure in the laboratory to elaborate war games involving hundreds of participants. The military simulated crowd control situations, rescuing helicopter crews in a Black Hawk Down setting and urban assaults. More unusual tests involved alcohol, attack dogs and maze-like obstacle courses. In more than 10,000 exposures, there were six cases of blistering and one instance of second-degree burns in a laboratory accident, the documents claim. The ADS was developed in complete secrecy for 10 years at a cost of $40 million. Its existence was revealed in 2001 by news reports, but most details of ADS human testing remain classified. There has been no independent checking of the military's claims. The ADS technology is ready to deploy, and the Army requested ADS-armed Strykers for Iraq last year. But the military is well aware that any adverse publicity could finish the program, and it does not want to risk distressed victims wailing about evil new weapons on CNN. This may mean yet more rounds of testing for the ADS. New bombs can be rushed into service in a matter of weeks, but the process is more complex for nonlethal weapons. It may be years before the debates are resolved and the first directed-energy nonlethal weapon is used in action. The development of a truly safe and highly effective nonlethal crowd-control system could raise enormous ethical questions about the state's use of coercive force. If a method such as ADS leads to no lasting injury or harm, authorities may find easier justifications for employing them. Historically, one of the big problems with nonlethal weapons is that they can be misused. Rubber bullets are generally safe when fired at the torso, but head impacts can be dangerous, particularly at close range. Tasers can become dangerous if they are used on subjects who have previously been doused with flammable pepper spray. In the heat of the moment, soldiers or police can forget their safety training. Steve Wright of Praxis, the Center for the Study of Information and Technology in Peace, Conflict Resolution and Human Rights, notes that there are occasions when this has happened in the past. He cites British soldiers, who increased the weight of baton rounds in Northern Ireland. \"Soldiers flouted the rules of engagement, doctoring the bullets by inserting batteries (to increase the weight) and firing at closer ranges than allowed,\" says Wright. There may also be technical issues. Wright cites a recent report on CS gas sprays which turned out to be more dangerous in the field than expected. \"No one had bothered to check how the sprays actually performed in practice, and they yielded much more irritant than was calculated in the weapon specification. This underlines the need for independent checking of any manufacturers' specifications. Here secrecy is the enemy of safety.\" Eye damage is identified as the biggest concern, but the military claims this has been thoroughly studied. Lab testing found subjects reflexively blink or turn away within a quarter of a second of exposure, long before the sensitive cornea can be damaged. Tests on monkeys showed that corneal damage heals within 24 hours, the reports claim. \"A speculum was needed to hold the eyes open to produce this type of injury because even under anesthesia, the monkeys blinked, protecting the cornea,\" the report says. The risk of cancer is also often mentioned in connection with the ADS system, despite the shallow penetration of radiation into the skin. But the Air Force is adamant that after years of study, exposure to MMW has not been demonstrated to promote cancer. During some tests, subjects were exposed to 20 times the permitted dose under the relevant Air Force radiation standard. The Air Force claims the exposure was justified by demonstrating the safety of the ADS system. The beam penetrates clothing, but not stone or metal. Blocking it is harder than you might think. Wearing a tinfoil shirt is not enough -- you would have to be wrapped like a turkey to be completely protected. The experimenters found that even a small exposed area was enough to produce the Goodbye effect, so any gaps would negate protection. Holding up a sheet of metal won't work either, unless it covers your whole body and you can keep the tips of your fingers out of sight. Wet clothing might sound like a good defense, but tests showed that contact with damp cloth actually intensified the effects of the beam. System 1, the operational prototype, is mounted on a Hummer and produces a beam with a 2-meter diameter. Effective range is at least 500 meters, which is further than rubber bullets, tear gas or water cannons. The ammunition supply is effectively unlimited. The military's tests went beyond safety, exploring how well the ADS works in practice. In one war game, an assault team staged a mock raid on a building. The ADS was used to remove civilians from the battlefield, separating what the military calls \"tourists from terrorists.\" It was also used in a Black Hawk Down scenario, and maritime tests, which saw the ADS deployed against small boats. It might also be used on the battlefield. One war game deployed the ADS in support of an assault, suppressing incoming fire and obstructing a counterattack. \"ADS has the same compelling nonlethal effect on all targets, regardless of size, age and gender,\" says Capt. Jay Delarosa, spokesman for the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate, which decides where and how the ADS might be deployed. \"It can be used to deny an area to individuals or groups, to control access, to prevent an individual or individuals from carrying out an undesirable activity, and to delay or disrupt adversary activity.\" The precise results of the military's war games are classified, but Capt. Delarosa insists that the ADS has proven \"both safe and effective in all these roles.\" The ADS comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. As well as System 1, a smaller version has been fitted to a Stryker armored vehicle -- along with other lethal and nonlethal weapons -- for urban security operations. Sandia National Labs is looking at a small tripod-mounted version for defending nuclear installations, and there is even a portable ADS. And there are bigger versions too. \"Key technologies to enable this capability from an airborne platform -- such as a C-130 -- are being developed at several Air Force Research Laboratory technology directorates,\" says Diana Loree, program manager for the Airborne ADS. The airborne ADS would supplement the formidable firepower of Special Forces AC-130 gunships, which currently includes a 105-mm howitzer and 25-mm Gatling guns. The flying gunboats typically engage targets at a range of two miles or more, which implies an ADS far more powerful than System 1 has been developed. But details of the exact power levels, range and diameter of the beam are classified. | 5774) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Eight Closed!](forum_thread.php?id=35957) ( [Message 475171](forum_thread.php?id=35957&postid=475171)) Posted 6 Dec Whare's Robin (i 'eard Robin's NOW a 'Woman') Yes the operation was a success.. didn't quite mean iT thaT wey (snickr) LOSING YEP. . . .

[Here](http://metasearch.com/www2search.cgi?p=NOSKA9Q&l=20&s=o) you can find some infos. here is what that link says: We did not find results for: NOSKA9Q. Try the suggestions below or type a new query above. Sorry, i found it out when i checked the link, that it didn't work... \"KA9Q NOS was only the second known implementation of the Internet protocols for low-end computers; the first was MIT's PC/IP, which became the basis of the now-defunct company FTP Software, Inc. Unlike PC/IP, KA9Q NOS could simultaneously act as an Internet client, a server and an IP packet router, and it could handle multiple client and server sessions at once. KA9Q NOS attracted many contributors and became very widely used throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s in amateur packet radio and in various educational projects. In a way, it was the Linux of its day, although Linux is now a far larger and more ambitious project. KA9Q NOS became the basis for several low-end commercial dialup terminal servers and routers. It also influenced the development of the Internet protocols and certain implementations, including the Linux kernel. It was also incorporated in the imbedded software in Qualcomm CDMA cellular phones. When I originally conceived NOS, affordable personal computers lacked the hardware support (especially memory management and a \"protected\" mode) needed to run a \"real\" operating system such as UNIX. The so-called \"operating systems\" then available for personal computers (e.g., MS-DOS and Windows 3.1) lacked any native support for the Internet protocols, so this package filled a real need. But that was a different era. KA9Q NOS is now largely obsolete, and I have not maintained it since the mid 1990s when Linux took off. If you are looking simply to connect your PC to the Internet, I recommend just using the native Internet support in your operating system of choice. \" | 5924) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 472293](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=472293)) Posted 4 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hmm... everyone's losing.

Navy Secretary Donald Winter vetoed plans last week for a commissioning ceremony for the Makin Island in San Francisco, said retired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. J. Michael Myatt. Instead, San Diego will host the ceremony. Navy leaders were concerned about San Francisco's refusal to offer a home port for the retired battleship Iowa, which would be turned into a museum, as well as the school board's decision to abolish junior ROTC training at city high schools, Myatt said.

Unfortunately to be a member of a \"left-wing\" party doesn't automatically mean to actually think left-wing - so your observation, Richard, can be agreed - but only, because the former left Democrats indeed have moved much to the center within the last century -and most during McCarthy's regiment. You guys don't realize that Europe is a lot more socialistic than the USA. So when Ninjadwarf talks about conservatives, he could be talking about some of our moderate Democrats. This makes him think that most of the USA main stream news sources are center or even conservative. Just my observations! Europe is more social-democratic than the USA, but also more right-wing. Socialistic doesn't fit really. So, IMHO what is called liberal in Germany (i.e. FDP) can be compared with the Democrats and what's called conservative (i.e. CDU/CSU) can be compared with the Republicans. Means, the Social-Democratic Party (SPD), and the parties further left are not \"covered\" by any influent party in the States (that's why I said that the left-winged have no influence) - but the further right-winged parties (like the German \"Republicans\" or NPD, which gained up to 15 percent in some counties) also have (fortunately) no influence there. And I know that there are some extremely right-wing organizations over there. So when I talk about conservatives I mean the Republicans or those Democrats who can be confused as Republicans due to their talking. I lived in Germany from 1977 to 1991. You can't compare Germany conservatives directly with US conservatives. I know CDU/CSU are conservatives in Germany, but they compare more like moderate US Democrates in their views, because the whole political spectrum in the US is shifted to the right compared to the Germany. | 6057) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 471239](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=471239)) Posted 3 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: next time all your base are mine Oh you ice-cold Ice-Man, my dear... you have to catch and freeze me first before you can get my base before I'm nig-nagging yours.

As to his support of Mrs. Clinton, he must, at least, have leanings toward Commumist or collectivist politics because that is where she resides in her convictions.

The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handle bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him, and the shattered patio door. The wife ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the wife up righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas was spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet. The man was treated and released to come home. Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

Apparently people with 'sociopathic' tendencies have very little or no conscience, are apt to bully others and try to discredit everything they say. I just wondered because I have done a little bit of research on sociopathy, but I am not pretending any expertise. Just wondered if anyone had any other thoughts on that or whether they could improve on my knowledge. Well, as I mentioned before, I grew up as an atheist myself - and I was one until I began to belief in God in 1991. But I still remember (and often experience from family and some friends) how atheists are thinking. Most atheist come with the argument \"If there were such thing like a God, then there were no war and no injustice in the world, as well no heavy diseases. But because they are, there is no God, and everyone who believes in such an idea is a darned fool.\" That's a poor thinking in my opinion, but they refuse to accept other ideas. It's not necessarily sociopathic, but rather a holding tight on all personal disappointings - (like in one of those old movies, when a heavily disappointed father said \"you're not my son anymore, I have no son and never had one!!!\") Thinking about it right now methinks that there must be a kind of \"faith by nature\" in every human, but - like Stephen King mentioned, growing up a human is burdened more and more with disbelief - only those who kept at least a little bit of a child inside have the power to accept the idea of God. I myself was treated like non-existent for one entire year by my own mother after she saw the certificate of my baptism in '93. It was like I being a traitor. Especially, due to the fact that my younger brother died only 8 years before in a Christian hospital, and the nurse there tried to console her with \"God has taken your son to him...\" Now I was joining the same God who took her younger son away after letting him suffer cancer? So I actually was a traitor in her eyes. It took her a while to learn and accept that I remained (almost) the same old guy she knew as her son, just a bit less pessimistic, and not a drinker anymore... | 6083) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470986](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470986)) [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470977](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470977)) Posted 3 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: All your base is mine may be, but at the end, I win :> you cant win if all your base is mine Sure: You will be assimilated --> all the base you collected will be mine --> I win.

All that plus the better 15\" monitor, brought the price to $1300. I forgot to mention that we paid extra for Windows 3.1 instead of just DOS. But that was all so we could still be using it 15 years later. I think that lasted about 4 years. We had to upgrade to State of the Art with a 486DX2 WITH 16 MEG OF RAM! Eat your hearts out!

It is well established that the global temperature has gone up slightly over the last 150 years or so. What I am saying is that it has not been established that mankind has had any but a negligible effect on global temperatures or climate. Or that mankind can do anything about the natural changes that do occur. Another established fact is that the Earth has been, for most of the history of life on the planet, much warmer than it has been during the recorded history of mankind. At this point, given the state of research, I can only conclude that the proponents of \"Oh my God, man is KILLING the earth!\" global warming are crooks looking for money. Also, those who actually take the word of that group and want to force everyone elso to reverse the supposed effects on climate are in the position of Caligula commanding the tide to stay out. Just a small point, but it's not \"man is KILLING the earth\", but \"man is KILLING man\". Whatever man does to this planet, even if it causes the extinction of all life, it will leave earth orbiting the Sun, with plenty of time to heal and evolve more life, probably chicken-like with a little more intelligence than man ever had. Even if mankind should vanish, the true rulers of the world will survive: the insects (which btw have more different kinds of than each other animals together and still can survive under the most dangerous conditions)! | 6121) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470593](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470593)) Posted 2 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I think self-proclaimed winners are funny.

It's me who win! actually? 2006 [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: I have to agree with VYUZ San Diego writer Terri Trainor: \"The government accepting a gift to honor veterans, a gift that has a centerpiece representing the presiding symbol of the religion of most of those so honored merely indicates honor for one religion. It in no way dishonors other religions. Nor does it preclude other religions from so representing themselves and making similar gifts. There are a lot of hills in this town. Why not have those religions that wish fair representation simply raise the funds and erect their own memorials? One religious affiliation taking initiative in no way restricts other religious groups from making similarly honoring initiatives.\" and \"Has Cowett visited Arlington Cemetary in Washington, DC?\" The athiest who brought the suit is also free to put up his own memorial deriding the religious convictions of all others so honored. That way, he need not feel slighted. I also have issue with identifying this person as an \"atheist\". According to the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, \"atheist\" is a derivitive of the word \"atheism\", a noun meaning \"the belief that God does not exist\". If this person were actually an atheist, it would be a matter of supreme indifference where or how people have honored soldiers fallen in battle. In my opinion some \"atheists\" use their belief the same way as some \"religious\" people, just as a mask to put their own peculiar interests through behind. | 6125) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470571](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470571)) Posted 2 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Eh Oh!

You can choose to take all they say as absolute truth, or you can look at the facts and decide for yourself. Michael Moore clearly had a bias, as did Dan Rather. Look behind their slanted viewpoints--perhaps you will come to agree with them anyway, but perhaps you will find something different. Well, what people say - be it Moore, Olbermann, Rumsfeld, even GWB himself (which sometimes also reveals a lot unvoluntarily) - this is merely opinion. Okay, \"point of view\" may be the better word. And that's as true as any point of view. But what they do, and the influence of what they do - that's what really counts. The Americans I met and talked with - some of them still are my friends - had so different points of view, you sometimes could think they told of 2 or 3 different Americas. I agree to BrainSmashR's observation: our political ideals are basically the exact opposite. While he in my eyes is really a right-wing, in his eyes I am what he would call a Communist, though I never was in a Communist Party: Before the Berlin Wall came down I didn't want to join a party where most members were in only because of promotion reasons, and after that I searched without result for a Party I would fit in. But in general, my political ideals tend to a system where social means are more important then uncontrolled markets, where education and medical care are free of charge for everyone. | 6138) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470274](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470274)) Posted 2 Dec 2006 by : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 470267](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=470267)) Posted 2 Dec 2006 by Post: Heaven High! hi u Low Me waaaaaaaaah got asleep too early, woke up, and now I can't get sleep again ... but at least I get some winning time You are getting sleepier and sleepier.. .. .. .. .

Please correct me if I'm wrong. 1) I stated that \"the left-winged (i.e. Communist Party or others) have no political influence.\" But okay, I understand: if already Democrats are called left-winged, then all other parties further left must be seen as extremist (May be a heritage of the McCarthy-era?) 2) You: \"we never declared war on any of those countries.\" I, agreeing with you: \"Sure, the American government never declared war on those countries\" but adding: \"they simply sent their soldiers there.\" (which was my impression since I heard from Vietnam, but anyway.) I believed this sentence to be clearly understandable. But I was wrong: You: \"No, it's a fact that we haven't declared war sicne World War 2, and your opinion won't change that fact either.\" Isn't that a bit strange? Three times the same sentence 3) I see, so it's ok for Germany to invade Poland under false pretenses and start a world war,I never said it were ok -I hate war and I hate the Nazis! The old, original ones, and the new ones! I only pointed it as a (may be bad) similarity but when we do it to the middle east after the worst terrorist attack in the history of our country... I also never said that such a reaction were wrong - but I said that I believed that these terrorists were independent figures like those suicide bombers - and I don't think that these were sent out by the government of any middle east country. If there had been a 100% proof that this horrible attack (I lost a friend at this day myself) was commanded and organized by the government of a certain middle east country, then I could hesitatingly agree with the decision of your president even to declare war. But as long such a 100%proof is missing, I can see a similarity between Germany's invasion in Poland, and the (let me put it in quotation marks) \"invasion\" in Irak. Sorry about that. 4) have you even had a short look on this link I posted? That's not Michael Moore, that's a University who made this poll which I quoted from. \"More like those that lived in the lap of luxury under Saddam are scared they will have to work for a living instead of raping and pillaging the weak.\" Most of the Iraqis lived \"in the lap of luxury\", \"raping and pillaging the weak\"? I rather doubt it. As I remember from a report, most of the Iraqi had less luxury than Americans who live at a trailer park. I don't know what gave you this impression, but since I try to use different sources to get things confirmed from one side which I learned from the other side, I have mostly at least two \"witnesses\" for each article I read. Every fact I read about, I search other references and counter arguments, to get my own opinion whether or not this fact is true. Meanwhile I can even see who is a Conservative and who is a Democrate when I talk with them (though they differ not that much, less than SPD and CDU here in Germany). And it's my impression that you are at least a Conservative. | 6163) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 469875](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=469875)) Posted 1 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Hi noodles, How ya doing?

I think it has more to do with people haveing fewer sexual liasons than transmitting diseases. ie..the Church has it in their heads that the use of condoms causes people to have sex with non spouses, so ban the use of condoms and you have more \"in marriage\" sexual relations. Probably needs updating, but look at the people that become Pope, old and not exactly up to date on the latest thinking of the public. I am NOT defending their position, just trying to explain what I think they are thinking. I can agree. The Church's intention is that sexual relationship should be ONLY between husband and wife, and for they expect all people to obey that rule, there were no need for condoms. But, on the other hand: if people really would obey that rule (ie. \"no sex except with one's own spouse\") then it also would cut down hiv and other sexual caused diseases a lot. | 6167) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : [The Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 469858](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=469858)) Posted 1 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Und so Ich Vwin? 292 Do you want me to answer in German?

Hello everyone! back! 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Man, I grew up in a part of Germany which's government was a marionette in Soviet's hands - so I know the urge of freedom myself. And I have the opinion that every country in the world should be unsupervised by others - as long they pass UN rules. It's like in Germany, were there still are occupying forces, though the world war has been over since 1945. Well, most of us feel that the US troops here are remainings of the occupying forces and should leave asap as well. Heck, my friends even have the opinion Germany should leave NATO and make their own thing, absent of this \"superpower world uber sheriff\" thing togeter with the US military, making the NATO fight in wars, which - with the right political strategy - not even had to be started. I agree with your stance on NATO...it's a piece of crap. As far as occupying forces, you don't get to make that decision. If you recall, prior to 1945 your country tried to take over the world and exterminate an entire race of people. You're lucky the world even allows you to govern yourself, much less do it unsupervised. That's your opinion. I only wonder why suddenly the number of \"insurgents\" rebelling against their \"saviours\" is increasing so much - is it so impossible that it could be by reason? That they simply fear to be about to be suppressed again, this time by foreigners? Just leave them alone & watch them from far - and slap their hands when they try to grab something dangerous again, if implicitly needed. IMHO that would be the only right way. To pretend that an attack of a handful of terrorists were a warlike act of an entire nation - that is IMHO the boldest lie of politians since Sept 1 1939, when a German radio sender close to the border was attacked by (German guys pretending to be) \"Polish terrorists\" - which led to WW2 then. Once again, we haven't declared war on Iraq. We are aiding them in fighting the insurgents and helping them to establish a Democratic for of government. One that produce nearly a 75% voter turnout even in the middle of a war torn country! Guess why most American don't care about the opinions of foreigners? It's because your opinions are based on lies, not one or two, but ALL of them. Here's what the Iraqi people want, according to a recent [poll conducted by the University of Maryland](http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Iraq/Iraq_Jan06_rpt.pdf): \"A large majority of Iraqis think the US plans to maintain bases in Iraq permanently, even if the newly elected government asks the US to leave. A large majority favors setting a timeline for the withdrawal of US forces, though this majority divides over whether the timeline should be six months or two years. Nearly half of Iraqis approve of attacks on US-led forces\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20acincluding nine out of 10 Sunnis. Most Iraqis believe that many aspects of their lives will improve once the US-led forces leave... Asked if it was a good idea for Iraqi leaders to have agreed at the Arab League conference that there should be a timetable for the withdrawal of US-led forces from Iraq, 87% say it was, including 64% of Kurds, 94% of Sunnis and 90% of Shia.\" Is that really what Dubya wanted? The majority of the same people who were just relieved from their terror regime by the American soldiers want their helpers out? Well, Dubya, think about that, let them have their will and don't risk the lifes of hundreds or thousands of soldiers staying in a country where they are not welcome anymore. No I don't try to re-write history. The invasion into Poland which led to WW2 started as an answer to this \"warlike attack\" - which turned out finally to have been a fake one - you can read that in each German history book. And: the occupation of Germany by the allies was okay as long as Germany had no own stabile government ... but from the moment on, when there was a government (okay there were two then) all occupying forces should have gone away instead of controlling the countries over decades - this had been the one and only right way. But history tend to repeat itself - including all of it's mistakes. BTW, the German invasion of Poland started WW2 and that's an accepted fact world-wide. So now you're not only telling lies about my country, you're trying to rewrite history.....and you still wonder why your country is occupied by the winning team. Sure, the American government never declared war on those countries - they simply sent their soldiers there. As far as I know, the US haven't been attacked by Korea, by Vietnam, by Grenada, by Iran, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Iraq or any other land - except 9/11 (which I believe to be done by some independent misled folks having a conviction like those suicide bombers) and Pearl Harbour, the States never have been attacked themselves by other countries (at least not in the 20th century) but had troops on other countries to \"defend American interests\" What a coincidence, we never declared war on any of those countries. Try reading an American history book instead of listening to fat retards like Micheal Moore. We're at the top of the food chain and this is how we do things over here. We didn't ask you if you like it or if you cared. Our objective is to protect America, it's citizens, and our interests, not to please you.... Sure it is totally okay to protect the own citizens and the own land... but: against whom or what? There must be an objective threat to protect against - and IMHO no country in the world where US troops were and are fighting (after WW2) was even able to really threaten the Mighty Super Power USA seriously. Well, I'm just wondering... \"Imagine there is war, and nobody goes there\" | 6170) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 469743](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=469743)) Posted 1 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: and now it's my turn to go off to work a little bit, but: I'll be back | by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: Good morning everybody.

After Litvinenko quit the FSB \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac the KGB's successor agency \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac in 2000, he alleged the FSB was responsible for bombing two Russian apartment buildings, killing 300 people. The government blamed Chechen terrorists and used the attacks as a rationale to renew its war on separatist Chechnya \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac all to the benefit of the presidential hopes of then-Prime Minister Putin. In recent days, however, it has been credibly suggested that Putin might not be responsible. It's hard to fathom how the Russian leader could benefit from ordering the showy murder of a high-profile critic \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac accomplished with radioactive polonium 210, a sinister flourish \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac in one of the media capitals of the Western world. Thus, Putin's enemies had a motive to kill Litvinenko and undermine Putin. Litvinenko also had plenty of enemies beyond Putin. Nevertheless, whether or not Putin ordered the hit, the attention he is getting as a result of the London murder could have a welcome effect: getting the world to deal with the fact that under Putin, Russia is morphing into a gangster state without modern parallel. Once a laboratory for free-market economics, Russia is steadily seeing its most lucrative industries seized by the government. (The economy is humming, but largely because of oil wealth, not Putin's informed stewardship.) Property rights are under assault. Individual freedoms are disappearing. The once-iconoclastic media are now largely pro-Putin, intimidated by murders, shutdowns and takeovers. Once-free elections now are held largely to legitimize Putin's diktats and to install his allies. Putin's bullying extends to some of the nations that spun off from the Soviet Union in 1991. When Ukrainians elected reformer Viktor Yushchenko \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac also poisoned in mysterious circumstances \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac as their leader in 2004, Russia responded by cutting off gas supplies to Ukraine after first raising prices by 400 percent. Georgia and Moldova have been similarly abused. Given this history, it is no longer acceptable for the Bush administration to push the pretense that Putin is a benign fellow with a few ugly quirks. Instead, the U.S. government must be forthright about what has become of Russia under his leadership \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac and far more wary of what he might do next. Perhaps in a cold realpolitik sense, a case can be made that Russia has been a valuable U.S. ally because Putin has held his tongue as the Bush administration pursued its aggressive foreign policy. And there is no question that Russia is less of a threat to the United States than in its Soviet incarnation; Putin and his cronies appear interested in accumulating wealth and power and using Russia's energy resources to dominate client states in Europe, not a return to the Cold War. Nevertheless, to tolerate Putin's gangster state is to encourage it to commit even more brazen outrages. Whether investigations into Litvinenko's assassination conclusively establish who is responsible, we hope Washington and the world do not turn away from the larger issue of the threat posed by a nation that is increasingly contemptuous of human rights and international law. On a list of the world's scariest people, Vladimir Putin is in the top ranks \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac and moving up fast. Has it been otherwise during the \"Cold War\"? - I mean, Putin is a former KGB officer - and surely he still uses the old connections, as well as former CIA people would do. | 6208) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: In my opinion, the US should send their soldiers back home a.s.a.p., and admit their mistake.

It won't stunt his growth, it won't give him AIDS, it won't make him sick or weakly. In fact, it will pretty much just make him normal.... Sure it will. Not all mothers can breast-feed their kids, and not all babies can tolerate it with their health - yes, bottle-feeding IS healthy, too. But it ISN'T the non-plus-ultra, the only appropriate thing. Not even the most optimal thing. And there is IMO nothing sexual, annoying or harassing with seeing a woman opening the buttons to feed her kid.

In the first place they weren't \"posted\" all over the forum, they were specific to mine and Iceman's signatures. In the second place, this is 2006. Breastfeeding isn't a necessity and hasn't been for quite some time. ...and finally, I certainly don't think someone who condones women acting like wild animals in public is fit to give anyone advice on what is and isn't degrading to women. If you want to be a prude then be a prude, if you condone public nudity, then condone public nudity, but for christ's sake, stop trying to do both.... I partly disagree. Well, I disagree with point 2: though we have 2006, it's still medically, and psychologically proven that breast-feeding is optimal - both for the nutrition of the baby, and for the bonding between mother and child, and that feeding by bottle still should be only a replacement for that. And I disagree with point three: feeding a child has nothing to do with \"acting like wild animals\" - rather have those courtship rituals you see on fairs, discos and other really public places, where some kind of women act like pros searching new \"clients\" where even the blindest man can see ulterior sexual motives (a la \"sex | 6221) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 469317](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=469317)) Posted 1 Dec 2006 by [thorin belvrog](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/show_user.php?userid=8489449) Post: good moaning people.....

But only when the first results come, then the faith will change into knowledge. So each scientist, each researcher is a believer: a believer in his or her particular theory not exactly knowing it to be true - but doing and acting as if. And as soon there are enough evidence, or proof, - only then, not before that - the belief in that theory turns to a knowledge that this theory is really true.

The trouble with calling the US response to the actions of Islamofaschists a \"game\" is that the Islamofaschists are in deadly earnest about wanting everyone who is not exactly of their religious and cultural views dead. The more trouble is the US helped the so-called \"Islamofaschists\" to come up only decades ago, with supporting them with weapons and training. Bin Laden is a 100% CIA \"product\", as well Saddam was before they went nuts - but CIA officially refuse to admit that. The entire war (or don't I have to say invasion?) down there has only been started by the US for oil, and for political reasons. To kill a couple terrorists doesn't need invading a country with some hundred thousand soldiers and bombing it back to Stone Age. If the fight against terrorism really were the only reason, it had been enough to send some undercover persons to kill or arrest these few people like they do in South and Middle America with these drug producing people. But Old Dubya needed to improve his settlement by calling out a war, and taking almost all Civil Rights in his own wonderful country away with his \"Home Security Act \" (or how do you call it?) to make God's Own Country becoming a f***ing police-state. In my opinion, the US should send their soldiers back home a.s.a.p., and admit their mistake. (I know I sound like having my knowledge from Michael Moore. That's true, partly.

I remember, just 15 years ago there was a youth radio channel from (Eastern) Germany broadcasting a weekly (or semi-weekly?) show named \"Music for the Recorder\" - I still own about thirty cassettes with complete albums on them: recorded one side at a time. And - there are (a very few) channels in Germany doing similar shows nowadays: not so explicitely, but they send no ads or comments at all, unless the album or something is over. There's an assumption that the only reason why someone would buy any of them is to duplicate the music, and not backup data. Actually its not free because we paying the fee to RIAA (SABAM for Belgium) already if we buy a Tape, Recordable-CD, Video/Sound recorder or CD-writer. Wait until music starts to be sold on any of those media. I don't (think) know if the above is true when buying a HD, usb-sticks, smart-cards etc. 1) From the radio, onto the cassette, the only cost is of the cassette. Radio is free.Radio-to-tape is illegal, but it's unenforceable, which is why people continue to do so. 2) TV is free. (Only cost is of the TV, not access, unless it is cable.) I could record a music video onto VHS, until such time as I get some better technology. 3) Internet radio can also be accessed for free in MANY instances. I can record from it using the freeware program AudioGrabber. (Only cost is of the computer.)Dubious at best since recording an audiostream is akin to the radio-to-tape example, but unlike it, this can be enforced if the audio software \"respects\" broadcast/record flags (and most don't for practicality reasons). In my opinion, concerning software, movies and music, big business has too much influence in politics, anywhere. it _is_ possible otherwise. See Linux: Most of their products are for free, or very cheap, nonetheless they make their fortune; and Micro$oft becomes the loser after all, because they always want to force their clients to buy their oversold products, even by setting spy-bugs into the kernel (WGA-tool), and calling the users criminal who use other sources. Like so many folks, I prefer Freeware: not only in software, but also in music :o) Hail to usenet and sharegroups!!! | 6261) |[Message boards](forum_index.php) : [Cafe SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) : Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 468715](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=468715)) Posted 30 SETI](forum_forum.php?id=11) Wins Part Seven Closed!!](forum_thread.php?id=35851) ( [Message 468706](forum_thread.php?id=35851&postid=468706)) Posted Post: Congrats to ninjadwarf for winning The last Person to post Wins Part Six!

An example: \"Helicopter, helicopter/Please come down/if you don't/I'll shoot you down/Bang, bang!\" Or as I meant it, it means talking unintelligibly. It stems from an old english saying from many years ago, when the Dutch language was seen as very difficult to understand.
