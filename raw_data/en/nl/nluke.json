The Benefits Of The Cleanse - Weight release between 15-40 pounds (based on actual user reports - results may vary) - Assists in decreasing cellulite* - Balances appetite* - Helps to increase energy* - Helps to regulate metabolism* The Difference Between Weight Loss and Weight Release Weight loss is when you lose weight which causes the subconscious mind to go find the \"lost\" weight because by nature you can't lose anything that belongs to you. People do not say they lost \"unnecessary\" weight or \"unhealthy\" weight, they just outright say they lost weight and this is what sabotages them. Weight release means you \"released\" the weight, the unnecessary and unhealthy weight of course. It has an energy of self control, it implies your conscious intent to \"release\" whereas 'lost' implies the opposite. People who lose weight gain it back far more than people who use the right language and say they released weight. WHAT DOES THE WEIGHT RELEASE CLEANSE CONSIST OF?

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FULL BODY CLEANSE AND THE WEIGHT RELEASE CLEANSE? The [Full Body Cleanse](https://www.dherbs.com/store/full-body-cleanse-p-1.html) generally helps people to release weight from waste and substances trapped in the eliminative channels, especially the colon; and for women specifically, the five fatty reserve areas: breast, belly, buttocks, thighs, upper back arms.* The Weight Release Cleanse generally helps people release weight by specifically helping to restore lost or impaired functions and capabilities of the endocrine system due to sabotage predicated upon poor diet.* These lost functions and capabilities of the endocrine system include those of the hypothalamus gland (which controls hunger and appetite), thyroid gland (which regulates metabolism), and the body's ability to burn fat in the body, especially the five fatty reserve areas, to name a few. In addition to the above, the Weight Release cleanse addresses sugar craving more intensely than the [Full Body Cleanse](https://www.dherbs.com/store/full-body-cleanse-p-1.html).* The Weight Release Cleanse also utilizes appetite suppressing herbs that naturally help to decrease eating and appetite.* The Weight Release Cleanse is designed to help those individuals who have difficulty releasing weight (waste) on the [Full Body Detox](https://www.dherbs.com/store/full-body-cleanse-p-1.html) due to non-toxic problems, i.e. impaired endocrine functions, emotional issues, subconscious programming (\"holding on\" to weights of the world or life), and mental sabotage (concentrating on not wanting to be fat and so thereby attracting fat in accordance pursuant to the Law of Attraction and the science of NLP: Neuro-Linguistic Programming). The Weight Release Cleanse, like the [Full Body Cleanse](https://www.dherbs.com/store/full-body-cleanse-p-1.html), works on fluid (via the kidneys) and the intestinal tract-colon, but it also does all of the above.* Therefore, it is ideal to perform both cleanses ( [Full Body Cleanse](https://www.dherbs.com/store/full-body-cleanse-p-1.html) followed by Weight Release Cleanse) for desired weight release, especially since you just don't want to release weight (waste), but to cleanse the entire body.* Weight release is achieved through a combination of diet change and routine exercise.
