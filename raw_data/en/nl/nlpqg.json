Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 2 Six Steps to D ue Regard Step 1. What's the piece of work and its objective(s) ? The Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act 20 14 (the Act) received Royal Assent on 1 May 2014, and will come into effect in April 2016 . The Act puts a duty on any persons exercisin g functions under the Act to seek to promote the well -being of people who need care and support and carers who need support. The Act also provides the statutory framework to deliver the Welsh Government's commitment to integrate social services to support people of all ages, and support people as part of families and communities. Timef rame The statutory framework will consist of three main elements: 1.the Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act 2014); 2.regulations made under the Act; and 3.codes of practice/statutory guidance. These three elements work together to form the framework within which Social Services will operate from April 2016. 8 May to 31 July 2015: Publ ic consultation on code of p ractice in relation to Advocacy under Part 10 and rel ated parts of the Act. Autumn / November 2015: Code of Practice laid before the Assembly . April 2016: Commencement of the Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act 2014 . This assessment has been completed for the Code of Practice on the exercise of S ocial Services functions in relation to Advocacy under Part 10 and related parts of the Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act 20 14 (the Code) . The Code is issued under section 145 of the Act and sets out the requirements for local authorities to provi de people access to advocacy services and ensure support is available to enable individuals to engage and participate to achieve their well being outcomes. Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 3 The Code outlines the responsibility of local authorities to : ensure that access to advocacy servic es and support is available to enable individuals to engage and participate when local authorities are exercising statutory duties in relation to them and to arrange an independent advocate to facilitate the involvement of individuals in certain circumstan ces. The Code recognises the over-arching duties under section 6 of the Act require that any person exercising functions under the Act must: in so far as reasonably practicable, ascertain and have regard to peop le's views, wishes and feelings ( includin g children, families of children, young people and carers) and have regard to the importance of providing support to enable the individual (including children, families of children, young people and carers) to participate in decisions that affect him or h er, to the extent that it is appropriate in the circumstances, particularly where the individual's ability to communicate is limited for any reason. These over -arching duties, together with the United Nation Principles and Convention on the rights of a c hild under section 7 of the Act are integral in understanding and assessing people's well -being outcomes; what matters to people; and people's needs for care and support to enable them to achieve their personal well -being outcomes. Advocacy should be co nsidered as an inherent element of the Act to focus social care around people and their well -being. Advocacy helps individuals including children and young people , to understand how they can be in volved, how they can contribute , and take part wherever pos sible to lead or direct the process. Step 2. Analysing the impact The Act takes forward Wales' distinctive and internationally regarded rights based approach to children's social care. The assessment of the impacts that the Act will have on childr en and young people confirms the rights based approach that is taken, reveals that many of the Articles are relevant and those listed below are being dealt with in the Act. The rights conferred on children in the Act apply to all children regardless of an y of their characteristics. \"Well -being\" is a key concept throughout the Act. The definition of \"well -being\" in section 2(3) specifically ensures that it includes the physical, intellectual, emotional, social and behavioural development of children . The Act creates a comprehensive framework of general duties for local authorities and other public bodies towards children in their area combined with specific entitlements for individual children or th eir carers following assessment of their well -being. Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 4 The positive impact for children and young people is that advocacy services and support is accessible. It will enable and empower them to express their views , wishes and feelings , and to give them a voice and control over the ir well-being outcomes . The Code sets out the circumstances which individuals, including children and young people, may requir e advocacy services and when a l ocal authority must provide advocacy . The need for advocacy for looked after and other specified children is set out as S ection 178 of the Act re -states the existing entitlements of looked after children and to other children specified within section 178 (\"entitled children\") to advocacy and comes into force from April 2016. The duties owed to those children remain extant. The Code sets out principles of effective commissioning and publishing of advocacy which will ensure that c hildren and young people will have access to support and are able to have information in a format that is suitable for them to ensure they are informed of what they are eligible for. Specifically for looked after children and other specified children , the Code explicitly states: Local authorities must have robust communication and publicity mechanisms to ensure that children, including those with additional communication needs, are aware of their right to make a complaint and to have an advocate. This must include providing information for entitled children about advocacy and associated services which are available ; informing entitled children about advo cacy when they intend or wish to make a complaint ; and providing help and assistance when entitled children want an advocate to speak for them. Step 3. How does your piece of work support and promote children' s rights? The following UNCRC Articles ha ve been identified as most relevant to th e Code: Article 3 -All organisations concerned with children should work towards what is best for each child. Article 4 - Governments should make these rights available to children. Article 6 - All children have t he right of life. Governments should ensure that children survive and develop healthily . Article 12 - Children have the r ight to say what they think should happen, when adults are making decisions that affect them, and to have their opinions taken into acc ount. Article 13 - Children have the right to get and to share information as long as the information is not damaging to them or to others. Article 19 - Governments should ensure that children are properly cared for, and protect them from violence, abuse a nd neglect by their parents or anyone else who looks after them. Article 25 - Children who are looked after by their local authority and who have a care and support plan rather than their parents should have their situation reviewed regularly. Article 39 - Children who have been neglected or abused should receive special help Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 5 to restore their self respect Consistent with the commitments to secure strong voice and control, the Code supplemented by all relevant codes of practice issued under the Act, enable local authorities and individuals (including children and young people) , in genuine partnership, to consider the range of advocacy support available and put the necessary arrangements in place. This will include the specific requirements on the local autho rity to arrange an independent advocate to support the child or young person wherever a local authority exercises a relevant function under the Act in relation to that person. Specifically, l ocal authorities must arrange for the provision of an independ ent advocate when a person can only overcome the barrier(s) to participate fully in the assessment, care and support planning, review and safeguarding processes with assistance from an appropriate individual, but there is no appropriate individual availabl e and to support entitled children when making a complaint or representation . Section 7 of the Act requires a person exercising functions under the Act in relation to a child requiring care or support, or who is a carer, or who is a looked after child to have due regard to Part 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child The Code is therefore intended to improve outcomes referred to in the relevant articles of UNCRC . Step 4. Advising the Minister and Ministerial decision The advice to the Minister of Health and Social Services confirms that this CRIA has been completed. No conflict with UNCRC articles has been identified. A 12 week consultation on the Code ran between 8 May and 31 July 201 5. In addition a series of engagement eve nts, in line with the formal consultation, were held which included representatives from the Association of Directors of Social Services Heads of Children's Services and representatives from the Office of the Children's Commissioner . As a result of commen ts received from the formal consultation and the engagement events amendments were incorporated in to the Code of Practice. A full report of the consultation and the analysis of responses can be accessed on the Welsh Government website: http://gov.wales/consultations/healthsocialcare/part10/?status=closed&lang=en Step 5. Recording and communicating the outcome Final version to be retained on i -share Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 6 Budgets The overall intended effect of the Code is to ensure that children and youn g people can achieve their well -being outcomes by ensuring they have access to advocacy services and support is available to enable them to engage and participate when local authorities are exercising statutory duties in relation to them. To enable their views, wishes and feelings to be heard and enable them to make their own informed decisions. The evidence provided in Steps 1 -3 above sets out in more detail the way in which rights of children and young people have been addressed in drafting the Code. A draft Code of Practic e was produced for consultation . The consultation period ran from 8 May 2015 to 31 July 2015 . The draft Code was co -produced with a technical working group which in cluded representations from children's' g roups such a Office of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, Children in Wales, Barnardo's Cymru , local authorities and Advocacy providers. As well as formal consultation, using various formats, officials gave pre sentations to groups, held discussions, attended one to one meetings, encouraged people to invite them to their existing meetings, and wrote articles and gave them to our partners to use within their networks. Stakeholders were asked to share information w ith their networks and feed back to Welsh Government. As well as key contacts being encouraged to disseminate the consultation documents amongst their networks , to support wider engagement, easy r ead and children and young - people friendly versions were al so produced and disseminated. Once the Act comes into force in April 2016 child friendly literature on the Act will be developed. Chris P - is this the case? Step 6. Revisiting the piece of work as and when needed The Act contains provision to allow for Ministers to monitor functions of the Act carried out by local authorities and other bodies. Ministers may require these bodies to report on their duties in implementing these regulations. Officials will continue to monitor the impact of the Code in r elation to the UNCRC. Six Step CRIA May2014 v1 Page 7 As a result of completing the CRIA, has there been any impact on budgets? It is important that where any changes are made to spending plans , including where additional alloc ations have been made, that this h as been as sessed and evidenced as part of the CRIA process .
