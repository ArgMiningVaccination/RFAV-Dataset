Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). (Minimum age: birth) At birth: Administer monovalent HepB to all newborns prior to hospital discharge. If mother is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, administer HepB and 0.5 mL of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. If mother's HBsAg status is unknown, administer HepB within 12 hours of birth. Determine the HBsAg status as soon as possible and if HBsAg positive, administer HBIG (no later than age 1 week). If mother is HBsAg negative, the birth dose can be delayed, in rare cases, with a provider's order and a copy of the mother's negative HBsAg laboratory report in the infant's medical record. After the birth dose: The HepB series should be completed with either monovalent HepB or a combination vaccine containing HepB. The second dose should be administered at age 1-2 months. The final dose should be administered no earlier than age 24 weeks. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be tested for HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg after completion of at least 3 doses of a licensed HepB series, at age 9-18 months (generally at the next well-child visit). 4-month dose: It is permissible to administer 4 doses of HepB when combination vaccines are administered after the birth dose. If monovalent HepB is used for doses after the birth dose, a dose at age 4 months is not needed. 2. Rotavirus vaccine (Rota). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) Administer the first dose at age 6-12 weeks. Do not start the series later than age 12 weeks. Administer the final dose in the series by age 32 weeks. Do not administer any dose later than age 32 weeks. Data on safety and efficacy outside of these age ranges are insufficient . 3. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). (Minimum age: 6 weeks) The fourth dose of DTaP may be administered as early as age 12 months, provided 6 months have elapsed since the third dose. Administer the final dose in the series at age 4-6 years. 4. Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib). age: 6 weeks) If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB\u00ae or ComVax\u00ae [Merck]) is administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. TriHIBit\u00ae (DTaP/Hib) combination products should not be used for primary immunization but can be used as boosters following any Hib vaccine in children age 12 months or older.5. Pneumococcal vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 weeks for pneumococcal [PCV]; 2 years for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPV]) Administer one dose of PCV to all healthy children aged 24-59 months having any incomplete schedule. Administer PPV to children aged 2 years and older with underlying medical conditions. 6. Influenza vaccine. (Minimum age: 6 months for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [TIV]; 2 years for live, attenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) Administer annually to children aged 6-59 months and to all eligible close contacts of children aged 0-59 months. Administer annually to children 5 years of age and older with certain risk factors, to other persons (including household members) in close contact with persons in groups at higher risk, and to any child whose parents request vaccination. For healthy persons (those who do not have underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications) ages 2-49 years, either LAIV or TIV may be used. Children receiving TIV should receive 0.25 mL if age 6-35 months or 0.5 mL if age 3 years or older. Administer 2 doses (separated by 4 weeks or longer) to children younger than 9 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or who were vaccinated for the first time last season but only received one dose. 7. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). (Minimum age: 12 months) Administer the second dose of MMR at age 4-6 years. MMR may be administered before age 4 -6 years, provided 4 weeks or more have elapsed since the first dose . 8. Varicella vaccine. (Minimum age: 12 months) Administer second dose at age 4-6 years; may be administered 3 months or more after first dose. Do not repeat second dose if administered 28 days or more after first dose. 9. Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA). (Minimum age: 12 months) Administer to all children aged 1 year (i.e., aged 12-23 months). Administer the 2 doses in the series at least 6 months apart. Children not fully vaccinated by age 2 years can be vaccinated at subsequent visits. HepA is recommended for certain other groups of children, including in areas where vaccination programs target older children. 10. Meningococcal vaccine. (Minimum age: 2 years for meningococcal conjugate and for polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4)) Administer MCV4 to children aged 2-10 years with terminal complement deficiencies or anatomic or functional asplenia and certain other high-risk groups.

Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV). (Minimum age: 9 years ) Administer the first dose of the HPV vaccine series to females at age 11-12 years. Administer the second dose 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose. Administer the HPV vaccine series to females at age 13-18 years if not previously vaccinated. 3. Meningococcal vaccine. Administer MCV4 at age 11-12 years and at age 13-18 years if not previously vaccinated. MPSV4 is an acceptable alternative. Administer MCV4 to previously unvaccinated college freshmen living in dormitories. MCV4 is recommended for children aged 2-10 years with terminal complement deficiencies or anatomic or functional asplenia and certain other high-risk groups. Persons who received MPSV4 3 or more years previously and remain at increased risk for meningococcal disease should be vaccinated with MCV4. 4. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV). Administer PPV to certain high-risk groups. 5. Influenza vaccine. Administer annually to all close contacts of children aged 0-59 months. Administer annually to persons with certain risk factors, health-care workers, and other persons (including household members) in close contact with persons in groups at higher risk. Administer 2 doses (separated by 4 weeks or longer) to children younger than 9 years who are receiving influenza vaccine for the first time or who were vaccinated for the first time last season but only received one dose. For healthy nonpregnant persons (those who do not have underlying medical conditions that predispose them to influenza complications) ages 2-49 years, either LAIV or TIV may be used. 6. Hepatitis A vaccine (HepA). Administer the 2 doses in the series at least 6 months apart. HepA is recommended for certain other groups of children, including in areas where vaccination programs target older children. 7. Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB). Administer the 3-dose series to those who were not previously vaccinated. A 2-dose series of Recombivax HB\u00ae is licensed for children aged 11-15 years. 8. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).

Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination Tdap should replace a single dose of Td for adults aged <65 years who have not previously received a dose of Tdap. Only one of two Tdap products (Adacel\u00ae[sanofi pasteur]) is licensed for use in adults. Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary vaccination series with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. A primary series for adults is 3 doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccines; administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. However, Tdap can substitute for any one of the doses of Td in the 3-dose primary series. The booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine should be administered to adults who have completed a primary series and if the last vaccination was received >10 years previously. Tdap or Td vaccine may be used, as indicated. If the person is pregnant and received the last Td vaccination >10 years previously, administer Td during the second or third trimester; if the person received the last Td vaccination in <10 years, administer Tdap during the immediate postpartum period. A one-time administration of 1 dose of Tdap with an interval as short as 2 years from a previous Td vaccination is recommended for postpartum women, close contacts of infants aged <12 months, and all health-care workers with direct patient contact. In certain situations, Td can be deferred during pregnancy and Tdap substituted in the immediate postpartum period, or Tdap can be administered instead of Td to a pregnant woman after an informed discussion with the woman. Consult the ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td as prophylaxis in wound management. 2. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination HPV vaccination is recommended for all females aged <26 years who have not completed the vaccine series. History of genital warts, abnormal Papanicolaou test, or positive HPV DNA test is not evidence of prior infection with all vaccine HPV types; HPV vaccination is still recommended for these persons. Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual activity; however, females who are sexually active should still be vaccinated. Sexually active females who have not been infected with any of the HPV vaccine types receive the full benefit of the vaccination. Vaccination is less beneficial for females who have already been infected with one or more of the HPV vaccine types. A complete series consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 2 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose. Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for females with the medical indications described in Figure 2, \"Vaccines that might be indicated for adults based on medical and other indications,\" it is not a live-virus vaccine and can be administered. However, immune response and vaccine efficacy might be less than in persons who do not have the medical indications described or who are immunocompetent. 3. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination Measles component: Adults born before 1957 can be considered immune to measles. Adults born during or after 1957 should receive >1 dose of MMR unless they have a medical contraindication, documentation of >1 dose, history of measles based on health-care provider diagnosis, or laboratory evidence of immunity. A second dose of MMR is recommended for adults who 1) have been recently exposed to measles or are in an outbreak setting; 2) have been previously vaccinated with killed measles vaccine; 3) have been vaccinated with an unknown type of measles vaccine during 1963-1967; 4) are students in postsecondary educational institutions; 5) work in a health-care facility; or 6) plan to travel internationally. Mumps component: Adults born before 1957 can generally be considered immune to mumps. Adults born during or after 1957 should receive 1 dose of MMR unless they have a medical contraindication, history of mumps based on health-care provider diagnosis, or laboratory evidence of immunity. A second dose of MMR is recommended for adults who 1) are in an age group that is affected during a mumps outbreak; 2) are students in postsecondary educational institutions; 3) work in a health-care facility; or 4) plan to travel internationally. For unvaccinated health-care workers born before 1957 who do not have other evidence of mumps immunity, consider administering 1 dose on a routine basis and strongly consider administering a second dose during an outbreak. Rubella component: Administer 1 dose of MMR vaccine to women whose rubella vaccination history is unreliable or who lack laboratory evidence of immunity. For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, routinely determine rubella immunity and counsel women regarding congenital rubella syndrome. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. 4. Varicella vaccination All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine unless they have a medical contraindication. Special consideration should be given to those who 1) have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of immunocompromised persons) or 2) are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers; child care employees; residents and staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions; college students; military personnel; adolescents and adults living in households with children; nonpregnant women of childbearing age; and international travelers). Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: 1) documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart; 2) U.S.-born before 1980 (although for health-care personnel and pregnant women birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity); 3) history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella by a health-care provider (for a patient reporting a history of or presenting with an atypical case, a mild case, or both, health-care providers should seek either an epidemiologic link with a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or evidence of laboratory confirmation, if it was performed at the time of acute disease); 4) history of herpes zoster based on health-care provider diagnosis; or 5) laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. Assess pregnant women for evidence of varicella immunity. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the health-care facility. The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first dose. 5. Influenza vaccination Medical indications: Chronic disorders of the cardiovascular or pulmonary systems, including asthma; chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]); any condition that compromises respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk of aspiration (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injury, or seizure disorder or other neuromuscular disorder); and pregnancy during the influenza season. No data exist on the risk for severe or complicated influenza disease among persons with asplenia; however, influenza is a risk factor for secondary bacterial infections that can cause severe disease among persons with asplenia. Occupational indications: Health-care personnel and employees of long-term care and assisted- living facilities. Other indications: Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care and assisted-living facilities; persons likely to transmit influenza to persons at high risk (e.g., in-home household contacts and caregivers of children aged 0-59 months, or persons of all ages with high-risk conditions); and anyone who would like to be vaccinated. Healthy, nonpregnant adults aged <49 years without high- risk medical conditions who are not contacts of severely immunocompromised persons in special care units can receive either intranasally administered live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist\u00ae) or inactivated vaccine. Other persons should receive the inactivated vaccine. 6. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination Medical indications: Chronic pulmonary disease (excluding asthma); chronic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes mellitus; chronic liver diseases, including liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse (e.g., cirrhosis); chronic alcoholism, chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy [if elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 before surgery]); immunosuppressive conditions; and cochlear implants and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Vaccinate as close to HIV diagnosis as possible. Other indications: Alaska Natives and certain American Indian populations and residents of nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. 7. Revaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine One-time revaccination after 5 years for persons with chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy); or immunosuppressive conditions. For persons aged >65 years, one-time revaccination if they were vaccinated >5 years previously and were aged <65 years at the time of primary vaccination. 8. Hepatitis A vaccination Medical indications: Persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates. Behavioral indications: Men who have sex with men and persons who use illegal drugs. Occupational indications: Persons working with hepatitis A virus (HAV)-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting. Other indications: Persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A (a list of countries is available at wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentdiseases.aspx ) and any person seeking protection from HAV infection. Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix\u00ae), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta\u00ae). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix\u00ae) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months. 9. Hepatitis B vaccination Medical indications: Persons with end-stage renal disease, including patients receiving hemodialysis; persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); persons with HIV infection; and persons with chronic liver disease. Occupational indications: Health-care personnel and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids. Behavioral indications: Sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than 1 sex partner during the previous 6 months); current or recent injection-drug users; and men who have sex with men. Other indications: Household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities; international travelers to countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection (a list of countries is available at wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentdiseases.aspx); and any adult seeking protection from HBV infection. Settings where hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all adults: STD treatment facilities; HIV testing and treatment facilities; facilities providing drug-abuse treatment and prevention services; health-care settings targeting services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; end-stage renal disease programs and facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients; and institutions and nonresidential daycare facilities for persons with developmental disabilities. Special formulation indications: For adult patients receiving hemodialysis and other immunocompromised adults, 1 dose of 40 \u00b5g/mL (Recombivax HB\u00ae), or 2 doses of 20 \u00b5g/mL (Engerix-B\u00ae) administered simultaneously. 10. Meningococcal vaccination Medical indications: Adults with anatomic or functional asplenia, or terminal complement component deficiencies. Other indications: First-year college students living in dormitories; microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis ; military recruits; and persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic (e.g., the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season [December-June]), particularly if their contact with local populations will be prolonged. Vaccination is required by the government of Saudi Arabia for all travelers to Mecca during the annual Hajj. Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is preferred for adults with any of the preceding indications who are aged <55 years, although meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is an acceptable alternative. Revaccination after 3- 5 years might be indicated for adults previously vaccinated with MPSV4 who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., persons residing in areas in which disease is epidemic). 11. Herpes zoster vaccination A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged >60 years regardless of whether they report a prior episode of herpes zoster. Persons with chronic medical conditions may be vaccinated unless a contraindication or precaution exists for their condition. 12. Selected conditions for which Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine may be used Hib conjugate vaccines are licensed for children aged 6 weeks-71 months. No efficacy data are available on which to base a recommendation concerning use of Hib vaccine for older children and adults with the chronic conditions associated with an increased risk for Hib disease. However, studies suggest good immunogenicity in patients who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection or who have had splenectomies; administering vaccine to these patients is not contraindicated. 13. Immunocompromising conditions Inactivated vaccines are generally acceptable (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, and influenza [trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine]), and live vaccines generally are avoided in persons with immune deficiencies or immune suppressive conditions. Information on specific conditions is available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.Summary of Recommendations for Adult Immunization (Page 1 of 3) Note: LAIV may not be given to some of the persons listed below; see contraindica- tions listed in far right column.
