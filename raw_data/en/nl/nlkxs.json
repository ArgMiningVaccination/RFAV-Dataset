The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of C hildren's Hospital Med ical Center and the affiliated entities as discussed i n Note 1(a). These entities a re under common ownership and management. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Stat ements Management is responsible for t he preparation and fair presenta tion of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally a ccepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of in ternal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolid ated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidat ed financial statement s based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordan ce with auditing standards g enerally accepted in the United States of America and the standards appli cable to financial audits contai ned in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller Genera l of the United States. Those s tandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the cons olidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidenc e about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial sta tements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments , the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's prepar ation and fair presentation of the consolidated finan cial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the ci rcumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the eff ectiveness of the Company's int ernal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriate ness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by mana gement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - 2 - We believe that the audit eviden ce we have obtained is sufficie nt and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cincinnati Children's as of June 30, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Information Our audits were conducted for th e purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expe nditures of federal awards is required by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non- Profit Organizations , and the accompanying schedule is presented for the purposes o f additional analysis and is not a required part of th e basic consolidated financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of f ederal awards is the responsib ility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other rec ords used to prepare the basic consolidated financial statements. Such information has been subjected to th e auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic consolidated financial statements and certain addi tional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying account ing and other records used to prepare the basic consolidated financial sta tements or to the basic consoli dated financial statem ents themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standar ds generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of fed eral awards is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basi c consolidated financial state ments as a whole. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated October 21, 2015 on our consideration of Cincinnati Children's internal con trol over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that re port is to describe the scope o f our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and n ot to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

See accompanying notes to conso lidated financial statem ents. - 6 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) (1) Accounting Policies- (a) Basis of Consolidation--Children's Hospital Medi cal Center (Cincinnati Children's), River City Insurance Limited (River City), CHMC Commun ity Health Services Network (CHSN), Northern Kentucky Children's Medical Services, LLC (NKC MS), Burnet Ave LLC (Burnet) and TSHCH LLC (TSHCH), which are under common management, ar e included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as Cincinnati Children's or the Medical Center. Intercompany transactions and balan ces have been eliminated. Cincinnati Children's is an Ohio not-for-profit co rporation providing pediatric healthcare services, teaching and related research. River City is a captive insurance compan y and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's. CHSN is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Children's whose purpose is to manage primary care practices in a community setting. NKCMS is a limited liability corporation formed to enhance the scope a nd quality of pediatric care in Northern Kentucky. Burnet is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cinci nnati Children's, whose purpose is to hold land. TSHCH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cinci nnati Children's whose purpose is to acquire, hold, develop, subdivide, sell, lease, mortgage, mana ge and otherwise deal in real property. (b) Supporting Organizations--The Children's Hospital (TCH), Convalescent Hospital for Children and Orphan Asylum (CHCOA) and Adolescent Health Center of Greater Cincinnati, Inc. (CAC), all Ohio not-for-profit corporations which are not include d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, provide financial support to the Cinci nnati Children's. Certain endowment funds of these supporting organizations are restricted by the donors for specific operating purposes of Cincinnati Children's and are recorded as Interest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Recei pts from such restricted endowment funds and certain other receipts that are designated by the Bo ards of Trustees of the supporting organizations for specific operating purposes are reflected as a component of restricted gifts and contributions in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operati ons and Changes in Net Assets. Upon utilization in operations, such funds are reflected in the Conso lidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets as other-restricted net assets used to support operations. Other funds are contributed to Cincinnati Children's as designated by the Boards of the supporting organizations to provide genera l support and are reflected as receipts from supporting organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. Cincinnati Children's records in its consolidated financial statements the fair value of certain temporarily and permanently restricted net assets held by supporting organi zations on its behalf. Changes in the fair value of such temporarily a nd permanently restricted net assets are recorded as a Gain (Loss) in Interest in Net Assets of Suppor ting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. - 7 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) (c) Support Received from Supporting Organizations-- In general, the supporting organizations provide annual support to Cincinnati Children's that incl udes the dividend and interest earnings of the respective investment portfolios (net of operationa l expenses and any donor required reinvestment of income). On occasion, the respective Boards of Trustees of these supporting organizations may also designate certain pledges of unrestricted principal in support of key projects at Cincinnati Children's. As of June 30, 2015, TCH and CHCOA have out standing revocable pledges of $250,900 and $9,000, respectively. All outstanding pledges of principa l support are revocable at the discretion of TCH's and CHCOA's Board of Trustees. As a result, such revocable pledges are not recorded as receivables in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, TCH transferred $57,594 and $42,907, respectively, of temporarily restricted net assets to Cincinnati Children' s which are recorded as Gifts, contributions and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, TCH transferred $4,033 a nd $6,952, respectively, of unrestricted net assets to Cincinnati Children's, which are recorded as Receipts from Supporting Organizations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, Cincinnati Children's transferred $1,000 and $16, respectively, of temporarily restricted net assets to TCH to fund named chairs designated to support divisional activities. During fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respec tively, Cincinnati Children's transferred $46,893 and $31,400 of unrestricted net assets to TCH to f und named chairs designated to support divisional activities. At June 30, 2015 and 2014, Cincinnati Children' s had a payable to TCH for $3,022 and $1,083, respectively, related to transfers received greater than funding commitments in fiscal 2015 and 2014. These amounts will be offset in future fiscal y ears against the current year commitment. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, CHCOA transferred $10,922 and $4,308 respectively, to Cincinnati Children's which are recorded as Gifts, contribu tions and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. At June 30, 2015, Cincinnati Children's has a pa yable to CHCOA for $55, which will be repaid through a reduction in support in fiscal 2016. At June 30, 2014 Cincinnati Children's had a receivable from CHCOA for $29 related to fiscal 2014 funding. This amount was paid in fiscal 2015. At June 30, 2015, Cincinnati Children's has a receivable from CHCOA for $6,395 related to an irrevocable pledge to be paid in fiscal year s 2016 through 2018 in support of the renovation of the College Hill facility. At June 30, 2015 and 2014, Cincinnati Children's has a receivable from TCH of $10,587 related to the expected payment from TCH upon maturity of a life insurance policy. (d) Concentration of Patient Accounts Receivable a nd Revenue and Revenue Recognition--In both fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, substantially all of tota l net hospital patient service revenue is derived from third-party payment programs (Medicaid, insurance companies and various managed care agreements). - 8 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The following details the percentage of net hospita l patient service revenue by payer category for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Gross Net Gross Net Commercial insurers - 1% 1% The following details the percentage of accounts receivable by payer category as of June 30, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Commercial insurers 3% 2% Managed care 42% 48% Government 26% 21% Self pay 2% 3% Specialty contracts are single case agreements or cont racts for specialty services, such as transplants. Net hospital patient service revenue is reported at estim ated net realizable am ounts from patients, third party payers and others for services rende red and includes estimated retroactive revenue adjustments due to future audits and reviews. Retroactive adjustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in th e period the related services are rendered, and such amounts are adjusted in future periods as adjustme nts become known or as years are no longer subject to such audits and reviews. Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospital pa tient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have thir d-party payer coverage on the basis of estimated contractual rates for services rendered. For uninsured patients th at do not qualify for charity care, Cincinnati Children's recognizes net hospital patient service revenue on the basis of its standard rates for services provided (or on the basis of discounted rates, if negotiated or provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a significant portion of Cincinnati Children's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, Cincinnati Children's records a provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Revenue from government (Medicaid and Medicare) programs accounted for approximately 24% of Cincinnati Children's net hospital patient service re venue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Laws and regulations gove rning the Medicaid and Medicare programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change a material amount in the near term. At June 30, 2015, Cincinnati Children's has settled all Medicaid cost reports through 2008 and all Medicare cost reports through 2013. - 9 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The following table reconciles gross patient service re venue to net hospital pa tient service revenue for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014: 2015 2014 Charges at established rates $2,745,917 $2,510,971 Deductions: Discounts on commercial contractuals (322,169) (257,951) Write-downs related to services to the poor: Including Medicaid and governmental contractuals, charity care and other uncollectible self pay write-offs (906,572) (820,993) 1,517,176 1,432,027 Tax Levy Program 5,200 5,200 Care Assurance Program 24,755 24,441 Net Hospital Patient Service Revenue $1,547,131 $1,461,668 Patient accounts receivable and related allowances for contractual adjustm ents and doubtful accounts are recorded on an accrual basis at estim ated coll ection rates to report patient accounts receivable at net realizable value. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. In evaluating the collect ability of accounts receivable, Cincinnati Children's performs a detail review of current accounts, analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payer sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances. Management regularly reviews data about these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the a llowances. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have a third-party coverage, Cincinnati Children's analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for contract uals (for example, for expected unrecoverable amounts based on contract provisions on accounts for which the third-party payer has not yet paid, or for payers who are known to be ha ving financial difficulties that make the realization of amounts due unlikely). For receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deduc tible and copayment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), Cincinnati Children's records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotia ted) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Cincinnati Children's allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay patients was 17% and 21% of self- pay accounts receivable at June 30, 2015 and 2014. In addition, Cincinnati Children's bad debt write- offs (before recoveries) totaled approximately $31,805 and $40,833 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cincinnati Children's modifi ed its charity care and uninsured policy in fiscal 2014 in order to provide greater discounts to such pa tients. Cincinnati Children's does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third- party payers nor does it have significant write- offs from third-party payers. Cincinnati Children's does maintain an allowance for contractual write-offs for third party payers in order to appropria tely reduce receivables to net realizable value. - 10 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) A summary of activity in Cincinnati Children's provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 related to pa tient receivables is as follows: Balance at Beginning of Year Provision for doubtful Accounts Accounts written off, Net of recoveries Balance at End of Year Year Ended June 30, 2015 $15,139 $15,389 $(18,388) $12,140 Year Ended June 30, 2014 $16,618 $(25,253) $15,139 The Consolidated Balance Sheet also includes $38,320 and $39,120 of contractual reserves related to net patient receivables as of June 30, 2015 and 2014. Accounts receivable related to professional services b illings is included in Other Receivables in the accom panying Consolidated Balance Sheets. (e) Capitation Revenue - Cincinnati Children's has ag reements with two Ohio Medicaid managed care companies, covering approximately 33,000 and 36, 000 children, respectively, in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, to provide for reimbursement under a variable capitation methodology for hospital services. Under these two contracts, all physician and home care services continue to be reimbursed based on provider fee schedules. The hospital services are reimbursed through a variable capitation payment which represents the amount remaining af ter payment has been made for (a) Cincinnati Children's physician services, (b) Cincinnati Children's home care services, and (c) services provided to members outside the Cincinnati Children's ne twork. Under delegation agreements, Health Network by Cincinnati Children's receives fixe d payments to perform the required medical management, care management and care coor dination functions. Medicaid managed care organizations retain risk for payments to providers. (f) Grant Revenue and Other Revenue -- Grants and contributions restricted for a specific operating purpose are recorded as temporarily restricted net asset s and reflected in unrestricted revenues, gains, and other support when the funds are expended in acco rdance with the specifications of the grantor or donor. Contributions for capital expenditures, recorded as temporarily restricted net assets when received, are recorded as net assets released from r estrictions used for the purchase of property and equipment when expended. Unrestricted contribu tions and bequests are included in other revenue when received. (g) Graduate Medical Education -Cincinnati Children' s receives Federal graduate medical education funding, which has resulted in other revenue of $9,209 and $9,166 recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the y ears ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (h) Meaningful Use Funding --Cincinnati Children's is e ligible for incentive payments for the hospital and physicians that implement and meaningfully u se electronic health record (EHR) technology under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).

In fiscal 2014, Cinci nnati Children's applied for and received $4,351 in funding under ARRA related to the hospital and eligible physician use of an EHR. (i) Tax Exempt Status--Cincinnati Children's and CHSN are recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501( a) of the Internal Revenue Code as charitable organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3). Ri ver City is a captive insurance company and has no income tax obligations. NKCMS, Burnet a nd TSHCH are limited liability corporations whose income is taxable to Cincinnati Children's. The income tax provisions recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are immate rial for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. Cincinnati Children's accounts for income tax es in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC) 740 \"Income Taxes\". It is Cincinnati Children's policy to classify the expense related to interest and penalties, if any, to be paid on underpayments of income taxes within other expenses. There were no material penalti es or interest recognized in fiscal 2015 and 2014. Listed below are the tax years that remain subj ect to examination by major tax jurisdiction: Federal - 2012 to 2015 State - 2012 to 2015 (j) Cash Equivalents--Cash equivalents consist primar ily of money market investments (including money market mutual funds), certificates of deposit and de mand deposits. Cash is held primarily in one bank. (k) Inventories -Inventories consist of medical s upplies and pharmaceuticals and are valued on an average cost method. (l) Marketable Securities-- Cincinnati Children's accounts for its investments under ASC 958-320 \"Not- for-Profit Entities - Investments - Debt and Equity Securities\".

(o) Fair Value Measurements\u2014Cincinnati Children's accounts for its assets and liabilities under ASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements\". As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an or derly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistenc y and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, ASC 820 establishes a fair valu e hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into th ree broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted Prices (unadjusted) in activ e markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date for assets and lia bilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These in clude quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, that is, ma rkets in which there are a few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level 3: Unobservable inputs, developed us ing Cincinnati Children's estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that the market participants would use. Such inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierar chy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Determining where an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. In determining fair value, Cincinnati - 13 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) Children's utilizes valuation techniques that maximi ze the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. The table below includes the major categorization for debt and equity securities on the basis of the nature and risk of the investments at June 30, 2015. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Marketable Securities : U.S. Government and agency securities $ - $197,909 $ - Foreign bonds - 6,462 - Municipal bonds - 2,790 - Bond mutual funds 1,864 - - Common stock 170 - - Asset backed securities - 28,392 - Corporate obligations - 432,758 - 2,034 668,311 - Assets Limited As To Use: Mon ey market mutual funds 9,836 - - 9,836 - - Deferred Compensation Plans (included in Other Assets): Cash 2,386 - - Common stock 3,534 - - Mutual Funds: Money Market 145 - - Equity 2,921 - - International Equity 1,095 - - Bond 1,342 - - Lifecycle 3,434 - - Real Estate 268 - - Variable Annuities: Bond - 98 - Equity - 324 - International Equity - 128 - Money Market - 18 - Guaranteed Insurance Contract - - 3,069 15,125 568 3,069 Total $26,995 $668,879 $3,069 - 14 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The table below includes the major categorization fo r debt and equity securities on the basis of the nature and risk of the investments at June 30, 2014. Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Marketable Securities : U.S. Government and agency securities $ - $225,808 $ - Municipal bonds - 2,383 - Certificates of Deposit - 251 - Common stock 163 - - Corporate obligations - 160,534 - 163 388,976 - Assets Limited As To Use: Corporate bonds - 24,022 - Money market mutual funds 13,075 - - U.S. government securities - 1,000 - 13,075 25,022 - Investments in Private Investment Funds (included in Other Assets): High Yield Corporate Obligations - 34 - - 34 - Deferred Compensation Plans (included in Other Assets): Common stock 3,184 - - Mutual Funds: Money Market 242 - - Equity 2,513 - - International Equity 1,818 - - Bond 1,013 - - Lifecycle 2,548 - - Real Estate 139 - - Variable Annuities: Bond - 230 - Equity - 883 - International Equity - 180 - Money Market - 23 - Real Estate Pooled - 217 - Guaranteed Insurance - - 5,251 11,457 1,533 5,251 Total $24,695 $415,565 $5,251 - 15 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although management believes its valuation methods are a ppropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assu mptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Cincinnati Children's uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of common stock and mutual funds; such items are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Cincinnati Children's primarily bases fair value fo r investments in fixed income securities, including US government securities, municipal bonds and corpor ate obligations on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the te rms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and considers the counterparty credit ra ting. Such items are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Investments in private investment funds are valued by net asset value, as published and determined by the fund manager. Cincinnati Children's investment in High Yield Cor porate Obligations is an investment in a limited liability company whose investment objective is to ach ieve superior fixed income returns on invested funds through exposure to higher quality, less volatile, hi gh yield debt securities. As set forth in the LLC agreement, the LLC will dissolve on March 29, 2040, but may dissolve earlier under certain conditions. Any Investing Member may elect to w ithdraw, in whole or in part from the LLC on the last business day of any month or at such other date, as determined by the manager. ASC 825 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Entities that elect the fair value op tion will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Cincinnati Child ren's elected to measure its high yield corporate obligation investment fund under the provisions of ASC 825. In the future, Cincinnati Children's may elect to measure certain additional financial in struments at fair value in accordance with this standard. The guaranteed insurance contract is recorded based on discounted cash flows, which is an approximation of fair value. Cincinnati Children's Level 3 investment is primar ily in a guaranteed insurance contract. This investment is classified as Level 3 based on time restrictions for redemption. - 16 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The following is a reconciliation of the roll forward of the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs for fiscal 2015: Balance at July 1, 2014 $5,251 Purchases 1,266 Unrealized gains (losses) (112) Sales (3,336) Balance at June 30, 2015 $ 3,069 The amount of total gains or losses for the period included in changes in net assets attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held at June 30, 2015 $(112) The following is a reconciliation of the roll forward of the fair value m easurem e nts using significant unobservable inputs for fiscal 2014: Balance at July 1, 2013 $5,150 Purchases 2,742 Unrealized gains 149 Sales (2,790) Balance at June 30, 2014 $5,251 The amount of total gains or losses for the period included in changes in net assets attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to assets still held at June 30, 2014 $149 Cincinnati Children's policy is to recognize transfers in and out as of the actual date of the event or change in circum stances that caused the transfer. For the y ears ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no significant transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3. (p) Property and Equipment--Property and equipmen t are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to forty years, as follows: Land Improvements 3-25 years Buildings and Building Improvements 5-40 years Equipment 3-25 years Amortization of assets leased under capital leases is included in depreciation. Cincinnati Children's evaluates long-lived assets under the provisions of ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment\". During fiscal 2015 and 2014, Cinc innati Children's recorded losses of $7,111 and - 17 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) $8,101, respectively, related to impairment of land values based on a fair market value assessment of the estimated sales price Cincinnati Children's would expect to receive upon sale of this land. (q) Costs of Borrowing--Interest incurred on borrowe d funds, net of interest earned on restricted bond funds, during the period of construction of capital asset s is capitalized as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. In fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, Cincinnati Children's capitalized $843 and $336 of interest related to constr uction in progress. Total cash paid for interest was approximately $18,720 and $14,629 and in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred bond issuance costs and original issue disc ounts are amortized using the effective interest method over the period the relate d obligation is outstanding. (r) Temporarily Restricted Net Assets--Temporarily restricted net assets are those whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors to a specific purpose. Temporarily restricted net assets and net assets released from donor restrictions are primarily comprised of net assets restricted to support operations. Substantially all of these ne t assets are restricted by donors to support research, education and other advances in clinical care and prevention. The amount of temporarily restricted net assets whose use by Cincinnati Children's has been limited by donors for a specific purpose was $139,486 and $135,348 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Temporarily restricted net assets related to assets held in endowments at supporting organizations on Cincinnati Children's behalf are either donor restrict ed to support research at Cincinnati Children's or deferred gift programs where the restriction is a time restriction tied to the life expectancy of the donor. The amount of temporarily restricted net assets held at supporting organizations was $18,655 and $17,961 at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (s) Permanently Restricted Net Assets--Permanently restricted net assets are restricted by the donor to be maintained in perpetuity and are recorded in Inte rest in Net Assets of Supporting Organizations in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sh eets as they are held by supporting organizations. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, permanently restricted net assets consisted of the following amounts with expendable investment income restricted by donors to be used for the following purposes: 2015 2014 Research activities $1,098,777 $1,080,199 Clinical activities Cincinnati Children' s perm anently restricted net assets have been invested by supporting organizations in primarily marketable securities. (t) Excess of Revenues Over Expenses--The Consolidat ed Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets include \"excess of revenues over expenses.\" Changes in unrestricted net assets which are excluded from excess of revenues over expenses in clude receipts from supporting organizations, transfers to supporting organizati ons, pension and post retirement health liability adjustment, and contributions of long-lived assets (including asset s acquired using contributions which by donor restrictions were to be used for the purpose of acquiring such assets). - 18 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) (u) Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues a nd expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (v) New Accounting Pronouncements - - In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).\" ASU 2014-09 will eliminate the transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance currently in place under generally accepted accounting principles and will replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 was amended by ASU 2015-14 and will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adopti on is prohibited. Management has not yet evaluated the impact of ASU 2014-09 on consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 \"Simplif ying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\". ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. ASU 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 with application a pplied retrospectively. Management does not believe this will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07 \"Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent ).\" The amendments in this Update remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hi erarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all invest ments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. ASU 2015-07 will be effective for fiscal years begi nning after December 15, 2016, with application applied retrospectively; earlier application is perm itted. Management does not believe this will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. (2) Losses on the Provision of Uncom p ensated Care- In accordance with its m ission and purpose, Cincinnati Children' s m aintains a policy of providing medically necessary services to pediatric patients within its primary service area regardless of ability to pay. This primary service area has been defined to include th e four counties in Ohio, three counties in Kentucky and one county in Indiana that geographically surround Cincinnati. Under certain circumstances, Cincinnati Children's accepts patients from outside the primary service area regardless of their ability to pay. Cincinnati Children's defines indigent patient care as services rendered to patients whose families' annual income or net worth falls below certain mini mum standards. As such, losses absorbed by the Medical Center in rendering services to patients w ho are covered under governmental programs which are designed to aid low income families (primarily the Medicaid program) are considered indigent patient care. - 19 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) The following information summarizes uncompensated care provided during the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014: 2015 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,247,823 $288,573 $1,536,396 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 26,324 3,266 29,590 Other uncollectible self pay, at established charges 19,195 9,526 28,721 Total Medicaid, charity care and other uncollectible self pay charges $1,293,342 $301,365 $1,594,707 COSTS/LOSSES Estimated $ 572,923 $ 143,600 $ 716,523 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (417,034) (40,435) (457,469) Losses on the provision of uncompensated care (155,889) (103,165) (259,054) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 29,955 - 29,955 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy ($ 125,934) ($103,165) ($ 229,099) 2014 CHARGES Hospital Physician Total Charges under Medicaid and other entitlement programs $1,013,866 $253,415 $1,267,281 Charity care not eligible for Medicaid assistance, at established charges 35,072 4,665 39,737 Other uncollectible self pay, at established charges 26,141 10,838 36,979 Total Medicaid, charity care and other uncollectible self pay charges $1,075,079 $268,918 $1,343,997 Reimbursement from Medicaid programs (377,063) (41,696) (418,759) on the provision of uncompensated care (93,023) (89,806) (182,829) Funds received from HCAP and tax levy 29,641 - 29,641 Losses on provision of uncompensated care net of HCAP and tax levy ($63,382) ($89,806) ($153,188) The 2015 and 2014 cost amounts reflected in the tables a bove are calculated using cost to charge ratios calculated from prior y ear cost reports as the current year cost report is not yet available. Management does not believe that the difference in the cost report year would have a material impact on the amounts calculated. - 20 -Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively (dollars in thousands) (3) Tax Levy Funds- Under an agreem ent with Ham ilton County , Ohio (the County), Cincinnati Children's receives tax- supported funding from the County to reimburse Cincinna ti Children's for the provision of charity care to the County's indigent residents.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financ ial statements, we conside red Cincinnati Children's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincin nati Children's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the e ffectiveness of Cincinnati Child ren's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allo w management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned fu nctions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a mat erial misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely ba sis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less s evere than a material weakne ss, yet important enough to merit attention by those c harged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpo se described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal contr ol that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limita tions, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be mater ial weaknesses. However, material weaknesse s may exist that have not been identified. Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Cincinn ati Children's consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, w e performed tests of its comp liance with certain provisi ons of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and mat erial effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providin g an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit , and accordingly, we do not e xpress such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that a re required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . - 50 - Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of o ur testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the e ffectiveness of Cincinnati Children's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit perf ormed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Cincinnati Child ren's internal control and comp liance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose. October 21, 2015 - 51 - REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY OMB CIRCULAR A-133 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Trustees Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliates Cincinnati, Ohio Report on Compliance for Ea ch Major Federal Program We have audited Children's Hospital Medical Center and Affiliat es (\"Cincinnati Children's\") compliance with the types of compliance requir ements described in the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Cincinnati Children's maj or federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2015. Cincinnati Children's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findi ngs and questioned costs. Management's Responsibility Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants applicable to its federal programs. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for e ach of Cincinnati Children's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements refe rred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with aud iting standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local Governme nts, and Non-Profit Organizations . Those standards and OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan and perfo rm the audit to obtain r easonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the t ypes of compliance requirements referred to above that c ould have a direct and material effect on a major fede ral program occurr ed. An audit i ncludes examining, on a te st basis, evidence about Cincinnati Children's compliance with those requirements and pe rforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our o pinion on compliance for e ach major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Ci ncinnati Children's compliance. Opinion on Each Majo r Federal Program In our opinion, Cincinnati Children's complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federa l programs for the year ended June 30, 2015. Report on Internal Control over Compliance Management of Cincinnati Children's is responsible for establis hing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the typ es of compliance requ irements referred t o above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Cincinnati Children's internal contro l over compliance with the types of requirements - 52 - that could have a direct and mat erial effect on each major fede ral program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstan ces for the purpose of express ing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over complia nce in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness o f internal control over co mpliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Cincinnati Ch ildren's internal control over compliance. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over complian ce does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal p rogram on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or co mbination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possib ility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a fed eral program will not be prevent ed, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combin ation of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requ irement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal c ontrol over compliance, yet im portant enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for t he limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significan t deficiencies. We did not ide ntify any deficiencies i n internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may ex ist that have not been identified. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testin g based on the requirements of OMB Circular A-133. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. Report on Schedule of Expenditu res of Federal Awards Required b y OMB Circular A-133 We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Cincin nati Children's as of and for the year ended June 30, 2015, and have issued our report thereon dated October 21, 2015 , which contained an unmodified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by OM B Circular A-133 and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the resp onsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underly ing accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures a pplied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, incl uding compari ng and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the con solidated financial statement s or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedure s in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the s chedule of expenditure of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
