Spiritual healing rituals are one of the best ways to heal your mind, body, and soul and bring inner harmony and balance. They are the perfect way to heal all the things that weigh you down and help you always act out of a place from inner peace. In these modern times, where we struggle to keep it together, healing ourselves with rituals is the best way to bring inner balance. When you are properly balanced and harmonized, it's almost like you are finally able to breathe after an eternity of almost choking. It's finally experiencing how life is supposed to be, instead of half-living your entire life. So, how can healing rituals help you heal your issues and create the life of your dreams?What Are Spiritual Healing Rituals?The best decisions we make are the decisions we make when we are in perfect tune with ourselves, which is why it's so important to devote time to ourselves, understand what's happening within ourselves, and then heal the imbalance. Spiritual healing rituals have been performed ever since the dawn of time, and they held our spirits whole and intact. However, as time went by, life became more complicated, and we entered the modern era of distraction. As days go by, we are pulling ourselves more and more away from our inner issues, and we try to sweep them under the rug - and that hasn't been working out for us for a long time. That's why the need for using spiritual healing rituals is bigger than ever, and more and more people are trying to incorporate healing rituals into their lives. How Many Types Of Spiritual Rituals Are There? There are countless spiritual healing rituals that you can create for yourself. Here are some of them:Crystal HealingCrystal healing rituals are rituals that use crystals to help you heal certain imbalances within your body. Sometimes you hold the crystals in your hands and meditate with them, other times the crystals are placed on certain parts of your body, they can be charged and set with intentions and placed in your home, to enhance healing energies, they can be formed in crystal grids, or you can become a part of a human crystal grid to further enhance healing. There are countless healing rituals with crystals and they are the most common tools used for healing. Mostly there is a lot of crystal healing ritual because there are countless crystals in the crystal world that hold different healing frequencies and can be used for a variety of purposes. Shamanic RitualsShamanic rituals are ancient healing rituals performed by shamans. If we could describe Shamans in one word, that would be a healer. Shamans possess knowledge like no other of the herbs that grow in the surroundings, which they use for healing and inducing a Shamanic journey. As well-crafted healers, they were essential for the tribe's survival. However, beyond just being a physical healer, they were healers of all kinds - they helped dispute disagreements, they gave life advice and they helped the tribe members to live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. They were considered as friends to the whole tribe, and they were always consulted in important matters.According to shamans, people who have dealt with trauma in their lives, because of the trauma small pieces of their soul are getting lost in the spirit world, which is why they often feel lost, and are prone to get attacked by negative energy. Whichever type of shamanic healing you require, the job of a shaman is to deduce which kind of healing you are in need of and then guide you through the spiritual realms to get it. A shamanic healing process is different for each person, depending on the issue that needs to be resolved, and different tools can be used for each healing ritual. Travel Through Moon PhasesA lot of people perform healing rituals depending on the moon phase that we are going through. These healing rituals are based on the significance of each moon phase:Waxing Moon - One week after the New Moon, it's the perfect time to act upon the intentions that we've set. The Moon is now moving away from the Sun and receiving more and more light: we're increasingly energized to put our ideas into practice. The waxing of the moon starts immediately after the New Moon of the month. If you have set your intentions on the New Moon then this is the time to start moving on them. Show the universe how badly you want whatever it is you wished for by being open to the opportunities coming your way. Also, get out there and hunt for what you want.Full Moon - Two weeks after the New Moon, we've reached the half and the peak of the cycle: the moment when what has been unfolding until now is being fully realized. The bold moonlight brings to surface our progress from the past two weeks and, in a more general sense, from the past 6 months, since the New Moon that took place in this Full Moon's sign. Depending on how things have been working out for us, be it through personal effort, divine inspiration or ideally both, this is either a time of celebration or of reconsideration. Either way, it can get intense. Try not to put yourself down for what has passed- if possible, postpone any self-critique tendencies for when the Full Moon passes, your head clears again and you can look back at the situation with more calm.Waning Moon - One week after the Full Moon, light has waned enough for Luna to appear diminished in the sky. The next phase of the cycle comes naturally: after something flourished or came to a conclusion (Full Moon), we wind down, relax, and start reflecting on what has passed. It's a receptive phase that doesn't encourage us to start something new but to analyze the past weeks and the last half of the year to find out successful points, as well as flaws in our strategy. What have you been nailing? What needs improvement? Now we're supported to shed things that no longer serve our well-being and our growth, as well as to bask in the afterglow of the seductive Full Moon.New Moon - Before things are put into motion, the New Moon moment offers a space of stillness, a white page where anything could happen. This is the perfect time to make a list of anything you wish to manifest in the future, create a vision board of an area in your life you desire to change, or even light a candle to signify the need for change. Anyone new who comes into your life around this time could be of significance, as they more than likely bring some sort of gift of healing and learning for you. Also, if you want to make a change to your appearance or start a new wellness routine, making this change or starting this new habit around the New Moon gives it an extra kick.Chakra Balancing RitualsThe chakras within you are energy centers that are energized by life energy. Then, as each chakra is supplied with energy, the chakra transforms the energy into a specific type of energy that you need to function properly. The seven chakras represent the seven energy centers in your body. Placed in a vertical line along the length of your spine, each chakra has a different function in your life. When your chakras are balanced, no matter what storm comes in your life - you will always endure it. They are: Root Chakra - Center of balance and security. Sacral Chakra - Center of passion and creativity. Solar Plexus Chakra - Center of personal power and inner drive. Heart Chakra - Center of your capacity to love, and be loved. Throat Chakra - Center of truth and self-expression. Third Eye Chakra - Center of intuition and connection with your inner self. Crown Chakra - Center of connection with the Universe and the world. Manifesting RitualsBesides only healing blocks and getting rid of negative energy, healing rituals can also be used for manifesting your own damn magic. Depending on the tools you use, you can also create healing rituals to attract the right kind of energy from the Universe so that you can find and open the right path for creating your own damn magic. One of the best tools for manifestation are candles, but you can also use a lot of other tools for manifesting rituals.Reiki Healing RitualsReiki healing is a special Japanese technique for natural healing. The idea behind reiki is that everyone alive possesses special energy called life energy or ki. When our life energy is low, we are more likely to get sick or to get plagued with negative thoughts. When we are in abundance of life energy, we are stronger, healthier, and more joyful. The point of Reiki Healing is through each session to work on increasing your life energy so that you can live a better life.Custom Healing RitualsBesides all of the healing rituals that we listed above there are a ton of other types of rituals, and also custom rituals crafted specifically for a special purpose for a specific person. Sometimes, you just need to get really specific for the healing to be more successful. These are much harder to pull off but are well worth it. If you need a custom healing ritual crafted specifically for you, then you can check some of our custom healing rituals over here.When Is The Best Time To Practice Healing Rituals?Timing is everything in healing rituals. And a little astrology can help you with that, or using the moon phases can help you to time things up appropriately. For example, there are a lot of astrological events that bring different energy that can be good or bad for certain things - like for example if you are trying to move forward during a Mercury Retrograde, you are probably not going to move an inch forward because this is a time for reflecting. Because there are a lot of astrological happenings, you might be having a hard time to track them all down on your own, so perhaps signing up to our mailing list can make that easier for you.If you want to make things simpler for yourself then perhaps following the moon phases can simplify things for you - set intentions during the New Moon and p...", "sitename": "My Little Magic Shop", "date": "2021-02-06", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual Healing Rituals: How To Incorporate Them In Your Life?

Making your own healing ritual can sure be tough work, but it's well worth it. A lot of people are struggling to create their own custom rituals because they simply don't know where to start. Here are a few tips to help you make your own healing ritual: Decide on a purpose Your healing ritual has to have a strong purpose behind it. Of course, you can create a healing ritual for overall well-being; however, it's much better to create a ritual with a more specific purpose. We recommend that when you think of your purpose you should think somewhere along these lines: your ritual should be for cleansing negative energy, removing inner blocks, or attracting specific energy in your life to help you achieve your goals. You can, of course, go into more specifics as you go along, but if you are just starting out, these directions and more general types of healing rituals will be the most efficient, and much easier to create & pull off. Identify The Issue The best way to create your healing ritual is to properly identify the issue that you are facing. So, you aren't feeling like you are the most magical self - but that's not enough to specifically treat the issue that you are facing. Sit down and think about the emotions that you are facing and the struggles that you are having. Analyze them thoroughly, and see to which way they point. We recommend starting figuring out what kind of shapes your chakras are so that you can more easily identify the issue. Chakras are super important energy centers in your body, and when one of your chakras or more is out of balance you can see those imbalances throughout your life. By listing down the things that you struggle with and comparing them with chakra imbalance symptoms you can more easily determine what kind of ritual you need, and what exactly are you facing at the moment. Choose The Right Tools Okay gorgeous, now that you explored the issue, chose the right time for the ritual, it's time to choose the right tools. The tools you use during each ritual can be the same, or different depending on the purpose of your ritual. For example, using a Selenite stick can enhance energy and also cut toxic ties, depending on how it's used. Every tool that you choose, regardless of whether it's a crystal, essential oil, or candles can be used in many different ways, depending on what you want to work on during your ritual. Doing the proper research for each and every one of the tools that you have for a specific ritual, and how to use them properly so that they can help you bring the purpose of your ritual to life. Make The Time All of these steps take a lot of time - the research, the timing, choosing the tools, and then performing the ritual, however, your spiritual wellbeing and inner balance are well worth it. Devoting the time for yourself, and making sure that you are healthy in every moment of existence, and that you are capable to create your own damn magic is super important!
