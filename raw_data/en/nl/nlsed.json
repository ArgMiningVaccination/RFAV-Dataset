The Plan serves as the application for CCDF funds by providing a description of, and assurance about, the grantee's child care program and all services available to eligible families. OCC asked States and Territories to write their Plans based on a reasonable interpretation of the Act, pending completion of a final regulation. States and Territories had the option to outline an implementation plan for one or all of the 26 new areas if the State/Territory was not yet able to certify compliance. Thus, these Plans are conditionally approved until each State/Territory fully implements all new requirements of the CCDBG Act of 2014. The OCC will partner with States and Territories to support and monitor the successful and timely implementation of all provisions of the Act. As provided for in the applicable statutes and regulations, the Lead Agency has the flexibility to amend their program at any time. All amendments must be submitted to OCC for approval within 60 days of the effective of the change. Please find the following two documents within this PDF: 20162018 District of Columbia CCDF Plan Conditional Approval Letter - OCC issued a letter with the conditions of approval for each State and Territory. In reviewing plans and waiver/extension requests, OCC gave careful consideration to the statutory conditions outlined in the Act, as well as the length of time requested, with the goal of having all provisions related to the Act fully implemented by October 1, 2018 corresponding to the start of the FY20192021 CCDF Plan period. The approval letter covers the CCDF Plan for the period of June 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018. A \"conditionally approved\" plan is a fully approved plan with conditions to be met based on waiver requests, if applicable, and implementation and corrective action plans for unmet requirements. The conditions will be deemed fully met once all provisions in the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 are fully implemented. 20162018 District of Columbia CCDF Plan The Plan describes the CCDF program to be administered by District of Columbia for the period 6/1/2016 - 9/30/2018 as conditionally approved by OCC. The Plan serves as the application for CCDF funds by providing a description of, and assurance about, the grantee's child care program and all services available to eligible families. As provided for in the applicable statutes and regulations, the Lead Agency has the flexibility to modify this program at any time, including amending the options selected or described. For purposes of simplicity and clarity, the specific provisions of applicable laws printed therein are sometimes paraphrases of, or excerpts and incomplete quotations from, the full text. NOTE: The CCDF Plan reflects the services and activities as reported by the District of Columbia Lead Agency in their CCDF Plans for Fiscal Years 20162018. The CCDF Plans offer a snapshot into current and planned efforts, initiatives and implementation plans for each State/Territory through September 30, 2018. These Plans are not a catalog of all activities undertaken by the State/Territory. Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is not responsible for the contents of these CCDF plans. 330 C Street, S.W., Washington DC 20201 I www.acf .hhs.gov June 13, 2016 Hanseul Kang, State Superintendent Office of the State Superintendent of Education, Division of Early Leaming (OSSE) 810 First Street NE Washington, DC 20001 Dear State Superintendent Kang: The Office of Child Care (OCC) recognizes that there are many new requirements included in the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 that you are working to implement during this Plan period. We appreciate the time and energy that you put into developing your Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Plan to reform and effectively administer your program. I am pleased to inform you that the District of Columbia CCDF Plan for the period of June 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, has been conditionally approved. A \"conditionally approved \" plan is a fully approved plan with conditions to be met based on your waiver requests, if applicable, and implementation plans for unmet requirements. The conditions will be deemed fully met once all provisions in the CCDBG Act of 2014 are fully implemented and implementation plan action steps are completed. At that time the District of Columbia CCDF Plan will be approved without conditions. OCC gave careful consideration to the statutory conditions outlined in the Act, as well as the length of time requested , with the goal of having all provisions related to the Act fully implemented by October 1, 2018 corresponding to the start of the FY2019-2021 CCDF Plan period . The following conditions apply to your CCDF Plan: Waiver Requests -The CCDBG Act of 2014 gives the Secretary the option to waive statutory provisions or penalties for up to 3 years if certain statutory conditions are met. Background Check provisions were not considered under this waiver implementation process because the Act provided for a separate extension Page 2 -Hanseul Kang , State Superintendent process for States and Territories unable to comply by September 30, 2017. Decisions regarding your waiver requests are listed below. Your waiver request(s) for Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan (1.8.1) has been approved through the date listed in your Implementation Plan, not to exceed one year. Your waiver request for Background Checks (5.3.1) will be on hold for now since OCC will not make a decision on requests at this time. The Administration for Children and Families considers health and safety training critical to reducing risk of injury and death for children receiving assistance. According to the Program Instruction CCDF-ACF -PI-2015-09 issued December 2015, all new and existing caregivers and teachers serving children receiving CCDF assistance must have completed these training requirements by this date. The District of Columbia will not meet the health and safety training provision by the effective date of September 30 , 2016; therefore you will be on a Corrective Action Plan starting October 1, 2016. You will now have an additional year to achieve this goal. You have 60 days following receipt of this letter to formally submit your extended timeline for implementing this requirement , not to exceed one year, by completing or revising the Implementation Plan at 5.l .6b in the ACF -118 system. Key principles of the CCDF are to provide equal access to child care for children receiving child care assistance and to ensure parental choice. Provider payment rates set too low undermine these principles . As you are aware, the CCDBG Act of 2014 requires states and territories to take the cost of quality into account when setting rates, and to set rates based on the results of the most recent market rate survey or alternative methodology. We continue to be concerned that your rates may not allow for equal access. OCC plans to make review of payment rates a priority for our upcoming implementation monitoring visits. Thus , the conditional approval of your Plan does not constitute a final determination that your payment rates are sufficient to provide access to child care services for eligible families that are comparable to those provided to families that do not receive subsidies, as required by law. You will receive a Notice of Grant Award in October 2016 from the Office of Administration in the Administration for Children and Families. The notice will include the amount of your award and any additional terms and conditions for the receipt of Page 3-Hanseul Kang, State Superintendent CCDF program funds. During the effective period of this plan, any substantial changes to the District of Columbia program must be submitted as a plan amendment to your Regional Office for approval in accordance with 45 CFR 98.18(b). We remind you that your CCDF-funded child care program for in-home providers must comply with all applicable Federal laws and regulations, including Federal wage and income tax laws governing domestic workers. Questions regarding Federal wage laws should be directed to your local or district office of the Wage and Hour Division within the U.S. Department of Labor. Likewise, questions regarding Federal income tax laws should be directed to your local or district office of the Internal Revenue Service. We look forward to working together toward implementation of the CCDBG Act of 2014 and promoting the early learning and development of children along with family economic stability and success. Ifyou have any questions, please contact Beverly Wellons, Child Care Program Manager, Office of Child Care at (215) 861-4020 or Beverly.wellons@acf.hhs.gov. Thank you for all you do each day for children and families. Sincerely, Rachel Schumacher Director Office of Child Care cc: Elizabeth Groginsky, Assistant Superintendent of Early Leaming Nicholas Kent, Director of Policy, Planning and Research Beverly Wellons, Regional Program Manager, Office of Child Care Region III Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Plan For District of Columbia FFY 2016-2018 1 Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems Implementation of the requirements of the CCDBG Act of 2014 will require leadership and coordination between the child care assistance program and other child- and family-serving agencies, services, and supports at the state and local levels. ACF recognizes that each grantee must identify the most appropriate entities and individuals to lead and participate in implementation based on the context within that State or Territory. This will include those that manage various components of CCDF-funded activities and requirements (fiscal, subsidy, health and safety monitoring, and continuous quality improvement) as well as other public and private partners. This section collects information to help ACF understand the stakeholders convened and consulted to develop the Plan, where authority lies to make policy decisions and program changes, and who is responsible for implementing the blueprint for action the Plan describes. For example, the law requires that, at the option of the Tribes, State/Territory Lead Agencies must collaborate and coordinate with Indian tribes or tribal organizations in the State in a timely manner in the development of the CCDF Plan. ACF expects that new requirements in the law will necessitate that grantees build partnerships with other agencies and organizations to better link the children and families receiving financial assistance to information, services and resources regarding other programs for which they may be eligible, including developmental screenings for children, and other resources (also in section 2). In addition, States and Territories must describe how public-private partnerships are being used to increase the supply and quality of child care services. 1.1 CCDF Leadership The Governor of a State or Territory shall designate an agency (which may be an appropriate collaborative agency), or establish a joint inter-agency office, to represent the State (or Territory) as the Lead Agency.

Describe: 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that States and Territories have the option to combine funding for CCDF child care services with funding for any of the required programs listed in 1.4.1. These include programs operating at the Federal, State and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with disabilities, homeless children, and children in foster care. (658E(c)(2)(O))(ii)) Combining funds could include blending multiple funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams in an District of Columbia Page 23 of 223effort to expand and/or enhance services for children and families to allow for delivery of comprehensive high quality care that meets the needs of children and families. For example, State/Territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a State/Territory may allow county/local government to use coordinated funding streams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer CCDF funds with additional funding sources to pay for full-day, full-year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start or State/Territory pre-kindergarten requirements in addition to State/Territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, per the OMB Compliance Supplement governing audits (https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133_compliance_supplement_2014), CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start (CFDA 93.600) programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head Start and the CCDF is mandated by sections 640(g)(2)(D) and (E), and 642(c) of the Head Start Act (42 USC 9835(g)(2)(D) and (E); 42 USC 9837(c)) in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services (42 USC 9835(a)(5)(v)). In order to implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment or materials, grantees may blend several funding streams so that seamless services are provided. 1.5.1 Will you combine CCDF funds with the funds for any program with which you coordinate (described in 1.4.1)? Yes, If yes, describe at a minimum: How do you define \"combine\" Layered Funding Which funds will you combine Locally Appropriated Funds, Office of Head Start, and CCDF Funds Goal(s) of combining funds (why?) and expected outcomes, such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full-day, full-year programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations Funds are combined to support job embedded professional development, continuous quality child care, linkages and supports forcomprehensive services. Method of fund allocation (how you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the State/Territory level, local level, program level?) Funds will be combined at the program and state level through grants to sub-recipient organizations and contracts. District of Columbia Page 24 of 223How are the funds tracked and method of oversight OSSE uses an electronic grants management system (EGMS) to track all grant funds and expenditures. Additionally, on-site reviews are conducted to review compliance and eligibility. All sub-recipients are required to submit A-133 audits and/or financial statements on an annual basis. The OSSE Director of Operations and Management in the Division of Early Learning establishes the spending plans and tracks and monitors all expenditures. The DC Office of Contracts and Procurement oversees all contracts for OSSE. No. 1.6 Public-Private Partnerships The CCDBG Act of 2014 adds a new provision that requires States and Territories to describe in the Plan how the State/Territory encourages partnerships among State/Territory and public agencies, tribal organizations, private entities, faith based organizations and/or community- based organizations to leverage existing service delivery systems for child care and development services and to increase the supply and quality of child care services for children through age 12, such as by implementing voluntary shared services alliance models (i.e., cooperative agreement among providers to pool resources to pay for shared fixed costs and operation). (658E(c)(2)(P)) ACF expects these types of partnerships to leverage public and private resources to further the goals of reauthorization. 1.6.1 Describe the entities with whom and the levels at which the State/Territory is partnering (level - State/Territory, county/local, and/or programs), the goals of the partnerships, method of partnering. Include in your description examples of activities that have resulted from partnerships with other State/Territory and public agencies, tribal organizations, private entities, faith based organizations or community-based organizations, and how the partnerships are expected to leverage existing service delivery systems for child care and development services and to increase the supply and quality of child care services. Through the Early Head Start Child Care Partnership grant, OSSE established the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), a public private partnership with three neighborhood based \"hubs\" that provide quality services and supports to a network of child development centers and homes. This model willuse Early Head Start Program Performance Standards to increase the supply of high-quality infant and toddler care in the District. To achieve the goal of enhancing young children's school readiness, the QIN sites provide comprehensive services to promote District of Columbia Page 25 of 223the overall health, development, and well-being of infants and toddlers and their families. QIN agencies set goals that promote: Family Well-Being; Positive Parent-Child Relationships; Families as Lifelong Educators; Families as Learners; Family Engagement in Transitions; Family Connections to Peers and Community; and Families as Advocates and Leaders. OSSE is leveraging resources from District agencies to accomplish efficiencies and improve effectiveness and system coordination. To this end, OSSE has established the QIN Interagency Steering Committee comprised of the following city agencies: Department of Health, Department of Behavioral Health, Health Care Financing, Child and Family Services Agency, and the Department of Human Services. The Interagency Steering Committee meets monthly to discuss specific areas of coordination and supports for the child care partners and the families and children they serve. Through this committee the agencies provide professional development and technical assistance in their specific areas of expertise to leverage existing programs that can support families in achieving their goals in areas such as employment training, economic self-sufficiency, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. With the support of private philanthropy, OSSE will conduct a comprehensive implementation and impact evaluation of the QIN as it pertains to children, families, teachers, and administrators. The evaluation will explore how the EHS-CC partnership is implemented, the effectiveness of strategies, and resulting outcomes. This documentation at multiple levels of the intervention, focusing on the quality of the child care classrooms; the level of broader service delivery, focusing on the ancillary services all families receive; and the level of the participant, focusing on child, family and staff experiences will assess the effectiveness of the services provided from multiple perspectives. A local foundation has committed $10 million to support the enhancement and improvement of infant and toddler care in the District of Columbia over the next five years. A portion of this funding will support a shared services platform for all DC child development providers, provide funding to build the supply of quality infant and toddler care in the highest need areas of the city wards 7 and 8, and support two fellows at OSSE that will focus on early childhood data and policy initiatives. Another group of philanthropists are supporting DC and the surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia in developing a Regional Early Care and Education Workforce Implementation Network to participate in the National Implementation Network focused on implementing the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council of the National Academies, Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8: A Unifying Foundation. 1.7 Coordination with Local or Regional Child Care Resource and Referral Systems District of Columbia Page 26 of 223 States may use funds to support or establish Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R systems (also see section 7.4). If they do, there are specific requirements for CCR&Rs (658E(c)(3)(B)(iii)) These include: -Provide families with information on a full range of child care options (including faith-based, community-based child care centers and family child care homes, nontraditional hours and emergency child care centers) in their local area or region -To the extent practicable, work directly with families who receive child care assistance to offer the families support and assistance in making an informed decision about child care options in an effort to ensure families are enrolling their children in the most appropriate child care setting to suit their needs and that is of high quality as determined by the State/Territory -Collect data and provide information on the coordination of services and supports, including services provided through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for children with disabilities -Collect data and provide information on the supply of and demand for child care services in local areas or regions of the State/Territory and submit such information to the State/Territory -Work to establish partnerships with public agencies and private entities, including faith- based and community-based child care centers and family child care homes providers, to increase the supply and quality of child care services in the State/Territory -As appropriate, coordinate their activities with the activities of the Lead Agency and/or local agencies that administer CCDF. Nothing in statute prohibits States from using CCR&Ragencies to conduct or provide additional services beyond those required by statute above. 1.7.1 Does the State fund a system of local or regional CCR&R organizations? Yes. The State/Territory funds a CCR&R system. See also related follow-up questions in Section 7.1 and 7.4. If yes, the local or regional referral agency is required to do all of the activities listed here . See also related follow-up questions in Section 7.1 and 7.4. Does the CCR&R system provide all services identified below: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), Division of Early Learning contracts with a local organization to provide Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) services. The CCR&R helps families identify and select child care, provides information about the quality of licensed early childhood programs, and develops resources to help families understand program quality. It supports families who need District of Columbia Page 27 of 223child care resources via telephone and through an online searchable database. The CCR&R also provides materials and supports to child development providers. Additionally, OSSE develops grants, MOUs, and contracts with public and private agencies that provide scholarships for Child Development Associates (CDAs) and T.E.A.C.H. scholarships to support professionals that work in DC child development centers in obtaining early childhood degrees. OSSE's Part C program provides consultation and technical assistance as needed to child development facilities. By September 2017, OSSE will develop a CCR&R network of public and private agencies that work collaboratively to deliver high quality services and supports to families seeking child care including parent education and outreach and resources and supports for child development providers including scholarship funding, professional development, and technical assistance. No. The State/Territory does not fund a CCR&R system and has no plans to establish. Use section 7.4 to describe plans, if any, to establish a CCR&R system. 1.8 Disaster Preparedness and Response Plan The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a requirement that States must include a Statewide Child Care Disaster Plan for coordination of activities with the State/Territory human services agency, emergency management agency, child care licensing agency, State/Territory local resource and referral agencies, and the State Advisory Council (SAC) or other state-designated cross-agency body if there is no SAC.

State and Territory child care systems interact with parents in multiple ways, therefore presenting many opportunities to engage and inform families. Child care providers can serve as convenient and trusted sources of information for parents and family members on child development and community supports and services. State/Territory and local child care assistance systems should be designed to promote seamless linkages to useful information and other child- and family-services, such as during subsidy intake and redetermination processes and when parents utilize child care resource and referral or QRIS agencies. Outreach and consumer education is an ongoing process and is expected to cover the entire age span covered by CCDF from birth through age 12. The CCDBG Act of 2014 includes key purposes that address the role of parents as child care consumers who need information to make informed choices regarding the services that best suit their needs. A new purpose of CCDBG is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the development of their children in child care settings.\" States and Territories have the opportunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care sites that will support their role as their children's teacher and advocate. Key new provisions include: 1.1. The plan must certify that States and Territories will collect and disseminate consumer and provider education information to CCDF parents, providers, and the general public, including information about: -a) the availability of child care assistance, -b) the quality of child care providers (if available), -c) Other programs (specifically Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Head Start and Early Head Start, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)) for which families may also qualify. -d) Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs and services, District of Columbia Page 31 of 223-e) Research and best practices in child development, and -f) State/Territory policies regarding social- emotional/behavioral and early childhood mental health of young children, which may include positive behavioral intervention and support models, and policies on the expulsion of preschool-aged children (children from birth to five for purposes of this requirement) from early childhood programs receiving CCDF. -2. Information related to the health and safety of children in child care settings. The plan must certify that the State/Territory will make public certain information about the results of health and safety monitoring (described in section 5) using a website that is consumer-friendly and in an easily accessible format, including: -a) Provider-specific information: 1) results of monitoring and inspection reports, including those due to major substantiated complaints; 2) last date of inspection; and 3) information on corrective actions taken (if applicable). -b) Information about: 1) the annual number of deaths; 2) the annual number of serious injuries; and 3) annual number of incidences of substantiated child abuse in child care settings. -c) State/Territory processes for: 1) licensing child care providers; 2) conducting background checks and the offenses that would keep a provider from being allowed to care for children; and 3) conducting monitoring and inspections of child care providers. 2.1 Information about Child Care Financial Assistance Program Availability and Application Process Lead Agencies must inform parents of eligible children and the general public of the process by which they can apply for and potentially receive child care services. (658D(b)(1)(A)), 658E(c)(2)(E)(i)(1)) 2.1.1 Describe how the State/Territory informs families of availability of services. a) How does the State/Territory identify populations and areas of potentially eligible families (e.g., using available federal, State/Territory and local needs assessments to identify potentially eligible families?) OSSE identifies areas in which potentially eligible families are likely to live through a variety of public and private entities, early learning professionals, and contractors in the field whose research reflects local interests and needs. One primary source of information is DC Kids Count, which provides a comprehensive view of DC and identifies Ward-specific demographic information. Through partnership with DOH, DHS, and CFSA, OSSE identifies vulnerable populations and families eligible for SNAP, WIC, and TANF. OSSE utilizes the District of Columbia Page 32 of 223local Head Start grantees community needs assessments, Part C data, and data on homelessness provided by The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness. b) What partners help with outreach? For example, child care resource and referral agencies, home visitors, pediatricians, faith-based services, State/Territory or local agencies and organizations or other familiar and safe access points serving vulnerable or low-income populations. OSSE partners with multiple organizations that offer comprehensive assistance and services, including: housing, legal and employment services; food banks; employment counseling; immigrant and refugee services; and organizations that work to keep vulnerable and high-need families safe, sheltered, healthy, and fed. The local child care resource and referral agency (CCR&R) provides consumer education to families applying for CCDF assistance. Additionally, the CCR&R provides parents with profiles of child care programs including licensing history, location, quality rating information, and a description of the different care options available. These options also include the availability of services for children with special needs, English language learners, services for infants and toddlers, and homeless families.Outreach is available on a public website, and informational brochures are distributed to parents. In addition, the CCR&R shares program information with families through walk-in consultations and telephone referrals. c) What outreach strategies does the Lead Agency use (e.g., media campaigns, State/Territory website, or other electronic outreach? OSSE uses a combination of print, electronic, and digital media to increase the community's awareness of subsidized child care opportunities in the District. In addition, OSSE partners with community-based organizations to co-sponsor community events such as EdFest, Let's Move, and the District of Columbia's Back to School Event for Homeless Families. CCR&R personnel attend each event to discuss and disseminate information about available resources. 2.1.2 How can parents apply for services? Check all that apply. Electronically via online application, mobile app or email. Provide link In-person interview or orientation. District of Columbia Page 33 of 223Describe agencies where these may occur: Parents can visit one of two DC Child Care Services sites administered by the Department of Human Services. Phone Mail At the child care site At a child care resource and referral agency. Through kiosks or online portals at related State/Territory/local agency or organization serving low-income populations. Describe: Through a coordinated application process (e.g., application is linked to other benefits program to allow parents to apply for several programs at one time). Describe: Other strategies.

The State/Territory must make public certain information about the results of such monitoring on a website in a way that is consumer-friendly and in an easily accessible format. (658E(c)(2)(D)) In order for a website to be a useful tool for parents, it should be easy to navigate, with a minimum number of clicks, and in plain language. States and Territories must post the results of the monitoring on the website no later than November 19, 2017. All other components of the website must be completed no later than September 30, 2016. 2.3.1 Describe the status of State/Territory's consumer education website. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above - by March 1, 2016.

The unintentional consequence of child care assistance that is linked to adult work and school obligation is that child care arrangements - and the opportunity for children to form trusting relationships with teachers - are often interrupted and unstable. Child care financial assistance policies that make it easier to get and keep assistance support continuity of care and relationships between the child and child care provider and enable parents to stay employed or complete training/education. Child care support that extends until families are able to pay the full cost of care themselves promotes longer lasting economic stability for families. CCDF funds may support families until they reach 85% of State Median Income (SMI). The CCDBG Act of 2014 included requirements to establish minimum 12-month eligibility and redetermination periods, requiring that States and Territories have a process to account for irregular fluctuations in earnings, a policy ensuring that families' work schedules are not disrupted by program requirements, policies to provide for job search of not less than three (3) months, and to describe policies for graduated phase- out of assistance. The definition of an eligible child includes that a family's assets may not exceed $1,000,000 (as certified by a member of such family). Procedures for enrollment of homeless children pending completion of documentation are also now required. There is nothing in statute to prohibit States from establishing policies that extend eligibility beyond 12 months or establish other similar policies to align program requirements that allow children enrolled in Head Start, Early Head Start, state or local pre-kindergarten and other collaborative programs to finish the program year and to promote continuity for families receiving services through multiple benefits programs. 3.1 Eligible Children and Families In order to be eligible for services, children must (1) be under the age of 13, (2) reside with a family whose income does not exceed 85 percent of the State's median income for a family of the same size, and whose family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 (as certified by a member of such family); and who (3)(a) resides with a parent or parents who are working or attending a job training or educational program; or (b) is receiving, or needs to receive, protective services and District of Columbia Page 56 of 223resides with a parent or parents not described in (3a.). (658P(4)) 3.1.1 Eligibility Criteria Based upon Child's Age a) The CCDF program serves childrenfrom six weeks (weeks/months/years) to 12 years years (through age 12). b) Does the Lead Agency allow CCDF-funded child care for children age 13 and above but below age 19 years who are physically and/or mentally incapable of self- care?(658E(c)(3)(B), 658P(3)) Yes, and the upper age is 18 years (may not equal or exceed age 19). Provide the Lead Agency definition of physical or mental incapacity: This group of applicants includes families with a child (or children) who have a disability or special health care needs, and who is up to age 18 years and 11 months. These are children who do not function according to age-appropriate expectations in one or more of the following areas of development: social/emotional, cognitive, communication, perceptual-motor, physical or behavioral development, or who have chronic health care needs. No c) Does the Lead Agency allow CCDF-funded child care for children age 13 and above but below age 19 years who are under court supervision? (658P(3), 658E(c)(3)(B)) Yes and the upper age is (may not equal or exceed age 19) No. 3.1.2 How does the Lead Agency define the following eligibility terms? a) residing with - A person who is under the age of 18 years, or a person who is 18, 19, or 20 years of age and attending school full time, who lives in the household of and is financially dependent upon a parent or guardian. District of Columbia Page 57 of 223b) in loco parentis - In the place of parents. Individual(s) who has or have been charged through legal action (e.g., law or court order) with the same legal rights, duties, and responsibilities as a parent or legal guardian. 3.1.3 Eligibility Criteria Based on Reason for Care a) How does the Lead Agency define \"working, attending job training and education\" for the purposes of eligibility at the point of determination? Provide a brief description below, including allowable activities and if a minimum number of hours is required by State/Territory (not a federal requirement). * working: An individual engaged in paid employment or in a countable activity at least 20 hours per week.This may include job search activities for up to three months and new applicants who are unemployed for up to three months if the unemployment is due to a layoff and is of no fault of the employee/applicant. OSSE will explore changing the work requirements as we move forward in updating our eligibility policies in 2016. * attending job training An individual who participates in a documented training program at least 20 hours per week; or an educational activity leading to a GED or high school diploma, higher education credental, or other approved training programs.OSSE is currently working with DHS to expand child care access to TANF families and families that are experiencing homelessness by redefining required work hours. OSSE will also partner with the Workforce Interagency Council to ensure alignment with job seekers and identify strategies to remove child care as a barrier for families seeking employment. * attending education An individual may participate in a documented training program at least 20 hours per week; an educational activity that leads to a GED or high school diploma, or other approved training program with additional minimum work requirements. In OSSE's effort to streamline and simplify our child care eligibility policies, we are working with DHS to identify activities and trainings that support family's in moving toward self-sufficiency and ensuretheir children have access to high quality early care and education. b) Does the Lead Agency allow parents to qualify for CCDF assistance on the basis of education and training participation alone (without additional minimum work requirements)? District of Columbia Page 58 of 223Yes. No. If no, describe additional requirements c) Does the Lead Agency provide child care to children in protective services? Yes. If yes, how does the Lead Agency define \"protective services\" for the purposes of eligibility? Provide a brief description below. 1) Definition of protective services - Protective services refers to children involved in the DC child welfare system, including children in the care of foster parents (including kinship families), children placed in protective supervision with their birth parents, and children of teen parents who are in foster care. All of the aforementioned individuals involved in the lives of children in the child welfare system share the need for quality child care to secure the necessary care and support for the child while they are working and/or pursuing job training or further education and to promote the child's overall positive development (The District does not use CCDF funds for respite care for children in protective services). 2) Does the Lead Agency waive the co-payment and income eligibility requirements for cases in which children receive, or need to receive, protective services on a case- by-case basis? (658E(c)(5)) Yes. No. Note - If the Lead Agency elects to provide CCDF-funded child care to children in foster care whose foster care parents are not working, or who are not in education/training activities for CCDF purposes these children are considered to be in protective services and should be included in the protective services definition above. No. 3.1.4 Eligibility Criteria Based on Family Income a) How does the Lead Agency define \"income\" for the purposes of eligibility at the point of determination? * Definition of income - For the purpose of eligibility, the District of Columbia defines \"income\" as participants District of Columbia Page 59 of 223entering the program having an income equal to or less than 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) guidelines for their family size and exit the program when income reaches 300% of FPL upon the annual 12 month redetermination. Countable income is the portion of the annual gross income of the family unit that is considered in computing the copayment. OSSE will clarify oureligibility policies to ensure that families cannot become ineligible during the first 12 months unless they reach 85% SMI. b) Provide the CCDF income eligibility limits in the table below. Complete columns (a) and (b) based upon maximum eligibility initial entry into the CCDF program. Complete Columns (c) and (d) ONLY IF the Lead Agency is using income eligibility limits lower than 85% of the current SMI. Complete columns (e) and (f) with the maximum \"exit\" eligibility level if applicable and below the federal limit of 85% of current SMI. Note - If the income eligibility limits are not statewide, check here Describe how many jurisdictions set their own income eligibility limits Fill in the chart based on the most populous area of the state.

District of Columbia Page 60 of 223 c) SMI Source and year U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey Single Year Estimates 2014: Median Family Income by Family Size d) These eligibility limits in column (c) became or will become effective on: October 1, 2016 e) Provide the link to the income eligibility limits http://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/child_care_subsidy _program_parent_fee_final_rules.pdf 3.1.5 Graduated Phase-Out of Assistance The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that requires States and Territories to provide for a graduated phase-out of assistance for families whose income has increased at the time of re- determination , but remains below the federal threshold of 85% of State median income. Providing a graduated phase-out supports long-term family economic stability by allowing for wage growth and a tapered transition out of the child care subsidy program. (658E (c)(2)(N)(iv)) This might be achieved through policies such as establishing a second income eligibility threshold at redetermination (e.g., establishing a different eligibility threshold for families first applying for assistance and those already receiving assistance, sometimes called and \"exit threshold\") or by granting a sustained period of continued assistance to the family before termination. Describe the status of the State/Territory's policy regarding graduated phase-out of assistance. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe the policies and procedures for graduated phase-out Entry Level: The child care subsidy income sliding fee scale is based upon the 2014 HHS Poverty Guidelines and the 2014 DC State Family Median Income. The fee scale incorporates 85 percent of the state median income as constrained by up to 300% of the federal poverty guideline. The family remains eligible for 12 months. Exit Level: The exit level is set at the point where income equals 85 percent of the state median income (SMI) as constrained by 300% of the federal poverty level. Where 85 percent of SMI exceeds 300% of the FPL, District of Columbia Page 61 of 223the income exceeds the maximum eligibility level and the family must exit. Not implemented. The State must provide a State-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste tables here. Your responses here will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report.

(658E(c)(2)(N)(i)(II)) Note - this change requires that States and Territories have policies to account for the fact that some parents with seasonal or other types of work schedules may have irregular earnings over the course of a year, including changes that temporarily exceed 85% of SMI. States and District of Columbia Page 62 of 223Territories should have procedures to guide how eligibility and copayments are set in a manner to take such circumstances into account. For example, averaging family income over a period of time to broaden the scope of income verification to be more reflective of annual income rather than tied to a limited time frame that may have seasonal irregularities. Describe the status of the State/Territory's policy related to the fluctuation in earnings requirement. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe the circumstances that cover irregular fluctuations of earnings pursuant to this requirement Not implemented.

States may not deny child care benefits to an eligible child because the parent(s), legal guardians, persons standing in loco parentis, or other household members have not provided information regarding their immigration status. In addition, verification of child citizen status is not required when the child is served in a program meeting Early Head Start/Head Start standards, such as in Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships, or public educational standards which may include pre-k settings (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/resource/pi- 2008-01).

Reminder - Lead Agencies are reminded that, for purposes of implementing the citizenship verification requirements mandated by title IV of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, only the citizenship and immigration status of the child, who is the primary beneficiary of the child care benefit, is relevant for eligibility purposes (ACYF- PI-CC-98-08). States may not deny child care benefits to an eligible child because the parent(s), legal guardians, persons standing in loco parentis, or other household members have not provided information regarding their immigration status. In addition, verification of child citizen status is not required when the child is served in a program meeting Early Head Start/Head Start standards, such as in Early Head Start - Child Care Partnerships, or public educational standards which may include pre-k settings (http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/resource/pi-2008-01). 3.1.8 Which strategies, if any, will the Lead Agency use to assure the timeliness of eligibility determinations upon receipt of applications? Time limit for making eligibility determinations. Describe length of time : 30 calendar days from the date of the initial application. Track and monitor the eligibility determination process Other. Describe: The lead agency will monitor a random selection of 25% of all eligibility records from the District of Columbia Page 67 of 223Department of Human Services, Child Care Services Division. The lead agency will also monitor Level II child care providers who conduct eligibility determination on behalf of the lead agency for their sites. A percentage of eligibility records to be reviewed is determined by the total number of families whose children are enrolled in subsidy for the site. The criteria are: 1 to 30 family case records - all records will be reviewed; 31 to 100 family case records - 50% (randomly selected) will be reviewed; and More than 100 family case records - 30% (randomly selected) will be reviewed. None 3.1.9 Informing parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirement Per CCDF regulations, Lead Agencies are required to inform parents who receive TANF benefits about the exception to the individual penalties associated with the work requirement for any single custodial parent who has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care for a child under 6 years of age (98.16(9) and 98.33(b)). This requirement did not change under the reauthorization. Lead Agencies must coordinate with TANF programs to ensure, pursuant that TANF families with young children will be informed of their right not to be sanctioned if they meet the criteria set forth by the State TANF agency in accordance with section 407(e)(2)of the Social Security Act. In fulfilling this requirement, the following criteria or definitions are applied by the TANF agency to determine whether the parent has a demonstrated inability to obtain needed child care. NOTE: The TANF agency, not the CCDF Lead Agency, is responsible for establishing the following criteria or definitions. These criteria or definitions are offered in this Plan as a matter of public record. a) Identify the TANF agency that established these criteria or definitions: State/Territory TANF Agency The District of Columbia's Department of Human Services, Economic Security Administration b) Provide the following definitions established by the TANF agency. \"appropriate child care\": Child care must meet parents' needs in terms of hours and location.The child care center or family child care provider must be licensed. An in-home or relative provider is exempt from licensing; however, s/he must meet the minimum requirements incorporated in the child care provider's agreement. The basic needs of the children must be met. These District of Columbia Page 68 of 223needs include: safety, developmental, social, cultural, and health. \"reasonable distance\": Reasonable distance is defined as travel time it takes for a resident of the District of Columbia to drop off his/her child at a child care facility and arrive on time at work. This travel time should not exceed one and one-half hours from home to work. For District of Columbia residents who work outside the city in Maryland or Virginia, the travel time is defined as the time it takes to drop off the children at the child care facility and arrive on time to work. This travel time should not exceed two hours from home to work. \"unsuitability of informal child care\": Unsuitable Informal Child Care is care that is not licensed or is license - exempt under the Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services or does not meet the programmatic criteria as included in the executed Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services with the Office of State Superintendent of Education. Informal Child Care is defined as care provided by relative or in-home providers who are selected by the parents. Such providers must have an official provider agreement with the Parent and a Provider Agreement for Subsidized Child Care Services with OSSE along with current health certificates for themselves and the children in their care. \"affordable child care arrangements\": Affordable child care arrangements are terms of agreement between the parents and the provider that meet the needs of the parents and the children by using the Child Care Subsidy with the providers in the District of Columbia. Parents can obtain care for their children using the available subsidy, as long as they are participating with the District of Columbia's extensiveprovider subsidy system, which includes all categories of care (infants, preschoolers, school-age) in all wards. c) How are parents who receive TANF benefits informed about the exception to individual penalties associated with the TANF work requirements? In writing Verbally Other. Describe: List the citation to this TANF policy. List: http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/RuleHome.aspx?RuleNumber=29-5809 District of Columbia Page 69 of 223 http://dhs.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dhs/publication/attachments/Sanction%20fact s_0.pdf 3.1.10 The Lead Agency certifies that it will require a family member to certify that the family assets do not exceed $1,000,000. A check-off on the application is sufficient Yes. The Lead Agency certifies that it will require families to certify that the family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 no later than September 30, 2016. 3.2 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families At a minimum, CCDF requires Lead Agencies to give priority for child care assistance to children with special needs, or in families with very low incomes. This did notchange under reauthorization. Prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limited to eligibility determination (i.e., establishment of a waiting list or ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served). Lead Agencies may fulfill priority requirements in other ways such as higher payment rates for providers caring for children with special needs or waiving co-payments for families with very low incomes (at or below the federal poverty level). (658E(c)(3)(B)) 3.2.1 Describe how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child care services for the following children and families (658E(c)(3)(B)), including definitions, any time limits, grace periods or priority rules in the description: a. Provide definition of \"Children with special needs\": Children who have a disability or special health care need, and who are under nineteen (19) years of age who do not function according to age appropriate expectations in one or more areas of development. and describe how services are prioritized: The lead agency does not currently have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list, the lead agency will give priority to this special population. Additionally, there are no time limits. b. Provide definition of \"Families with very low incomes\": A family with a very low income is defined as a family of three with an income at or below $10,045 per year. District of Columbia Page 70 of 223and describe how services are prioritized: The lead agency does not currently have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list, the lead agency will give priority to this special population. c. Describe how services for families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), those attempting to transition off TANF through work activities, and those at risk of becoming dependent on TANF are prioritized (Section 418(b)(2) of the Social Security Act) The lead agency does not currently have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list, the lead agency will give priority to this special population. Additionally, the Lead Agency partners with other District Agencies, such as the DC Department of Human Services, to ensure families receiving TANF, attempting to transition off TANF, and those at risk of becoming dependent on TANF are supported. Many services may be accessed at the same points of entry to reduce access burdens to families needing to work and attend training programs. 3.2.2 Improving Access for Homeless Children and Families. The CCDBG Act of 2014 places greater emphasis on serving homeless children and families. Stable access to high-quality child care provides tremendous benefits to all children, especially our most vulnerable children. Children and families who experience homelessness face many challenges. Improving access to child care can buffer children and families from the challenges and risks associated with homelessness by supporting children's learning and development in safe, stable and nurturing environments. Under the new law, States and Territories are required to use CCDF funds to 1) allow homeless children to receive CCDF assistance after an initial eligibility determination but before providing required documentation (including documentation related to immunizations); 2) providing training and technical assistance to child care providers on identifying and serving homeless children and families (addressed in Section 6); and 3) conduct specific outreach to homeless families. (658E(c)(3)) States and Territories also must establish a grace period that allows homeless children and children in foster care (if served by the Lead Agency) to receive CCDF assistance while their families are taking the necessary actions to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements as described in Section 5. This flexibility will make it significantly easier for these vulnerable families to access child care services. This language is consistent with current requirements established through CCDF regulations in 1998, which required a grace period in which children can receive services while families take the necessary actions to comply with the immunization requirements. (658E(c)(2)I)(i)(I)) ACF recommends States and Territories consult the definition of homeless in the McKinney-Vento Act (section 725 of subtitle VII-B) as you District of Columbia Page 71 of 223implement the requirements of this section as that definition is consistent with the required CCDF administrative data reporting requirements. Describe the status of the State/Territory's procedures to enroll and provide outreach to homeless families and establish a grace period for children in foster care, if served, for meeting immunization requirements Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. Describe the following: a. Procedures to increase access to CCDF subsidies for homeless children and families, including the grace period to comply with immunization and health and safety requirements b. Procedures to conduct outreach to homeless families to improve access to child care services c. Procedures to provide a grace period to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements to expedite enrollment for children who are in foster care if served by the Lead Agency to improve access to child care services Not implemented. If not implemented, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste charts or tables here. Your responses will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report.

States are required to demonstrate in the Plan that no later than September 30, 2016 each child who receives assistance will be considered to meet all eligibility requirements for such assistance and will receive such assistance, for not less than 12 months before the State redetermines the eligibility of the child, regardless of changes in income (as long as income does not exceed the federal threshold of 85% of State median income) or temporary changes in participation in work, training, or education activities. (658E(c)(2)(N)(i) &(ii)) Note that this change means a State may not terminate CCDF assistance during the 12 month period if a family has an increase in income that exceeds the State's income eligibility threshold, but not the federal threshold of 85% SMI. In addition, this change means the State may not terminate assistance prior to the end of the 12 month period if family experiences a temporary job loss or temporary change in participation in a training or education activity. For example, if a working parent is temporarily absent from employment due to extended medical leave, changes in seasonal work schedule, or a parent enrolled in training or educational program is temporarily not attending class between semesters, the state should not terminate assistance. Describe the status of the State's establishment of a 12-month eligibility re-determination period for CCDF families. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe circumstances considered temporary changes in work, education or training that are not subject to termination List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe circumstances considered temporary changes in work, education or training that are not subject to termination Not implemented. If not implemented, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to District of Columbia Page 75 of 223complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste charts or tables here. Your responses will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report. Overall Target Completion Date (no later than September 30, 2016) 9/30/2016 Overall Status - Describe the State/Territory's status toward complete implementation for any requirement(s) (not yet started, partially implemented, substantially implemented, other) Partially implemented Implemented requirement(s) - Identify any requirement(s) implemented to date if applicable The District currently has a 12-month eligibility period for families. OSSE is revising the eligibility policies to ensurefamilies in seasonal employment and families experiencing temporary job loss or temporary change in participation in a training or education actively remain eligible for 12-months. Unmet requirement - Identify the requirement(s) to be implemented A minimum 12- month eligibility and redetermination period for CCDF families. Tasks/Activities -What specific steps will you take to implement the unmet requirement (e.g., legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) OSSE is currently meeting semi-monthly withrepresentatives from DHS to revise and streamline the eligibility policies to provide for 12 month eligibility, as defined by the CCDBG Act of 2014; OSSE has provided a draft memo of its recommended revisions to the eligibility policies for DHS review and comments; and OSSE will finalize policies and provide training to eligibility workers by September 30, 2016. Projected start date for each activity: 12/01/2015 Projected end date for each activity: 09/30/2016 Agency - Who is responsible for complete implementation of this activity OSSE Partners - Who is the responsible agency partnering with the State/Territory lead agency to complete implementation of this activity OSSE will partner with DHS and child care providers. District of Columbia Page 76 of 223 3.3.2 State and Territory option to terminate assistance prior to 12 months The CCDBG Act of 2014 provides States and Territories the option - but does not require them - to terminate assistance prior to re-determination at 12 months if a parent loses employment or if he or she stops attending a job training or education program (i.e., if the parent experiences a non-temporary change in their status as working, or participating in a training or education program). However, prior to terminating the subsidy, the State/Territory must provide a period of continued child care assistance of at least 3 months to allow parents to engage in job search, resume work, or to attend an education or training program as soon as possible. (658E(c)(2)(N)(iii)) Nothing in the statute prohibits the State/Territory from starting a new 12- month eligibility and redetermination period if families are eligible at the end of their job search, training or education attendance period. Note that unless the State allows a minimum 3-month job search period - the State/Territory may not exercise the option to terminate assistance based on a parent's non-temporary job loss or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program prior to the end of the minimum 12-month eligibility and re-determination period. The statute does not specify any documentation that States/Territories must require parents to submit regarding activities during periods of job search or finding training or education program requirements for this period. Does the State/Territory terminate assistance prior to 12 months due to a parent's non- temporary loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or education program? Yes, the State/Territory terminates assistance prior to 12 months due to parent's loss of work or cessation of attendance at a job training or education program ONLY. List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe the circumstances considered to be non-temporary job, education or training loss and provide the duration allowed for job search or resuming attendance in training or education programs The OSSE Child Care Eligibility Manual, Section 300.6 Eligibility Need - outlines the provision for loss of employment and maternity leave for period of not more than three months. The District allows a minimum three-month job search period for reduction in force through no fault of the employee. The District is revising current eligibility policies to implement a 12-month continuous eligibility for non-temporary changes in work and training requirements. No, the State/Territory does not allow this option. District of Columbia Page 77 of 223 3.3.3 Prevent Disruption of Work The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a requirement that States and Territories must describe in the Plan the procedures and policies in place to ensure that parents (especially parents in families receiving assistance under TANF) are not required to unduly disrupt their employment, education or job training activities in order to comply with the State/Territory's or designated local entity's requirements for redetermination of eligibility for assistance. (658E(c)(2)(N)(ii)) Examples include implementing re-determination strategies to verify income and employment electronically as opposed to more onerous practices such as asking parents and families to come to the subsidy office for an in-person visit, or aligning eligibility with other early care and education or public benefits programs to collect information centrally. The process by which States and Territories collect eligibility documentation represents a potential barrier to services, particularly when documentation can only be provided in-person during standard work hours. States and Territories can offer a variety of family-friendly mechanisms for submitting documentation for eligibility determinations and/or re-determination. Describe the status of the State/Territory's redetermination procedures and policies to ensure that parents (especially parents receiving TANF) do not have their employment, education or job training unduly disrupted in order to comply with the State/Territory's or designated local entity's requirements for redetermination of eligibility. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe the policies and procedures for not unduly disrupting employment Not implemented. If not implemented, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste charts or tables here. Your responses will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report. Overall Target Completion Date (no later than September 30, 2016) 9/30/2016 Overall Status - Describe the State/Territory's overall status toward complete implementation for this requirement(s) (not yet started, partially implemented, substantially implemented, other) Partially implemented District of Columbia Page 78 of 223Implemented requirement(s) - Identify any requirement(s) implemented to date if applicable Parents/Guardians with children enrolled at designatedLevel II Child Care sites may complete the redetermination process at the child care site. Unmet requirement - Identify the requirement(s) to be implemented ensure that parents (especially parents in families receiving assistance under TANF) are not required to unduly disrupt their employment, education or job training activities in order to comply with the State/Territory\u00bfs or designated local entity\u00bfs requirements for redetermination of eligibility for assistance. Tasks/Activities - What specific steps will you take to implement the unmet requirement (e.g., legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) The following activities will be implemented: Develop a web-based technology to submit documents directly to child care intake staff; Increase the number of providers that can complete initial determinations and redeterminations on site at child care centers; Revise the eligibility manual; Train eligibility and community-based staff; Increase the number of child care intake staff during high peak hours; and Extend hours of the intake centers during peak season Projected start date for each activity: 11/01/2015 Projected end date for each activity: 09/30/2016 Agency - Who is responsible for complete implementation of this activity OSSE Partners - Who is the responsible agency partnering with the State/Territory lead agency to complete implementation of this activity The District of Columbia's Department of Human Services; and Child Care Partners. 3.4 Family Contribution to Payment The statute requires Lead Agencies to establish a sliding fee scale that varies based on income District of Columbia Page 79 of 223and the size of the family to be used in determining each family's contribution (i.e., co-payment) to the cost of child care that is not a barrier to families receiving CCDF. (658E(c)(5) In addition to income and size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co-payments. The sliding fee scale is subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing monitoring efforts to CCDBG compliance. 3.4.1 Provide the CCDF copayments in the chart below according to family size. Note - If the sliding fee scale is not statewide, check here and describe how many jurisdictions set their own sliding fee scale Fill in the chart based on the most populous area of the State. Family Size (a) Lowest \"Entry\" Income Level Where Copaym ent First Applied (b) What is the monthly copayment for a family of this size upon initial entry into CCDF? (c) What is the percent of income for (b)? (d) Maximu m Highest \"Entry\" Income Level Before No Longer Eligible (e) What is the monthly copayment for a family of this size upon initial entry into CCDF? (f) What is the percent of income 4 a) What is the effective date of the sliding fee scale(s)? 10/01/2009 b) Provide the link to the sliding fee scale http://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/child_care_subsidy _program_parent_fee_final_rules.pdf 3.4.2 How will the family's contribution be calculated and to whom will it be applied? Check all that the Lead Agency has chosen to use. District of Columbia Page 80 of 223Fee as dollar amount and Fee is per child with the same fee for each child Fee is per child and discounted fee for two or more children Fee is per child up to a maximum per family No additional fee charged after certain number of children Fee is per family Fee as percent of income and Fee is per child with the same percentage applied for each child Fee is per child and discounted percentage applied for two or more children Fee is per child up to a maximum per family No additional percentage applied charged after certain number of children Fee is per family Contribution schedule varies because it is set locally/regionally (as indicated in 1.2.1). Describe: Other. Describe: 3.4.3 Will the Lead Agency use other factors in addition to income and family size to determine each family's copayment? (658E(c)(3)(B)) Yes, and describe those additional factors using the checkboxes below. Number of hours the child is in care Lower copayments for higher quality of care as defined by the State/Territory Other. Describe other factors. No. 3.4.4 The Lead Agency may waive contributions/co-payments from families whose incomes are at or below the poverty level for a family of the same size. District of Columbia Page 81 of 223 Will the Lead Agency waive family contributions/co-payments? Yes, the Lead Agency waives family contributions/co-payments for families with income at or below the poverty level for families of the same size. The poverty level used by the Lead Agency for a family size of 3 is $ 9,155.00 No, the Lead Agency does not waive family contributions/co-payments 3.4.5 How will the Lead Agency ensure the family contribution/co-payment, based on a sliding fee scale, is affordable? Check all that apply: Limits the maximum co-payment per family. Describe: Copayments are made only for the first and second oldest child. Limits combined amount of copayment for all children to a percentage of family income. List the percentage of the copayment limit. Describe: Minimizes the abrupt termination of assistance before a family can afford the full cost of care (\"the cliff effect\") as part of the graduated phase-out of assistance discussed in 3.1.5. Describe: Upon initial determination, parents may be eligible based on their family income up to 250% above the federal poverty level. Upon the annual redetermination, parents may be eligible up to 300% of the federal poverty level. OSSE's eligibiity policies will need to be revised to ensure that families cannot become income ineligible during the first 12 months unless they reach 85% SMI, Does not allow providers to charge families the difference between the maximum payment rate (addressed in section 4) and their private pay rate in addition to the copayment they are paying. Describe: The State does not allow providers to charge the difference between the maximum reimbursement rate and their private pay rate. District of Columbia Page 82 of 223Covers all fees (such as registration, supplies, field trips) to minimize the additional fees charged to the families by the provider. Describe: Other. Describe: 4 Ensure Equal Access to High Quality Child Care for Low-Income Children The 2014 reauthorization of the CCDBG Act is designed to help States and Territories advance improvements to the quality of child care in order to promote the healthy social-emotional, cognitive and physical development of participating children. Ensuring that low-income and vulnerable children can access high-quality care (and remain enrolled to school entry and beyond) is an equally important purpose of CCDBG. Payment levels and policies have a major impact on access. The CCDBG Act of 2014 revises the requirement for a market rate survey (MRS) so that: 1) it must be statistically valid and reliable; and (2) it must reflect variations in the cost of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child. Also, a State/Territory may develop and conduct an alternative methodology for setting payment rates, such as a cost estimation model, to take into account the cost of meeting quality requirements. To provide stability of funding and encourage more child care providers to participate in the subsidy program, the State/Territory's payment practices for CCDF child care providers must reflect generally accepted payment practices of non-CCDF child care providers in the State/Territory, such as paying for supplies, field trips, registration fees. In addition, to the extent practicable, the State/Territory must implement enrollment and eligibility policies that support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absence due to holidays or unforeseen circumstances such as illness or closures due to emergency. The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that the State/Territory must also develop and implement strategies to increase the supply and improve the quality of child care services for: (1) children in underserved areas; (2) infants and toddlers; (3) children with disabilities (the CCDBG Act of 2014 added a new definition of child with disability (658(P)(3)); and (4) children District of Columbia Page 83 of 223who receive care during non-traditional hours. With respect to investments to increase access to programs providing high-quality child care and development services, the State/Territory must give priority to children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have such programs. (658 E(c)(2)(M)) 4.1 Parental Choice In Relation to Certificates, Grants or Contracts The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive(s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either enrolling such child with a provider that has a grant or contract for the provision of service or receiving a child care certificate. (658E(c)(2)(A)) This did not change under the CCDBG Act of 2014. 4.1.1 Describe how the parent of each eligible child is advised that the Lead Agency offers the option of selecting a provider that has a grant or contract or receiving a child care certificate (658E(c)(2)(A)(i), 658P(2)) Parents can select a child care provider from the online child care finder or by contacting out to the Child Care Resource and Referral hotline. Additionally, staff at the Department of Human Services, Child Care Services Division provide information about child care options to families seeking child care certificate/admission forms. Currently, child care subsidy is facilitated through a voucher system whereby an admission form is provided to each eligible applicant. The child care admission form, which indicates the applicant's chosen provider, is then accepted by the licensed facility. Each licensed facility that accepts an admission form through the subsidy program must maintain a provider agreement for subsidized child care services. The District of Columbia does not use grants or contracts for direct child care services. 4.1.2 Describe how the parent is informed of the option to choose from a variety of child care categories - such as private, not-for-profit, faith-based providers (if using a certificate), centers, family child care homes, or in-home providers (658E(c)(2)(A)(i), 658P(2), 658Q)) District of Columbia Page 84 of 223Certificate form provides information about the choice of providers, including high quality providers Certificate is not linked to a specific provider so parents can choose provider of choice Consumer education materials on choosing child care Referral to child care resource and referral agencies Co-located resource and referral in eligibility offices Verbal communication at the time of application Community outreach, workshops or other in-person activities Other. Describe Parents can select a child care provider from the online child care finder or by reaching out to the Child Care Resource and Referral hotline. Information is provided in multiple languages as outlined in DC's Language Access Act. 4.1.3 Child Care Services Available through Grants or Contracts a) In addition to offering certificates, does the Lead Agency provide child care services through grants or contracts for child care slots? (658A(b)(1) Note: Do not check \"yes\" if every provider is simply required to sign an agreement in order to be paid in the certificate program. Yes. If yes, describe the type(s) of child care services available through grants or contracts the entities who receive contracts (e.g., shared services alliances, child care resource and referral agencies, family child care networks, community based agencies, child care providers, etc.) the process for accessing grants or contracts the range of providers available through grants or contracts how rates for contracted slots are set for grants and contracts District of Columbia Page 85 of 223how the State/Territory determines which entities to contract with for increasing supply and/or improving quality if contracts are offered statewide and/or locally: No. If no, skip to 4.1.4. b) Will the Lead Agency use grants or contracts for child care services to achieve any of the following (check all that apply): Increase the supply of specific types of care with grants or contracts for: Programs to serve children with disabilities Programs to serve infants and toddlers Programs to serve school-age children Programs to serve children needing non-traditional hour care Programs to serve homeless children Programs to serve children in underserved areas Programs that serve children with diverse linguistic or cultural backgrounds Programs that serve specific geographic areas Urban Rural Other. Describe: OSSE is exploring grants to build the supply of non-traditional care and care for infants and toddlers with disabilities in underserved areas and care for infants and toddlers experiencing homelessness. Improve the quality of child care programs with grants or contracts for: Programs providing comprehensive services, such as integrated child care in Head Start, Early Head Start, summer or other programs Programs meeting higher quality standards, such as higher rated QRIS programs, accreditation or state pre-k programs that meet higher quality standards Programs that provide financial incentives to teaching staff linked to higher education and qualifications link increased education requirements to higher compensation District of Columbia Page 86 of 223Programs to serve children with disabilities or special needs Programs to serve infants and toddlers Programs to serve school-age children Programs to serve children needing non-traditional hour care Programs to serve homeless children Programs to serve children in underserved areas Programs that serve children with diverse linguistic or cultural backgrounds Programs that serve specific geographic areas Urban Rural Other. Describe: 4.1.4 The Lead Agency certifies policies and procedures are in place that afford parents unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider who receives CCDF funds. (658E(c)(2)(B)) This requirement did not change under the CCDBG Act of 2014. Describe the policies and procedures for unlimited access Describe the policies and procedures for unlimited access Parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider. Parents are informed of this policy during the parent application and orientation process. Providers are informed of this policy during the subsidy provider orientation and in the subsidy provider agreement. 4.1.5 The Lead Agency must allow for in-home care (i.e., care provided in the child's own home) but may limit its use. Will the Lead Agency limit the use of in-home care in any way? Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the use of in-home care? Check all that apply. District of Columbia Page 87 of 223Restricted based on minimum number of children in the care of the provider to meet minimum wage law or Fair Labor Standards Act Describe: Restricted based on provider meeting a minimum age requirement Describe: Providers are required to be at least 21 years of age. Restricted based on hours of care (certain number of hours, non-traditional work hours) Describe: Restricted to care by relatives Describe: The provider must be related by blood or marriage (aunt, uncle, grandmother, grandfather). Restricted to care for children with special needs or medical condition Describe: Restricted to in-home providers that meet some basic health and safety requirements Describe: In home provider must complete 12 hours of annual health and safety training annually. Other Describe: No. 4.2 Assessing Market Rates and Child Care Costs The new law revises the requirement for a market rate survey (MRS) so that: (1) it must be statistically valid and reliable; and (2) it must reflect variations in the cost of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child (658E(c)(4)(B)). A State/Territory has the option to develop and use a statistically valid and reliable alternative methodology for setting payment rates, such as a cost estimation model. Any payment rates established using an District of Columbia Page 88 of 223alternative methodology or market rate survey must be reviewed and approved by ACF as part of the CCDF Plan review process. Because the alternative methodology is a new basis for setting payment rates, we highly recommend any State or Territory considering an alternative methodology to submit a description of its proposed approach to the ACF Regional Office in advance of the Plan submittal in order to avoid delays with Plan approval. (see http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/resource/ccdf-reauthorization-faq). The MRS or alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than two years before the date of submission of the Plan (instead of two years before the effective date of the Plan, as previously required for the MRS). The State must consult with the State Advisory Council, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities prior to developing and conducting the MRS or alternative methodology. The State must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or alternative methodology. The State must make the report with these results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the MRS or alternative methodology, including by posting the results on the Internet. The State must set CCDF subsidy payment rates in accordance with the results of the current MRS or alternative methodology. When setting payment rates, the State must take into consideration the cost of providing higher quality child care services than were provided prior to November 2014 (e.g., tiered reimbursement or other methods) and without, to the extent practicable , reducing the number of families receiving CCDF relative to the number served as of November 2014. In taking the cost of providing quality into consideration, it is important to consider such key factors as what it takes to support increased stability and reduced provider turnover when setting payment rates. 4.2.1 Developing and Conducting a Market Rate Survey (MRS) and/or an Alternative Methodology. Did the State/Territory conduct a statistically and valid and reliable MRS, alternative methodology or both between July 1, 2013 and March 1, 2016? MRS Alternative Methodology. Describe: OSSE consulted with nationally recognized early childhood finance experts to model the cost of delivering services at each level of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) in center and home-based settings that serve children of varying ages and needs. The DC QRIS system has three levels of quality: bronze, silver and gold. At minimum all District of Columbia Page 89 of 223licensed centers are bronze, a child development center or home that seeks national accreditation and completes its self-study is silver and accredited programs are gold. The goals of the alternative methodology work are: 1) identify the fiscal impact of the DC QRIS standards; 2) identify key cost drivers that cut across all QRIS levels; 3) carefully explore differential costs between programs that serve primarily (or exclusively) infants and toddlers and those that serve primarily (or exclusively) three- and four-year old children; and 4) use this information to test a range of alternative rate-setting and policy recommendations with a clear understanding of the fiscal impact of these decisions. Both. Describe: Other. Describe: 4.2.2 Describe how the State consulted with the State Advisory Council (SAC) or other state- or state-designated cross-agency body if there is no SAC, local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities which could include worker organizations prior to developing and conducting the MRS or alternative methodology. Describe: The State Early Childhood Development Coordinating Council was consulted on the alternative cost estimation methodology at its March and November 2015 meetings. 4.2.3 Describe how the market rate survey or alternative methodology is statistically valid and reliable. To be considered valid and reliable, the MRS or alternative methodology must represent the child care market, provide complete and current data, use rigorous data collection procedures, reflect geographic variation, and analyze data in a manner that captures other relevant differences. For example, market rate surveys can use administrative data such as child care resource and referral data if they are representative of the market. If an alternative methodology such as cost modeling is used, demonstrate that the methodology used reliable models that estimated the cost of delivering services in center- and home-based settings at each level of District of Columbia Page 90 of 223quality defined by the State/Territory. Describe: The District used a cost modeling approach that was developed and tested by national experts Anne Mitchell of the Alliance for Early Childhood Finance and Andrew Brodsky of Brodsky Research, and Augenblick, Palaich and Associates (APA), a leader in education finance. These leaders worked collaboratively with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care through the support of the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement and the Child Care State Systems Specialist Network to build the Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC), a dynamic, web-based tool that calculates the cost of quality child care based on site-level provider data. The District adapted the PCQC by embedding its principles in a set of Excel spreadsheets that are aligned to the District's unique reimbursement rate variations that are based on a range of quality and other funding factors. This cost model allows OSSE to understand the potential impact of rates and other policy changes on these quality and funding variations. Careful attention was paid to ensuring that the data used to inform cost assumptions in the model accurately reflects provider experience. Consultants carefully reviewed available financial and enrollment data on early childhood programs in the District and, in some cases, conducted targeted surveys to gather specific data (e.g. enrollment data in home-based care.) Group and individual interviews with the sector were also conducted to gather and/or vet information. 4.2.4 Describe how the market rate survey reflects variations in the price of child care services by: a) Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets): N/A b) Type of provider: N/A c) Age of child: N/A d) Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey, such as quality level District of Columbia Page 91 of 223N/A 4.2.5 Describe the process used by the State to make the results of the market rate survey widely available to the public. a) Date of completion of the market rate survey or alternative methodology (must be no earlier than July 1, 2013 and no later than March 1, 2016) 02/15/2016 b) Date report containing results were made widely available, no less than 30 days after the completion of the report 03/11/2016 c) How the report containing results was made widely available and provide the link where the report is posted if available The report will be posted on the OSSE website at www.osse.dc.gov. 4.3 Setting Payment Rates 4.3.1 Provide the base payment rates and percentiles (based on current MRS or alternative methodology) for the following categories. The ages and types of care listed below are meant to provide a snapshot of categories on which rates may be based and are not intended to be comprehensive of all categories that may exist in your State/Territory or reflective of the terms that your State/Territory may use for particular ages. Please use the most populous geographic region (serving highest number of children). Note - If the payment rates are not set by the State/Territory, check here Describe how many jurisdictions set their own payment rates a) Infant (6 months), full-time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $ 46.81 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a b) Infant (6 months), full-time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region Rate $ 32.76 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) District of Columbia Page 92 of 223Percentile: n/a c) Toddler (18 months), full-time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $ 45.80 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a d) Toddler (18 months), full-time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region Rate $ 31.21 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a e) Preschooler (4 years), full-time licensed center care in the most populous geographic region Rate $ 29.21 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a f) Preschooler (4 years), full-time licensed FCC care in the most populous geographic region Rate $ 22.03 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a g) School-age child (6 years), full-time licensed center care in the most populous geographic region Rate $ 19.85 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a h) School-age child (6 years), full-time licensed FCC care in the most populous geographic region Rate $ 20.00 per day unit of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) Percentile: n/a i) Describe the calculation/definition of full-time care: The definition of full-time care is care of six or more hours. j) Provide the effective date of the payment rates : 10/01/2013 k) Provide the link to the payment rates : http://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/publication/attachments/2015- 2016%20Blank%20Universal%20Agreement.pdf District of Columbia Page 93 of 223 4.3.2 States and Territories may choose to set base payment rates that differ because they take into consideration such factors as 1) geographic location, 2) age of child, 3) needs of children (special needs, protective services, etc.), 4) non-traditional hours of care, or 5) quality of care. In other words, base rates for infants may be set at a higher level than for school-age care because the cost of providing infant care tends to be higher than school-age care. In addition to these rates that differ tied to market variations in prices, States and Territories can choose to establish tiered rates or add-ons on top of these variable base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive for providers to serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children). Check which types of tiered payment or rate add-on, if any, the Lead Agency has chosen to implement. In the description of any tiered rates or add-ons, indicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates, amount or percentage of the tiered rate/add-on, and indicate if the rates were set based on the MRS or another process. Tiered rate/rate add-on for non-traditional hours. Describe: The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home providers for non-traditional care. Rates increase with the quality rating - bronze is the lowest reimbursement rate, silver is the middle reimbursement rate, and gold is the highest reimbursement rate. Tiered rate/rate add-on for children with special needs as defined by the State/Territory. Describe: The District offers a special needs reimbursement rate for center providers who provide child care and related services for children with special needs. Providers sign a modification to the child care subsidy agreement. Based on cost modeling, OSSE will explore the possibility of increasing the rate for Gold Level centers that serve children with special needs. Tiered rate/rate add-on for infants and toddlers (do not check if you have a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no separate bonus or add-on). Describe: The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home providers for infant and toddler care. The rates increase with quality rating - bronze is the lowest District of Columbia Page 94 of 223reimbursement rate, silver is the middle reimbursement rates, and gold is the highest reimbursement rate. Based on the cost modeling, OSSE and the SECDCC's Finance Policy and Public Private Partnerships Subcommittees are researching possible adjustments in the rate for children ages 12-30 months. OSSE will also explore increasing rates for infant and toddlers enrolled in Gold Level centers and homes to help fill the gap identified by cost modeling. Tiered rate/rate add-on for programs meeting higher quality as defined by the State/Territory. Describe: The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home providers for increase quality of care. The rates increase with quality rating - bronze is the lowest reimbursement rate, silver is the middle reimbursement rate, and gold is the highest reimbursement rate. As noted above, we are exploring additional adjustments to our tiered rates based on findings from cost modeling. Tiered rate/rate add-on for programs serving homeless children. Describe: Other tiered rate/rate add-on beyond the base rate. Describe: None. 4.3.3 Describe how the State/Territory set payment rates for child care services in accordance with the results of the most recent market rate survey or alternative methodology Describe: The cost modeling methodology is an extremely helpful way to establish rate policy because it not only allows OSSE to analyze the impact of standards and likely revenues, but also takes into consideration a host of additional factors that impact costs, such as enrollment levels, program size, gaps in subsidy eligibility and fee collection. For example, in addition to identifying the financial challenges of serving infants and toddlers, we learned that in order to meet DC higher quality standards and break even under current policies and reimbursement rates, child care centers need to be 98 percent enrolled, able to collect tuition and fees for all children every day, and serve at least 200 children. Similarly, family child care (FCC) homes District of Columbia Page 95 of 223need to be fully enrolled in order for the provider to make a decent wage (currently our FCC homes report that, on average, they are only 60 percent enrolled). As a result, OSSE plans to explore both rate and policy changes that could address enrollment efficiencies and program size, potentially including: Higher subsidy reimbursement rates for centers and homes that serve infants, toddlers and children with special needs, and have attained the QRIS Gold level; Quality grants for centers and homes that serve infants, toddlers and children with special needs and are currently at the bronze or silver level, with demonstrated interest in moving up the quality ladder. These grants would be time-limited, and focused on helping sites make the changes needed to attain a gold level rating; Revisions to subsidy policy aimed at boosting enrollment in child development homes, as well as centers that serve children with special needs that have attained a gold level rating; and contracting for slots, with emphasis on high-quality centers and homes, located in neighborhoods where significant numbers of vulnerable children live, that have attained some economies of scale via multi-site centers or Shared Service Alliances that centralize administration and program leadership. OSSE plans to engage the SECDCC Finance and Policy and Public and Private Partnerships Committee in developing concrete recommendations around subsidy policy, alternative-rate setting solutions, and innovative practices that will ensure equal access to high quality child care for the District's most vulnerable children. 4.3.4 In setting payment rates, how did the State/Territory take into consideration the cost of providing higher quality child care services than were provided prior to November 2014 (e.g., tiered payment or other methods) and without, to the extent practicable, reducing the number of families receiving CCDF relative to the number of families served as of November 2014. For example, providing tiered payment with a sufficient differential to support higher quality, considering the cost of quality using a cost estimation model or other method, or examining the participation rate of high-quality providers in the subsidy system (e.g., using indicators from a quality rating system, accreditation or other state-defined indicators of quality) and adjusting payment rates if necessary. District of Columbia Page 96 of 223Describe: The District's Child Care Subsidy Program rates include the full range of provider types, including specific rates for licensed centers andfamily child care homes, relative and in-home care. Rates are further categorized by the age of the child, as well as the quality of the center or home (as determined by the D.C.'s tiered rate reimbursement system/QRIS-Going for the Gold). DC is committed to maintaining the number of families receiving CCDF at the November 2014 level. We are also committed to using the results of the cost modeling study to explore options for ensuring that our child care centers and homes serving our most vulnerable children have greater enrollment and financial stability to ensure access and quality for our families. OSSE is working to align Early Head Start funding with child care programs to maximize all resources. In order to prepare children for success in school and life we must ensure that the early childhood programs they attend are of the highest quality. 4.4 Summary of Facts Used to Determine that Payments Rates Are Sufficient to Ensure Equal Access The CCDF plan shall provide a summary of data and facts relied on by the State/Territory to certify that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access. (658E (c)(4)(A)) Equal access is not limited to a single percentile alone but is inclusive of various metrics or benchmarks that would offer children receiving CCDF access to the same services (type of care, quality of care) as children not receiving CCDF. 4.4.1 What data and facts did the State use to determine equal access (i.e., what is your metric or benchmark of equal access - such as percentile that rates cover or proportion of costs covered)? Check all that apply and describe. Payment rates are set at the 75th percentile or higher of the most recent survey. Describe: Using tiered rates/differential rates as described in 4.3.3 to increase access for targeted needs. Rates based on data on the cost to the provider of providing care meeting certain standards District of Columbia Page 97 of 223Describe: Data on the size of the difference (in terms of dollars) between payment rates and the 75th percentile in the most recent survey, if rates are below the 75th percentile. Describe: Data on the proportion of children receiving subsidy being served by high-quality providers. Describe: OSSE administrative data demonstrates that the majority of children in the CCDF programs are enrolled in Silver and Gold programs. Silver and Gold are the two highest quality rated levels. Data on where children are being served showing access to the full range of providers. . Describe: Data on how rates set below the 75th percentile allow CCDF families access to the same quality of care as families not receiving CCDF. Describe: Feedback from parents, including parent survey or parent complaints. Describe: Other. Describe: 4.4.2 Does the State/Territory certify that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access either based on the current MRS or alternative methodology? Does the State/Territory certify that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access either based on the current MRS or alternative methodology? Yes. The State/Territory certifies that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access by March 1, 2016. District of Columbia Page 98 of 223Provide the State/Territory definition of how its payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access The District of Columbia does not have a waiting list. OSSE has subsidy contracts with280 of our 484 of our licensed child development facilities (58%). Additionally, the District's commitment to universal pre-K helps to ensure equal access to early care and education for three and four-year-old children. A majority of children in the District who receive subsidized child care are enrolled in centers/homes with a silver or gold rating. No. If no, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016).

To the extent practicable, the State/Territory must implement enrollment and eligibility policies that support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences due to holidays or unforeseen circumstances such as illness. (658E(c)(2)(S)) 4.5.1 Describe the status of State/Territory's payment practices for CCDF child care providers that reflect generally accepted payment practices of non-CCDF child care providers in the State/Territory Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016. Describe using 4.5.2 through 4.5.3 below. Not implemented. If not implemented, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste charts or tables here. Your responses will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report. Overall Target Completion Date (no later than September 30, 2016) Overall Status - Describe the State/Territory's overall status toward complete implementation for this requirement(s) (not yet started, partially implemented, substantially implemented, other) Implemented requirement(s) - Identify any requirement(s) implemented to date if applicable Tasks/Activities - What specific steps will you take to implement the unmet requirement (e.g., legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) Projected start date for each activity: Projected end date for each activity: Agency - Who is responsible for complete implementation of this activity District of Columbia Page 100 of 223Partners - Who is the responsible agency partnering with the State/Territory lead agency to complete implementation of this activity 4.5.2 Describe how the payment practices to child care providers who serve CCDF- assisted children reflect generally accepted payment practices of other child care providers in the State/Territory to ensure stability of funding to encourage more child care providers to serve children who receive CCDF assistance. Check all that apply and describe. The Lead Agency Pays prospectively prior to the delivery of services. Describe: Pays within no more than 21 days of billing for services. Describe: Supports fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by paying based on enrollment instead of attendance. Describe including the State/Territory's definition of occasional absences OSSE pays for five unexcused absences a month, 11 holidays, and 15 days of vacation annually. Supports fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by providing full payment if a child attends at least a certain percent of authorized time. Specify percent and describe Specify percent and describe OSSE pays for five unexcusedabsences a month, 11 holidays, and 15 days of vacation annually. Supports fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absences by providing full payment if a child is absent for a certain number of days in a month. Specify the number of absence days allowed and paid for and describe OSSE pays for five unexcusedabsences a month, 11 holidays, and 15 days of vacation annually. District of Columbia Page 101 of 223Pays on a full-time or part-time basis (rather than smaller increments such as hourly) Describe: Payment are made based on full-time or part-time needed care. Full-time care is six or more hours and part-time care is less than six hours. Pays for standard and customary fees that the provider charges private-paying parents (e.g., registration fees, deposits, supplies, field trips, etc.) Describe: Provides prompt notice to providers regarding any changes to the family's eligibility status that may impact payment Describe: Providers are notified of a family's redetermination status. Has a timely appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Describe: OSSE's recoupment policy outlines the provider's appeal and resolution process for payment inaccuracies and disputes. Other. Describe: OSSE is currently using its cost modeling methodology report, informed by surveys and interviews with DC providers, to ensure that, to the extent possible, rates are based on actual cost of delivering services. For those options not checked above, explain why these options are not generally accepted payment practices in your State/Territory. The District of Columbia's current system of payment is based on services rendered and thus payment is made in accordance with generally accepted payment practice of rending payment within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. Additionally, the District's subsidy reimbursements are for direct child care services, which the provider may then apply towards standard and customary fees incurred. 4.5.3 Check and describe the strategies the State/Territory will use to ensure the timeliness of payments. District of Columbia Page 102 of 223Policy on length of time for making payments. Describe length of time: Payments are made within 30 days of receipt of attendance submission. Track and monitor the payment process Describe: Use of electronic tools (e.g., automated billing, direct deposit, etc.) Describe: OSSE uses direct deposit for providers whenever possible. Other. Describe: 4.6 Supply Building Strategies to Meet the Needs of Certain Populations The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that the State/Territory will develop and implement strategies to increase the supply and improve the quality of child care services for children in underserved areas, infants and toddlers, children with disabilities, and children who receive care during non-traditional hours. (658 E(c)(2)(M)) 4.6.1 Has the State/Territory conducted data analysis of existing and growing supply needs? Yes. Describe data sources OSSE uses Kids Count data, administrative data and the Head Start Community Needs Assessment to identify needs of young children and families by geographic areas of the city. Additionally, agency performance data is analyzed annually to determine the availability and quality of licensed child care and preschool education. To help inform the cost model approach, OSSE coordinated with two advocacy organizations that conducted interviews with child development centers to learn more about the finances, business practices and enrollment in District child care centers. The CCR&R conducted a survey of child development homes. This information indicated that most family child care homes, and many child care centers, are not fully enrolled. Thus, there are available District of Columbia Page 103 of 223slots in most District neighborhoods. However, due to our historically low reimbursement rates for infants and toddlers, coupled with challenges regarding consistent eligibility, some providers with vacant slots do not serve subsidized children. Additionally, providers that serve children with special needs face significant cost challenges. Thus, OSSE is exploring supply-building strategies focused on boosting the quality of existing centers/homes-most especially in areas of greatest need and maximizing all available slots in these centers and homes so that they are at least 85 percent enrolled at all times. No. If no, how does the State/Territory determine most critical supply needs? 4.6.2 Describe what method(s) is used to increase supply and improve quality for: a) Infants and toddlers (check all that apply) Grants and contracts (as discussed in 4.1.3) Family child care networks Start-up funding Technical assistance support Recruitment of providers Tiered payment rates (as discussed in 4.4.1) Other.

Describe d) Homeless children (check all that apply) Grants and contracts (as discussed in 4.1.3) Family child care networks Start-up funding Technical assistance support Recruitment of providers Tiered payment rates (as discussed in 4.4.1) Other. Describe OSSE is building a partnership with community-based organizations that specifically addresses the needs of and assistance to families who are in transitional housing and/or are homeless. 4.6.3 The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States to describe the procedures and process it uses, in terms of the investments made to increase access to programs providing high quality child care and development services, to give priority for those investments to children in families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and District of Columbia Page 105 of 223unemployment and that do not have such high-quality programs. (658E(c)(2)(Q)) Describe the status of State/Territory's process and procedures to give priority for investments to children and families from areas with high concentrations of poverty and unemployment that do not have high-quality programs. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above. Describe The District of Columbia does not have a wait list for child care development services. The lead agency funds organizations that provide training and technical assistance to individuals interested in opening child development homes in underserved communities. Additionally, through the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership Quality Improvement Networks, OSSE has set a five-year goal of increasing by 1,000 the number of quality slots available for infant and toddler care across the District. This increase will focus particularly in neighborhoods and communities with high concentrations of poverty and limited access to high quality child development services. Not implemented. If not implemented, the State/Territory must provide a State/Territory-specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with this requirement, including planned activities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016). Please provide brief text responses and descriptions only. Do not cut and paste charts or tables here. Your responses will be consolidated electronically into an Implementation Plan summary report.

This includes both the standards that must be established and the pre-service/orientation and ongoing minimum training required. States and Territories must also explain why exemptions to any of the licensing standards do not endanger the health and safety of CCDF children in license-exempt care. States and Territories are required to have standards for CCDF providers regarding group size limits and appropriate child-to-provider ratios based on the age of children in child care. Pre-licensure and annual unannounced inspections of licensed CCDF providers and annual inspections of license-exempt CCDF providers are now required. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States and Territories to establish qualifications and training for licensing inspectors and appropriate inspector-to-provider ratios. It also requires States and Territories to conduct criminal background checks for all child care staff members, including staff members who don't care directly for children but have unsupervised access to children and lists specific disqualifying crimes. States and Territories must certify that all child care providers comply with child abuse reporting requirements of Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), mandatory reporting of known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect). 5.1 Licensing Requirements and Standards Each State is required to certify it has in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services provided within the State (not restricted to providers receiving CCDF), and to provide a detailed description of such requirements and how such requirements are effectively enforced. (658E(c)(2)(I)(i)) 5.1.1 The State/Territory certifies that it has licensing requirements applicable to child care services provided within the State. District of Columbia Page 107 of 223 (658(c)(2)(F)) This requirement did not change under the CCDBG Act of 2014. List the categories of care that your State/Territory licenses and provide your definition of each licensed category of care List the categories of care that your State/Territory licenses and provide your definition of each licensed category of care Child Development Center or \"Center\" means a Child Development Facility located in premises other than a dwelling occupied by the operator of the Facility. \"Child Development Facility\" or \"Facility\" means a center, home, or other structure that provides care and other services, supervision and guidance for children, infants, and toddlers on a regular basis, regardless of its designated name. \"Child Development Facility\" includes \"Child Development Development Center.\" \"Child Development Facility\" does not include a public or private elementary or secondary school engaged in legally required educational and related functions. Child Development Home\" means a private residence which provides a child development program for a maximum of six (6) children with a ratio of one adult caregiver to 2 children if there are 2 or more children younger than 2 years of age in the group; provided, that each adult caregiver possesses a post-secondary degree in early childhood education or a related field as determined by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, hold a current Child Development Associate (\"CDA\") credential, is enrolled in a CDA training program, or can provide evidence of enrollment in a CDA training program that will begin within 6 months of the first day of the adult caregiver's work with children at the child development home. The total of 6 children shall not include those of the caregiver who are 6 years or older; provided, that the total number of children of the caregiver between the ages of 6 and 15 years shall not exceed 3, and of those 3 children, no more than 2 shall be age 10 years or younger. A child development home shall also include care given to a child by a caregiver related to the child. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term \"related\" means any of the following relationships by marriage, blood, or adoption: Grandparent, parent, brother, sister, step- sister, step-brother, uncle, or aunt. \"Expanded Child Development Home\" means a Child Development Home in which child care is provided by two (2) or more Caregivers for up to twelve (12) children. District of Columbia Page 108 of 223 5.1.2 Does your State/Territory exempt any child care providers from its licensing requirements? Yes. Describe which types of providers that can receive CCDF are exempt from licensing and how such exemptions do not endanger children who receive CCDF services from license-exempt providers The following programs are exempt from licensure: Occasional babysitting in a babysitter's home for the children of one family; Informal parent-supervised neighborhood play groups; Care provided in places of worship during religious services; Care by a related person, as defined in section 399 of this Chapter; Facilities operated by the federal government on federal government property; except that a private entity utilizing space in or on federal government property is not exempt unless federal law specifically exempts the Facility from District of Columbia regulatory authority; and Public or private elementary or secondary schools engaged in legally required educational and related functions. No. 5.1.3 Describe the status of the State/Territory's development and implementation of child care standards for providers receiving CCDF that address appropriate ratios between the number of children and the number of providers and group size, in terms of the age of the children for each type of setting. (658E(c)(2)(H)) Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above. Describe using 5.1.4 and 5.1.5 below. Not implemented.

No, relatives are not exempt from inspection requirements. 5.3 Criminal Background Checks The CCDBG Act of 2014 added new requirements for States and Territories receiving CCDF funds to conduct criminal background checks on child care staff members and prospective staff members of child care providers. States and Territories must have requirements, policies, and procedures in place to conduct criminal background checks for staff members of child care providers (other than relatives) that are licensed, regulated or registered under State/Territory law or receive CCDF funds. Background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation or whose activities involve the care or supervision of children or unsupervised access to children. For family child care homes, this includes the caregiver requesting a check of him/herself, as well as other adults in the household that may have unsupervised access to children. These provisions must be in place no later than September 30, 2017. The CCDBG Act of 2014 specifies what a comprehensive criminal background check includes and a child care provider must submit a request to the appropriate State/Territory agency for a criminal background check for each child care staff member, including prospective child care staff members at least once every 5 years. A criminal background check must include a search of: State criminal and sex offender registry in the State where the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has resided over the past 5 years; State child abuse and neglect registry in the State where the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has resided over the past 5 years, National Crime Information Center (run by the FBI); FBI fingerprint check using Next Generation Identification ; and National Sex Offender Registry. Child care staff members cannot be employed by a provider receiving CCDF if they refuse a background check; make materially false statements in connection with the background check; are registered or required to be registered on the State or National Sex Offender Registry; have been convicted of a felony consisting of: murder, child abuse or neglect, crimes against children, spousal abuse, crime involving rape or sexual assault, kidnapping, arson, physical assault or battery, or subject to an individual review, at the State's option, a drug-related offense committed during the preceding 5 years; or have been convicted of a violent misdemeanor committed as an adult against a child. Timeliness of background checks - The State/Territory must conduct the background checks as quickly as possible and shall not exceed 45 days after the child care provider submitted the request. The State/Territory shall provide the results of the background check in a statement District of Columbia Page 150 of 223that indicates whether the staff member is eligible or ineligible, without revealing specific disqualifying information. If the staff member is ineligible, the State/Territory will provide information about each disqualifying crime to the staff member. Fees for background checks - Fees that a State/Territory may charge for the costs of processing applications and administering a criminal background check may not exceed actual costs to the State/Territory for processing and administration. Transparency - The State/Territory must ensure that policies and procedures for conducting criminal background checks are published on the State/Territory's consumer education website (also see section 2.3) or other publicly available venue. Appeals process - The State/Territory shall have a process for a child care staff member to appeal the results of their background check to challenge the accuracy and completeness. Privacy considerations - Lead Agency may not publicly release the results of individual background checks. 5.3.1 Describe the status of the State/Territory's requirements, policies, and procedures for criminal background checks for child care staff members and child care providers.

Not yet started. 5.3.9 Does the Lead Agency release aggregated data by crime? Yes. List types of crime included in the aggregated data: No. 6 Recruit and Retain a Qualified and Effective Child Care Workforce Teacher-child interactions and relationships, intentional strategies to engage children and their parents, and use of curriculum and assessment to inform practices with children are key components of high quality child care. These require a competent, skilled, and stable workforce. Research has shown that specialized training and education, positive and well-organized work environments and adequate compensation promote teacher recruitment, stability, diversity of District of Columbia Page 157 of 223the early childhood workforce, and effectiveness with young children in child care. In addition, professional development strategies that emphasize on-site mentoring and coaching of teachers have emerged as promising to change practices with children and families. Professional development, whether training, on-site coaching and mentoring, registered apprenticeship, or higher education coursework, should reflect the research and best practices of child development in all domains and cultural competence. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States and Territories to establish professional development and training requirements in key areas such as health and safety, early learning guidelines, responding to challenging behavior and engaging families. States and Territories are required to offer ongoing annual training and to establish a progression of professional development opportunities to improve knowledge and skills of CCDF providers. (658E(c)(2)(G)) An example of how a State/Territory might address this is to establish a system or framework of professional development that includes professional standards, a \"career ladder\" that allows an individual to build knowledge and skills in a cumulative manner from introductory training to advance level education, including obtaining credentials and post-secondary degrees. Professional development should be designed in a manner that aligns to competencies and qualifications that reflect working with children of different ages, English language learners, children with disabilities and the differentiated roles in all settings, such as teachers, teacher assistants, and directors. Training and education supporting professional development is also one of the options States and Territories have for investing their CCDF quality funds. (658G(b)(1)) ACF encourages States and Territories to collaborate and coordinate with other early childhood educator professional development resources, such as Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge grants, quality funds available through the Preschool Development grants, and funds available through Head Start and Early Head Start, to the extent practicable. Responsive, well- qualified adult caregivers are one of the most important factors in children's development and learning in child care settings. ACF strongly encourages States and Territories to link CCDF health and safety trainings (see Section 5) and child development trainings and education to this broader professional development framework as the foundation for building a knowledgeable early childhood education workforce. Questions related to requirements for recruiting and retaining a qualified and effective child care workforce have been consolidated into Section 6. 6.1 Training and Professional Development Requirements The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a requirement that the State/Territory develop training and professional development requirements designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children receiving CCDF across the entire age span from birth through age 12. (658E(c)(2)(G)) Training and professional development should be accessible and District of Columbia Page 158 of 223appropriate across settings and types of providers, including family child care home providers and child care center staff. The State/Territory also must develop and implement strategies to strengthen the business practices of child care providers to expand the supply and improve the quality of child care services. (658E(c)(2)(V)) For purposes of this section, the term professional development is inclusive of credit bearing coursework, postsecondary degree programs, and technical assistance (targeted assistance such as mentoring, coaching or consultation) activities. Health and safety topics that require renewal of a credential or certification should be considered continuing education unit trainings. 6.1.1 Describe the status of the State's training and professional development requirements to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. a) Provide ongoing training and professional development that is accessible for the diversity of providers in the State/Territory; provide for a progression of professional development reflecting research and best practice to meet the developmental needs of participating infants, toddlers, preschool, and school-age children and that is aligned to foundational and specialized competencies (including different ages of children, English language learners, and children with disabilities); and improve the quality and stability of the child care workforce (such as supports an individual to build on entry- and mid-level training and education (which may include higher education) to attain a higher level credential or professional certification and retention in the child care program). b) Are developed in consultation with the State Advisory Council (SAC) on Early Childhood Education and Care or other state or state-designated cross-agency body if there is no SAC that addresses training, professional development and education of child care providers and staff.) c) Incorporate knowledge and application of the State/Territory's early learning and developmental guidelines (where applicable), the State/Territory's health and safety standards (as described in section 5), and incorporate social-emotional/behavioral and early childhood mental health intervention models, which may include positive behavior intervention and support models (as described in Section 2) d) Are accessible to providers supported through Indian tribes or tribal organizations receiving CCDF District of Columbia Page 159 of 223 e) Appropriate, to the extent practicable, for child care providers caring for children receiving child care subsidies, including children of different age groups, English language learners, children with disabilities, and Native Americans, including Indians and Native Hawaiians. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above. Describe using 6.1.2 through 6.1.6 below. Not implemented.

Overall Target Completion Date (no later than September 30, 2016) Overall Status - Describe the State/Territory's overall status toward complete implementation for this requirement(s) (not yet started, partially implemented, substantially implemented, other) Implemented requirement(s) - Identify any requirement(s) implemented to date if applicable Tasks/Activities - What specific steps will you take to implement the unmet requirement (e.g., legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) Projected start date for each activity: Projected end date for each activity: Agency - Who is responsible for complete implementation of this activity Partners - Who is the responsible agency partnering with the State/Territory lead agency to complete implementation of this activity 6.1.2 Describe how the State provides ongoing training and professional development, provides for a progression of professional development (such as allows an individualto build on entry- and mid-level training and education both in terms of the skills and District of Columbia Page 160 of 223knowledge they attain but also in terms of credit that leads toward a higher level credential or certification, including articulation agreements) reflecting research and best practice to meet the developmental needs of participating children and improve the quality and stability of the child care workforce: State/Territory professional standards and competencies. Describe. The DC Professionals Receiving Opportunities and Support (DCPROS) outlines 11 Core Knowledge Areas (CKA) for all professionals in the District of Columbia. The CKA are well-integrated professional standards which are aligned with the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Standards for Early Childhood Professional Preparation, the Child Development Associate (CDA) Competency Standards, DC Common Core Early Learning Standards, DCPS Effective Schools Framework and the Federal Head Start Program Performance Standards. They include: Child Growth and Development; Observing, Documenting and Assessing to Support Young Children and Families; Health, Safety, and Nutrition; Curriculum; Inclusive Practices; Learning Environments; Building Family and Community Relationship; Diversity: Family, Language, Culture, and Society; Program Management, Operation and Evaluation; Professionalism and Advocacy; and Social-Emotional Development and Mental Health. The District's professional development plan recognizes that the field of early childhood encompasses a myriad of standards and competencies that reflect quality and stability in the child care workforce.New professionals receive basic orientation. Following this orientation, a supplemental week of early learning foundational training is provided to include health and safety, social-emotional, basic DC CCELS, SIDS prevention, Healthy Nutrition, CPR/First Aid, Act Early: Developmental Milestones, and CSEFEL). This series of Early Learning Foundations professional development is made available to all members of the workforce, free of charge. Once all sessions in the series are completed the individual earns 20 professional learning units (PLUs). Each of the courses embeds child development information and informs providers on how to use the DC Common District of Columbia Page 161 of 223Core Early Learning Standards for planning. By introducing the use of best practices, professionals learn the importance of their professional growth and are introduced to the comprehensive core knowledge areas in the Early Learning Foundations Course Catalog Career ladder or lattice. Describe. The District of Columbia Career Guide for Early Childhood and Out of School Time Professionals: Pathways to Professional Growth outlines a systemized professional development trajectory, with entry requirements for the workforce across all early education settings. The lattice provides a progressive articulation of professional attainment designated by Levels 1 through 12. The DC Career Guide is designed to support retention in the workforce based on individuals' decisions regarding their professional goals. The Career Guide encompasses four career pathways: Leadership, Infant/Toddler, Pre- Kindergarten, and Before/Afterschool. Early educators access teaching and learning opportunities, and at their own pace, attain the next professional level in the career guide. There are twelve levels with Qualifications Requirements that are defined, yet flexible, to ensure that professionals can pursue their own individualized professional growth plans. The Career Guide utilizes a system for pathways to progress through the 12 Levels based on the following: (1) documentation of earned professional learning units (PLUs), required annually for employment in a subsidized licensed child care setting; (2) credentials (CDA Infant Toddler, CDA Preschool, Director's Credential I, and/or a credential in a specialized field of study); and (3) earned college credits and higher education degrees. The approval process for Level progression is individualized and issued by the District's Division of Early Learning (DEL) Professional Development team. Articulation agreements between two- and four-year postsecondary early childhood education or degree programs. Describe. The Program Quality Committee of the SECDCC is exploring how the District can ensure that early childhood professionals who complete a CDA credential will simultaneously earn an equivalent of six college credits. At this time, three schools with Associate Degree (AA) early childhood programs in the District transpose the CDA to earned District of Columbia Page 162 of 223college credit based on the 480 required CDA practicum hours in child care centers. Additionally, a new Associate Degree program of study in Early Childhood with an Infant- Toddler endorsement is launching at a District post secondary university. Currently, there is interest between representatives from local colleges, technical assistance organizations, and student scholarship program staff to engage in a discussion and develop articulation agreements. The research recently released by the National Academy of Sciences, \"Transforming the Workforce\" will be a foundation for partnership between professionals, including all levels of leadership and faculty of higher education programs. The regional perspective and dialogue is currently facilitated by the members of a local private foundation. The conversation about implementation is evolving and potentially pivotal in local implementation for workforce recruitment and retention strategies. This regional discussion extends to collaborative decisions that guide the local professional field and potentially instrumental in defining competencies and career pathways. Collectively this influence accelerates the movement toward formal articulations and agreements between two and four-year postsecondary early childhood education programs. Community-based training approved by a state regulatory body to meet licensing or regulatory requirements. Describe. Workforce data, including recruitment, retention, registries or other documentation, and compensation information. Describe. OSSE is upgrading its current professional development registry to a more user-friendly platform that will enhance early learning professional's access to professional learning opportunities and it will be integrated and connected to the child care licensing system.

OSSE issues certificates for earned Professional Development Learning Units (PLU) for providers attending the professional development training opportunities through the Early Learning Course Catalog published quarterly. OSSE does not provide Continuing Education Units (CEUs). State-approved trainings. Describe. Additionally, OSSE has a robust, research-based Trainer Approval Program (TAP) that ensures the child care workforce has access to a wide variety of quality training opportunities that improve their knowledge, skills, and competency in early childhood development from infancy through pre-K to Kindergarten. TAP certifies both individual and organizational professional development trainers that provide ongoing training and professional development opportunities in 11 Core Knowledge Areas (CKAs). CKAs detail the specific knowledge and skills needed by early childhood professionals to work effectively with all young children and families. CKAs include: Child Growth and Development; Social-Emotional Development and Mental Health; Observing, Documenting, and Assessing to Support Young Children and Families; Inclusive Practices; Health, Safety, and Nutrition; Curriculum; Learning Environments; Building Family and Community Relationships; Diversity: Family, Language, Culture, and Society; Program Management: Operation and Evaluation; and Professionalism and Advocacy. District of Columbia Page 164 of 223 OSSE supportsscholarships for the early care and education workforce as well as in- person and on-line resources through the OSSE Early Learning Foundations Course Catalog, published quarterly.

Describe. 6.1.3 Describe how the State/Territory developed its training and professional development requirements in consultation with the State Advisory Council (SAC) on Early Childhood Education and Care (if applicable) or other state or state-designated cross-agency body if there is no SAC Describe. The SECDCC Committee for Program Quality is focused on improving access and actively contributes to improvements in professional development. The committee membership is comprised of a quality improvement coach, OSSE certified professional development trainers, higher education faculty, a family child care home provider, a licensed child care center director, and representatives from OSSE's Early Learning Division. The committee is focused on the quality improvement with regard to the Career Lattice, pedagogy for higher education and competence of providers, and identification of strategies for collecting information and feedback from the provider community. OSSE professional development system is articulated through the District of Columbia Professionals Receiving Opportunities and Support (DC PROS). Professional Development (PD) Plan is designed to serve as a guide for the District of Columbia to solidify and expand professional development opportunities for the early childhood workforce. DC PROS builds upon current systems and includes the goals and initiatives designed to accomplish the DEL workforce development objectives. DC PROS is a fluid document that will be reviewed by the Program Quality Committee as the agenda progresses to further address and adapt to best practices in the field and legislative or policy changes. District of Columbia Page 165 of 223OSSE administration is participating in The Regional Implementation Network with regard to the collaboration activities in response to the National Academies of Sciences, Institute of Medicine and National Research Council report, \"Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8: A Unifying Foundation.\" The network has convened with state-based leadership, including neighboring states Virginia and Maryland, with the intent to identify a core group of administrators and foundation stakeholders for ongoing representation at the national level. The national agenda will influence and build momentum within the State Advisory and Program Quality committee's work toward quality improvements in the workforce. 6.1.4 Describe how the State/Territory incorporates knowledge and application of the State's early learning and developmental guidelines (where applicable), the State/Territory's health and safety standards (as described in section 5), and incorporates social-emotional/behavioral and early childhood mental health intervention models, which may include positive behavior intervention and support models (as described in Section 2) into its training and professional development requirements Describe.

Describe. The DCCCELS articulate progression and differences in the approach to learning with infants, mobile infants, toddlers, 3's, 4's and 5's. The trajectory of child development is clearly articulated in DCCCELS as well as reinforced in textbooks, curricula, and practicum assignments. Supportive practices in these standards provide guidance regarding the inclusion of English learners and children with special needs. OSSE provides specialized bilingual trainers to accommodate language diversity in its professional development trainings. The District of Columbia offers both oral translation and written translation services of vital documents (applications, notices, complaint forms, legal contracts, and outreach materials that inform individuals about their rights or eligibility requirements for benefits and participation) in the following languages: Amharic, Spanish, Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Korean.

Yes, the State/Territory has a system of technical assistance operating State/Territory-wide Yes, the State/Territory has a system of technical assistance operating as a pilot or in a few localities No, but the State/Territory is in the development phase No, the State/Territory has no plans for development a) If yes, check all that apply to the technical assistance and describe. Child care providers are supported in developing and implementing curriculum/learning activities based on the State's/Territory's early learning and development guidelines. Describe: OSSE provides Early Learning Standards training and technical assistance (T/TA) for teachers and administrators. The T/TA is selected and prioritized based on data from a variety of sources including, but not limited to: community requests and workgroups, analysis of CLASS, ITERS, FCCERS and ECERS assessment data scores, Education Services Monitor program reports, licensing inspection reports, and Unusual Incident Reports. OSSE offers a range of professional learning experiences to enhance the infrastructure of professional development for providers including: Traditional Course offerings: The Early Learning Course Catalog is published quarterly and encompasses the foundation of the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards, as well as cross-sector targeted subject matter that is aligned with identified needs. The catalog selections range from basic to advanced learning opportunities in eleven core knowledge areas for professionals who work across different early care and education settings; Communities of Practice: Communities of Practice (CoP) are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do, and actively learn how to do it better as they meet regularly and receive technical assistance and feedback. In the past two years OSSE has introduced CoPs around cutting edge topics in early childhood education including DC Early Mathematics Collaborative, Early Literacy, CLASS Dimensions and participation in the Science Education Leadership Cadre. District of Columbia Page 185 of 223Priority examples for the upcoming years are the Cradling Literacy (a birth to three early literacy initiative), a pre-K Language Learning and Early Literacy program, and the Program Administration Scales (a program management tool for self- assessment); DC Early Learning Standards 301 -Field Trip Fridays: These hands on learning opportunities are planned throughout the fiscal year and provide an opportunity for teachers, administrators, coaches, and family child care home providers to explore the Early Learning Standards through hands-on activities; collaborate and network with their peers and colleagues; and avail themselves of free cultural and educational resources in the District; PD On-Demand/On-site: OSSE will provide extensive on-site technical assistance and site-based trainings on the DC CCELS to the community during the months of December, January, and February; PD Coaching and Technical Assistance: The Division of Early Learning supports technical assistance through the coaching for classroom teachers, and coaching for the Early Head Start Child Care Partnerships centers and family child development homes; and PD Campaign Initiatives: OSSE participates in the development of an annual conference, and supports the workforce through high profile campaign topics designed to expedite awareness and behavior change. This strategy is responsive and used to move the work force toward career pathways and targeted areas of interest. Also, it is the means for T/TA and fast-track implementation of best practice. In some cases, topic choice relates to local emergent needs, as well as national awareness campaigns such as: 1) Early Head Start, and routines and relationship-based care of infants and toddler age children and parents, and 2) family and community engagement. The technical assistance is linked to the State's/Territory's quality rating and improvement system. Describe: District of Columbia Page 186 of 223Child care providers working with infants and/or toddlers have access to the technical assistance for implementing early learning and development guidelines. Describe: OSSE has supported and sustained infant and toddler quality improvement initiatives using a technical assistance coaching support system and is currently working with technical assistance providers and other key stakeholders to develop a state-based coaching model that will support early learning professionals in improving their practice. The Early Head Start (EHS) Child Care Partnerships QIN provides continuous, intensive coaching with teacher/provider staff to ensure fully compliant programs, enhance competency, while implementing the comprehensive EHS framework with all partnering programs. QIN partner programs currently receive coaching on PITC pedagogy, reducing risks while promoting health and safety, and utilizing data assessment to inform positive changes and best practices. OSSE provides technical assistance on understanding and using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) data for Infants and Toddlers to improve program quality. Data engagement meetings support program leaders in learning more about the CLASS data and how to use it to improve outcomes for children. Program leaders are given their program and classroom level reports on the CLASS observation prior to the data engagement meeting. During the meeting, program leaders ask specific questions based on the information in their program/class level reports. The information exchange assists attendees in effectively using their data. Addtionally, OSSE Education Services Monitors and professional development staff are certified PITC trainers and use the knowledge and information to provide technical assistance to child development centers and homes. Child care providers working with preschool-age children have access to the technical assistance for implementing early learning and development guidelines. Describe: Professional development offerings in the DC Early Learning Foundations Catalog - District of Columbia Page 187 of 223entitled DC Common Core Early Learning Standards 101, 201, and 301 - are provided with intentional scaffolding and immerse early care professionals, teachers, administrators, coaches and specialists in the continuum of learning. Through these offerings, they gain a thorough understanding of the early development that is expected of all young children (from birth through exit from pre- Kindergarten). The implementation of technical assistance through an early literacy community of practice (CoP), introduced in 2013, exemplifies a move to center-based, side by side observations, and incorporates feedback sessions and a coaching model. This investment was well-received by the District's early learning professionals. The DC CCELS 301 is a hands-on training that provides strongly integrated teaching for coaches, family child home providers, teachers, and administrators. Additionally, partnerships between OSSE and community experts on the arts and sciences include hands-on technical assistance with teachers and family child care home providers, incorporating active engagement with STEM, arts integration, early mathematics and early literacy immersion experiences to comprehensively support school readiness for young children. Child care providers working with school-age children have access to the technical assistance for implementing early learning and development guidelines. Describe: Child care providers working with school-age children and out of school time programs have full access to the Early Learning Foundations Catalog offerings and, specifically, the DC CCELS 101, 201 and 301 training opportunities offered each month in English (and four times annually in Spanish). b) Indicate which funds are used for this activity (check all that apply) CCDF funds. Describe CCDF funds (e.g., quality set-aside, infant-toddler set aside, etc.) CCDF Discretionary and quality set-aside funds will be used to support the professional development system, communities of practice, and supports for continuous quality improvement. District of Columbia Page 188 of 223Other funds. Describe other funding sources (e.g., Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge, state or local funds, etc.) Locally appropriated funds will be used to support the early head start childcare partnership. 6.3.4 Check here to demonstrate that State/Territory assures that CCDF funds will not be used to develop or implement an assessment for children that: (658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I)) -Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care provider ineligible to participate in the CCDF program -Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward or sanction for an individual provider -Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF program -Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing effectiveness of child care programs -Will be used to deny children eligibility to participate in the CCDF program Yes. 7 Support Continuous Quality Improvement Lead Agencies are required to reserve and use a portion of their Child Care and Development Block Grant funds for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and increase parental options for, and access to, high-quality child care. Support for continuous quality improvement is expected to cover the entire age span of children supported by CCDF, from birth through age 12. States/Territories may provide these quality improvement activities directly, or through grants or contracts with local child care resource and referral organizations or other appropriate entities. The activities should be in alignment with a State/Territory-wide assessment of the State's/Territory's needs to carry out such services and care. These quality investments can align with, support and help sustain additional quality efforts developed under Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge grants, Early Head Start/Head Start partnerships and other funding efforts. States and Territories will report on these quality improvement investments through CCDF in three ways: 1) ACF will collect annual data on how much CCDF funding is spent on quality activities using the expenditure report (ACF-696); 2) In the Plan, States and Territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the three-year period; and District of Columbia Page 189 of 2233) For each three-year Plan period, States and Territories will submit a separate annual report that will show the measures used by the State/Territory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State/Territory. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States and Territories to use the quality set-aside to fund at least one of the following 10 activities: 1) Supporting the training and professional development of the child care workforce (as described in Section 6) 2) Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and development guidelines (as described in Section 6) 3) Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating system for child care providers and services 4) Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers 5) Establishing or expanding a Statewide system of child care resource and referral services (as described Section 1) 6) Supporting compliance with State/Territory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in Section 5) 7) Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the State/Territory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children 8) Supporting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation 9) Supporting the development or adoption of high-quality program standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and physical development 10) Other activities to improve the quality of child care services as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, child well-being, or kindergarten-entry are possible. Throughout this Plan, States and Territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, the quality set- aside funds. We recognize that for some areas, States and Territories may leverage other funds to support the quality improvement goals, which we encourage and support. For example, activities related to early learning and development guidelines may be supported by a combination of CCDF and education funding. States and Territories continue to have such flexibility. District of Columbia Page 190 of 223 7.1 Activities to Improve the Quality of Child Care Services 7.1.1 What are your overarching goals for quality improvement? Please describe how the State/Territory selected these goals, including any data or the State/Territory-wide assessment of needs that identified the needs for quality improvement services The District's early learning strategic plan was established by the SECDCC and focuses on building a comprehensive early learning and development system that integrates and aligns policies, services and programs in pursuit of better outcomes for the District's youngest children, particularly children who face multiple risk factors to their learning and development. The following goals drive the District's system building work: All District children, birth through age 8 will develop in comprehensive and enriching environments; All families of children, birth through age 8, are linked to opportunities and resources that strengthen their role as parents; Professionals working with young children have the knowledge, skills, and supports to work effectively with and on behalf of children and families; and All communities (neighborhoods in all Wards of the District of Columbia) are safe places where resources are available to help children and families thrive. As a result of these shared goals and our strategic approach, the District will realize the following outcomes: Significant decrease in the school readiness gap and the academic achievement between populations of children; Improved knowledge and practice of nurturing behaviors, parenting, nutrition and wellness among families and early childhood professionals; Increased number of environments, including but not limited to early childhood and development settings, providing early identification, intervention, supports, and mental health consultation; Increased number of children who live in safe, stable, and supportive families; Increased number of children receiving developmental screens in a timely manner, including District of Columbia Page 191 of 223Medicaid-eligible children who will receive EPSDT screening on a periodicity schedule that meets the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics; Improved access for families to information about high-quality early childhood and development settings for their children; Increased number of early childhood professionals that have a clearly articulated path that is inclusive of teacher preparation programs for career advancement and aligns with the Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework; and Increased number of neighborhood clusters that have access to high-quality early childhood development programs. The SECDCC's early learning plan includes six key strategies to advance our goals and achieve outcomes for children, families, professionals and communities: Enhance the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS); Going for the Gold. Currently, the District's QRIS only applies to providers in the subsidy system. By revising its QRIS, the District will have a common method for assessing and communicating the level of quality in ALL publicly funded early care and education programs for children birth to age five. Expand Infant & Toddler Capacity and Quality: . The District's universal pre-K program for all three- and four-year old children has resulted in dramatic increases in the participation of children with high needs in high quality pre-k. The District must now shift to increasing the availability and quality of programs serving infants and toddlers with the same sense of urgency and intentionality it had when it achieved its status as the nation's leader in public pre-k. Over the last three years, the District has invested nearly $18 million in new investments to build the supply of high quality infant and toddler child care for families who can least afford it. These resources have been targeted to increase the reimbursement rates to providers serving infants and toddlers in our child care subsidy program and improve child care facilities to expand the supply of infant and toddler child care in the District by an additional 200 slots. Create Health and Early Childhood Education Linkages : The District has one of the highest rates of insured children in the country; as such the health care system is a critical partner in addressing the health, behavioral health and developmental needs of children in order to improve school readiness and later school success. In fact, during the infant and toddler District of Columbia Page 192 of 223years, child health practitioners often represent the only professional seeing the child and therefore are in a position to identify and respond to developmental concerns. There is a growing base of innovative practices and an emerging field of research and knowledge on the efficacy of early childhood primary care practice interventions that support school readiness goals, particularly when health practitioners are linked to early learning and development programs. Implement Pre-K to 3rd Grade Approaches: With universal access to pre-K, the District's public education system is truly a P-12, rather than a K-12 system - with the great majority of pre-k programs being delivered within elementary schools. As such, the District is poised to ensure that children's gains made in pre-K are sustained in the K-3 grades in order to close the achievement gap. Research shows that intentional efforts must be implemented to promote pre-K to 3rd grade continuity. Improving our structure of school accountability to more explicitly incorporate children's progress during these critical years is essential. Develop and Utilize a Comprehensive Early Childhood Data System: The District will build on the foundation of our existing State Longitudinal\u00ad Education Data system (SLED) and the District of Columbia Access System (DCAS) to develop, manage and use data to improve the quality of the District's birth to five system and look at children's progress and outcomes over time. Using a common identifier, the data system will integrate data across multiple state departments and agencies including health, human services, education, and health care finance where appropriate. Using data in SLED and DCAS, the District will regularly generate information that is timely, rele\u00advant, and accessible. Policymakers, early learning and development programs and early childhood educators will use this data to continuously improve, make key decisions, and inform parents and other community stakeholders about the status of early learning in the District. Produce citywide and neighborhood level school readiness data and maps: The District will implement the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a valid and reliable school readiness measure, in all pre-K 4 classrooms every three years. The EDI maps and data will represent children's health and development across multiple domains, overlaid with other data including risk factors and community assets. The EDI data will allow the District to make evidence-based decisions when targeting early childhood resources, conducting strategic planning (both internal and external to government), and tracking the impact of early learning policies and investments on child outcomes over time.

Describe: 7.2.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State/Territory. Describe: The current Quality Rating System, Going for the Gold, is a tiered rate reimbursement system based on accreditation. The purpose of this system is as follows: To identify and reward programs that attain accreditation; Improve the quality of child care in the District of Columbia; Encourage providers to participate in the subsidy system; Increase compensation for exceptional programs; and Provide a vehicle for families to access information regarding high quality care for children. Although the \"Going for the Gold\" fulfilled most of the intended purposes, a need to enhance and expand the current system was identified after the Pre-K Act was enacted and a three sector system of service delivery, DC Public Schools, public charter schools and community- based organizations, was codified. DC's enhanced QRIS will provide a common measure of quality that will inform consumers and help target investments and planning across all three systems. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has devoted significant time to developing an enhanced QRIS. OSSE contracted with the BUILD Initiative and engaged the National Center on Quality in support of this work over the past two years. The enhanced QRIS is outcome-focused and will be piloted in 2016 with the goal to begin full implementation in 2017. The framework includes Learning Environment, In-seat Attendance (pre-K only), and a Continuous Quality Improvement Plan. 7.3 Improving the Supply and Quality of Child Care Programs and Services for Infants and Toddlers District of Columbia Page 199 of 223The CCDBG Act of 2014 included changes targeted at improving the supply and quality of infant-toddler care. Lead Agencies are encouraged to systematically assess and improve the overall quality of care infants and toddlers receive, the systems in place or needed to support and enhance the quality of infant and toddler providers and the capacity of the infant and toddler workforce to meet the unique needs of very young children, and the methods in place to increase the proportion of infants and toddlers in higher quality care. 7.3.1 What activities are being implemented by the State/Territory to improve the supply (see also section 4) and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers? Check all that apply and describe. Establishing or expanding high-quality community or neighborhood-based family and child development centers, which may serve as resources to child care providers in order to improve the quality of early childhood services provided to infants and toddlers from low-income families and to help eligible child care providers improve their capacity to offer high-quality, age-appropriate care to infants and toddlers from low-income families. Describe: The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) received one of seven state level Early Head Start-Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnership grants to provide high quality, comprehensive, early childhood development services to at-risk children in wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; the wards demonstrating the most need and which have the highest at-risk populations. Through this initiative, OSSE developed a community-based Quality Improvement Networks (QIN) comprised of three neighborhood-based hubs that are responsible for providing comprehensive services and quality improvement technical assistance to a network of child development centers and child development homes. These centers and homes have agreed to meet Early Head Start Program Performance Standards. All services will be full-day, minimum of 10.5 hours a day and full-year, at least 48 weeks. At least 50 percent of the project's enrollment will be EHS-eligible children, and 100 percent of enrolled children will receive child care subsidies. This initiative will increase the supply of high-quality infant and toddler care in the District and supplement and enhance the quality of services provided to all children enrolled in the child care partner sites. As the first phase in a five-year program, the combined funding comprised of locally appropriate funds and federal assistance will provide high quality, comprehensive, infant and toddler development services to 200 EHS-eligible children District of Columbia Page 200 of 223and reach a total of 440 low-income children in EHS-CC Partnership slots in the first year of the grant. The project will add child care capacity in the District by allowing existing child care providers that are selected to participate in the networks (Partner Sites) to convert existing child care subsidy slots to or add new EHS-CC partnership slots based on the physical capacity of the site and community needs. Federal funding covers technical assistance to enhance quality and instructional coaching for infant/toddler teachers in partner sites. Local funding will support the provision of comprehensive services. The QIN will ensure more infants and toddlers and their families benefit from early, continuous, intensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services meeting EHS standards. In addition to enhancing existing subsidy slots through this initiative, the District will add 1,000 new and/or QIN participatingslots for infants and toddlers with local funding and create additional neighborhood-based QINs over the next five years. Establishing or expanding the operation of community or neighborhood-based family child care networks. Describe: As part of the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), OSSE awarded a grant to a community-based organization to serve as a hub and provide technical assistance and training and coordinate comprehensive services for a network of child development homes that primarily serve infants and toddlers. The hub agency supports ten child development home providers and continues to recruit home providers out of its existing partnerships established through the Licensing and Technical Assistance grant from OSSE. The hub is supporting the network in achieving Early Head Start quality in their programs. The hub provides continuous job embedded professional development and coaching to the staff, comprehensive services, health services, support in nutrition and wellness, as well as support to engage families in the programs. Providing training and professional development to promote and expand child care providers' ability to provide developmentally appropriate services for infants and toddlers. Describe: The QIN coaches and infant and toddler specialists are trained in the PITC coaching model and provide weekly coaching and support to infant and toddler teachers. Providing financial incentives (including the use of grants and contracts as discussed in section 4) to increase the supply and quality of infant-toddler care. District of Columbia Page 201 of 223Describe: Providing coaching and/or technical assistance on this age group's unique needs from Statewide networks of qualified infant-toddler specialists. Describe: The District provides ongoing professional development opportunities for infant and toddler professionals. In FY15, the district conducted over 150 professional development trainings specific to infant and toddler teachers and administrators free of charge. The District also has approximately 100 OSSE approved professional development trainers that are certified in the infant and toddler development content area. Below are some of the infant and toddler trainings that are offered annually. Social and Emotional Foundations of Early Learning (based off of CSEFEL); The DC Common Core Early Learning Standards; Addressing the Impact of Parental Incarceration on Children, Families, Schools and Communities; Preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; Diapering A to Z; CLASS Trainings specifically for Infants and Toddlers; Stewards of Children; Adult and Pediatric First Aid; Nutrition for infants and Toddlers; Intentional Lesson Planning; Ages and Stages Questionnaire; Infants and Toddlers: Early Brain Development, Learning, and Mental Health. Coordinating with early intervention specialists who provide services for infants and toddlers with disabilities under part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) Describe: The OSSE is the lead agency for the District's Early Intervention (Part C) Program (DCEIP). The mission of the DC Early Intervention Program is to identify and serve infants and toddlers, birth through two (2) years, with developmental delays and disabilities and their families. As the single point of entry for infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays and disabilities from birth to the third birthday, DC EIP identifies and evaluates infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays and provides high quality, age appropriate early intervention services for eligible infants/toddlers and their families. DC EIP coordinates services in a caring manner that supports the culture and meets the needs of families. OSSE incorporates the requirements under IDEA, Part C - Comprehensive System of Personnel Development (CSPD); monitoring and compliance; fiscal oversight; training and technical assistance; data collection and reporting; public awareness; procedural safeguards and policy District of Columbia Page 202 of 223development. In its overall administration of its early education and care programs, DCEIP maintains both in-house and contracted staff to provide child find; evaluation/assessments; direct early intervention services; and service coordination. DC EIP serves approximately 750 children and their families per year. Developing infant and toddler components within the State's/Territory's QRIS. Describe: Developing infant and toddler components within the State's/Territory's child care licensing regulations. Describe: The licensing regulations have standards that are specific to Infants and toddlers. Some examples include ratio, group size, indoor program space requirements, and general furnishing, food and nutrition, equipment and supplies requirements. Developing infant and toddler components within the early learning and development guidelines. Describe: In a response to the evolution of the standards movement in early childhood education, the District of Columbia revised its early learning standard in 2012. The revised standards have a continuum of learning and development expected of all young children from birth through third grade. They include alignment with the Common Core Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics. They are also aligned with the Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework, thus ensuring that all children will receive the same standards-based instruction regardless of program. The Early Learning standards include indicators for infants, toddlers, two year olds, preschoolers (3s and 4s) and the exit expectations for children leaving pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten. Improving the ability of parents to access transparent and easy to understand consumer information about high-quality infant and toddler care. Describe: A grant award witha child care resource and referral agency (CCR&R) is in place to provide consumer education to families. The CCR&R provides parents with a provider listing and current Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) rating information. Additionally, informational brochures are distributed to parents that address the importance of quality and different child care options. CCR&R shares program information with families seeking child care through a variety of mediums including an online database, walk-in consultation and phone referrals.

The CCR&R provides parents and caregivers with information, education, and resources that help support children's development and learning. The CCR&R provides a walk-in and online resource library filled with books, articles, and brochures to help answer questions about child development and other topics important to parents and caregivers. The CCR&R also provides information about the different types of early learning and development programs and helps families find a high quality early learning and development provider in their area. The CCR&R will be involved in the implementation of the enhanced quality rating and improvement system (QRIS) including providing marketing for the QRIS and technical assistance and coaching supports to rated programs. The CCR&R will be involved in the continuous evaluation planning and promotion of the QRIS. The measure of success will be the number of programs progressing into high quality levels and the number of children enrolled in higher quality care. 7.5 Facilitating Compliance with State Standards 7.5.1 What strategies does your State/Territory fund with CCDF quality funds to facilitate District of Columbia Page 205 of 223child care providers' compliance with State/Territory requirements for inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety, and with State/Territory licensing standards? Describe: On-line and in-person trainings on new licensing regulations and the required trainings; Technical assistance from experts and consultants on regulatory compliance practices, technologies and processes; and updates to monitoring tools and interpretative guidelines; Upgrade and improve online content on licensing requirements and provider resources; Provide on-going health and safety training and resources to providers; Conduct additional provider meetings and trainings on licensing regulations and child care and health and safety practices; and Support providers in making necessary changes by providing timely and written feedback on licensing visits and inspections. 7.5.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State/Territory Describe: Scores on the CLASS, ITERS, and FCCERS; In-seat Attendance (pre-K only); Development and implementation of a Quality Improvement Plan; Number of centers and homes achieving highest quality tier level on the state's enhanced QRIS; Improvement in health and safety ratings as measured on environmental health and safety reviews conducted by licensing specialists; District of Columbia Page 206 of 223 Percentage of licensing staff completing competency-based training and staff development; Results of provider surveys on the quality of monitoring visits and their satisfaction with the quality of available resources; and Number of provider trainings conducted and percentage of providers attending sessions. 7.6 Evaluating and Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Child Care Programs and Services 7.6.1 One of the purposes of the CCDBG Act of 2014 is to increase the number and percentage of low-income children in high-quality child care settings. Describe how the State/Territory measures the quality and effectiveness of child care programs and services offered in the State/Territory, including any tools used to measure child, family, teacher, classroom, or provider improvements, and how the State/Territory evaluates that such programs positively impact children The District primarily relies on the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) as our measure of quality. In 2015, the District conducted CLASS observations in every preschool classroom receiving CCDF funds. Additionally, 209 infant and toddler classrooms that receive CCDF funds were also assessed using the CLASS Infant and the CLASS toddler. The Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale-Revised (FCCERS-R) and the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ITERS-R) are also used to measure the quality of child care programs. OSSE will use the Early Development Instrument, a population-based measure of school readiness to measure improvements in child outcomes. 7.6.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State/Territory Describe: The following are a description of instruments used for program quality evaluation, teacher effectiveness observation and student outcome evaluation. District of Columbia Page 207 of 223 Program Quality Evaluation -ITERS-R (Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Revised Edition) is an observation instrument designed to assess programs for children from birth to 30 months of age. It measures spatial, programmatic, and interpersonal features of the program environment. ITERS-R has 39 items that are organized into seven subscales: 1) Space and Furnishings, 2) Personal Care Routines, 3) Listening and Talking, 4) Activities, 5) Interaction, 6) Program Structure, and 7) Parents and Staff. Scoring of this instrument ranges from 1 (inadequate), 4 (minimal), and 7 (excellent). -FCCERS-R (Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Revised Edition) is an observation instrument designed to assess family child care programs conducted in a provider's home for children from infancy through school-age. It measures spatial, programmatic, and interpersonal features of the program environment. This instrument contains 37 items and seven subscales: 1) Space and Furnishings, 2) Personal Care Routines, 3) Listening and Talking, 4) Activities, 5) Interaction, 6) Program Structure, and 7) Parents and Provider and contains 43 items. Scoring of this instrument ranges from 1 (inadequate), 4 (minimal), and 7 (excellent). Teacher Effectiveness Evaluation -CLASS Pre-k: The CLASS Pre-K has nine subscales to assess classroom quality in terms of emotional and instructional climate and quality of teacher-child interactions, which includes classroom management and instructional supports for learning. Each subscale is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 or 2 (classroom is low on that dimension) to 6 or 7 (classroom is high on that dimension). -CLASS Infant (CLASS-I): The CLASS-I includes one (1) broad domain of Responsive Caregiving and four (4) dimensions. In CLASS-I, Responsive Caregiving refers to specific teaching behaviors that include participation in shared experiences and play; attending quickly to infants' cues and needs; following infants' leads and expanding on them; monitoring infants' behavior and sounds; and engaging in back and forth communication exchanges. Responsive Caregiving acknowledges that infants each have their own preferences, interests, and needs. Teachers are more effective when they pay careful attention to infants as individuals and respond in a way that will best meet each infant's particular needs. This responsive Caregiving builds a foundation of trust and security and supports infants as they learn about and explore the world around them. -CLASS Toddler (CLASS-T): The CLASS-T describes two (2) domains of Emotional and Behavioral Support and Engaged Support for Learning and eight (8) dimensions of teacher-child interactions that support children's learning and development. In CLASS-T, Emotional and Behavioral Support refers to specific teaching and behaviors that help children develop warm, supportive relationships, experience enjoyment and excitement about learning, feel comfortable in the classroom, experience appropriate levels of autonomy or independence, develop behavioral regulation, meet behavioral expectations, and fully participate in classroom activities. Engaged Support for Learning refers to specific teaching behaviors that include the facilitation of activities that enhance children's thinking, reasoning, and verbal skills, build their knowledge of the world, and encourage persistence, attention, and District of Columbia Page 208 of 223motivation. Student Outcome Evaluation -The Early Development Instrument (EDI) tool is an assessment that provides a population based measure of how young children are developing in neighborhoods in the United States. This information can be useful in improving policies, as well as, allocating resources and community level strategies to improve school readiness for children birth to 5 years old. The information from EDI benefits teachers, schools, & communities in a variety of ways: -Provides a community measure of school readiness that can be used to look back and assess how the early childhood community can better prepare children for school, as well as, look forward to inform how to address the needs of the incoming class of kindergarten students -Helps forge partnerships between schools and the broader community of early childhood stakeholders 7.7 Accreditation Support 7.7.1 Does the State/Territory support child care providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation by a national accrediting body with demonstrated, valid, and reliable program standards of high quality?

This work has been funded through the Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems Grant through the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Additionally, with the passage of the District of Columbia's Healthy Tots Act (HTA) in 2014, child development programs serving more than 50 percent children eligible for subsidy are required to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. The HTA provides an additional enhancement to each meal as an incentive and outlines standards for physical health and well-being. 7.8.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State/Territory Describe: Number of centers enrolled in CACFP; CACFP monitoring visits; Licensing inspections; and Enhanced QRIS - continuous quality improvement. 7.9 Other Quality Improvement Activities 7.9.1 List and describe any other activities the State/Territory provides to improve the District of Columbia Page 210 of 223quality of child care services and describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving provider preparedness, child safety, child well-being, or entry into kindergarten. OSSE will partner with the Department of Behavioral Health to expand research-based mental health consultation to child development centers and homes. Children will be measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Deveraux Early Childhood Assessment. Teachers will have the opportunity to reflect on their own practice and will receive coaching support. 8 Ensure Grantee Program Integrity and Accountability Under CCDF, program integrity and accountability activities are grounded in the State/Territory's policies for implementing the CCDF program. For error rate activities, reviews are based on the State/Territory's own CCDF policies. The CCDBG Act of 2014 made sweeping changes to the program requirements. With these changes, the State/Territory has an opportunity to change their own policies to reduce the burden for participants and staff as they build in safeguards to maintain program integrity. For example, the new law focuses on eligibility requirements at the time of eligibility determination and allows for a minimum 12- month period of eligibility before redetermination, which lessens the need for participants to continually provide documentation. This, in turn, relieves the State/Territory from the burden of constantly \"checking\" on participants which can open the door for miscalculations, lost paperwork, and other errors. Lead Agencies are required to have accountability measures in place to ensure integrity and to identify fraud or other program violations. These accountability measures should address administrative error, including unintentional agency error, as well as program violations, both unintentional and intentional. Violations may or may not result in further action by the Lead Agency, including those cases suspected of and/or prosecuted for fraud. 8.1 Program Integrity 8.1.1 Describe how the State ensures that their definitions for violations have been modified, staff trained, and program integrity procedures revised to reflect new requirements. District of Columbia Page 211 of 223Describe: OSSE has hosted a number of Town Hall Meetings to share information on the reauthorization of the child care development fund block grant law. These meetings will continue through March 2016 to ensure that all community partners both, public and private, are informed of all aspects of the law and policy changes. These meetings will also include information about the regulations once they are published in the Federal Register Additional steps will include: -Revising and/or adding definitions to the eligibility policies and procedures and child care licensing regulations; -Streamlining and simplifing current eligibility policies and procedures; -Providing regular training for agency staff and child care partners; and -Monitoring for compliance. OSSE is working with national and local experts to revise current eligibility and licensing policies to align with the new CCDBG Act of 2014 to ensure compliance with new requirements, program accountability, violations, and fraud reduction. 8.1.2 Describe how the State/Territory ensures that all staff are informed and trained regarding changes made to its policies and procedures to reflect new CCDF requirements. Check all that apply. Issue policy change notices Issue new policy manual Staff training Orientations Onsite training Online training Regular check-ins to monitor implementation of the new policies. Describe: OSSE conducts regular feedback sessions with staff and providers to ensure full implementation of all policy changes. Other. Describe: District of Columbia Page 212 of 223 8.1.3 Describe the processes the Lead Agency will use to monitor all sub-recipients, including those described in Section 1, such as licensing agencies, child care resource and referral agencies, and others with a role in administering CCDF. The Lead Agency is responsible for ensuring effective internal controls over the administration of CCDF funds. Lead Agencies that use other governmental or non-governmental sub- recipients to administer the program must have written agreements in place outlining roles and responsibilities for meeting CCDF requirements. Definition: \"Subrecipient means a non-Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass- through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an individual that is a beneficiary of such program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency (2 CFR 200.93).Two CFR Part 200, Subpart A provides additional information on contractors (which may be referred to as \"vendors\").The description of monitoring must include, but is not limited to, a description of the written agreements used, a schedule for completing the tasks, a budget which itemizes categorical expenditures consistent with CCDF requirements and indicators or measures to assess performance. Additional items for discussion may include: fiscal management, review of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with CCDF regulations, and monitoring/auditing contractors or grantees to ensure that eligible children are served and eligibility documentation is verified.\" Describe: OSSE monitors all CCDF sub-recipients. Written grant agreements or contracts are in place for all sub-contractors and/or sub-grantees that include deliverables and a detailed scope of work to ensure compliance with all federal and District laws, policies and regulations. OSSE requires all sub-recipients to participate in a post award conference that includes a review of all of OSSE's financial and programmatic policies and procedures as well as OMB circulars. OSSE's grants management unit hosts an annual conference for all sub-recipients. OSSE conducts annual onsite monitoring visits and program evaluations to all sub-recipients including, but not limited, the child care resource and referral agency and professional development and technical assistance grantees. Each program maintains records on file for a minimum period of three years. These records must be accessible at all times for review upon request by officials from the District of Columbia Government or the Federal Government. All on-site visits support efforts to maintain quality and ensure compliance with District of Columbia Page 213 of 223OSSE agreements, grants, MOUs, annual renewal issuances, OSSE's quality tier reimbursement criteria, OSSE's internal policies and procedures, and the District's and CCDF regulations. OSSE has implemented the Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS). The system was designed to improve the management and administration of federal and local grants managed by OSSE. EGMS provides users with information on the status of project applications and awards of federal and state funds. EGMS offers grantees more convenience with a centralized location to manage the following: -Identify and apply to OSSE grants; -Track milestones of the sub-recipient's grant from start to finish; and -Submit electronic reimbursement requests. The system has enhanced operational efficiencies, security architecture, central data storage and warehousing, increased transparency, workflow automation and performance accountability. OSSE's grants management and program staff review monthly invoices in EGMS to determine that all expenses are aligned with the grantees' scope of work and approved budget. In addition, mid-and-year end reports are submitted to OSSE. These reports, along with onsite monitoring, provide a thorough review of the grantee's compliance with OSSE's approved work plan, budget, and performance goals. If corrective action is needed, grant monitors, along with the grantee, develop quality improvement plans to support compliance with the grant requirements. Fiscal Monitoring OSSE sub-recipients expending $750,000 or more annually in federal funds must comply with the Federal Office of Management and Budget OMB - A133 Single Audit requirements for non-profit organizations and the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards' (GAGAS) which are the guidelines for the annual audit required by all for-profit organizations in receipt of $750,000 or more in federal funds. These organizations must submit an Independent Auditor's Report with the financial opinion of a Certified Public Accountant. Sub- recipients with income and revenues less than $750,000 annually must submit a financial review as conducted by a Certified Public Accountant with the corresponding notes and letter of opinion. Both financial reviews and audits must be conducted annually and should be submitted no later than nine months following the close of the provider's fiscal year. District of Columbia Page 214 of 223Sub-recipients are required to submit monthly invoices that align with an OSSE approved budget. Sub-recipients that fail to comply with the terms of their grant will be required to return funds and will be barred from participating in CCDF funded programs for a minimal of one year. Monitoring Licensing The OSSE Child Care Licensing and Compliance Unit inspects all licensed child development facilities at least once per year to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations as outlined in DCMR 29 and in the CCDF Plan. Monitoring of the Monthly Attendance Attendance is collected monthly and processed by the Attendance Coordinators. Attendance records may be audited at any time that discrepancies are suspected. When underpayments or overpayments are suspected, the Education Services Monitors conduct reviews of the attendance by collecting recent pay statements and attendance reports along with the facility's attendance roster and reconciles and compares these documents for errors, underpayments, overpayments or errors in names, services provided, start date or termination date, excused or unexcused absences and number of days served. The Education Services Monitors discuss all findings with the provider. In cases where there are substantial errors with the attendance the OSSE may impose sanctions such as Stop Placement Status or implement a corrective action plan. All suspected cases of fraud are forwarded to the OSSE's Office of the General Counsel. Eligibility Monitoring OSSE's Child Care Eligibility Monitoring Unit has the primary responsibility to monitor all eligibility determinations completed by intake/eligibility workers at the DC's Department of Human Services/Child Care Service Division and the Community Based Level II Provider sites. Level II providers are community-based organizations and sub-recipients that have agreements with OSSE to complete on-site eligibility determinations for their programs only. Eligibility records are selected for review to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information used in the eligibility determination process. A percentage of applications processed by Level II eligibility workers are monitored on an annual basis. To ensure timely eligibility redetermination, the Child Care Eligibility Monitoring Unit shares pending eligibility determination statistical reports monthly with the Level II Providers. After annual monitoring visits the Annual Eligibility Assessment Review Report of findings with expected corrective District of Columbia Page 215 of 223actions is issued and is shared with Level II providers and DHS/CCSD. The Child Care Eligibility Monitors conduct follow up visits to verify that the corrective actions have been completed, if needed. 8.1.4 Describe the activities the Lead Agency has in place to identify program violations and administrative error to ensure program integrity using the series of questions below. Program violations may include intentional and unintentional client and/or provider violations as defined by the Lead Agency. Administrative error refers to areas identified through the Error Rate Review process. Lead Agencies are required to have processes in place to identify fraud or other program violations. a) Check which activities the Lead Agency has chosen to conduct to identify unintentional or intentional program violations. Share/match data from other programs (e.g., TANF, Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), Medicaid) or other databases (e.g., State Directory of New Hires, Social Security Administration, Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS)) Run system reports that flag errors (include types) Describe: OSSE uses a \"Pending Eligibility Report\" to identify pending and late eligibility redeterminations errors.

District of Columbia Page 216 of 223Level II providers are child care providers who have agreements with OSSE to conduct their own eligibility. The Department of Human Services (DHS) is encouraged to run this report for cases that they manage every month. A percentage of the Level II provider's records are audited once a year. The review focuses on the five factors of Eligibility: Relationship, Residency, Legal Status (of the child), Need, and Income; and Records managed by DHS are randomly reviewed annually at a rate of 25%. The education services monitors conduct yearly visits to Level II sites to ensure that the programs are in alignment with the District's policies and procedures. During the visits the program's quality and curriculum are assessed. During the eligibility audits, the eligibility monitors review documents for accuracy and ensure that there are proper procedures in place during the intake and records maintenance process. Determinations involving provider \"Stop Placement\" (of children) or terminations from the subsidy program must be signed off by the supervisor. Additionally, before providers are paid for a month of services, a senior level supervisor must authorize the Accounts Payable Unit to process the monthly payment. Staff in the Division of Early Learning (DEL) and the Data, Accountability and Research (DAR) Division use data mining techniques to determine historic changes in rates and whether rate changes coincided with tier and payment adjustments. The education services monitors and eligibility monitors conduct quarterly trainings for providers on attendance and eligibility policies. Providers may also receive individual trainings if requested. None.
