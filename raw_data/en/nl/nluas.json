Please don't wait - vaccinate today .\" It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the body to build immunity against the flu. Flu vaccine is safe and has a proven track record of reducing influenza infections. Flu vaccine greatly reduces the chances of getting the flu and helps prevent se rious illness, hospitalization and death associated with flu. Flu shots can be co -administered with other vaccines, including the COVID -19 vaccine. If you're seein g a provider to get your COVID -19 vaccine or a Pfizer booster dose, check to see if you can get a flu shot too. Many, but not all, vaccine clinics will be offering both vaccines at the same time this year for convenience and efficiency.
