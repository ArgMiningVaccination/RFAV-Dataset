The [flu shot](https://www.forbes.com/health/medicare/does-medicare-cover-flu-shots/) has not only proven that it keeps people from getting sick with flu\u2014 the CDC cites a reduced risk of 40% to 60%\u2014 but a 2021 study found it also reduces risk of flu-related ICU admission by 26% and death by 31% [[1]](#footnote_1). Below, we detail when to get your child the flu shot, some side effects to look for and even a needle-free vaccine option. When Should My Child Get the Flu Shot? Influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory virus that can cause fever, cough, body aches and, mostly in children, vomiting and diarrhea. Complications of the flu could lead to pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, worsening of certain medical conditions and even death. \"I talk about it like a carseat,\" says Tiffany Kimbrough M.D., medical director of the mother-infant unit at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University. \"Chances are, you won't get into an accident and everyone ends up fine, but buckling up your little one, like a flu shot, is an extra layer of protection.\" Children can receive the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available, which can be as early as July or August, according to the CDC. Children six months through 8 years old getting a flu vaccine for the first time, as well as those who have previously received only one dose, should get two doses of the vaccine. In these cases, they should receive the first dose as soon as possible, since the second dose must follow four weeks after. If you are pregnant in your third trimester, you can also consider early vaccination, as it can help protect your infant in the first few months when they are too young to be vaccinated, according to the CDC. There are caveats to consider, though. \"Getting the influenza vaccine too early may mean that it will wear off by the peak or end of the season and may leave you vulnerable,\" says Chelsea Johnson M.D., who is based in Tucson, Arizona and is the associate lead of pediatrics at K Health, a healthcare startup. \"Know when influenza is in your area to ensure that you get the vaccine in time to protect you, but not too soon, then it doesn't last the entire season.\" September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated, according to the CDC, and ideally, you and your child should be vaccinated by the end of October. Additionally, the CDC notes that the flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine can be given at the same time. Types of Flu Shots There are two ways to receive the flu vaccine, and both are highly effective. By needle The flu vaccine administered by needle, typically injected into your arm, is a solution of non-viable virus particles that help the immune system recognize and kill the flu virus quickly, allowing for mild symptoms if any at all. \"Non-viable virus particles\" means you cannot get the flu from the shot and are not contagious to other people, says Dr. Johnson. There are different flu vaccines administered by needle that are approved for different age groups. By nasal spray The [nasal spray](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/allergies/nasal-sprays-for-allergies/) flu vaccine protects against four different strains of flu virus and is intended for children and adults ages two through 49. The nasal spray is a live-attenuated virus, or a weakened live virus that cannot cause infection in someone with a normal immune system, says Dr. Johnson. In people with a weak immune system, the live-attenuated virus in the spray could actually cause a flu infection, so be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about whether this route is the best way to go for you and your child's needs. \"The nasal spray vaccine is a great option for those who may be needle-phobic or for parents who don't want to give their little one another [needle] jab,\" says Dr. Kimbrough. How Old Does My Child Need to Be to Get a Flu Shot? Children need to be six months or older to receive the flu shot administered with a needle. Rare exceptions for the flu shot include people with severe, life-threatening allergies to ingredients in the vaccine, as well as those who have had a severe allergic reaction to a flu shot in the past. Meanwhile, the nasal spray flu vaccine is meant for children older than two years old. The list of exceptions for this form of the vaccine is a little longer, and includes children and adolescents ages two through 17 who are receiving medications that contain aspirin or salicylate, and children ages two through four who have [asthma](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/asthma/) or who have had a history of wheezing in the past 12 months. The CDC provides [the full list of exceptions here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/whoshouldvax.htm). Be sure to talk to your child's doctor about this form of the vaccine when making a decision. Benefits of the Flu Shot Overall, flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with the flu and can reduce the severity of its symptoms if you do get sick. \"This means less missed school for kids, less missed work for parents and fewer doctor's visits for both,\" says Dr. Johnson. Vaccination also protects people around you, especially those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, including babies and young children. In children, flu vaccination can be lifesaving. A 2017 CDC study showed that the flu shot significantly reduces a child's risk of dying from the flu\u2014a reduced risk of 51% among children with high-risk, underlying medical conditions and a reduced risk of 65% among healthy children [[2]](#footnote_2). Other research shows that during the flu seasons from 2004 to 2020, flu-related deaths in children ranged from 37 to 199 deaths\u2014and about 80% of those children were not fully vaccinated [[3]](#footnote_3). Getting the flu shot also reduces the risk of hospitalization from the flu. A 2014 study showed that the vaccine was 74% effective in preventing a child from being sent to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) [[4]](#footnote_4). Side Effects of the Flu Shot Common side effects of the flu shot include pain, redness and swelling at the injection site, as well as mild flu-like symptoms such as low-grade fever, muscle aches, headache and fatigue. These effects usually go away in 24 to 36 hours, says Dr. Johnson. The nasal spray vaccine has different side effects of runny or stuffy nose and cough. It's important to remember that experiencing symptoms doesn't mean the vaccine made you sick. \"That's just your immune system getting activated to fight the real virus,\" says Dr. Kimbrough. As with any vaccine, contact a healthcare provider if you develop a high fever, behavior changes or severe allergic reactions, such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, dizziness and a fast heartbeat. Life-threatening reactions to the flu shot are rare and would appear within a few minutes or hours after receiving the vaccine, according to the CDC. Is the Flu Shot Safe? Thanks to decades of studies, there is plenty of safety data to back up the flu shot. The CDC, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several other healthcare organizations continually monitor the safety of flu vaccines by tracking vaccine-related side effects and other data. Tell your healthcare provider beforehand if your child is allergic to eggs (as some vaccines may have small amounts of egg protein) or has had allergic reactions to the flu shot before. A licensed flu vaccine may still be appropriate for your child, but there are likely egg-free flu vaccine options available. You should also notify your healthcare provider if your child has a weakened immune system or Guillain-Barre Syndrome (a neurological disorder that causes severe muscle weakness). Additionally, if your child is receiving the nasal spray vaccine, tell their doctor if they are receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing therapy. "}
