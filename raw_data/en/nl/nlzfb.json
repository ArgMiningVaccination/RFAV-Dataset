Raising awareness among healthcare providers and patients is critical to eliminating preventable infections caused by unsafe injections. Injection and Needle Safety Toolkit Although injections and needle use in professional settings are generally safe, unsafe practices do happen and may cause serious harm. Unsafe practices, like reusing vials or syringes, have the potential to spread disease by cross-contaminating body fluids.
