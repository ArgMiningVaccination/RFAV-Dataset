The lipid nanoparticles of the present invention comprise a cationic lipid according to formula (I), (II) or (III) and/or a PEG lipid according to formula (IV), as well as an mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence encoding an antigenic peptide or protein. The invention further relates to the use of said lipid nanoparticles as vaccines or medicaments, in particular with respect to influenza or rabies vaccination. The present invention relates to mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles useful as mRNA-based vaccines. Additionally, the present invention relates to a composition comprising the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles and the use of the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles or the composition for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition, especially a vaccine, e.g. for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases, tumour or cancer diseases, allergies or autoimmune diseases. The present invention further describes a method of treatment or prophylaxis of the afore-mentioned diseases. Gene therapy and genetic vaccination belong to the most promising and quickly developing methods of modern medicine. They may provide highly specific and individual options for therapy of a large variety of diseases. Genetic vaccination allows evoking a desired immune response to selected antigens, such as characteristic components of bacterial surfaces, viral particles, tumour antigens or the like. Generally, vaccination is one of the pivotal achievements of modern medicine. However, effective vaccines are currently available only for a limited number of diseases. Accordingly, infections that are not preventable by vaccination still affect millions of people every year. Commonly, vaccines may be subdivided into \"first\", \"second\" and \"third\" generation vaccines. \"First generation\" vaccines are, typically, whole-organism vaccines. They are based on either live and attenuated or killed pathogens, e.g. viruses, bacteria or the like. The major drawback of live and attenuated vaccines is the risk for a reversion to life-threatening variants. Thus, although attenuated, such pathogens may still intrinsically bear unpredictable risks. Killed pathogens may not be as effective as desired for generating a specific immune response. In order to minimize these risks, \"second generation\" vaccines were developed. These are, typically, subunit vaccines, consisting of defined antigens or recombinant protein components which are derived from pathogens. Genetic vaccines, i.e. vaccines for genetic vaccination, are usually understood as \"third generation\" vaccines. They are typically composed of genetically engineered nucleic acid molecules which allow expression of peptide or protein (antigen) fragments characteristic for a pathogen or a tumor antigen in vivo. Genetic vaccines are expressed upon administration to a patient after uptake by target cells. Expression of the administered nucleic acids results in production of the encoded proteins. In the event these proteins are recognized as foreign by the patient's immune system, an immune response is triggered. DNA as well as RNA may be used as nucleic acid molecules for administration in the context of genetic vaccination. DNA is known to be relatively stable and easy to handle. However, the use of DNA bears the risk of undesired insertion of the administered DNA-fragments into the patient's genome potentially resulting mutagenic events such as in loss of function of the impaired genes. As a further risk, the undesired generation of anti-DNA antibodies has emerged. Another drawback is the limited expression level of the encoded peptide or protein that is achievable upon DNA administration because the DNA must enter the nucleus in order to be transcribed before the resulting mRNA can be translated. Among other reasons, the expression level of the administered DNA will be dependent on the presence of specific transcription factors which regulate DNA transcription. In the absence of such factors, DNA transcription will not yield satisfying amounts of RNA. As a result, the level of translated peptide or protein obtained is limited. By using RNA instead of DNA for genetic vaccination, the risk of undesired genomic integration and generation of anti-DNA antibodies is minimized or avoided. However, RNA is considered to be a rather unstable molecular species which may readily be degraded by ubiquitous RNAses. mRNA vaccines comprising antigen-encoding mRNA complexed to protamine are already described in the prior art (e.g. Petsch et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2012 December; 30(12):1210-6., Schnee compositions comprising nucleoside-modified RNA encoding different antigens. Even if a lot of progress was made in the last years there is still a need in the art for providing an efficient method for mRNA vaccination, which allows eliciting an adaptive immune response, wherein the administration is not severely impaired by early degradation of the antigen or by an inefficient translation of the mRNA due to inefficient release of the mRNA in the cell. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to decrease the dose of mRNA vaccines to decrease potential safety concerns and to make the vaccines affordable for the third world. There are many challenges associated with the delivery of nucleic acids to effect a desired response in a biological system. Nucleic acid based therapeutics, such as vaccines, have enormous potential but there remains a need for more effective delivery of nucleic acids to appropriate sites within a cell or organism in order to realize this potential. However, two problems currently face the use of oligonucleotides in therapeutic contexts. First, free RNAs are susceptible to nuclease digestion in plasma. Second, free RNAs have limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where the relevant translation machinery resides. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as neutral lipids, cholesterol, PEG, PEGylated lipids, and oligonucleotides have been used to block degradation of the RNAs in plasma and facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides. There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide optimal drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic or local delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with unacceptable toxicity and/or risk to the patient. The present invention provides these and related advantages.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles or pharmaceutical compositions comprising said nanoparticles as well as the uses thereof. mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles according to the invention comprise: (i) a cationic lipid with the formula (I): or a pharmaceutically acceptable c, d and e are as defined herein; and or a cationic lipid with the formula (II): or a pharmaceutically acceptable c and d are as defined herein; and/or preferably a cationic lipid with the formula III: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, tautomer, prodrug G2, and G3 are as defined herein. and/or a PEG lipid with the formula (IV) wherein R8 and R9 are each independently a straight or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain containing from 10 to 30 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl chain is optionally interrupted by one or more ester bonds; and w has a mean value ranging from 30 to 60; and optionally a neutral lipid and/or a steroid or sterioid analogue, wherein the mRNA compound is encapsulated in or associated with said lipid nanoparticle.

Any technical features disclosed thereby can be part of each and every embodiment of the invention. Additional definitions and explanations can be provided in the context of this disclosure. Unless defined otherwise, or unless the specific context requires otherwise, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by a person skilled in the relevant technical field. Unless the context indicates or requires otherwise, the words \"comprise\", \"comprises\" and \"comprising\" and similar expressions are to be construed in an open and inclusive sense, as \"including, but not limited to\" in this description and in the claims. The expressions, \"one embodiment\", \"an embodiment\", \"a specific embodiment\" and the like mean that a particular feature, property or characteristic, or a particular group or combination of features, properties or characteristics, as referred to in combination with the respective expression, is present in at least one of the embodiments of the invention. The occurrence of these expressions in various places throughout this description do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment. Moreover, the particular features, properties or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. The singular forms \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" should be understood as to include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Percentages in the context of numbers should be understood as relative to the total number of the respective items. In other cases, and unless the context dictates otherwise, percentages should be understood as percentages by weight (wt.-%). In the context of the invention, a \"composition\" refers to any type of composition in which the specified ingredients may be incorporated, optionally along with any further constituents, usually with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Thus, the composition may be a dry composition such as a powder or granules, or a solid unit such as a lyophilised form or a tablet. Alternatively, the composition may be in liquid form, and each constituent may be independently incorporated in dissolved or dispersed (e.g. suspended or emulsified) form. In one of the preferred embodiments, the composition is formulated as a sterile solid composition, such as a powder or lyophilised form for reconstitution with an aqueous liquid carrier. Such formulation is also preferred for those versions of the composition which comprise a nucleic acid cargo as described in further detail below. As used herein, a \"compound\" means a chemical substance, which is a material consisting of molecules having essentially the same chemical structure and properties. For a small molecular compound, the molecules are typically identical with respect to their atomic composition and structural configuration. For a macromolecular or polymeric compound, the molecules of a compound are highly similar but not all of them are necessarily identical. For example, a segment of a polymer that is designated to consist of 50 monomeric units may also contain individual molecules with e.g. 48 or 53 monomeric units. A lipidoid compound, also simply referred to as lipidoid, is a lipid-like compound, i.e. an amphiphilic compound with lipid-like physical properties. In the context of the present invention the term lipid is considered to encompass lipidoids. Unless a different meaning is clear from the specific context, the term \"cationic\" means that the respective structure bears a positive charge, either permanently, or not permanently but in response to certain conditions such as pH. Thus, the term \"cationic\" covers both \"permanently cationic\" and \"cationisable\". As used herein, \"permanently cationic\" means that the respective compound, or group or atom, is positively charged at any pH value or hydrogen ion activity of its environment. Typically, the positive charge is results from the presence of a quaternary nitrogen atom. Where a compound carries a plurality of such positive charges, it may be referred to as permanently polycationic, which is a subcategory of permanently cationic. Cationic component/compound: The term \"cationic component/compound\" typically refers to a charged molecule, which is positively charged (cation) at a pH value of typically about 1 to 9. In some embodiments, the cationic component/compound is preferably charged at a pH value of or below 9 (e.g. 5 to 9), of or below 8 (e.g. 5 to 8), of or below 7 (e.g. 5 to 7), most preferably at physiological pH values, e.g. about 7.3 to 7.4. Accordingly, a cationic peptide, protein, polysaccharide, lipid or polymer according to one embodiment of the present invention is positively charged under physiological conditions, particularly under physiological salt conditions of the cell in vivo. In another preferred embodiment, the lipid nanoparticle, the cationic peptide, protein, polysaccharide, lipid or polymer according to the present invention is uncharged, has a neutral charge or is respectively electrically neutral under physiological conditions, particularly under physiological salt conditions of the cell in vivo. A cationic peptide or protein preferably contains a larger number of cationic amino acids, e.g. a larger number of Arg, His, Lys or Orn than other amino acid residues (in particular more cationic amino acids than anionic amino acid residues like Asp or Glu) or contains blocks predominantly formed by cationic amino acid residues. The expression \"cationic\" may also refer to \"polycationic\" components/compounds. The cationic component/compound may also refer to a cationic lipid capable of being positively charged. Exemplary cationic lipids include one or more amine group(s) which bear the positive charge. Preferred cationic lipids are ionizable such that they can exist in a positively charged or neutral form depending on pH. The ionization of the cationic lipid affects the surface charge of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) under different pH conditions. This charge state can influence plasma protein absorption, blood clearance and tissue distribution (Semple, S. C., et al., Adv. Drug Deliv Rev 32:3-17 (1998)) as well as the ability to form non-bilayer structures (Hafez, I. M., et al., Gene Ther 8:1188-1196 (2001)) critical to the intracellular delivery of nucleic acids. As described elsewhere, the pKa of formulated cationic lipids is correlated with the effectiveness of LNPs for delivery of nucleic acids (see Jayaraman et al, Angewandte Chemie, International Edition (2012), 51(34), 8529-8533; Semple et al, Nature Biotechnology 28, 172-176 (2010)). In some embodiments of the present invention, the preferred range of pKa is about 5 to about 7. In this context, the prefix \"poly-\" refers to a plurality of atoms or groups having the respective property in a compound. If put in parenthesis, the presence of a plurality is optional. For example, (poly)cationic means cationic and/or polycationic. However, the absence of the prefix should not be interpreted such as to exclude a plurality. For example, a polycationic compound is also a cationic compound and may be referred to as such. \"Cationisable\" means that a compound, or group or atom, is positively charged at a lower pH and uncharged at a higher pH of its environment. Also in non-aqueous environments where no pH value can be determined, a cationisable compound, group or atom is positively charged at a high hydrogen ion concentration and uncharged at a low concentration or activity of hydrogen ions. It depends on the individual properties of the cationisable or polycationisable compound, in particular the pKa of the respective cationisable group or atom, at which pH or hydrogen ion concentration it is charged or uncharged. In diluted aqueous environments, the fraction of cationisable compounds, groups or atoms bearing a positive charge may be estimated using the so-called Henderson-Hasselbalch equation which is well-known to a person skilled in the art. For example, in some embodiments, if a compound or moiety is cationisable, it is preferred that it is positively charged at a pH value of about 1 to 9, preferably 4 to 9, 5 to 8 or even 6 to 8, more preferably of a pH value of or below 9, of or below 8, of or below 7, most preferably at physiological pH values, e.g. about 7.3 to 7.4, i.e. under physiological conditions, particularly under physiological salt conditions of the cell in vivo. In other embodiments, it is preferred that the cationisable compound or moiety is predominantly neutral at physiological pH values, e.g. about 7.0-7.4, but becomes positively charged at lower pH values. In some embodiments, the preferred range of pKa for the cationisable compound or moiety is about 5 to about 7. Nucleic acid: The term nucleic acid means any DNA- or RNA-molecule. The term may be used for a polynucleotide and/or oligonucleotide. Wherever herein reference is made to a nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence encoding a particular protein and/or peptide, said nucleic acid or nucleic acid sequence, respectively, preferably also comprises regulatory sequences allowing in a suitable host, e.g. a human being, its expression, i.e. transcription and/or translation of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the particular protein or peptide. Nucleoside modification: in the context of the present invention the term nucleoside modification refers to mRNA molecules or compounds comprising nucleosides, which are not usually part of mRNA, preferably non-natural nucleosides. In particular, the term preferably mRNA nucleosides other than adenine, guanine, thymine. Peptide: A peptide is an oligomer or polymer of at least two amino acid monomers. Usually the monomers are linked by peptide bonds. The term \"peptide\" does not limit the length of the polymer chain of amino acids. In some embodiments of the present invention a peptide may for example contain less than 50 monomer units. Longer peptides are also called polypeptides, typically having 50 to 600 monomeric units, more specifically 50 to 300 monomeric units. Protein: A protein typically consists of one or more peptides and/or polypeptides folded into a 3-dimensional form, facilitating a biological function. Influenza pandemic or pandemic flu: An influenza pandemic can occur when a non-human (novel) influenza virus gains the ability for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission and then spreads globally. Influenza viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic are referred to as \"influenza viruses with pandemic potential\" or \"pandemic influenza virus\". Examples of influenza viruses with pandemic potential include avian influenza A (H5N1) and avian influenza A (H7N9), which are two different \"bird flu\" viruses. These are non-human viruses (i.e., they are novel among humans and circulate in birds in parts of the world) so there is little to no immunity against these viruses among people. Human infections with these viruses have occurred rarely, but if either of these viruses was to change in such a way that it was able to infect humans easily and spread easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic could result. Vaccine for pandemic influenza/flu or pandemic influenza/flu vaccine: A vaccine directed against a pandemic influenza virus is called herein as a vaccine for pandemic influenza/flu or pandemic influenza/flu vaccine. Flu/influenza season: Flu season is an annually recurring time period characterized by the prevalence of outbreaks of influenza (flu). The season occurs during the cold half of the year in each hemisphere. Influenza activity can sometimes be predicted and even tracked geographically. While the beginning of major flu activity in each season varies by location, in any specific location these minor epidemics usually take about 3 weeks to peak and another 3 weeks to significantly diminish. Flu vaccinations have been used to diminish the effects of the flu season; pneumonia vaccinations additionally diminishes the effects and complications of flu season. Since the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two flu seasons each year. Vaccine for seasonal influenza/flu or seasonal influenza/flu vaccine: A vaccine directed against the seasonal occurring influenza viruses in a flu season is termed herein \"vaccine for seasonal influenza/flu or seasonal influenza/flu vaccine\". Immune system: The immune system may protect organisms from infection. If a pathogen breaks through a physical barrier of an organism and enters this organism, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. If pathogens evade this innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. According to this, the immune system comprises the innate and the adaptive immune system. Each of these two parts contains so called humoral and cellular components. Immune response: An immune response may typically either be a specific reaction of the adaptive immune system to a particular antigen (so called specific or adaptive immune response) or an unspecific reaction of the innate immune system (so called unspecific or innate immune response). The invention relates to the core to specific reactions (adaptive immune responses) of the adaptive immune system. Particularly, it relates to adaptive immune responses to infections by viruses like e.g. Influenza viruses. However, this specific response can be supported by an additional unspecific reaction (innate immune response). Therefore, the invention also relates to a compound for simultaneous stimulation of the innate and the adaptive immune system to evoke an efficient adaptive immune response. Adaptive immune system: The adaptive immune system is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogenic growth. The adaptive immune response provides the vertebrate immune system with the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens (to generate immunity), and to mount stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. The system is highly adaptable because of somatic hypermutation (a process of increased frequency of somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows a small number of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual lymphocyte. Because the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the DNA of each cell, all of the progeny (offspring) of that cell will then inherit genes encoding the same receptor specificity, including the Memory B cells and Memory T cells that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity. Immune network theory is a theory of how the adaptive immune system works, that is based on interactions between the variable regions of the receptors of T cells, B cells and of molecules made by T cells and B cells that have variable regions. Adaptive immune response: The adaptive immune response is typically understood to be antigen-specific. Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific antigens, pathogens or pathogen-infected cells. The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by \"memory cells\". Should a pathogen infect the body more than once, these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it. In this context, the first step of an adaptive immune response is the activation of na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells or different immune cells able to induce an antigen-specific immune response by antigen-presenting cells. This occurs in the lymphoid tissues and organs through which na\u00efve T cells are constantly passing. Cell types that can serve as antigen-presenting cells are inter alia dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Each of these cells has a distinct function in eliciting immune responses. Dendritic cells take up antigens by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis and are stimulated by contact with e.g. a foreign antigen to migrate to the local lymphoid tissue, where they differentiate into mature dendritic cells. Macrophages ingest particulate antigens such as bacteria and are induced by infectious agents or other appropriate stimuli to express MHC molecules. The unique ability of B cells to bind and internalize soluble protein antigens via their receptors may also be important to induce T cells. Presenting the antigen on MHC molecules leads to activation of T cells which induces their proliferation and differentiation into armed effector T cells. The most important function of effector T cells is the killing of infected cells by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and the activation of macrophages by Th1 cells which together make up cell-mediated immunity, and the activation of B cells by both Th2 and Th1 cells to produce different classes of antibody, thus driving the humoral immune response. T cells recognize an antigen by their T cell receptors which do not recognize and bind antigen directly, but instead recognize short peptide fragments e.g. of pathogen-derived protein antigens, which are bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells. Cellular immunity/cellular immune response: Cellular immunity relates typically to the activation of macrophages, natural killer cells (NK), antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen. In a more general way, cellular immunity is not related to antibodies but to the activation of cells of the immune system. A cellular immune response is characterized e.g. by activating antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that are able to induce apoptosis in body cells displaying epitopes of an antigen on their surface, such as virus-infected cells, cells with intracellular bacteria, and cancer cells displaying tumor antigens; activating macrophages and natural killer cells, enabling them to destroy pathogens; and stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses. Humoral immunity/humoral immune response: Humoral immunity refers typically to antibody production and the accessory processes that may accompany it. A humoral immune response may be typically characterized, e.g., by Th2 activation and cytokine production, germinal center formation and isotype switching, affinity maturation and memory cell generation. Humoral immunity also typically may refer to the effector functions of antibodies, which include pathogen and toxin neutralization, classical complement activation, and opsonin promotion of phagocytosis and pathogen elimination. Innate immune system: The innate immune system, also known as non-specific immune system, comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner. This means that the cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a generic way, but unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host. The innate immune system may be e.g. activated by ligands of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) receptors, e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or other auxiliary ligand of a RIG-I like receptor, an immunostimulatory nucleic immunostimulatory RNA a CpG-DNA, an antibacterial agent, or an anti-viral agent. Typically a response of the innate immune system includes recruiting immune cells to sites of infection, through the production of chemical factors, including specialized chemical mediators, called cytokines; activation of the complement cascade; identification and removal of foreign substances present in organs, tissues, the blood and lymph, by specialized white blood cells; activation of the adaptive immune system through a process known as antigen presentation; and/or acting as a physical and chemical barrier to infectious agents. Adjuvant/adjuvant component: An adjuvant or an adjuvant component in the broadest sense is typically a (e.g. pharmacological or immunological) agent or composition that may modify, e.g. enhance, the efficacy of other agents, such as a drug or vaccine. Conventionally the term refers in the context of the invention to a compound or composition that serves as a carrier or auxiliary substance for immunogens and/or other pharmaceutically active compounds. It is to be interpreted in a broad sense and refers to a broad spectrum of substances that are able to increase the immunogenicity of antigens incorporated into or co-administered with an adjuvant in question. In the context of the present invention an adjuvant will preferably enhance the specific immunogenic effect of the active agents of the present invention. Typically, \"adjuvant\" or \"adjuvant component\" has the same meaning and can be used mutually. Adjuvants may be divided, e.g., into immuno potentiators, antigenic delivery systems or even combinations thereof. The term \"adjuvant\" is typically understood not to comprise agents which confer immunity by themselves. An adjuvant assists the immune system unspecifically to enhance the antigen-specific immune response by e.g. promoting presentation of an antigen to the immune system or induction of an unspecific innate immune response. Furthermore, an adjuvant may preferably e.g. modulate the antigen-specific immune response by e.g. shifting the dominating Th2-based antigen specific response to a more Th1-based antigen specific response or vice versa. Accordingly, an adjuvant may favourably modulate cytokine expression/secretion, antigen presentation, type of immune response etc. Immunostimulatory RNA: An immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA) in the context of the invention may typically be an RNA that is able to induce an innate immune response itself. It usually does not have an open reading frame and thus does not provide a peptide-antigen or immunogen but elicits an innate immune response e.g. by binding to a specific kind of Toll-like-receptor (TLR) or other suitable receptors. However, of course also mRNAs having an open reading frame and coding for a peptide/protein (e.g. an antigenic function) may induce an innate immune response. Antigen: In the context of the present invention \"antigen\" refers typically to a substance which may be recognized by the immune system, preferably by the adaptive immune system, and is capable of triggering an antigen-specific immune response, e.g. by formation of antibodies and/or antigen-specific T cells as part of an adaptive immune response. Typically, an antigen may be or may comprise a peptide or protein which may be presented by the MHC to T-cells. In the sense of the present invention an antigen may be the product of translation of a provided nucleic acid molecule, preferably an mRNA as defined herein. In this context, also fragments, variants and derivatives of peptides and proteins comprising at least one epitope are understood as antigen. Epitope (also called \"antigen determinant\"): T cell epitopes or parts of the proteins in the context of the present invention may comprise fragments preferably having a length of about 6 to about 20 or even more amino acids, e.g. fragments as processed and presented by MHC class I molecules, preferably having a length of about 8 to about 10 amino acids, e.g. 8, 9, or 10, (or even 11, or 12 amino acids), or fragments as processed and presented by MHC class II molecules, preferably having a length of about 13 or more amino acids, e.g. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or even more amino acids, wherein these fragments may be selected from any part of the amino acid sequence. These fragments are typically recognized by T cells in form of a complex consisting of the peptide fragment and an MHC molecule. B cell epitopes are typically fragments located on the outer surface of (native) protein or peptide antigens as defined herein, preferably having 5 to 15 amino acids, more preferably having 5 to 12 amino acids, even more preferably having 6 to 9 amino acids, which may be recognized by antibodies, i.e. in their native form. Such epitopes of proteins or peptides may furthermore be selected from any of the herein mentioned variants of such proteins or peptides. In this context antigenic determinants can be conformational or discontinuous epitopes which are composed of segments of the proteins or peptides as defined herein that are discontinuous in the amino acid sequence of the proteins or peptides as defined herein but are brought together in the three-dimensional structure or continuous or linear epitopes which are composed of a single polypeptide chain. Vaccine: A vaccine is typically understood to be a prophylactic or therapeutic material providing at least one antigen or antigenic function. The antigen or antigenic function may stimulate the body's adaptive immune system to provide an adaptive immune response. Antigen-providing mRNA: An antigen-providing mRNA in the context of the invention may typically be an mRNA, having at least one open reading frame that can be translated by a cell or an organism provided with that mRNA. The product of this translation is a peptide or protein that may act as an antigen, preferably as an immunogen. The product may also be a fusion protein composed of more than one immunogen, e.g. a fusion protein that consist of two or more epitopes, peptides or proteins derived from the same or different virus-proteins, wherein the epitopes, peptides or proteins may be linked by linker sequences. Artificial mRNA (sequence): An artificial mRNA (sequence) may typically be understood to be an mRNA molecule, that does not occur naturally. In other words, an artificial mRNA molecule may be understood as a non-natural mRNA molecule. Such mRNA molecule may be non-natural due to its individual sequence (which does not occur naturally) and/or due to other modifications, e.g. structural modifications of nucleotides which do not occur naturally. Typically, artificial mRNA molecules may be designed and/or generated by genetic engineering methods to correspond to a desired artificial sequence of nucleotides (heterologous sequence). In this context an artificial sequence is usually a sequence that may not occur naturally, i.e. it differs from the wild type sequence by at least one nucleotide. The term \"wild type\" may be understood as a sequence occurring in nature. Further, the term \"artificial nucleic acid molecule\" is not restricted to mean \"one single molecule\" but is, typically, understood to comprise an ensemble of identical molecules. Accordingly, it may relate to a plurality of identical molecules contained in an aliquot. Bi-/multicistronic mRNA: mRNA, that typically may have two (bicistronic) or more (multicistronic) open reading frames (ORF) (coding regions or coding sequences). An open reading frame in this context is a sequence of several nucleotide triplets (codons) that can be translated into a peptide or protein. Translation of such an mRNA yields two (bicistronic) or more (multicistronic) distinct translation products (provided the ORFs are not identical). For expression in eukaryotes such mRNAs may for example comprise an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence. Monocistronic mRNA: A monocistronic mRNA may typically be an mRNA, that comprises only one open reading frame (coding sequence or coding region). An open reading frame in this context is a sequence of several nucleotide triplets (codons) that can be translated into a peptide or protein. 5-CAP structure: A 5-CAP is typically a modified nucleotide (CAP analogue), particularly a guanine nucleotide, added to the 5-end of an mRNA molecule. Preferably, the 5-CAP is added using a 5-5-triphosphate linkage (also named m7GpppN). Further examples of moiety. These modified 5-CAP structures may be used in the context of the present invention to modify the mRNA sequence of the inventive composition. Further modified 5-CAP structures which may be used in the context of the present invention are CAP1 (additional methylation of the ribose of the adjacent nucleotide of m7GpppN), CAP2 (additional methylation of the ribose of 2nd nucleotide downstream of the m7GpppN), cap3 (additional methylation of the ribose of the 3rd nucleotide downstream of the m7GpppN), cap4 (additional methylation of the ribose of the 4th nucleotide downstream of the m7GpppN), ARCA context of the present invention, a 5-CAP structure may also be formed in chemical RNA synthesis or RNA in vitro transcription (co-transcriptional capping) using cCAP analogues, or a CAP structure may be formed in vitro using capping enzymes (e.g., commercially available capping kits). CAP analogue: A CAP analogue refers to a non-polymerizable di-nucleotide that has CAP functionality in that it facilitates translation or localization, and/or prevents degradation of the RNA molecule when incorporated at the 5-end of the RNA molecule. Non-polymerizable means that the CAP analogue will be incorporated only at the 5-terminus because it does not have a 5 triphosphate and therefore cannot be extended in the 3-direction by a template-dependent RNA polymerase. CAP analogues include, but are not limited to, a chemical structure selected from the group consisting of m7GpppG, m7GpppA, m7GpppC; unmethylated (e.g., m2,2,7GpppG), dimethylated symmetrical CAP analogues m7,3dGpppG al., 2001. RNA 7(10):1486-95). Further CAP analogues have been described previously (U.S. Pat. No. 7,074,596, WO2008/016473, WO2008/157688, WO2009/149253, WO2011/015347, dinucleotide CAP analogues has been described recently (Kore et al. (2013) Bioorg. Med. Chem. 21(15): 4570-4). Poly (C) sequence: A poly-(C)-sequence is typically a long sequence of cytosine nucleotides, typically about 10 to about 200 cytosine nucleotides, preferably about 10 to about 100 cytosine nucleotides, more preferably about 10 to about 70 cytosine nucleotides or even more preferably about 20 to about 50 or even about 20 to about 30 cytosine nucleotides. A poly(C) sequence may preferably be located 3 of the coding region comprised by a nucleic acid. Poly-A-tail/sequence: A poly-A-tail also called \"3-poly(A) tail or poly(A) sequence\" is typically a long sequence of adenosine nucleotides of up to about 400 adenosine nucleotides, e.g. from about 25 to about 400, preferably from about 50 to about 400, more preferably from about 50 to about 300, even more preferably from about 50 to about 250, most preferably from about 60 to about 250 adenosine nucleotides, added to the 3-end of a RNA. Moreover, poly(A) sequences, or poly(A) tails may be generated in vitro by enzymatic polyadenylation of the RNA, e.g. using Poly(A)polymerases derived from E. coli or yeast. Polyadenylation: Polyadenylation is typically understood to be the addition of a poly(A) sequence to a nucleic acid molecule, such as an RNA molecule, e.g. to a premature mRNA. Polyadenylation may be induced by a so called polyadenylation signal. This signal is preferably located within a stretch of nucleotides at the 3-end of a nucleic acid molecule, such as an RNA molecule, to be polyadenylated. A polyadenylation signal typically comprises a hexamer consisting of adenine and uracil/thymine nucleotides, preferably hexamer sequences, are also conceivable. Polyadenylation typically occurs during processing of a pre-mRNA (also called premature-mRNA). Typically, RNA maturation (from pre-mRNA to mature mRNA) comprises the step of polyadenylation. 3-untranslated region (3-UTR): A 3-UTR is typically the part of an mRNA which is located between the protein coding region (i.e. the open reading frame) and the poly(A) sequence of the mRNA. A 3-UTR of the mRNA is not translated into an amino acid sequence. The 3-UTR sequence is generally encoded by the gene which is transcribed into the respective mRNA during the gene expression process. The genomic sequence is first transcribed into pre-mature mRNA, which comprises optional introns. The pre-mature mRNA is then further processed into mature mRNA in a maturation process. This maturation process comprises the steps of 5-Capping, splicing the pre-mature mRNA to excise optional introns and modifications of the 3-end, such as polyadenylation of the 3-end of the pre-mature mRNA and optional endo- or exonuclease cleavages etc. In the context of the present invention, a 3-UTR corresponds to the sequence of a mature mRNA which is located 3 to the stop codon of the protein coding region, preferably immediately 3 to the stop codon of the protein coding region, and which extends to the 5-side of the poly(A) sequence, preferably to the nucleotide immediately 5 to the poly(A) sequence. The term \"corresponds to\" means that the 3-UTR sequence may be an RNA sequence, such as in the mRNA sequence used for defining the 3-UTR sequence, or a DNA sequence which corresponds to such RNA sequence. In the context of the present invention, the term \"a 3-UTR of a gene\", such as \"a 3-UTR of an albumin gene\", is the sequence which corresponds to the 3-UTR of the mature mRNA derived from this gene, i.e. the mRNA obtained by transcription of the gene and maturation of the pre-mature mRNA. The term \"3-UTR of a gene\" encompasses the DNA sequence and the RNA sequence of the 3-UTR. 5-untranslated region (5-UTR): A 5-UTR is typically understood to be a particular section of messenger RNA (mRNA). It is located 5 of the open reading frame of the mRNA. Typically, the 5-UTR starts with the transcriptional start site and ends one nucleotide before the start codon of the open reading frame. The 5-UTR may comprise elements for controlling gene expression, also called regulatory elements. Such regulatory elements may be, for example, ribosomal binding sites or a 5-Terminal Oligopyrimidine Tract. The 5-UTR may be posttranscriptionally modified, for example by addition of a 5-CAP. In the context of the present invention, a 5-UTR corresponds to the sequence of a mature mRNA which is located between the 5-CAP and the start codon. Preferably, the 5-UTR corresponds to the sequence which extends from a nucleotide located 3 to the 5-CAP, preferably from the nucleotide located immediately 3 to the 5-CAP, to a nucleotide located 5 to the start codon of the protein coding region, preferably to the nucleotide located immediately 5 to the start codon of the protein coding region. The nucleotide located immediately 3 to the 5-CAP of a mature mRNA typically corresponds to the transcriptional start site. The term \"corresponds to\" means that the 5-UTR sequence may be an RNA sequence, such as in the mRNA sequence used for defining the 5-UTR sequence, or a DNA sequence which corresponds to such RNA sequence. In the context of the present invention, the term \"a 5-UTR of a gene\", such as \"a 5-UTR of a TOP gene\", is the sequence which corresponds to the 5-UTR of the mature mRNA derived from this gene, i.e. the mRNA obtained by transcription of the gene and maturation of the pre-mature mRNA. The term \"5-UTR of a gene\" encompasses the DNA sequence and the RNA sequence of the 5-UTR. 5-Terminal Oligopyrimidine Tract (TOP): The 5-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) is typically a stretch of pyrimidine nucleotides located at the 5-terminal region of a nucleic acid molecule, such as the 5-terminal region of certain mRNA molecules or the 5-terminal region of a functional entity, e.g. the transcribed region, of certain genes. The sequence starts with a cytidine, which usually corresponds to the transcriptional start site, and is followed by a stretch of usually about 3 to 30 pyrimidine nucleotides. For example, the TOP may comprise 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 or even more nucleotides. The pyrimidine stretch and thus the 5-TOP ends one nucleotide 5 to the first purine nucleotide located downstream of the TOP. Messenger RNA that contains a 5-terminal oligopyrimidine tract is often referred to as TOP mRNA. Accordingly, genes that provide such messenger RNAs are referred to as TOP genes. TOP sequences have, for example, been found in genes and mRNAs encoding peptide elongation factors and ribosomal proteins. TOP motif: In the context of the present invention, a TOP motif is a nucleic acid sequence which corresponds to a 5-TOP as defined above. Thus, a TOP motif in the context of the present invention is preferably a stretch of pyrimidine nucleotides having a length of 3-30 nucleotides. Preferably, the TOP motif consists of at least 3 pyrimidine nucleotides, preferably at least 4 pyrimidine nucleotides, preferably at least 5 pyrimidine nucleotides, more preferably at least 6 nucleotides, more preferably at least 7 nucleotides, most preferably at least 8 pyrimidine nucleotides, wherein the stretch of pyrimidine nucleotides preferably starts at its 5-end with a cytosine nucleotide. In TOP genes and TOP mRNAs, the TOP motif preferably starts at its 5-end with the transcriptional start site and ends one nucleotide 5 to the first purin residue in said gene or mRNA. A TOP motif in the sense of the present invention is preferably located at the 5-end of a sequence which represents a 5-UTR or at the 5-end of a sequence which codes for a 5-UTR. Thus, preferably, a stretch of 3 or more pyrimidine nucleotides is called \"TOP motif\" in the sense of the present invention if this stretch is located at the 5end of a respective sequence, such as the inventive mRNA, the 5-UTR element of the inventive mRNA, or the nucleic acid sequence which is derived from the 5-UTR of a TOP gene as described herein. In other words, a stretch of 3 or more pyrimidine nucleotides which is not located at the 5-end of a 5-UTR or a 5-UTR element but anywhere within a 5-UTR or a 5-UTR element is preferably not referred to as \"TOP motif\". TOP gene: TOP genes are typically characterised by the presence of a 5-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. Furthermore, most TOP genes are characterized by a growth-associated translational regulation. However, also TOP genes with a tissue specific translational regulation are known. As defined above, the 5-UTR of a TOP gene corresponds to the sequence of a 5-UTR of a mature mRNA derived from a TOP gene, which preferably extends from the nucleotide located 3 to the 5-CAP to the nucleotide located 5 to the start codon. A 5-UTR of a TOP gene typically does not comprise any start codons, preferably no upstream AUGs (uAUGs) or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Therein, upstream AUGs and upstream open reading frames are typically understood to be AUGs and open reading frames that occur 5 of the start codon (AUG) of the open reading frame that should be translated. The 5-UTRs of TOP genes are generally rather short. The lengths of 5-UTRs of TOP genes may vary between 20 nucleotides up to 500 nucleotides, and are typically less than about 200 nucleotides, preferably less than about 150 nucleotides, more preferably less than about 100 nucleotides. Exemplary 5-UTRs of TOP genes in the sense of the present invention are the nucleic acid sequences extending from the nucleotide at position 5 to the nucleotide located immediately 5 to the start codon (e.g. the ATG) in the sequences international patent application WO2013/143700 or homologs or variants thereof, whose disclosure is incorporated herewith by reference. In this context a particularly preferred fragment of a 5-UTR of a TOP gene is a 5-UTR of a TOP gene lacking the 5-TOP motif. The term \"5-UTR of a TOP gene\" preferably refers to the 5-UTR of a naturally occurring TOP gene. Fragment of a nucleic acid sequence, particularly an mRNA: A fragment of a nucleic acid sequence consists of a continuous stretch of nucleotides corresponding to a continuous stretch of nucleotides in the full-length nucleic acid sequence which is the basis for the nucleic acid sequence of the fragment, which represents at least 20%, preferably at least 30%, more preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, even more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, and most preferably at least 90% of the full-length nucleic acid sequence. Such a fragment, in the sense of the present invention, is preferably a functional fragment of the full-length nucleic acid sequence. In this context, a \"fragment of a nucleic acid sequence\" e.g. a fragment of an mRNA sequence is preferably a nucleic acid sequence encoding a fragment of a protein or of a variant thereof as described herein. More preferably, the expression 'fragment of a nucleic acid sequence' refers to a nucleic acid sequence having a sequence identity of at least 70%, more preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably of at least 90% and most preferably of at least 95% or even 97%, with a respective full-length nucleic acid sequence. Variant of a nucleic acid sequence, particularly an mRNA: A variant of a nucleic acid sequence refers to a variant of nucleic acid sequences which forms the basis of a nucleic acid sequence. For example, a variant nucleic acid sequence may exhibit one or more nucleotide deletions, insertions, additions and/or substitutions compared to the nucleic acid sequence from which the variant is derived. Preferably, a variant of a nucleic acid sequence is at least 40%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95% identical to the nucleic acid sequence the variant is derived from. Preferably, the variant is a functional variant. A \"variant\" of a nucleic acid sequence may over a stretch of 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 or 100 nucleotide of such nucleic acid sequence. Stabilized nucleic acid, preferably mRNA: A stabilized nucleic acid, preferably mRNA typically, exhibits a modification increasing resistance to in vivo degradation (e.g. degradation by an exo- or endo-nuclease) and/or ex vivo degradation (e.g. by the manufacturing process prior to vaccine administration, e.g. in the course of the preparation of the vaccine solution to be administered). Stabilization of RNA can, e.g., be achieved by providing a 5-CAP-Structure, a Poly-A-Tail, or any other UTR-modification. It can also be achieved by chemical modification or modification of the G/C-content of the nucleic acid. Various other methods are known in the art and conceivable in the context of the invention. RNA In vitro transcription: The terms \"RNA in vitro transcription\" or \"in vitro transcription\" relate to a process wherein RNA is synthesized in a cell-free system (in vitro). DNA, particularly plasmid DNA, is used as template for the generation of RNA transcripts. RNA may be obtained by DNA-dependent in vitro transcription of an appropriate DNA template, which according to the present invention is preferably a linearized plasmid DNA template. The promoter for controlling in vitro transcription can be any promoter for any DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Particular examples of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are the T7, T3, and SP6 RNA polymerases. A DNA template for in vitro RNA transcription may be obtained by cloning of a nucleic acid, in particular cDNA corresponding to the respective RNA to be in vitro transcribed, and introducing it into an appropriate vector for in vitro transcription, for example into plasmid DNA. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the DNA template is linearized with a suitable restriction enzyme, before it is transcribed in vitro. The cDNA may be obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA or chemical synthesis. Moreover, the DNA template for in vitro RNA synthesis may also be obtained by gene synthesis. Methods for in vitro transcription are known in the art (see, e.g., Geall et al. (2013) Semin. Immunol. (2013) Reagents used in said method typically include: - 1) a linearized DNA template with a promoter sequence that has a high binding affinity for its respective RNA polymerase such as bacteriophage-encoded RNA polymerases; - 2) ribonucleoside triphosphates cytosine, guanine and uracil); - 3) optionally a CAP analogue as defined above (e.g. m7G(5)ppp(5)G (m7G)); - 4) a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase capable of binding to the promoter sequence within the linearized DNA template (e.g. T7, T3 or pyrophosphatase to degrade pyrophosphate, which may inhibit transcription; - 7) MgCl2, which supplies Mg2+ ions as a co-factor for the polymerase; - 8) a buffer to maintain a suitable pH value, which can also contain antioxidants (e.g. DTT), and/or polyamines such as The term \"full-length protein\" as used herein typically refers to a protein that substantially comprises the entire amino acid sequence of the naturally occurring protein. Nevertheless, substitutions of amino acids e.g. due to mutation in the protein are also encompassed in the term full-length protein. Fragments of proteins: \"Fragments\" of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention may, typically, comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined herein, which is, with regard to its amino acid sequence (or its encoded nucleic acid molecule), N-terminally and/or C-terminally truncated compared to the amino acid sequence of the original (native) protein (or its encoded nucleic acid molecule). Such truncation may thus occur either on the amino acid level or correspondingly on the nucleic acid level. A sequence identity with respect to such a fragment as defined herein may therefore preferably refer to the entire protein or peptide as defined herein or to the entire (coding) nucleic acid molecule of such a protein or peptide. In this context a fragment of a protein may typically comprise an amino acid sequence having a sequence identity of at least least 70%, more preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably of at least 90% and most preferably of at least 95% or even 97%, with an amino acid sequence of the respective naturally occurring full-length protein. Fragments of proteins or peptides in the context of the present invention may furthermore comprise a sequence of a protein or peptide as defined herein, which has a length of for example at least 5 amino acids, preferably a length of at least 6 amino acids, preferably at least 7 amino acids, more preferably at least 8 amino acids, even more preferably at least 9 amino acids; even more preferably at least 10 amino acids; even more preferably at least 11 amino acids; even more preferably at least 12 amino acids; even more preferably at least 13 amino acids; even more preferably at least 14 amino acids; even more preferably at least 15 amino acids; even more preferably at least 16 amino acids; even more preferably at least 17 amino acids; even more preferably at least 18 amino acids; even more preferably at least 19 amino acids; even more preferably at least 20 amino acids; even more preferably at least 25 amino acids; even more preferably at least 30 amino acids; even more preferably at least 35 amino acids; even more preferably at least 50 amino acids; or most preferably at least 100 amino acids. For example such fragment may have a length of about 6 to about 20 or even more amino acids, e.g. fragments as processed and presented by MHC class I molecules, preferably having a length of about 8 to about 10 amino acids, e.g. 8, 9, or 10, (or even 6, 7, 11, or 12 amino acids), or fragments as processed and presented by MHC class II molecules, preferably having a length of about 13 or more amino acids, e.g. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or even more amino acids, wherein these fragments may be selected from any part of the amino acid sequence. These fragments are typically recognized by T-cells in form of a complex consisting of the peptide fragment and an MHC molecule, i.e. the fragments are typically not recognized in their native form. Fragments of proteins or peptides may comprise at least one epitope of those proteins or peptides. Furthermore also domains of a protein, like the extracellular domain, the intracellular domain or the transmembrane domain and shortened or truncated versions of a protein may be understood to comprise a fragment of a protein. Variants of proteins: \"Variants\" of proteins or peptides as defined in the context of the present invention may be generated, having an amino acid sequence which differs from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s), such as one or more substituted, inserted and/or deleted amino acid(s). Preferably, these fragments and/or variants have the same biological function or specific activity compared to the full-length native protein, e.g. its specific antigenic property. \"Variants\" of proteins or peptides as defined in the context of the present invention may comprise conservative amino acid substitution(s) compared to their native, i.e. non-mutated physiological, sequence. Those amino acid sequences as well as their encoding nucleotide sequences in particular fall under the term variants as defined herein. Substitutions in which amino acids, which originate from the same class, are exchanged for one another are called conservative substitutions. In particular, these are amino acids having aliphatic side chains, positively or negatively charged side chains, aromatic groups in the side chains or amino acids, the side chains of which can enter into hydrogen bridges, e.g. side chains which have a hydroxyl function. This means that e.g. an amino acid having a polar side chain is replaced by another amino acid having a likewise polar side chain, or, for example, an amino acid characterized by a hydrophobic side chain is substituted by another amino acid having a likewise hydrophobic side chain (e.g. serine and substitutions are possible, in particular, at those sequence positions which cause no modification to the three-dimensional structure or do not affect the binding region. Modifications to a three-dimensional structure by insertion(s) or deletion(s) can easily be determined e.g. using CD spectra (circular dichroism spectra) (Urry, 1985, Absorption, Circular Dichroism and ORD of Polypeptides, in: Modern Physical Methods in Biochemistry, Neuberger et al. (ed.), Elsevier, Amsterdam). A \"variant\" of a protein or peptide may 98% or 99% amino acid identity over a stretch of 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 or 100 amino acids of such protein or peptide. Furthermore, variants of proteins or peptides as defined herein, which may be encoded by a nucleic acid molecule, may also comprise those sequences, wherein nucleotides of the encoding nucleic acid sequence are exchanged according to the degeneration of the genetic code, without leading to an alteration of the respective amino acid sequence of the protein or peptide, i.e. the amino acid sequence or at least part thereof may not differ from the original sequence in one or more mutation(s) within the above meaning. Identity of a sequence: In order to determine the percentage to which two sequences are identical, e.g. nucleic acid sequences or amino acid sequences as defined herein, preferably the amino acid sequences encoded by a nucleic acid sequence of the polymeric carrier as defined herein or the amino acid sequences themselves, the sequences can be aligned in order to be subsequently compared to one another. Therefore, e.g. a position of a first sequence may be compared with the corresponding position of the second sequence. If a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same component (residue) as is the case at a position in the second sequence, the two sequences are identical at this position. If this is not the case, the sequences differ at this position. If insertions occur in the second sequence in comparison to the first sequence, gaps can be inserted into the first sequence to allow a further alignment. If deletions occur in the second sequence in comparison to the first sequence, gaps can be inserted into the second sequence to allow a further alignment. The percentage to which two sequences are identical is then a function of the number of identical positions divided by the total number of positions including those positions which are only occupied in one sequence. The percentage to which two sequences are identical can be determined using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, but not limiting, example of a mathematical algorithm which can be used is the algorithm of Karlin et al. (1993), PNAS USA, 90:5873-5877 or Altschul et al. (1997), Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402. Such an algorithm is integrated in the BLAST program. Sequences which are identical to the sequences of the present invention to a certain extent can be identified by this program. Derivative of a protein or peptide: A derivative of a peptide or protein is typically understood to be a molecule that is derived from another molecule, such as said peptide or protein. A \"derivative\" of a peptide or protein also encompasses fusions comprising a peptide or protein used in the present invention. For example, the fusion comprises a label, such as, for example, an epitope, e.g., a FLAG epitope or a V5 epitope. For example, the epitope is a FLAG epitope. Such a tag is useful for, for example, purifying the fusion protein. Pharmaceutically effective amount: A pharmaceutically effective amount in the context of the invention is typically understood to be an amount that is sufficient to induce an immune response. Carrier/polymeric carrier: A carrier in the context of the invention may typically be a compound that facilitates transport and/or complexation of another compound. Said carrier may form a complex with said other compound. A polymeric carrier is a carrier that is formed of a polymer. Vehicle: An agent, e.g. a carrier, that may typically be used within a pharmaceutical composition or vaccine for facilitating administering of the components of the pharmaceutical composition or vaccine to an individual. Jet injection: The term \"jet injection\", as used herein, refers to a needle-free injection method, wherein a fluid containing at least one inventive mRNA sequence and, optionally, further suitable excipients is forced through an orifice, thus generating an ultra-fine liquid stream of high pressure that is capable of penetrating mammalian skin and, depending on the injection settings, subcutaneous tissue or muscle tissue. In principle, the liquid stream forms a hole in the skin, through which the liquid stream is pushed into the target tissue. Preferably, jet injection is used for intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of the mRNA sequence according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, jet injection is used for intramuscular injection of the mRNA sequence according to the invention. In a further preferred embodiment, jet injection is used for intradermal injection of the mRNA sequence according to the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the inventors' surprising finding that mRNA encoding at least one antigenic peptide or protein comprised in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) induces very efficiently antigen-specific immune responses against the encoded antigenic peptide or protein at a very low dosages and dosing regimen which do not require frequent administration.

In order to be suitable for the present invention, the lipid nanoparticles comprise at least: (i) a cationic lipid and/or a PEG-lipid as defined below; and (ii) an mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence encoding an antigenic peptide or protein. The mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticle may comprise further compounds, such as one or more neutral lipids, steroids and combinations of said compounds. Suitable compounds will be described in detail below. The mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence encoding an antigenic peptide or protein may be a mRNA molecule. In one embodiment of the invention, the mRNA compound is a natural and non-modified mRNA. Within the context of the present invention, natural and non-modified mRNA encompasses mRNA generated in vitro, without chemical modifications or changes in the sequence. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the mRNA compound comprises an artificial mRNA. In the context of the present invention artificial mRNA encompasses mRNA with chemical modifications, sequence modifications or non-natural sequences. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mRNA compound does not comprise nucleoside modifications, in particular no base modifications. In a further embodiment, the mRNA compound does not comprise 1-methylpseudouridine modifications. In one preferred embodiment, the mRNA comprises only the naturally existing nucleosides. In a further preferred embodiment, the mRNA compound does not comprise any chemical modification and optionally comprises sequence modifications. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention the mRNA compound only comprises the naturally existing nucleosides adenine, uracil, guanine and cytosine. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, the mRNA sequence is mono-, bi-, or multicistronic, preferably as defined herein. The coding sequences in a bi- or multicistronic mRNA preferably encode distinct peptides or proteins as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof. Preferably, the coding sequences encoding two or more peptides or proteins may be separated in the bi- or multicistronic mRNA by at least one IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence, as defined below. Thus, the term \"encoding two or more peptides or proteins\" may mean, without being limited thereto, that the bi- or even multicistronic mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five, six or more (preferably different) peptides or proteins or their fragments or variants within the definitions provided herein. More preferably, without being limited thereto, the bi- or even multicistronic mRNA, may encode, for example, at least two, three, four, five, six or more (preferably different) peptides or proteins as defined herein or their fragments or variants as defined herein. In this context, a so-called IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence as defined above can function as a sole ribosome binding site, but it can also serve to provide a bi- or even multicistronic mRNA as defined above, which encodes several peptides or proteins which are to be translated by the ribosomes independently of one another. Examples of IRES sequences, which can be used according to the invention, are those from picornaviruses (e.g. FMDV), pestiviruses (CFFV), polioviruses disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), mouse leukoma virus (MLV), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV). According to a further embodiment the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence according to the invention may encode at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and more peptides or proteins (or fragments and derivatives thereof) as defined herein linked with or without an amino acid linker sequence, wherein said linker sequence can comprise rigid linkers, flexible linkers, cleavable linkers (e.g., self-cleaving peptides) or a combination thereof. Therein, the peptides or proteins may be identical or different or a combination thereof. Particular peptide or protein combinations can be encoded by said mRNA encoding at least two peptides or proteins as explained herein (also referred to herein as \"multi-antigen-constructs/mRNA\"). In a particular aspect of the invention, the lipid nanoparticles comprise an mRNA compound, comprising an mRNA sequence encoding an antigenic peptide or protein, or a fragment, variant or derivative thereof. These antigenic peptides or proteins may be derived from pathogenic antigens, tumour antigens, allergenic antigens or autoimmune self-antigens, preferably as defined herein. In the context of the present invention, antigenic peptides or proteins preferably exclude luciferases.

Influenza: In a particularly preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the invention the mRNA compound comprises a mRNA sequence comprises a coding region, encoding at least one antigenic peptide or protein derived from hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), nuclear export protein (NEP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein PB1, PB1-F2, or polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of an influenza virus or a fragment or variant thereof. In this context, the amino acid sequence of the at least one antigenic peptide or protein may be selected from any peptide or protein derived from hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), nuclear export protein (NEP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein PB1, PB1-F2, or polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of an influenza virus or a fragment or variant or from any synthetically engineered influenza virus peptide or protein. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the coding region encodes at least one antigenic peptide or protein derived from hemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA) of an influenza virus or a fragment or variant thereof. In this context the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) may be chosen from the same influenza virus or from different influenza viruses. In this context it is particularly preferred that the at least one coding region encodes at least one full-length protein of hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein 1 (M1), matrix protein 2 (M2), non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), nuclear export protein (NEP), polymerase acidic protein (PA), polymerase basic protein PB1, PB1-F2, or polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of an influenza virus or a variant thereof. In particularly preferred embodiments the at least one coding region encodes at least one full-length protein of hemagglutinin (HA), and/or at least one full-length protein of neuraminidase (NA) of an influenza virus or a variant thereof. The term \"full-length protein\" as used herein typically refers to a protein that substantially comprises the entire amino acid sequence of the naturally occurring protein. As used herein, the term \"full-length protein\" preferably relates to the full-length sequence of a protein as indicated in the sequence listing of the present invention i.e. to an amino acid sequence as defined by any one of the SEQ ID NOs listed in the sequence listing (SEQ ID NOs: 1-30504 ID NO: 224309) or to an amino acid provided in the database under the respective database accession number. Preferred Sequences of the Present Invention: In this context it is further preferred that the at least one coding sequence of the mRNA sequence of the present invention encodes at least one antigenic peptide or protein which is derived from a hemagglutinin (HA) protein of an influenza A virus; or a hemagglutinin (HA) protein of an influenza B virus; or a neuraminidase (NA) protein of an influenza A virus; or a neuraminidase (NA) protein of an influenza B virus; or or a fragment or variant thereof, wherein the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of an influenza A virus or the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of an influenza B virus or the neuraminidase (NA) protein of an influenza A virus or the neuraminidase (NA) protein of an influenza B virus is selected from the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins or the neuraminidase (NA) proteins as listed in the sequence listing of the present invention. The sequence listing discloses all influenza A or influenza B virus hemagglutinin (HA) proteins and all influenza A or influenza B virus neuraminidase (NA) proteins which are preferred in the present invention. Each preferred antigenic peptide or protein and its coding sequence can be identified with the data element shown under the numeric identifier <223>. In other words, each preferred hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) sequence from an influenza A or B virus can be identified through the specific database accession number (i.e. a GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No.) by reading through the sequence listing entries under numeric identifier <223>. In sum, each preferred sequence is depicted by its GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. which again is depicted with seven distinct preferred SEQ ID NO in the sequence listing (protein, nucleic acid wild type, nucleic acid optimizations 1 to 5). This is apparent from the numeric identifier <223>. I.e. the first consecutive entry of a specific GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. in the sequence listing under numeric identifier <223> indicates the SEQ ID NO: corresponding to the respective AMINO ACID SEQUENCE (i.e. Protein Sequence wild type SEQ ID NO). Further, the second consecutive entry of a GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. in the sequence listing under numeric identifier <223> corresponds to the NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE of the wild type mRNA encoding the protein (i.e. Nucleotide Sequence wild type SEQ ID NO). Further, the next five consecutive entries of a GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. in the sequence listing under numeric identifier <223> provide the SEQ ID NOs corresponding to five different MODIFIED/OPTIMIZED NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCES of the sequences as described herein that encode the protein preferably having the amino acid sequence as defined by the first consecutive entry for a specific GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. in the sequence listing (i.e. Optimized Nucleotide Sequence SEQ ID NO). Accordingly, a reference to a specific GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No equals to a reference to the block of seven sequences as described above (protein=1, nucleic acid=2, optimized sequences=3-7). One example would be the first GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. which is mentioned in the sequence listing, i.e. under SEQ ID NO:1 numeric identifier <223>: AAA16879. If Accession No. AAA16879 is searched throughout the sequence listing it is apparent that, as described above, seven SEQ ID NO are connected to this Accession No.: SEQ ID NO:192073. In accordance with the above explanation, for SEQ ID NO:1, the numeric identifier <223> reads \"derived and/or (wt) NO: 32013, the (wt) NO: 64025, the (opt1) NO: 96037, the (opt2) NO: 128049, the (opt3) NO: 160061, the \"derived modified (opt4) from for ID NO: 192073, the identifier reads \"derived and/or modified CDS sequence (opt5) from hemagglutinin_InfluenzaA_AAA16879\". Therefore, a reference to AAA16879 equals to a reference to the seven sequences as described above (protein=1st sequence, nucleic acid=2nd sequence, five different optimized sequences=3rd-7th sequence). A second example would be the second GenBank Protein or Nucleic Acid Accession No. which is mentioned in the sequence listing, i.e. under SEQ ID NO:2 numeric identifier <223>: \"AAA16880\". Accession No. AAA16880 is connected to these seven sequences in the sequence listing: SEQ ID NOs:2 (protein), 32014 (nucleic acid wild type), (optimization 1), 96038 (optimization 2), 128050 (optimization 3), 160062 (optimization 4), and 192074 (optimization 5). Accordingly, a reference to AAA16880 equals to a reference to the seven sequences as described above. A further illustration of this circumstance can be seen in exemplary FIGS. 20-24, which show the structure of the sequence listing by exemplifying hemagglutinin (HA) proteins and neuraminidase (NA) proteins of influenza A and B viruses and glycoproteins of Rabies virus: - - exemplary hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of influenza A virus (FIG. 20); - exemplary hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of influenza B virus (FIG. 21); - exemplary neuraminidase (NA) proteins of influenza A virus (FIG. 22); - exemplary neuraminidase (NA) proteins of influenza B virus (FIG. 23); - exemplary glycoproteins of Rabies virus (FIG. 24).

In this context, the terms in brackets indicate the particular preferred allergenic antigens (allergens) from the particular source. Most preferably the allergenic antigen is preferably derived from a source (e.g. a plant (e.g. grass or a tree), a natural product (e.g. milk, nuts etc.), a fungal source (e.g. Aspergillus) or a bacterial source or from an animal source or animal poison (e.g. cat, dog, venom of bees etc.), preferably selected from the list consisting of grass pollen (e.g. pollen of rye), tree pollen (e.g. pollen of hazel, birch, alder, ash), flower pollen, herb pollen (e.g. pollen of mugwort), dust mite (e.g. Der f 1, Der p 1, Eur m 1, Der m 1 Der f 2, Der p 2, Eur m 2, Tyr p 2, Lep d 2), mold (e.g. Fel d 2, Fel d3, or Fel d4 of cats), food (e.g. allergens of fish (e.g. bass, cod, flounder), seafood (e.g. crab, lobster, shrimps), egg, wheat, nuts (e.g. peanuts, almonds, cashews, walnuts), soya, milk, etc.) or insect venom (e.g. allergens from the venom of wasps, bees, hornets, ants, mosquitoes, or ticks). Autoimmune Self-Antigens: Autoimmune self-antigens, i.e. antigens associated with autoimmune disease or autoantigens, may be associated with an autoimmune disease affecting at least one or more of the following organ systems: the circulatory system, the digestive system, the endocrine system, the excretory system, the immune system, the integumentary system, the muscular system, the nervous system, the reproductive system, the respiratory system, the skeletal system, preferably with the the cardiovascular system, the neuroendocrine system, the musculoskeletal system or gastrointestinal system. Therein the circulatory system is the organ system which enables pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels. The digestive system enables digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus. The endocrine system enables communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary glands. The excretory system comprises kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra and is involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine. The immune system comprises structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels which may be responsible for transport of cellular and humoral components of the immune system. It is responsible for defending against disease-causing agents and comprises amongst others leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen. The integumentary system comprises skin, hair and nails. The muscular system enables movement with muscles together with the skeletal system which comprises bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons and provides structural support. The nervous system is responsible for collecting, transferring and processing information and comprises the brain, spinal cord and nerves. The reproductive system comprises the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis. The respiratory system comprises the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm and acts together with the circulation system. Autoimmune self-antigens (antigens associated with autoimmune disease or autoantigens) are selected from autoantigens associated with autoimmune diseases selected from Addison disease (autoimmune adrenalitis, Morbus Addison), anemia (AIHA) of the cold type (cold hemagglutinine disease, cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (cold agglutinin disease), (CHAD)), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) of the warm type (warm AIHA, warm autoimmune haemolytic anemia (AIHA)), autoimmune hemolytic Donath-Landsteiner anemia cell arteriitis, autoimmune chronic gastritis, autoimmune infertility, autoimmune inner disease (including colitis ulcerosa (Morbus diseases, Diabetes, Diabetes mellitus Type 1 (type I diabetes, insuline dependent Diabetes mellitus), Diabetes mellitus Type 2 (type II diabetes), essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, fibromyalgia, fibromyositis, Goodpasture syndrome (anti-GBM haematologic autoimmune diseases, Hashimoto thyroiditis, hemophilia, acquired hemophilia, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, particularly autoimmune forms disease (Morbus Meniere); mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis (MS, Charcot's disease), Myasthenia primary These and other proteins acting as autoimmune self-antigens are understood to be therapeutic, as they are meant to treat the subject, in particular a mammal, more particularly a human being, by vaccinating with a self-antigen which is expressed by the mammal, e.g. the human, itself and which triggers an undesired immune response, which is not raised in a healthy subject. Accordingly, such proteins acting as self-antigens are typically of mammalian, in particular human origin.

According to a further embodiment, the mRNA sequence according to the invention is an artificial mRNA sequence as defined herein. According to a further embodiment, the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence according to the invention is a modified mRNA sequence, preferably a modified mRNA sequence as described herein. In this context, a modification as defined herein preferably leads to a stabilization of the mRNA sequence according to the invention. More preferably, the invention thus provides a stabilized mRNA sequence comprising at least one coding region as defined herein. According to one embodiment, the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence of the present invention may thus be provided as a \"stabilized mRNA sequence\", that is to say as an mRNA that is essentially resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. by an exo- or endo-nuclease). Such stabilization can be effected, for example, by a modified phosphate backbone of the mRNA of the present invention. A backbone modification in connection with the present invention is a modification in which phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in the mRNA are chemically modified. Nucleotides that may be preferably used in this connection contain e.g. a phosphorothioate-modified phosphate backbone, preferably at least one of the phosphate oxygens contained in the phosphate backbone being replaced by a sulfur atom. Stabilized mRNAs may further include, for example: non-ionic phosphate analogues, such as, for example, alkyl and aryl phosphonates, in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl group, or phosphodiesters and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen residue is present in alkylated form. Such backbone modifications typically include, without implying any limitation, modifications from the group consisting of methylphosphonates, phosphoramidates and phosphorothioates (e.g. cytidine-5-O-(1-thiophosphate)). In the following, specific modifications are described, which are preferably capable of \"stabilizing\" the mRNA as defined herein. Chemical Modifications: The term \"mRNA modification\" as used herein may refer to chemical modifications comprising backbone modifications as well as sugar modifications or base modifications. In this context, a modified mRNA (sequence) as defined herein may contain nucleotide analogues/modifications, e.g. backbone modifications, sugar modifications or base modifications. A backbone modification in connection with the present invention is a modification, in which phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in an mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as defined herein are chemically modified. A sugar modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the sugar of the nucleotides of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as defined herein. Furthermore, a base modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the base moiety of the nucleotides of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence. In this context, nucleotide analogues or modifications are preferably selected from nucleotide analogues, which are applicable for transcription and/or translation. Sugar Modifications: The modified nucleosides and nucleotides, which may be incorporated into a modified mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as described herein, can be modified in the sugar moiety. For example, the 2 hydroxyl group (OH) can be modified or replaced with a number of different \"oxy\" or \"deoxy\" substituents. Examples of \"oxy\"-2 hydroxyl group modifications include, but are not limited in which the 2 hydroxyl is connected, e.g., by a methylene bridge, to the 4 carbon of the same ribose sugar; and amino groups (\u2014O-amino, wherein the amino or amino acid); or the amino group can be attached to the sugar through a linker, wherein the linker comprises one or more of the atoms C, N, and 0. The sugar group can also contain one or more carbons that possess the opposite stereochemical configuration than that of the corresponding carbon in ribose. Thus, a modified mRNA can include nucleotides containing, for instance, arabinose as the sugar. Backbone Modifications: The phosphate backbone may further be modified in the modified nucleosides and nucleotides, which may be incorporated into a modified mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as described herein. The phosphate groups of the backbone can be modified by replacing one or more of the oxygen atoms with a different substituent. Further, the modified nucleosides and nucleotides can include the full replacement of an unmodified phosphate moiety with a modified phosphate as described herein. Examples of modified phosphate groups include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioate, oxygens replaced by sulfur. The phosphate linker can also be modified by the replacement of a linking oxygen with nitrogen (bridged phosphoroamidates), sulfur (bridged phosphorothioates) and carbon (bridged methylene-phosphonates). Base Modifications: The modified nucleosides and nucleotides, which may be incorporated into a modified mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as described herein can further be modified in the nucleobase moiety. Examples of nucleobases found in mRNA include, but are not limited to, adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil. For example, the nucleosides and nucleotides described herein can be chemically modified on the major groove face. In some embodiments, the major groove chemical modifications can include an amino group, a thiol group, an alkyl group, or a halo group. In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the nucleotide analogues/modifications are selected from base modifications, which are is given to nucleotides for base modifications selected from the group of base-modified nucleotides consisting of 5-methylcytidine-5-triphosphate, 7-deazaguanosine-5-triphosphate, the nucleotide can be modified on the major groove face and can include replacing hydrogen on C-5 of uracil with a methyl group or a halo group. In specific embodiments, a modified nucleoside is 5-O-(1-thiophosphate)-adenosine, 5-O-(1-thiophosphate)-cytidine, 5-O-(1-thiophosphate)-guanosine, embodiments, embodiment of the invention, the mRNA compound does not comprise a base modification as described above. Lipid Modification: According to a further embodiment, a modified mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence as defined herein can contain a lipid modification. Such a lipid-modified mRNA typically comprises an mRNA as defined herein. Such a lipid-modified mRNA as defined herein typically further comprises at least one linker covalently linked with that mRNA, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker. Alternatively, the lipid-modified mRNA comprises at least one mRNA as defined herein and at least one (bifunctional) lipid covalently linked (without a linker) with that mRNA. According to a third alternative, the lipid-modified mRNA comprises an mRNA molecule as defined herein, at least one linker covalently linked with that mRNA, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker, and also at least one (bifunctional) lipid covalently linked (without a linker) with that mRNA. In this context, it is particularly preferred that the lipid modification is present at the terminal ends of a linear mRNA sequence. Sequence Modifications: G/C Content Modification: According to another embodiment, the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles comprises an mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence, which may be modified, and thus stabilized, by modifying the guanosine/cytosine (G/C) content of the mRNA sequence, preferably of the at least one coding region of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence of the present invention. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the G/C content of the coding region of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence of the present invention is modified, particularly increased, compared to the G/C content of the coding region of the respective wild type mRNA, i.e. the unmodified mRNA. The amino acid sequence encoded by the mRNA is preferably not modified as compared to the amino acid sequence encoded by the respective wild type mRNA. This modification of the mRNA sequence of the present invention is based on the fact that the sequence of any mRNA region to be translated is important for efficient translation of that mRNA. Thus, the composition of the mRNA and the sequence of various nucleotides are important. In particular, sequences having an increased G (guanosine)/C (cytosine) content are more stable than sequences having an increased A (adenosine)/U (uracil) content. According to the invention, the codons of the mRNA are therefore varied compared to the respective wild type mRNA, while retaining the translated amino acid sequence, such that they include an increased amount of G/C nucleotides. In respect to the fact that several codons code for one and the same amino acid (so-called degeneration of the genetic code), the most favourable codons for the stability can be determined (so-called alternative codon usage). Depending on the amino acid to be encoded by the mRNA, there are various possibilities for modification of the mRNA sequence, compared to its wild type sequence. In the case of amino acids, which are encoded by codons, which contain exclusively G or C nucleotides, no modification of the codon is necessary. Thus, the codons for Pro (CCC or CCG), Arg (CGC or (GCC or GCG) and Gly (GGC or GGG) require no modification, since no A or U is present. In contrast, codons which contain A and/or U nucleotides can be modified by substitution of other codons, which code for the same amino acids but contain no A and/or U. Examples of these are: the codons for Pro can be modified from CCU or CCA to CCC or CCG; the codons for Arg can be modified from CGU or CGA or AGA or AGG to CGC or CGG; the codons for Ala can be modified from GCU or GCA to GCC or GCG; the codons for Gly can be modified from GGU or GGA to GGC or GGG. In other cases, although A or U nucleotides cannot be eliminated from the codons, it is however possible to decrease the A and U content by using codons which contain a lower content of A and/or U nucleotides. Examples of these are: the codons for Phe can be modified from UUU to UUC; the codons for Leu can CUA to CUC or CUG; the for Ser can be modified from UCU or UCA or AGU to UCC, UCG or AGC; the codon for Tyr can be modified from UAU to UAC; the codon for Cys can be modified from UGU to UGC; the codon for His can be modified from CAU to CAC; the codon for Gin can be modified from CAA to CAG; the codons for Ile can be modified from AUU or AUA to AUC; the codons for Thr can be modified from ACU or ACA to ACC or ACG; the codon for Asn can be modified from AAU to AAC; the codon for Lys can be modified from AAA to AAG; the codons for Val can be modified from GUU or GUA to GUC or GUG; the codon for Asp can be modified from GAU to GAC; the codon for Glu can be modified from GAA to GAG; the stop codon UAA can be modified to UAG or UGA. In the case of the codons for Met (AUG) and Trp (UGG), on the other hand, there is no possibility of sequence modification. The substitutions listed above can be used either individually or in all possible combinations to increase the G/C content of the mRNA sequence of the present invention compared to its particular wild type mRNA (i.e. the original sequence). Thus, for example, all codons for Thr occurring in the wild type sequence can be modified to ACC (or ACG). Preferably, however, for example, combinations of the above substitution possibilities are used: substitution of all codons coding for Thr in the original sequence (wild type mRNA) to ACC (or ACG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Ser to UCC (or UCG or AGC); substitution of all codons coding for Ile in the original sequence to AUC and substitution of all codons originally coding for Lys to AAG and substitution of all codons originally coding for Tyr to UAC; substitution of all codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and substitution of all codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Arg to CGC (or CGG); substitution of all codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Glu to GAG and substitution of all codons originally coding for Ala to GCC (or GCG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Gly to GGC (or GGG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Asn to AAC; substitution of all codons coding for Val in the original sequence to GUC (or GUG) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Phe to UUC and substitution of all codons originally coding for Cys to UGC and substitution of all codons originally coding for Leu to CUG (or CUC) and substitution of all codons originally coding for Gin to CAG and substitution of all codons originally coding for Pro to CCC (or CCG); etc. Preferably, the G/C content of the coding region of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence of the present invention is increased by at least 7%, more preferably by at least 15%, particularly preferably by at least 20%, compared to the G/C content of the coding region of the wild type RNA, which codes for an antigen as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof. According to a specific embodiment at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90%, 95% or even 100% of the substitutable codons in the region coding for a peptide or protein as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof or the whole sequence of the wild type mRNA sequence are substituted, thereby increasing the GC/content of said sequence. In this context, it is particularly preferable to increase the G/C content of the mRNA sequence of the present invention, preferably of the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence according to the invention, to the maximum (i.e. 100% of the substitutable codons) as compared to the wild type sequence. According to the invention, a further preferred modification of the mRNA sequence of the present invention is based on the finding that the translation efficiency is also determined by a different frequency in the occurrence of tRNAs in cells. Thus, if so-called \"rare codons\" are present in the mRNA sequence of the present invention to an increased extent, the corresponding modified mRNA sequence is translated to a significantly poorer degree than in the case where codons coding for relatively \"frequent\" tRNAs are present. According to the invention, in the modified mRNA sequence of the present invention, the region which codes for a peptide or protein as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof is modified compared to the corresponding region of the wild type mRNA sequence such that at least one codon of the wild type sequence, which codes for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell, is exchanged for a codon, which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. By this modification, the sequence of the mRNA of the present invention is modified such that codons for which frequently occurring tRNAs are available are inserted. In other words, according to the invention, by this modification all codons of the wild type sequence, which code for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell, can in each case be exchanged for a codon, which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and which, in each case, carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. Which tRNAs occur relatively frequently in the cell and which, in contrast, occur relatively rarely is known to a person skilled in the art; cf. e.g. Akashi, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001, 11(6): 660-666. The codons, which use for the particular amino acid the tRNA which occurs the most frequently, e.g. the Gly codon, which uses the tRNA, which occurs the most frequently in the (human) cell, are particularly preferred. According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to link the sequential G/C content which is increased, in particular maximized, in the modified mRNA sequence of the present invention, with the \"frequent\" codons without modifying the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the coding region of the mRNA sequence. This preferred embodiment allows provision of a particularly efficiently translated and stabilized (modified) mRNA sequence of the present invention. The determination of a modified mRNA sequence of the present invention as described above (increased G/C content; exchange of tRNAs) can be carried out using the computer program explained in WO02/098443\u2014the disclosure content of which is included in its full scope in the present invention. Using this computer program, the nucleotide sequence of any desired mRNA sequence can be modified with the aid of the genetic code or the degenerative nature thereof such that a maximum G/C content results, in combination with the use of codons which code for tRNAs occurring as frequently as possible in the cell, the amino acid sequence coded by the modified mRNA sequence preferably not being modified compared to the non-modified sequence. Alternatively, it is also possible to modify only the G/C content or only the codon usage compared to the original sequence. The source code in Visual Basic 6.0 (development environment used: Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 6.0 with Servicepack 3) is also described in WO02/098443. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of the mRNA sequence of the present invention is increased compared to the A/U content in the environment of the ribosome binding site of its respective wild type mRNA. This modification (an increased A/U content around the ribosome binding site) increases the efficiency of ribosome binding to the mRNA. An effective binding of the ribosomes to the ribosome site the AUG forms the start codon) in turn has the effect of an efficient translation of the mRNA. According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the mRNA sequence of the present invention may be modified with respect to potentially destabilizing sequence elements. Particularly, the coding region and/or the 5 and/or 3 untranslated region of this mRNA sequence may be modified compared to the respective wild type mRNA such that it contains no destabilizing sequence elements, the encoded amino acid sequence of the modified mRNA sequence preferably not being modified compared to its respective wild type mRNA. It is known that, for example in sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs, destabilizing sequence elements (DSE) occur, to which signal proteins bind and regulate enzymatic degradation of mRNA in vivo. For further stabilization of the modified mRNA sequence, optionally in the region which encodes at least one peptide or protein as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof, one or more such modifications compared to the corresponding region of the wild type mRNA can therefore be carried out, so that no or substantially no destabilizing sequence elements are contained there. According to the invention, DSE present in the untranslated regions (3- and/or 5-UTR) can also be eliminated from the mRNA sequence of the present invention by such modifications. Such destabilizing sequences are e.g. AU-rich sequences (AURES), which occur in 3-UTR mRNAs (Caput et al., 1670 to 1674). The mRNA sequence of the present invention is therefore preferably modified compared to the respective wild type mRNA such that the mRNA sequence of the present invention contains no such destabilizing sequences. This also applies to those sequence motifs which are recognized by possible endonucleases, e.g. the sequence GAACAAG, which is contained in the 3-UTR segment of the gene encoding the transferrin receptor (Binder et al., EMBO J. 1994, 13: 1969 to 1980). These sequence motifs are also preferably removed in the mRNA sequence of the present invention.

Sequences Adapted to Human Codon Usage: According to the invention, a further preferred modification of the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence comprised in the mRNA of the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles of the present invention is based on the finding that codons encoding the same amino acid typically occur at different frequencies.

Therefore it is particularly preferred that the most frequent codons are used for each encoded amino acid (see Table 1a, \"Human codon usage table\", most frequent codons are marked with asterisks). Such an optimization procedure increases the codon adaptation index (CAI) and ultimately maximises the CAI. In the context of the invention, sequences with increased or maximized CAI are typically referred to as \"codon-optimized\" sequences and/or CAI increased and/or maximized sequences.

According to a further particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention provides mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles wherein the mRNA comprises an mRNA sequence as defined herein comprising at least one coding region encoding at least one antigenic peptide or protein derived from glycoprotein of a Rabies virus, wherein the coding region comprises or consists of any one of the (modified) RNA sequences according to SEQ ID NOs: 190565-192072 or of a fragment or variant of any one of these sequences. In a further preferred embodiment, the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence according to the invention comprises or consists of an RNA sequence identical to or having a sequence identity of at least least 70%, more preferably of at least 80%, even more preferably at least 85%, even more preferably of at least 90% and most preferably of at least 95% or even 97%, with any one of the (modified) RNA sequences according to SEQ ID NOs: 160061-192072, or of a fragment or variant of any one of these sequences. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence according to the invention comprises or consists of an RNA sequence having a sequence identity of at least 80% with any one of the (modified) RNA sequences according to SEQ ID NOs: 160061-192072 or of a fragment or variant of any one of these sequences. C-Optimized Sequences: According to another embodiment, the mRNA compound comprising an mRNA sequence of the present invention may be modified by modifying, preferably increasing, the cytosine (C) content of the mRNA sequence, preferably of the coding region of the mRNA sequence. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the C content of the coding region of the mRNA sequence of the present invention is modified, preferably increased, compared to the C content of the coding region of the respective wild type mRNA, i.e. the unmodified mRNA. The amino acid sequence encoded by the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence of the present invention is preferably not modified as compared to the amino acid sequence encoded by the respective wild type mRNA. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the modified mRNA sequence is modified such that at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or 80%, least 90% of the theoretically possible maximum cytosine-content or even a maximum cytosine-content is achieved. In further preferred embodiments, the codons of the target mRNA wild type sequence, which are \"cytosine content optimizable\" are replaced by codons having a higher cytosine-content than the ones present in the wild type sequence. In a further preferred embodiment, some of the codons of the wild type coding sequence may additionally be modified such that a codon for a relatively rare tRNA in the cell is exchanged by a codon for a relatively frequent tRNA in the cell, provided that the substituted codon for a relatively frequent tRNA carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA of the original wild type codon. Preferably, all of the codons for a relatively rare tRNA are replaced by a codon for a relatively frequent tRNA in the cell, except codons encoding amino acids, which are exclusively encoded by codons not containing any cytosine, or except for glutamine (Gln), which is encoded by two codons each containing the same number of cytosines. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the modified target mRNA is modified such that at least 80%, or at least 90% of the theoretically possible maximum cytosine-content or even a maximum cytosine-content is achieved by means of codons, which code for relatively frequent tRNAs in the cell, wherein the amino acid sequence remains unchanged. Due to the naturally occurring degeneracy of the genetic code, more than one codon may encode a particular amino acid. Accordingly, 18 out of 20 naturally occurring amino acids are encoded by more than one codon (with Tryp and Met being an exception), e.g. by 2 codons (e.g. Cys, Asp, Glu), by three codons (e.g. Ile), by 4 codons (e.g. A1, Gly, Pro) or by 6 codons (e.g. Leu, Arg, Ser). However, not all codons encoding the same amino acid are utilized with the same frequency under in vivo conditions. Depending on each single organism, a typical codon usage profile is established. The term \"cytosine content-optimizable codon\" as used within the context of the present invention refers to codons, which exhibit a lower content of cytosines than other codons encoding the same amino acid. Accordingly, any wild type codon, which may be replaced by another codon encoding the same amino acid and exhibiting a higher number of cytosines within that codon, is considered to be cytosine-optimizable (C-optimizable). Any such substitution of a C-optimizable wild type codon by the specific C-optimized codon within a wild type coding region increases its overall C-content and reflects a C-enriched modified mRNA sequence. According to a preferred embodiment, the mRNA sequence of the present invention, preferably the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence of the present invention comprises or consists of a C-maximized mRNA sequence containing C-optimized codons for all potentially C-optimizable codons. Accordingly, 100% or all of the theoretically replaceable C-optimizable codons are preferably replaced by C-optimized codons over the entire length of the coding region. In this context, cytosine-content optimizable codons are codons, which contain a lower number of cytosines than other codons coding for the same amino acid. Any of the codons GCG, GCA, GCU codes for the amino acid Ala, which may be exchanged by the codon GCC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon UGU that codes for Cys may be exchanged by the codon UGC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon GAU which codes for Asp may be exchanged by the codon GAC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon that UUU that codes for Phe may be exchanged for the codon UUC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons GGG, GGA, GGU that code Gly may be exchanged by the codon GGC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon CAU that codes for His may be exchanged by the codon CAC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons AUA, AUU that code for Ile may be exchanged by the codon AUC, and/or any of exchanged by the codon CUC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon AAU that codes for Asn may be exchanged by the codon AAC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons CCG, CCA, CCU coding for Pro may be exchanged by the codon CCC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons AGG, AGA, CGG, CGA, CGU coding for Arg may be exchanged by the codon CGC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons AGU, AGC, UCG, UCA, UCU coding for Ser may be exchanged by the codon UCC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons ACG, ACA, ACU coding for Thr may be exchanged by the codon ACC encoding the same amino acid, and/or any of the codons GUG, GUA, GUU coding for Val may be exchanged by the codon GUC encoding the same amino acid, and/or the codon UAU coding for Tyr may be exchanged by the codon UAC encoding the same amino acid. In any of the above instances, the number of cytosines is increased by 1 per exchanged codon. Exchange of all non C-optimized codons (corresponding to C-optimizable codons) of the coding region results in a C-maximized coding sequence. In the context of the invention, at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, of the non C-optimized codons within the at least one coding region of the mRNA sequence according to the invention are replaced by C-optimized codons. It may be preferred that for some amino acids the percentage of C-optimizable codons replaced by C-optimized codons is less than 70%, while for other amino acids the percentage of replaced codons is higher than 70% to meet the overall percentage of C-optimization of at least 70% of all C-optimizable wild type codons of the coding region. Preferably, in a C-optimized mRNA sequence of the invention, at least 50% of the C-optimizable wild type codons for any given amino acid are replaced by C-optimized codons, e.g. any modified C-enriched mRNA sequence preferably contains at least 50% C-optimized codons at C-optimizable wild type codon positions encoding any one of the above mentioned amino acids Ala, Cys, Asp, Phe, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Asn, Pro, Arg, Ser, Thr, Val and Tyr, preferably at least 60%. In this context codons encoding amino acids, which are not cytosine content-optimizable and which are, however, encoded by at least two codons, may be used without any further selection process. However, the codon of the wild type sequence that codes for a relatively rare tRNA in the cell, e.g. a human cell, may be exchanged for a codon that codes for a relatively frequent tRNA in the cell, wherein both code for the same amino acid. Accordingly, the relatively rare codon GAA coding for Glu may be exchanged by the relative frequent codon GAG coding for the same amino acid, and/or the relatively rare codon AAA coding for Lys may be exchanged by the relative frequent codon AAG coding for the same amino acid, and/or the relatively rare codon CAA coding for Gin may be exchanged for the relative frequent codon CAG encoding the same amino acid. In this context, the amino acids Met (AUG) and Trp (UGG), which are encoded by only one codon each, remain unchanged. Stop codons are not cytosine-content optimized, however, the relatively rare stop codons amber, ochre (UAA, UAG) may be exchanged by the relatively frequent stop codon opal (UGA). The single substitutions listed above may be used individually as well as in all possible combinations in order to optimize the cytosine-content of the modified mRNA sequence compared to the wild type mRNA sequence. Accordingly, the at least one coding sequence as defined herein may be changed compared to the coding region of the respective wild type mRNA in such a way that an amino acid encoded by at least two or more codons, of which one comprises one additional cytosine, such a codon may be exchanged by the C-optimized codon comprising one additional cytosine, wherein the amino acid is preferably unaltered compared to the wild type sequence.

An LNP may comprise any lipid capable of forming a particle to which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are attached, or in which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are encapsulated. The term \"lipid\" refers to a group of organic compounds that are derivatives of fatty acids (e.g., esters) and are generally characterized by being insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. Lipids are usually divided in at least three classes: (1) \"simple lipids\" which include fats and oils as well as waxes; (2) \"compound lipids\" which include phospholipids and glycolipids; and (3) \"derived such as steroids. In one embodiment, the mRNA-comprising LNP comprises one or more cationic lipids as defined herein, and one or more stabilizing lipids. Stabilizing lipids include neutral lipids and pegylated lipids. As mentioned, the LNP comprises a cationic lipid. The cationic lipid is preferably cationisable, i.e. it becomes protonated as the pH is lowered below the pKa of the ionizable group of the lipid, but is progressively more neutral at higher pH values. When positively charged, the lipid is then able to associate with negatively charged nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, the cationic lipid comprises a zwitterionic lipid that assumes a positive charge on pH decrease. The LNP may comprise any lipid capable of forming a particle to which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are attached, or in which the one or more nucleic acid molecules are encapsulated. In certain embodiments, the LNP may comprise any further cationic or cationisable lipid, i.e. any of a number of lipid species which carry a net positive charge at a selective pH, such as physiological pH. Such lipids include, but are of commercial preparations of cationic lipids are available which can be used in the present invention. These include, for example, LIPOFECTIN\u00ae (commercially available cationic liposomes comprising DOTMA and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-3phosphoethanolamine lipids comprising dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine (DOGS) in ethanol from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.).

In a further aspect, the present invention provides a vaccine, which is based on the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles according to the invention comprising at least one mRNA compound comprising a mRNA sequence comprising coding region as defined herein. The vaccine according to the invention is preferably a (pharmaceutical) composition as defined herein. Accordingly, the vaccine according to the invention is based on the same components as the (pharmaceutical) composition described herein. Insofar, it may be referred to the description of the (pharmaceutical) composition as provided herein. Preferably, the vaccine according to the invention comprises at least one mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles comprising at least one mRNA sequence as defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In embodiments, where the vaccine comprises more than one mRNA sequence (such as a plurality of RNA sequences according to the invention, wherein each preferably encodes a distinct antigenic peptide or protein) encapsulated in mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles, the vaccine may be provided in physically separate form and may be administered by separate administration steps. The vaccine according to the invention may correspond to the (pharmaceutical) composition as described herein, especially where the mRNA sequences are provided by one single composition. However, the inventive vaccine may also be provided physically separated. For instance, in embodiments, wherein the vaccine comprises more than one mRNA sequences/species encapsulated in mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles as defined herein, these RNA species may be provided such that, for example, two, three, four, five or six separate compositions, which may contain at least one mRNA species/sequence each (e.g. three distinct mRNA species/sequences), each encoding distinct antigenic peptides or proteins, are provided, which may or may not be combined. Also, the inventive vaccine may be a combination of at least two distinct compositions, each composition comprising at least one mRNA encoding at least one of the antigenic peptides or proteins defined herein. Alternatively, the vaccine may be provided as a combination of at least one mRNA, preferably at least two, three, four, five, six or more mRNAs, each encoding one of the antigenic peptides or proteins defined herein. The vaccine may be combined to provide one single composition prior to its use or it may be used such that more than one administration is required to administer the distinct mRNA sequences/species encoding any of the antigenic peptides or proteins encapsulated in mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles as defined herein. If the vaccine contains at least one mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles, typically comprising at least two mRNA sequences, encoding the antigen combinations defined herein, it may e.g. be administered by one single administration (combining all mRNA species/sequences), by at least two separate administrations. Accordingly; any combination of mono-, bi- or multicistronic mRNAs encoding the at least one antigenic peptide or protein or any combination of antigens as defined herein (and optionally further antigens), provided as separate entities (containing one mRNA species) or as combined entity (containing more than one mRNA species), is understood as a vaccine according to the present invention. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the inventive vaccine, the at least one antigen, preferably a combination as defined herein of at least two, three, four, five, six or more antigens encoded by the inventive composition as a whole, is provided as an individual (monocistronic) mRNA, which is administered separately. As with the (pharmaceutical) composition according to the present invention, the entities of the vaccine may be provided in liquid and or in dry (e.g. lyophilized) form. They may contain further components, in particular further components allowing for its pharmaceutical use. The vaccine or the (pharmaceutical) composition may, e.g., additionally contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or further auxiliary substances and additives and/or adjuvants. The vaccine or (pharmaceutical) composition typically comprises a safe and effective amount of the mRNA compound according to the invention as defined herein, encoding an antigenic peptide or protein as defined herein or a fragment or variant thereof or a combination of antigens, encapsulate within and/or associated with the lipid nanoparticles. As used herein, \"safe and effective amount\" means an amount of the mRNA that is sufficient to significantly induce a positive modification of cancer or a disease or disorder related to cancer. At the same time, however, a \"safe and effective amount\" is small enough to avoid serious side-effects, that is to say to permit a sensible relationship between advantage and risk. The determination of these limits typically lies within the scope of sensible medical judgment. In relation to the vaccine or (pharmaceutical) composition of the present invention, the expression \"safe and effective amount\" preferably means an amount of the mRNA (and thus of the encoded antigen) that is suitable for stimulating the adaptive immune system in such a manner that no excessive or damaging immune reactions are achieved but, preferably, also no such immune reactions below a measurable level. Such a \"safe and effective amount\" of the mRNA of the (pharmaceutical) composition or vaccine as defined herein may furthermore be selected in dependence of the type of mRNA, e.g. monocistronic, bi- or even multicistronic mRNA, since a bi- or even multicistronic mRNA may lead to a significantly higher expression of the encoded antigen(s) than the use of an equal amount of a monocistronic mRNA. A \"safe and effective amount\" of the mRNA of the (pharmaceutical) composition or vaccine as defined above will furthermore vary in connection with the particular condition to be treated and also with the age and physical condition of the patient to be treated, the severity of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the nature of the accompanying therapy, of the particular pharmaceutically acceptable carrier used, and similar factors, within the knowledge and experience of the accompanying doctor. The vaccine or composition according to the invention can be used according to the invention for human and also for veterinary medical purposes, as a pharmaceutical composition or as a vaccine. In a preferred embodiment, the mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticle of the (pharmaceutical) composition, vaccine or kit of parts according to the invention is provided in lyophilized form. Preferably, the lyophilized mRNA comprising lipid nanoparticles are reconstituted in a suitable buffer, advantageously based on an aqueous carrier, prior to administration, e.g. Ringer-Lactate solution, Ringer solution, a phosphate buffer solution.

The vaccine or (pharmaceutical) composition according to the invention may typically contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The expression \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" as used herein preferably includes the liquid or non-liquid basis of the inventive vaccine. If the inventive vaccine is provided in liquid form, the carrier will be water, typically pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline or buffered (aqueous) solutions, e.g phosphate, citrate etc. buffered solutions. Particularly for injection of the inventive vaccine, water or preferably a buffer, more preferably an aqueous buffer, may be used, containing a sodium salt, preferably at least 50 mM of a sodium salt, a calcium salt, preferably at least 0.01 mM of a calcium salt, and optionally a potassium salt, preferably at least 3 mM of a potassium salt. According to a preferred embodiment, the sodium, calcium and, optionally, potassium salts may occur in the form of their halogenides, e.g. chlorides, iodides, or bromides, in the form of their hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, or sulfates, etc. Without being limited thereto, examples of salts include e.g. NaCl, NaI, NaBr, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, Na2SO4, examples KCl, KI, KBr, K2CO3, KHCO3, anions of the aforementioned cations may be contained in the buffer. According to a more preferred embodiment, the buffer suitable for injection purposes as defined above, may contain salts selected from sodium chloride (NaCl), calcium potassium chloride (KCl), anions may be present additional to the chlorides. CaCl2) can also be replaced by another salt like KCl. Typically, the salts in the injection buffer are present in a concentration of at least 50 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), at least 3 mM potassium chloride (KCl) and at least 0.01 mM calcium chloride (CaCl2)). The injection buffer may be hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with reference to the specific reference medium, i.e. the buffer may have a higher, identical or lower salt content with reference to the specific reference medium, wherein preferably such concentrations of the afore mentioned salts may be used, which do not lead to damage of cells due to osmosis or other concentration effects. Reference media are e.g. in \"in vivo\" methods occurring liquids such as blood, lymph, cytosolic liquids, or other body liquids, or e.g. liquids, which may be used as reference media in \"in vitro\" methods, such as common buffers or liquids. Such common buffers or liquids are known to a skilled person. However, one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers or diluents or encapsulating compounds may be used as well, which are suitable for administration to a person. The term \"compatible\" as used herein means that the constituents of the inventive vaccine are capable of being mixed with the mRNA according to the invention as defined herein, in such a manner that no interaction occurs, which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical effectiveness of the inventive vaccine under typical use conditions. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, fillers and diluents must, of course, have sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to make them suitable for administration to a person to be treated. Some examples of compounds which can be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, fillers or constituents thereof are sugars, such as, for example, lactose, glucose, trehalose and sucrose; starches, such as, for example, corn starch or potato starch; dextrose; cellulose and its derivatives, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; acid, magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as, for example, groundnut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil from theobroma; polyols, such as, for example, polypropylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid. The choice of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is determined, in principle, by the manner, in which the pharmaceutical composition or vaccine according to the invention is administered. The composition or vaccine can be administered, for example, systemically or locally. Routes for systemic administration in general include, for example, transdermal, oral, parenteral routes, including intraperitoneal injections and/or intranasal administration routes. Routes for local administration in general include, for example, topical administration routes but also intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, and sublingual injections. More preferably, composition or vaccines according to the present invention may be administered by an intradermal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route, preferably by injection, which may be needle-free and/or needle injection. Compositions/vaccines are therefore preferably formulated in liquid or solid form. The suitable amount of the vaccine or composition according to the invention to be administered can be determined by routine experiments, e.g. by using animal models. Such models include, without implying any limitation, rabbit, sheep, mouse, rat, dog and non-human primate models. Preferred unit dose forms for injection include sterile solutions of water, physiological saline or mixtures thereof. The pH of such solutions should be adjusted to a physiologically tolerable pH, such as about 7.4. Suitable carriers for injection include hydrogels, devices for controlled or delayed release, polylactic acid and collagen matrices. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for topical application include those which are suitable for use in lotions, creams, gels and the like. If the inventive composition or vaccine is to be administered perorally, tablets, capsules and the like are the preferred unit dose form. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for the preparation of unit dose forms which can be used for oral administration are well known in the prior art. The choice thereof will depend on secondary considerations such as taste, costs and storability, which are not critical for the purposes of the present invention, and can be made without difficulty by a person skilled in the art. The inventive vaccine or composition can additionally contain one or more auxiliary substances in order to further increase the immunogenicity. A synergistic action of the mRNA contained in the inventive composition and of an auxiliary substance, which may be optionally be co-formulated (or separately formulated) with the inventive vaccine or composition as described above, is preferably achieved thereby. Depending on the various types of auxiliary substances, various mechanisms may play a role in this respect. For example, compounds that permit the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), for example lipopolysaccharides, TNF-alpha or CD40 ligand, form a first class of suitable auxiliary substances. In general, it is possible to use as auxiliary substance any agent that influences the immune system in the manner of a \"danger signal\" (LPS, GP96, etc.) or cytokines, such as GM-CFS, which allow an immune response produced by the immune-stimulating adjuvant according to the invention to be enhanced and/or influenced in a targeted manner. Particularly preferred auxiliary substances are cytokines, such as monokines, lymphokines, interleukins or chemokines, that\u2014additional to induction of the adaptive immune response by the encoded at least one antigen\u2014promote the innate immune response, such as hGH. Preferably, such immunogenicity increasing agents or compounds are provided separately (not co-formulated with the inventive vaccine or composition) and administered individually. Further additives which may be included in the inventive vaccine or composition are emulsifiers, such as, for example, Tween; wetting agents, such as, for example, The inventive vaccine or composition can also additionally contain any further compound, which is known to be immune-stimulating due to its binding affinity (as ligands) class of compounds, which may be added to an inventive vaccine or composition in this context, may be CpG nucleic acids, in particular CpG-RNA or CpG-DNA. A CpG-RNA or (ds CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid is preferably in the form of CpG-RNA, more preferably in the form of single-stranded CpG-RNA (ss CpG-RNA). The CpG nucleic acid preferably contains at least one or more (mitogenic) cytosine/guanine dinucleotide sequence(s) (CpG motif(s)). According to a first preferred alternative, at least one CpG motif contained in these sequences, that is to say the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif, is unmethylated. All further cytosines or guanines optionally contained in these sequences can be either methylated or unmethylated. According to a further preferred alternative, however, the C (cytosine) and the G (guanine) of the CpG motif can also be present in methylated form.

Referring to General Reaction Scheme 1, compounds of structure A-1 can be purchased from commercial sources or prepared according to methods familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art. A mixture of A-1, A-2 and DMAP is treated with DCC to give the bromide A-3. A mixture of the bromide A-3, a base (e.g., N,N-diisopropylethylamine) and the N,N-dimethyldiamine A-4 is heated at a temperature and time sufficient to produce A-5 after any necessarily workup and or purification step. Other embodiments of the compound of Formula (I) (e.g., compound B-5) can be prepared according to General Reaction Scheme 2 (\"Method B\"), wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated C1-C24 alkyl or saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl, m is 0 or 1 and n is an integer from 1 to 24.

A solution of B-1 (1 equivalent) is treated with acid chloride B-2 (1 equivalent) and a base (e.g., triethylamine). The crude product is treated with an oxidizing agent (e.g., pyridinum chlorochromate) and intermediate product B-3 is recovered. A solution of crude B-3, an acid (e.g., acetic acid), and N,N-dimethylaminoamine B-4 is then treated with a reducing agent (e.g., sodium triacetoxyborohydride) to obtain B-5 after any necessary work up and/or purification. It should be noted that although starting materials A-1 and B-1 are depicted above as including only saturated methylene carbons, starting materials which include carbon-carbon double bonds may also be employed for preparation of compounds which include carbon-carbon double bonds. Different embodiments of the lipid of Formula (I) (e.g., compound C-7 or C9) can be prepared according to General Reaction Scheme 3 (\"Method C\"), wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated C1-C24 alkyl or saturated or unsaturated cycloalkyl, m is 0 or 1 and n is an integer from 1 to 24.

As illustrated in General Reaction Scheme 6, an appropriately protected ketone (F-1) is reacted under reductive amination F-4 yields acylated product F-5. Removal of the alcohol protecting group on F-5 followed by reaction with F-7 and/or F-8 and appropriate activating reagent (e.g., DCC) yields the desired compound F-9. General Reaction Scheme 7 provides an exemplary method (Method G) for preparation of Lipids of Formula (III). G1, G3, R1 and R3 in General Reaction Scheme 7 are as defined herein for Formula (III), and G1 refers to a one-carbon shorter homologue of G1. Compounds of structure G-1 are purchased or prepared according to methods known in the art. Reaction of G-1 with diol G-2 under appropriate condensation conditions (e.g., DCC) yields ester/alcohol G-3, which can then be oxidized (e.g., PCC) to aldehyde G-4. Reaction of G-4 with amine G-5 under reductive amination conditions yields a lipid of Formula (III). It should be noted that various alternative strategies for preparation of lipids of Formula (III) are available to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, other lipids of Formula (III) wherein L1 and L2 are other than ester can be prepared according to analogous methods using the appropriate starting material. Further, General Reaction Scheme 6 depicts preparation of lipids of Formula (III), wherein G1 and G2 are the same; however, this is not a required aspect of the invention and modifications to the above reaction scheme are possible to yield compounds wherein G1 and G2 are different. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described herein the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups.

Subsequently, the DNA plasmids are enzymatically linearized using EcoRI and transcribed in vitro using DNA dependent T7 RNA polymerase in vitro run-off transcription in the presence of a nucleotide mixture and CAP analog (m7GpppG) under suitable buffer conditions. The obtained mRNAs were purified using PureMessenger\u00ae (CureVac, T\u00fcbingen, Germany; WO2008/077592 A1) and were used for further experimentation. NHP were administered with RABV-G A as protamine formulation and RABV-G B as LNP formulation. Compositions comprising more than one mRNA encoding different Influenza proteins/antigens may also be produced according to procedures as disclosed in the PCT application PCT/EP2016/082487. Example LNP polymer conjugated lipids (PEG-lipid) were prepared and tested according to the general procedures described in PCT Pub. Nos. WO 2015/199952, WO 2017/004143 and WO 2017/075531, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-formulated mRNA was prepared using an ionizable amino lipid (cationic lipid), phospholipid, cholesterol and a PEGylated lipid. LNPs were prepared as follows. Cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol and PEG-lipid were solubilized in ethanol at a molar ratio of approximately 50:10:38.5:1.5 or 47.5:10:40.8:1.7. LNPs for the Examples included, for example, cationic lipid compound III-3 and the foregoing components. Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) comprising compound III-3 were prepared at a ratio of mRNA to Total Lipid of 0.03-0.04 w/w. Briefly, the mRNA was diluted to 0.05 to 0.2 mg/mL in 10 to 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4. Syringe pumps were used to mix the ethanolic lipid solution with the mRNA aqueous solution at a ratio of about 1:5 to 1:3 (vol/vol) with total flow rates above 15 ml/min. The ethanol was then removed and the external buffer replaced with PBS by dialysis. Finally, the lipid nanoparticles were filtered through a 0.2 m pore sterile filter. Lipid nanoparticle particle diameter size was 60-90 nm as determined by quasi-elastic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Malvern, UK). For other cationic lipid compounds mentioned in the present specification, the formulation process is similar.Example 2: Ppluc Expression after i.m. Application of LNP-Formulated mRNA of (Ppluc) 24h and 48h after intramuscular injection (i.m.) into the M. tibialis. Therefore, 0.1 pg, 1 g and 10 pg mRNA coding for Ppluc were LNP-formulated to yield the respective LNP-formulation according to Table I. As a control served unformulated Ppluc mRNA (10 pg and 1 g). At time point Oh, four mice per group were transfected with Ppluc mRNA in accordance with the scheme shown in table I. After 24h and 48h, in vivo bioluminescence imaging of mice was performed with an IVIS Lumina II Imaging System 10 minutes after intraperitoneal Luciferin injection, using an exposure time of 60s. Bioluminescence values were quantified by measuring photon flux (photons/second) in the region of interest. After 48 hours, mice were sacrificed and muscle, lung, liver, spleen, brain, kidney and heart were collected, shock frozen in dry ice and stored at 80\u00b0 C. for further analysis. Organ samples were lysed for 3 Minutes at full speed in a tissue lyser (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Afterwards 800 pl of lysis buffer were added and the resulting solutions were subjected another 6 minutes at full speed in the tissue lyser. After 10 minutes centrifugation at 13500 rpm at 4\u00b0 C. the supernatants were mixed with luciferin buffer (25 mM glycylglycin, 15 mM MgSO4, 5 mM ATP, 62.5 M luciferin) and luminescence was detected using a Chameleon plate reader (Hidex). Results: As can be seen in As shown in LNP formulated HA-mRNA was used for testing the immunogenicity after (i.m.) application. Specifically, a GC-enriched H1N1 (Netherlands 2009)-HA mRNA sequence as LNP formulation was applied as described above. For vaccination, 8 BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected into the M. tibialis of both legs (25 pl per leg) according to the vaccination scheme shown in Table II. As apparent, 10 pg mRNA encoding Influenza HA was LNP-formulated (as described above) to yield the respective LNP-formulation for vaccination; unformulated mRNA (10 pg) served as a control. On day 0, a prime vaccination was administered. Animals vaccinated with buffer served as negative control. On day 21, a blood sample was collected from the retrobulbar sinus and a boost vaccination was administered. After 35 days, the mice were sacrificed and blood and organ samples (spleen) were collected for further analysis. Splenocytes were isolated at day 35 and stimulated with an HA peptide library for T cell analysis. For immunogenicity assays, Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were analyzed in the sera 3 weeks after prime and 2 weeks after boost. Frequencies of activated, HA-specific, multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (IFN-+/TNF+) were measured by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. ELISA Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay: Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers. Mouse sera were heat inactivated (56\u00b0 C., 30 min), incubated with kaolin (Carl Roth, Germany) and pre-adsorbed to chicken red blood cells (CRBC; Lohmann Tierzucht, Germany). pl of 2-fold dilutions of sera were incubated for 45 min 4 hemagglutination units (HAU) of inactivated Influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus and 50p1 0.5% CRBC was added. HI titers were determined by the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum able to inhibit hemagglutination. ELISA: Detection of an antigen-specific immune response (B-cell immune response) was carried out by detecting influenza specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. Therefore, blood samples were taken from the vaccinated mice 21 days post prime and 14 days post boost and sera were prepared. MaxiSorb plates (Nalgene Nunc International) were coated with the inactivated virus. After blocking with 1\u00d7PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA the plates were incubated with diluted mouse serum (as indicated). Subsequently a biotin-coupled secondary antibody (anti-mouse-IgG1 and IgG2a, Pharmingen) was added. After washing, the plate was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and subsequently the conversion of the substrate acid) was measured. Intracellular Cytokine Staining: Induction of antigen-specific T cells was determined days after boost using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Splenocytes from vaccinated and control mice were isolated and stimulated with an HA peptide library (PepMix Influenza A (HA/California (H1N1)), JPT) and anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) for 6 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in the presence of the GolgiPlug containing protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). After stimulation, cells were washed and stained for intracellular cytokines using the Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibodies were used Dye was used to distinguish live/dead cells (Invitrogen). Cells were acquired using a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Therefore, 8 mice per group were each vaccinated intradermally according to the vaccination scheme shown in Table III. As apparent, 10 pg HA-mRNA was LNP-formulated (as described above) to yield the respective LNP-formulation for the vaccination; unformulated HA mRNA (10 pg) served as a control. At time point 0 days, a prime vaccination was administered to 8 mice per group. On day 21, a blood sample was collected and a boost vaccination was administered. After 35 days, the mice were sacrificed and blood and organ samples (spleen) were collected for further analysis. For immunogenicity assays, the HI titer was measured. ELISA was applied for determining antibody titers. Further, CD4 T cell immune response (IFN/TNF producing CD4 T cells) and CD8 T cell immune response (IFN/TNF producing CD8 T cells and CD107+ IFN producing CD8 T cells) was assessed 14 days after boost vaccination.

Results: Results Immunogenicity Assays: 1 g LNP-formulated, induced HI titers above the threshold of 1:40 already after prime vaccination as apparent from Results ELISA Assays: 1 g HA-mRNA, LNP-formulated, induced significantly higher functional antibody titers, both IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, when compared to non-formulated mRNA already after a single i.m. injection (see Results T Cell Assays: 1 g HA-mRNA, LNP-formulated, led to increased IFN production compared to non-formulated mRNA. The medium control as expected never generated a response (see The rabies mRNA vaccine encoded the glycoprotein (RABV-G) of the accession number: AAA47218.1). Optimized mRNA constructs (RABV-G A and B) were used, which contain identical ORFs but different UTRs. The protamine-formulated RABV-G mRNA vaccines contained RABV-G mRNA B (as described above) if not otherwise indicated. Protamine RNA Formulation For the preparation of protamine complexed mRNA (\"RNActive\u00ae formulation\"), the obtained antigen mRNA constructs complexed with protamine prior to use in in vivo vaccination experiments. The mRNA complexation consists of a mixture of 50% free mRNA and 50% mRNA complexed with protamine at a weight ratio of 2:1. First, mRNA was complexed with protamine by addition of protamine-Ringer's lactate solution to mRNA. After incubation for 10 minutes, when the complexes were stably generated, free mRNA was added, and the final concentration of the vaccine was adjusted with Ringer's lactate solution. LNP formulated HA-mRNA and RABV-G mRNA vaccines as prepared in the previous example were used for vaccination. Four nulliparous and nonpregnant cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were vaccinated by intramuscular injection at days 1 and 29 with LNP-III-3-formulated HA-mRNA or RABV-G mRNA (1 pg or 10 pg, as described above) or protamine-formulated HA-mRNA or RABV-G mRNA (240 pg) into the biceps femoris muscle (500 l). As negative control buffer was injected. Serum samples were collected from the femoral vein on days 0, 29 and 50. Detection of an antigen-specific immune response was carried out on days 0, 29 and 50. Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers. Non-human at C. overnight, inactivated (56\u00b0 C., 60 min) and incubated with kaolin. 50 pl of 2-fold dilutions of pre-treated sera were incubated for 45 min 4 hemagglutination units (HAU) of inactivated Influenza A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus (NIBSC, UK) and 50 pl 0.5% CRBC was added. HI titers were determined by the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum able to IgG A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) for coating (1 pg/ml) and were GmbH, Germany, using the FAVN test (Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization test) and the Standard Challenge Virus CVS-11 according to WHO protocol. Cytokine Analysis: Blood samples of NHPs were collected on days 1 and 29 for HA immunization and day 1 for RABV-G immunization from all NHPs prior to administration and 6 and 24 hours after dosing to determine inflammation using the Luminex-based PRCYTOMAG-40K kit (MD MILLIPORE). Body Temperature: Body temperature of NHPs was determined by rectal measurement right before and at 0.5, 2, 6 and 24 hours after each dose. Results: As a general result, a single intramuscular administration of a 1 g mRNA dose, LNP-III-3-formulated, surprisingly induced protective antibody titers in all vaccinated non-human primates in the two indications rabies and influenza. Results Antibody Titer Analysis: The results from the neutralizing antibody titer analysis are shown in Results Rabies Virus Neutralizing Titers (VNTs): As shown in Results HI-Titer: LNP-III-3-formulated HA-mRNA led to very high HI titers already after prime vaccination as apparent from Animals which received 1 g of LNP-III-3-formulated HA-mRNA required a second vaccination to reach the protective titer in 3 of 4 animals, while none of the animals receiving 240 pg protamine-formulated HA-mRNA exhibited detectable HI titers. Results Cytokine Analysis: Systemic cytokine concentrations after vaccination with LNP-III-3-formulated mRNA stayed below detection level for IL-13, IL 4, IL-5, IL-6, IFN- and TNF increase for IL-2, IL-8 and G-CSF Importantly, TNF, and IL-6 were induced by LNP-formulations compared to protamine-formulations, which are generally well tolerated in humans. Results Body Temperature-Results and Other Results: Intramuscular application of LNP-III-3-formulated mRNA in non-human primates showed no impact on body temperature or the body weight [data not shown]. Injection sites showed only slight erythema and/or edema in 1 of 4 animals in each group receiving the LNP-III-3-formulated HA-mRNA, which resolved 24 to 96 hours after injection and no injection site reactions after vaccination with the RABV-G-mRNA formulations [data not shown]. In summary, the LNP-III-3-formulated by NHPs.Example 7: Application of Low mRNA The amount of 0.5 pg LNP-formulated RABV-G-mRNA was used for testing the immunogenicity after intramuscular (i.m.) application. The sequence which was used is shown in SEQ ID NO: 224276. Therefore, BALB/c mice were each vaccinated according to the vaccination scheme shown in Table Va intramuscularly in one leg. Unformulated RABV-G mRNA (40 pg) served as a control. At time point 0 days, a prime vaccination was administered to 8 mice per group and a blood samples was taken one day later. On day 21, a blood sample was collected and a boost vaccination was administered. Prime and boost vaccinations were performed in different legs, i.e. left and right leg, respectively. After 35 days, the mice were sacrificed and blood and organ samples (spleen and liver) were collected for further analysis. For immunogenicity assays, the VNT was measured as described before, i.e. anti-rabies virus neutralizing titers (VNTs) in serum were GmbH, Germany, using the FAVN test (Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralization test) and the Standard Challenge Virus CVS-11 according to WHO protocol. CD4 T cell immune response (IFN/TNF producing CD4 T cells) and CD8 T cell immune response (IFN/TNF producing CD8 T cells and CD107+ IFN producing CD8 T cells) were assessed. Assays were performed as described before. Histology of liver specimens from animals vaccinated with 5 pg LNP or buffer controls was examined. Serum levels of ALT/AST were examined in serum samples taken d1 and d21. AST/ALT and liver were analyzed by mfd GmbH, Germany. Results: Results Rabies Virus Neutralizing Titers (VNTs): As shown in As VNT-levels of As proven in Results: Results T Cell Assays: T cell responses were observed in mice immunized twice with 5 pg, 1 g and 0.5 pg as apparent from Results Liver Damage Analysis: Histology of RABV-G LNP 5 pg mRNA and buffer administered control animals was performed. No pathological findings observed in any of the tested animals. AST levels were increased on day 1 post vaccination with the highest dose of LNPs (5 pg) but decreased over time and returned to background levels on day 21 (see For vaccination 9 mice per group were intramuscularly injected twice with a composition comprising LNP formulated mRNA encoding HA of 4 four mRNAs were mixed in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 and then formulated as described above. As control, Fluarix Quadrivalent 2015-2016 was injected, a split virus vaccine comprising 4 different inactivated influenza virus strains (A/California/7/2009, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, B/Phuket/3073/2013, and B/Brisbane/60/2008) indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses. As negative control Ringer lactate buffer was injected. Detection of an HA-specific immune response (B-cell immune response) was carried out by detecting IgG2a antibodies directed against the particular influenza virus. Therefore, blood samples were taken from the vaccinated mice three weeks after vaccination and sera were prepared. MaxiSorb plates (Nalgene Nunc International) were coated with the particular recombinant HA protein. After blocking with 1\u00d7PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA the plates were incubated with diluted mice serum (as indicated). Subsequently a biotin-coupled secondary antibody (anti-mouse-IgG2a, Pharmingen) was added. After washing, the plate was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin, followed by addition of the Amplex UltraRed Reagent (Invitrogen) and subsequent quantification of the fluorescent product. Results: The results shown in These data proof that mRNA encoded antigens e.g. of different influenza viruses can be combined in one composition/vaccine. In contrast to Fluarix, the LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA multivalent vaccine induced IgG2a antibody responses in na\u00efve animals against all subtypes and the low dose of mRNA was immunogenic in mice surprisingly after single intramuscular injection.Example 9: Vaccination Experiment with a Combination of mRNAs Encoding HA and NA of Different Influenza Viruses For vaccination 8 mice per group are intramuscularly injected with a composition comprising LNP formulated mRNA encoding HA of 4 different (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008.

As negative control Ringer lactate buffer is injected. Detection of an HA-specific immune response (B-cell immune response) is carried out by detecting IgG2a antibodies directed against the particular influenza virus as described above. NA-specific immune responses (B-cell immune response) directed against the particular influenza virus are determined using NA inhibition assay (NAI).Example 10: Synthesis of Compound I-3 A solution of 6-(2-hexyldecanoyloxy)hexan-1-al (2.4 g), acetic acid (0.33 g) and 4-aminobutan-1-ol (0.23 g) in methylene chloride (20 mL) was treated with sodium triacetoxyborohydride (1.3 g) for two hours. The solution was washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed. The residue was passed down a silica gel column using a methanol/methylene chloride (0-8/100-92%) gradient, yielding compound 3 as a colorless oil (0.4 g).Example 11: Synthesis of a Representative PEG Lipid Pegylated lipid IVa (\"PEG-DMA\") was prepared wherein n approximates the center of the range of ethylene oxide repeating units in the pegylated lipid. Synthesis of IVa-1 and IVa-2: To a solution of myristic acid (6 g, 26 mmol) in toluene (50 mL) was added oxalyl chloride (39 mmol, 1.5 equivalents, 5 g) at RT. Accordingly, 39 mmol of oxalyl chloride is 1.5 molar equivalents relative to the starting material myristic acid (26 mmoles\u00d71.5=39 mmoles). After the resulting mixture was heated at 70\u00b0 C. for 2h, the mixture was concentrated. The residue was taken up in toluene and concentrated again. The residual oil was added via a syringe to a concentrated ammonia solution (20 mL) at 10\u00b0 C. The reaction mixture was filtered and washed with water. The white solid was dried in vacuo. The desired product was obtained as a white solid (3.47 g, 15 mmol, 58.7%). Synthesis of IVa-3: To suspension of 20-2 (3.47 g, 15 mmol) in THF (70 mL) was added in portions of lithium aluminium hydride (1.14 g, 30 mmol) at RT during 30 min period of time. Then the mixture was heated to reflux gently (oil bath at 65\u00b0 C.) overnight. The mixture was cooled to 5\u00b0 C. and sodium sulphate 9 hydrate was added. The mixture was stirred for 2h, filtered through a layer of celite, washed with 15% of MeOH in DCM (200 mL). The filtrate and washings were combined and concentrated. The residual solid was dried in vacuo. The desired product was obtained as a white solid (2.86 g 13.4 mmol, 89.5%). Synthesis of IVa-4: To a solution of myristic acid (3.86 g, 16.9 mmol) in benzene (40 mL) and DMF (1 drop) was added oxalyl chloride (25.35 mmol, 1.5 25.35 mmol of oxalyl chloride is 1.5 molar equivalents relative to the starting material myristic acid (16.9 mmol\u00d71.5=25.35 mmol). The mixture was stirred at RT for 1.5h. Heated at 60\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The mixture was concentrated. The residue was taken up in toluene and concentrated again. The residual oil (light yellow) was taken in 20 mL of benzene and added via syringe to a solution of 20-3 (2.86 g 13.4 mmol) and triethylamine (3.53 mL, 1.5 equivalents) in benzene (40 mL) at 10\u00b0 C. Accordingly, 3.53 mL of triethylamine is 1.5 molar equivalents with respect to the 13.4 mmol of 20-3 i.e. a 50% molar excess of this reagent compared to the starting material for this step. After addition, the resulting mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and was adjusted to pH 6-7 with 20% H2SO4. The mixture was filtered and washed with water. A pale solid was obtained. The crude product was recrystallized from methanol. This gave the desired product as an off-white solid (5.65 g, 13 mmol, 100%). Synthesis of IVa-5: suspension of 20-4 (5.65 g, 13 mmol) in THF (60 mL) was added in portions lithium aluminium hydride (0.99 g, 26 mmol) at RT during 30 min period of time. Then the mixture was heated to reflux gently overnight. The mixture was cooled to 0\u00b0 C. and sodium sulphate 9 hydrate. The mixture was stirred for 2h, then filtered through a pad of celite and silica gel and washed with ether first. The filtrate turned cloudy and precipitation formed. Filtration gave a white solid. The solid was recrystallized from MeOH and a colorless crystalline solid (2.43 g). The pad of celite and silica gel was then washed 5% of MeOH in DCM (400 mL) and then 10% of MeOH in DCM with 1% of triethylamine (300 mL). The fractions containing the desired product were combined and concentrated. A white solid was obtained. The solid was recrystalized from MeOH and a colorless crystalline solid (0.79 g). The above two solids (2.43 g and 0.79 g) were combined and dried vacuo (3.20 g, 60%). 1HNMR Iva: To a solution of 20-5 (7 mmol, 2.87 g) and triethylamine (30 mmol, 4.18 mL) in DCM (100 mL) was added a solution of mPEG-NHS (from NOF, 5.0 mmol, 9.97 g, PEG MW approx. 2,000, n=about 45) in DCM (120 mL,). After 24h the reaction solution was washed with water (300 mL). The aqueous phase was extracted twice with DCM (100 mL\u00d72). DCM extracts were combined, washed with brine (100 mL). The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated partially. The concentrated solution (ca 300 mL) was cooled at approximately 15 C. Filtration gave a white solid (1.030 g, the unreacted starting amine). To the filtration was added Et3N (1.6 mmol, 0.222 mL, 4 equivalents) and acetic anhydride (1.6 mmol, 164 mg). The mixture was stirred at RT for 3h and then concentrated to a solid. The residual solid was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (0-8% methanol in DCM). This gave the desired product as a white solid (9.211 g). 1HNMR (CDCl3 with a Combination of LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding HA of Different Influenza Viruses Female BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccine compositions with doses, application routes and vaccination schedules as indicated in Table A (mRNA sequences according to Example 1). As a negative control, one group of mice was injected with buffer (ringer lactate, Rila). As a positive control, one group of mice was vaccinated with an approved Influenza vaccine (Influsplit\u00ae tetra 2016/2017; A/California/07/2009, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, B/Brisbane/60/2008, B/Phuket/3073/2013). All animals were injected with the respective composition on day 0 and day 21. Blood samples were collected on day 21, 35, and 49 for the determination of binding antibody titers (using ELISA) and blocking antibody titers (using a HI assay). T cell responses were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using splenocytes isolated on day 49. Detailed descriptions of the performed experiments are provided below. 12.1. Determination of Anti HA Protein Specific IgG1 and IgG2a Antibodies by ELISA: ELISA assay was performed essentially as commonly known in the art, or as described above. ELISA was performed for each antigen comprised in the mRNA vaccine composition (as indicated in Table A). Results are shown in 12.2. Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HI): In a 96-well plate, the mixed with HA H1N1 antigen (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1); NIBSC) or HA blood cells (4% erythrocytes; Lohmann Tierzucht). In the presence of HA neutralizing antibodies, an inhibition of hemagglutination of erythrocytes can be observed. The lowest level of titered serum that resulted in a visible inhibition of hemagglutination was the assay result. The results are shown in 12.3. Detection of T-Cell Responses: Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were isolated according to a standard protocol known in the art. Briefly, isolated spleens were grinded through a cell strainer and washed in PBS/1% FBS followed by red blood cell lysis. After an extensive washing step with PBS/1% FBS splenocytes were seeded into 96-well plates (2\u00d7106 cells per well). The cells were stimulated with a pool of overlapping 15mer peptides of H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) for determining CD8+ T-cell responses or they were stimulated with recombinant HA protein for determining CD4+ T-cell responses. After stimulation, cells were washed and stained for intracellular cytokines using the Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The diluted 1:100. Aqua Dye was used to distinguish live/dead cells (Invitrogen). Cells were acquired using a Canto II flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo software package (Tree Star, Inc.). Results for CD4+ T-cells are shown in Results: The data shows that IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies could be detected after vaccination with the LNP formulated mRNA combination vaccines. Notably, for all mRNA encoded antigens comprised in the respective combination, specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies could be detected demonstrating that all mRNAs comprised in the respective compositions are translated into protein and trigger a humoral immune response in mice as shown in Functional neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated for H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) and H3N2 (A/HongKong/4801/2014) (see Overall, the data demonstrates that LNP formulated mRNA based combination vaccines for HA antigens derived from different influenza viruses (A types and B types) induce strong and durable humoral immune responses and T-cell mediated cellular immune responses.Example 13: Vaccination Experiment with a Combination of LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding HA of Different Influenza Viruses Female BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccine compositions with doses, application routes and vaccination schedules as indicated in Table B (mRNA Sequences according to Example 1). As a negative control, one group of mice was injected with buffer (ringer lactate, Rila).). As a positive control, one group of mice was vaccinated with an approved Influenza vaccine (Fluarix\u00ae; A/California/07/2009, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, B/Brisbane/60/2008, B/Phuket/3073/2013). All animals were vaccinated on day 0 and day 21. Blood samples were collected on day 21, 35, and 49 for the determination of binding antibody titers (using ELISA), blocking antibody titers (using a HI assay) and the determination of virus neutralizing titers (VNTs). T cell responses were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using splenocytes isolated on day 49. Detailed descriptions of the performed experiments are provided below. 13.1. Determination of Anti HA Protein Specific IgG1 and IgG2a Antibodies by ELISA: ELISA assay was performed essentially as commonly known in the art, or as described above. ELISA was performed for each antigen comprised in the mRNA vaccine composition (as indicated in Table B). Results are shown in Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were isolated according to a standard protocol known in the art. ICS experiment was performed essentially as described in Example 12. Results for CD4+ T-cells are shown in Results: The data shows that IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies could be detected after vaccination with the LNP formulated mRNA combination vaccines. Notably, for all mRNA encoded antigens comprised in the respective combination, specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies could be detected demonstrating that all mRNAs comprised in the respective compositions are translated into protein and trigger a humoral immune response in mice as shown in Functional neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated for H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) and H3N2 (A/HongKong/4801/2014) (see Overall, the data demonstrates that LNP formulated mRNA based combination vaccines for HA antigens derived from different influenza viruses (A types and B types) induce strong and durable humoral immune responses and T-cell mediated cellular immune responses.Example 14: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNA Encoding Neuraminidase Influenza immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccine compositions with doses, application routes and vaccination schedules as indicated in Table C (mRNA Sequences according to Example 1). As a negative control, one group of mice was injected with buffer (ringer lactate, Rila). As positive control, one group of mice were vaccinated on day 0 and day 21. Blood samples were collected on day 21, 35, and 49 for determination of immune responses. T cell responses were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using splenocytes isolated on day 49. 14.1. Determination of Immune Responses for N1 NA (A/California/7/2009): Functional NA-specific antibodies were analyzed using an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), essentially performed as previously described in the art. ELLA was performed in 96 well plates coated with a large glycoprotein substrate fetuin. NA cleaves terminal sialic acids from fetuin, exposing the penultimate sugar, galactose. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) is a lectin with specificity for galactose and therefore the extent of desialylation can be quantified using a PNA-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, followed by addition of a chromogenic peroxidase substrate. The optical density that is measured is proportional to NA activity. To measure functional NA inhibiting (NI) antibody titers, serial dilutions of sera were incubated on fetuin-coated plates with A/California/7/2009(H1N1) virus (pre-treated with Triton-X-100). The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that results in >50% inhibition of NA activity is designated as the NI antibody titer. The result is shown in To determine T-cell responses, an ICS experiment was performed, essentially as outlined above. Cells were stimulated with NA specific peptide mixture and CD8+ T-cell responses and CD4+ T-cell responses were determined. The results are shown in Results: As shown in As shown in F*-mRNA corresponds to a fluorescently labeled PpLuc mRNA (60%-UTP-40%-5-Aminoallyl-UTP) which cannot be translated into a protein due to the labeling (SEQ ID NO: 224286). The activation of the innate immune system is required to mount efficacious adaptive immune responses after vaccination. Therefore, the inventive LNP-III-3-formulated mRNA according to the invention was tested for their potency to (transiently) induce pro-inflammatory mice. pg non-formulated (mRNA) or LNP-formulated RABV-G-mRNA (mRNA/LNP), or with buffer control. dLNs serum samples were isolated 4h, 14h, after i.m. application and cytokine chemokine content was measured in protein lysates and sera by Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). The results are shown in To elucidate whether the pro-inflammatory environment translates into activation and changes in the composition of immune cells, the number and activation status of leukocytes in the dLNs was analyzed. To ensure that any observed effect was independent of the mRNA-encoded protein, a fluorescently labeled mRNA that cannot be translated (F*-mRNA) was used. BALB/c mice (n=3/group) were injected i.m. in both legs with 10 pg non-formulated (F*mRNA) or LNP-formulated F*mRNA (F*mRNA/LNP), or with buffer. dLNs were isolated 4h, 24h and 48h after i.m. application and analyzed separately by flow cytometry. Numbers of each cell population (50A) and frequency of activated immune cells (50B) in the dLNs are shown in Results: As shown in As shown in As shown in Taken together, these results suggest that i.m. injection of LNP-formulated mRNA vaccines induces a broad but transient local immunostimulatory milieu, which is relevant for the induction of strong adaptive immune responses.Example 16: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding Rabies Virus Antigen in Non-Human Primates LNP-III-3 formulated RABV-G mRNA vaccines as prepared in the previous example were used for vaccination. Studies with cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were conducted at Envigo CRS, S.A.U., Santa Perp\u00e8tua de Mogoda, Spain. Animals were of Vietnamese origin, bred in captivity, nulliparous and not pregnant. Animals had at treatment start an age of 2.5 to 3.5 years and a body weight of 2.2-3.3 kg. NHPs were vaccinated i.m. at days 0 and 28 into the biceps femoris muscle with a single dose of 500 pl. Vaccination with the licensed human rabies vaccine Rabipur\u00ae (Novartis) was performed i.m. in NHPs with the full human dose according to the pre-exposure prophylaxis schedule on days 0, 7, and 28 or on a reduced schedule on days 0 and 28. VNTs of vaccinated monkeys were analyzed as described above. T-cell responses (CD 4+ and CD8+) were analyzed as described above. The results are shown in Results: Example 17: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding Influenza H1N1 or Influenza H3N2 A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) vaccine as described in the previous example were used for vaccination. Studies with cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were conducted at Envigo CRS, S.A.U., Santa Perp\u00e8tua de Mogoda, Spain. Animals were of Vietnamese origin, bred in captivity, nulliparous and not pregnant. Animals had at treatment start an age of 2.5 to 3.5 years and a body weight of 2.2-3.3 kg. NHPs were vaccinated with 10 pg of either the H1N1-HA or the H3N2-HA vaccine and measured functional antibodies against the respective viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. As control, a group of animals was vaccinated with a full human dose of Fluad\u00ae. Na\u00efve NHPs were vaccinated i.m. with 10 pg of either the H1N1-HA or the H3N2-HA vaccine at days 0 and 28 into the biceps femoris muscle with a single dose of 500 pl. Functional antibodies against the respective viruses were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. The results are shown in Results: Example 18: Vaccination Experiment with a Combination of mRNAs Encoding Different Influenza Antigens in Non-Human Primates Non-human primates (NHPs) are immunized (6 animals per group) with LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccines with doses, application routes and vaccination schedules as indicated in Table D (mRNA Sequences preferably according to Example 1). As vaccines, an mRNA composition comprising four HA antigens is used (\"tetravalent HA\") or an mRNA composition comprising HA, three NA; heptavalent or \"septavalent HA+NA\") is used. All animals are vaccinated on day 0 and day 28. Blood samples are collected on day 0, 14, 28, 56, 77, and 84 for determination of antibody responses. T cell responses are analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using isolated splenocytes. Analysis of immune responses performed essentially as described above (ELLA, HI assay, ELISA, ICS, VNTs). To demonstrate safety and efficiency of the Influenza mRNA vaccine composition, a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (phase I) is initiated. For clinical development, GMP-grade RNA is produced using an established GMP process, implementing various 5 quality controls on DNA level and RNA level as described in detail in WO 2016/180430 A1. In the clinical trial, human volunteers (adult subjects, 18-45 years of age) are intramuscularly (i.m.) injected for at least two times with an mRNA composition comprising one mRNA coding for one influenza antigen as specified herein (\"monovalent\", H3N2 A/Hong Kong/4801/2014), or with an mRNA HA influenza antigens as specified herein (\"tetravalent HA\"), or with an mRNA composition comprising four HA and three NA influenza antigens as specified herein(\"septavalent HA+NA\") or with an mRNA composition comprising multiple HA and multiple NA influenza antigens as specified herein (\"multivalent HA+NA\"). In addition, a group of elderly volunteers is treated (elderly adults >65 years of age). The design of the studies is indicated in Tables E-H below. In order to assess the safety profile of the Influenza vaccine compositions according to the invention, subjects are monitored after administration (vital signs, vaccination site tolerability assessments, hematologic analysis). The efficacy of the immunization is analysed by determination of HI-titers and ELLA assay. Blood samples are collected on day 0 as baseline and after completed vaccination. Sera are analyzed for functional antibodies (HI assay, ELLA, VNTs (FAVN test)). In addition, a RFFIT assay is performed to analyze the presence of early VNTs using the rapid fluorescent foci inhibition test using the cell culture-adapted challenge virus strain CVS 11 as recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health. In brief, heat-inactivated sera are tested in serial two-fold dilutions for their potential to neutralize a 100 tissue culture infectious dose 50% of CVS. Sera dilutions are incubated with virus for about 70 min at 37\u00b0 C. (in a water-jacket incubator with 5% CO2). 30,000 BHK-21 cells are added per well. Infected cell cultures are incubated for 22 hours at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2. Cells are fixed using 80% acetone/20% PBS at 20\u00b0 C. for 10 min and stained using FITC-conjugated anti-rabies globulin. Plates are washed twice using PBS and excess of PBS is removed. Cell cultures are scored positive or negative for the presence of rabies virus detected by FITC-positive signals. Negative scored cells in sera treated wells represent neutralization of rabies virus. Each RFFIT test includes WHO or OIE standard serum (positive reference serum), which serves as reference for standardisation of the assay. Neutralization activity of test sera is calculated with reference to the standard serum provided by the WHO and displayed as International Units/ml (IU/ml). Furthermore, a subset of healthy subjects is challenged with live Influenza virus or placebo by oral administration. Subjects are followed post-challenge for symptoms of Influenza associated illness, infection and immune responses.Example 20: Stability of LNPs (LNP-III-3) Stored at 5\u00b0 C. for 3 Months To compare immunogenicity and reactogenicity of LNP-III-3 formulated RABV-G mRNA stored at 5\u00b0 C. for 3 months, immunogenicity was assessed by determining humoral responses, including functional antibodies and cellular immune responses two weeks post boost vaccination (see Table J). RABV-G-specific antibody titers were determined by Virus Neutralization Assay as described above. As apparent from The aim of this example was to evaluate the toxicity of the inventive LNPs (LNP-III-3). To this end, several in vivo toxicity studies were carried out in different animal models (e.g. mice, rats, or rabbits) with different mRNA doses (f.e. 1 g, 10 pg, 40 pg, 100 pg, or 200 pg). The results showed that the inventive LNPs showed no significant toxicity in vivo, evidenced by analysis of local reactions, pain, food consumption, body weight, organ weight, clinical chemistry (i.e. no adverse test substance related changes observed) and hematology (i.e. no adverse test substance related changes observed). Only minor local reactions like erythemas and edemas, i.e. normal reactions to vaccines which usually occur within 1-3 days, were found in a minority of the animals vaccinated with e.g. 10 pg and 100 pg.Example 22: Vaccination Experiment with a Combination of LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding HA of Different Influenza Viruses in mRNA vaccine\" (see Table K). Respective mRNA sequences according to Example 1. As a positive control, one group of ferrets was vaccinated with an approved Influenza vaccine (Fluad\u00ae tetra 2016/2017). All animals were injected with the respective composition on day 0 and day 21. Blood samples were collected on day 0, 21, 35, and 49 for the determination of blocking antibody titers for each encoded antigen (using a HI assay as described above and MN assay). The results are shown in Results: As shown in Overall, the results demonstrate that the herein used tetravalent mRNA vaccine induces functional antibody responses for all four antigens. Moreover, the antibody responses were comparable to those observed for the approved vaccine Fluad, showing the enormous potential of the inventive LNP-formulated vaccine.Example 23: Challenge Vaccination Experiment with a Combination of LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding HA of Different Influenza Viruses in formulated tetravalent mRNA vaccine of Example 22. As a positive control, groups are vaccinated with Fluad\u00ae tetra 2016/2017. As negative control, groups are injected with placebo. For each group, 6 animals are treated (\"immunization phase\" in Table L). To simulate a past season infection with influenza virus, some groups are also infected prior to the vaccination experiment with influenza virus. Group 5-8 are infected with H3N2 A/Fukui/20/2004 virus and group 13-16 were infected with B/Massachusetts/2/2012 Yamagata lineage (see \"prime phase\" in Table L) After immunization, ferrets are challenged intratracheal with influenza virus. Group 5-8 were challenged with HA A/Netherlands/602/2009 virus and group 13-16 were challenged with B/Brisbane/60/2008 Victoria lineage (see \"challenge phase\" in Table L). Day 1-3 post virus challenge ferrets are analysed for virus load (nose, throat, swabs) and health parameters (fever, body weight). 4 days after virus challenge, animals are euthanized and analysed for immune responses (HI titers, IgG, Mn etc). As exemplarily shown in Example 14, LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA encoding neuraminidase induces strong and effective immune responses. In the present example, a trivalent mRNA composition comprising mRNA encoding NA of encoding NA Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) and encoding encoding NA of Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 was vaccinated (herein referred to as \"Trivalent NA mRNA vaccine\"). Respective mRNA sequences according to Example 1 Female BALB/c mice were injected at day 0 and day 21 with a trivalent NA mRNA vaccine, Influsplit Tetra (2016/2017) as positive control or a buffer control (RiLa) according to a regimen as provided in Table M below. Serum samples were taken for the determination of specific antibody titers (ELLA assay, performed according to Example 14). Results of the ELLA assay are shown in Results: As shown in As exemplarily shown in the Examples above, LNP-III-3 formulated tetravalent HA mRNA vaccines and trivalent NA mRNA vaccines induce strong and effective immune responses for each encoded antigen. In the present example, an LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA composition encoding three different NA antigens (mRNA encoding NA of Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), of Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2) and mRNA encoding encoding NA of Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 was vaccinated) and four different HA antigens (mRNA encoding HA of Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1), of Influenza A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 mRNA encoding HA of Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 and mRNA encoding encoding HA of Influenza B) was vaccinated (herein referred to as \"septavalent HA/NA mRNA vaccine\"). Respective mRNA sequences according to Example 1. Female BALB/c mice were injected i.m. at day 0 and day 21 with LNP-III-3 formulated tetravalent HA mRNA vaccine, LNP-III-3 LNP-III-3 formulated septavalent HA/NA mRNA vaccine. As positive control, one group of mice was injected with Influsplit Tetra\u00ae 2016/2017. As negative control, one group of mice was injected with RiLa buffer.

Example 26: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding Ebola GP In the present example, the inventive mRNA LNP-III-3 formulation was compared with an established mRNA vaccine format (Protamine formulation; see Example 6) using mRNA encoding glycoprotein GP of Ebola virus (ZEBOV GP Sierra Leone 2014). Protamine formulation of mRNA encoding GP of Ebola virus (SEQ ID NO: 224362) as described in Example 6. LNP formulation of mRNA encoding GP of Ebola virus (SEQ ID NO: 224362) as described above. Immunogenicity of Ebola GP mRNA Vaccine in Mice: Female BALB/c mice were injected at day 0 and day 21 with a LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA encoding GP of Ebola virus (RNA ID \"R3875\"; intramuscular (i.m.)) or protamine formulated mRNA encoding GP of Ebola virus (RNA ID \"R3875\"; intradermal (i.d.)). As negative control, one group of mice was injected with RiLa buffer. Serum samples for the analysis of IgG endpoint titers (ELISA) were collected at day 35. ELISA was performed using recombinant ZEBOV Mayinga GP protein (lacking the transmembrane domain) for coating. ELISA results are shown in Results: Example 27: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated mRNAs Encoding H3N2 Administered Subcutaneously As described in the previous examples, LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccines induce strong and effective immune responses when administered intramuscularily or intradermally (e.g. see Example 4). To evaluate the effectivity of the inventive vaccine format for other suitable administration routes, sub-cutaneous injection was tested. Non-human primates (Macaca fascicularis) were Kong/4801/2014 H3N2 (mRNA sequences to Example 1). Three groups were vaccinated subcutaneously (sc) with different vaccine doses (10 pg, 50 pg, 100 pg) and one control group was vaccinated intramuscularily. HI titers at day 0, day 28, day 49 and day 70 were determined as described herein. Results of the experiment are shown in Results: As shown in For vaccination 9 mice (C57 BL/6) per group were intradermally injected 3 times within 3 weeks with 1 g LNP formulated Ova mRNA (Component A) and 32 pg protamine formulated Ova mRNA (Component B), as negative control RiLa was injected (see Table Q). Levels of circulating antigen-specific CD8 positive T cells were measured with OVA-specific dextramers (bind to antigen specific T cell receptors of CD8 positive cells) at day 7 and 21. 1 g LNP formulated Ova mRNA (Component A) vaccine induces high and boostable levels of circulating antigen-specific CD8 positive T cells after intradermal application (see Levels of multifunctional antigen-specific CD8 positive T cells (IFN/TNF) were measured by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Therefore splenocytes were isolated from the vaccinated mice one week after the last vaccination and CD8 positive T cells were stimulated with OVA specific peptides (SIINFEKL and TEWTSSNVMEERKIKV) (see Detection of B-cell immune responses was carried out by detecting OVA-specific IgG2c titers. Therefore, serum samples were taken from the vaccinated mice one week after the last vaccination and analyzed by ELISA. 1 g of LNP-formulated OVA-mRNA vaccine leads to increased OVA-specific IgG2c titers after intradermal application compare to protamine formulated Ova mRNA (see The results demonstrate that the inventive LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccine format is suitable to induce anti-tumor responses in vivo and therefore useable for vaccination against tumor.Example 29: Tumor Challenge Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated OVA mRNA Vaccine C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 3\u00d7105 E.G7-OVA cells per mouse (in a volume of 100 pl PBS) on the right flank on day 0 of the experiment. Intradermal (i.d.) therapy started at day 4 and continued twice a week for three weeks. Mice were injected with 1 g OVA mRNA and an irrelevant PpLuc mRNA formulated in LNPs. To control for anti-tumor effects due to injection procedure, mice were injected with buffer (RiLa). The results of the experiment are shown in Tumor growth was monitored by measuring the tumor size in three dimensions using a calliper. Tumor volume was calculated according to the following formula: The results in The results demonstrate that the inventive LNP-III-3 formulated mRNA vaccine format is suitable for tumor vaccination.Example 30: Vaccination Experiment with LNP-III-3 Formulated Endogene Tumor Associated Antigens mRNA Vaccine in Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitor C57BL/6 mice injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 1\u00d7105 B16.F10 cells (murine melanoma cell line) per mouse on the right flank on day 0 of the experiment. At day 6 after tumor challenge, mice were vaccinated intradermal with LNP formulated Trp2 mRNA (Component A) and irrelevant LNP formulated PpLuc mRNA (Component B). In addition intraperitoneal (i.p.), median tumor size and survival rates were analyzed. To exclude an anti-tumor effect due to the checkpoint inhibitors, mice were injected with component B and a control antibody (rat IgG2a, BioXCell).
