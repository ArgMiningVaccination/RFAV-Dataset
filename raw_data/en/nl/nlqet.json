Their active principles are extracted into various solvents and the liquid homeopathic medicine is poured into small, highly porous and absorptive sugar globules for better taste. The content inside these white sugar pills aims to cure you. For example, Natrum Muriaticum is the remedy prepared from common salt, Aurum Metalicum is the remedy prepared from Gold, Argentum Nitricum is the remedy prepared from silver, and so on. Remedies prepared from plants are Arnica, Aconite, Belladonna, Bryonia, Calendula, Rhus Tox, etc. animal juices are Naja, Lachesis and Tarantula. Before being employed for the treatment of patients, homeopathic medicines have been tested on healthy people to know their curative properties and their symptoms are well documented. As they have been successfully tested on human beings, they are suitable to treat human sufferings. Preparation and preservation The original substance, which is in a crude form, is converted into its medicinal form by a series of dilutions. The substance is diluted and shaken repeatedly, as per defined method. This process of progressive dilution is called potentization. Potentization helps in activating inert medicinal properties of the crude substance. The medicine prepared after such a dilution method possesses very minute traces of the original crude substance, which makes homeopathic medicine very safe, effective and free from any side-effects. FDA-approved laboratories prepare homeopathic medicines under strict rules and regulations from authentic sources. Unlike allopathic medicines, homeopathic medicines do not have any expiry date, but preservation of the medicine demands a moisture-free atmosphere under normal room temperature in an airtight container. Touching homeopathic medicines or exposing them to strong odours and extreme temperatures, or even direct sunlight, may reduce their effectiveness. Liquid homeopathic medicine may evaporate if the bottle is not sealed properly, as it contains medicated alcohol. The alcohol content in liquid medicines is within the limits of permitted medical use approved by the FDA. Action of homeopathic medicine Homeopathic medicines act by stimulating your body's natural healing power through your immune system and nerves. Like allopathic medicines, they are not digested in the stomach or liver, and no medicine waste product is excreted by the kidney. Hence, there is no adverse effect of long-term homeopathic medicine use on your liver, stomach or kidneys. Homeopathic medicines can be used for any complaint you may be suffering, provided your symptoms exactly match with the symptoms that the remedy is capable of producing on a healthy person. The right remedy for you is the one that will cover all your symptoms at a mind and body level, while also considering your emotions, temperament, and physical characteristics. The medicine stimulates your nerves directly when it is kept below your tongue and the action starts within a few seconds of consumption. It doesn't have to mix with your blood to begin its action. This is the reason why a patient experiences symptomatic relief a few minutes after taking the homeopathic medicine, provided the given remedy is correct. "}
