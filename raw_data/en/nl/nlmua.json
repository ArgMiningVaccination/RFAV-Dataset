Immunity & Ageing provides a specific conduit for dissemination of new knowledge in this increasingly important arena. Published since 2004, the journal is a specialist open access journal dedicated to promulgating information on the impact of ageing on immune systems, the influence of aged immune systems on organismal well-being and longevity, age-associated diseases which have at least partly an immune etiology, and potential immune interventions to increase health span. Immunity & Ageing welcomes submissions dealing with any aspect of ageing in human and model organisms that relates to immune function. Papers dealing with any aspect of ageing that does not include a substantial immunological element will not be considered. "}
