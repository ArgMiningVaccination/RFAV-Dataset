Grapefruit oil is perfect for use during a Swedish massage, either added to a diffuser or combined with a carrier oil and used on the skin. The best carrier oils for aromatherapy massage Essential oils should never be applied neat (meaning used on the skin without a carrier oil) as they can cause irritation. To make essential oils safe for topical use, you should first combine the essential oil with a carrier oil. A [carrier oil](/collections/carrier-oils) is a type of plant-based oil which is made from the fatty portion of a plant such as the seeds or nuts. There are many types of carrier oils, each with a combination of health benefits and therapeutic properties. The type of carrier oil you choose will depend on your personal preferences, along with any allergies or sensitivities you might have. Different carrier oils have different shelf lives, ranging from as little as six months for sweet almond oil up to five years for jojoba oil. Carrier oils will degrade faster if they are exposed to heat and light, so you should store your carrier oil in a cool, dark place to maximise its shelf life. We've handpicked some of our favourite carrier oils for you to try. Avocado oil: Hydrate and renew Avocado oil is bursting with essential and trace minerals, ready to hydrate and revitalise your skin tone.

This oil has a shelf life of around a year. Coconut oil: For silky smooth skin With a fantastic shelf life of up to four years, coconut oil is often celebrated for its health benefits. Massaging coconut oil into your skin can help to reduce inflammation and encourage healing. This oil also has anti-aging properties as it stimulates the production of collagen, helping the skin to retain its elasticity. It's also packed full of vitamin E, helping to protect the skin from sun damage. Grapeseed oil: Light but powerful Grapeseed oil is a powerful anti-inflammatory. This means that grapeseed oil can help with acne and reduce redness of the skin. Using grapeseed oil for your aromatherapy massage can help to tone and tighten your skin whilst reducing the appearance of wrinkles, blemishes and stretch marks. Typically, grapeseed oil has a shelf life of just three months. However, store your grapeseed oil in the fridge and you can quadruple its shelf life, allowing it to be used for up to a year. Simply remove your oil from the fridge an hour before use to allow it to return to room temperature. Sweet almond oil: Softening and hydrating Perfect for use on sensitive skin, sweet almond oil helps to soothe dry and irritated skin. This oil penetrates deep into your skin with its emollient properties to hydrate and regenerate damaged skin cells. With around six months of shelf life, sweet almond oil is ideal for use on dry and acne-prone skin. However, be sure to avoid this oil if you suffer from a nut allergy. Jojoba oil: Detox and revitalise This light moisturising oil helps to remove impurities from your skin. Jojoba oil mimics the consistency of our body's natural oils, making it ideal for use on acne-prone skin.
