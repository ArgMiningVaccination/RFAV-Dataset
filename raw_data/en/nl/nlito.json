Apple had its latest product hype-fest on Tuesday. I'll [point you to my colleagues](https://fortune.com/2019/09/10/apple-iphone-11-event-recap/) who are more in tune with the tech-specific beat on the big picture announcements\u2014but, as readers know, some of the company's most intriguing interests lay in health care. And the new Apple Watch Series 5, with its watchOS6 upgrade, includes some notable additions on that front. The marquee new feature may be the \"Cycle Tracking\" app for keeping tabs on menstrual cycles. The application \"gives customers the ability to log important information related to their menstrual cycles, and see predicted timing for their next period and fertile windows using the convenience of Apple Watch,\" [says the company](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/09/apple-unveils-apple-watch-series-5/). To be clear, there are other new features as well, including Apple Watch programs to assess ambient noise and its effect on hearing (the appropriately named \"Noise\" app). But the Cycle Tracking addition, though [previously telegraphed](https://fortune.com/2019/06/03/apple-watch-menstrual-tracking-period-app/), might be the most striking addition. The app underscores a growing digital health outreach trend tailored [towards female customers](https://www.glossy.co/podcasts/hims-and-hers-hilary-coles-we-are-defining-our-own-category). Last year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [cleared a digital birth control app dubbed Natural Cycles](https://fortune.com/2018/08/30/digital-birth-control-app-natural-cycles/) meant for fertility monitoring (and to [no shortage of controversy](https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17796864/birth-control-app-natural-cycles-facebook-ad-accuracy)). The question, as with so many digital health products, remain\u2014Will consumers ultimately trust such technology, or merely use it as an ancillary, novelty service? Read on for the day's news.
