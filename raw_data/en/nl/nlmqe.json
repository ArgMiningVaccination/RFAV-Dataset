Las Vegas independent living is also known for resort-style amenities and activities that enable seniors to truly enjoy their new maintenance-free lifestyle. Stand-alone and combined communities You can choose between our seven partner independent living-only communities, sometimes called stand-alone communities, and our 13 partner communities that offer senior care services. Stand-alone independent living facilities are exclusively for independent, active seniors over the age of 55. These communities offer senior-specific amenities and social activities, but residents are free to come and go as they please. In the event that your care needs change in the future, it may be helpful to choose a combined community. Some Las Vegas independent living communities provide different combinations of assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing care. These on-site services give you the freedom to choose between communities that simply help with activities of daily living and other communities that provide a broader range of services. Choosing an independent living facility like this will keep you connected to senior care services without ever having to move. Variety of independent living homes You'll find the comforts of home in the range of Las Vegas independent living apartments and villas. Many communities offer a mixture of studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments that come with either kitchenettes or full kitchens. For visitor- and couple-friendly options, you can also find two-bedroom independent living apartments that have up to two bathrooms. Some options also have private patios and balconies in addition to their landscaped grounds. Independent living villas are another option in Las Vegas. Villas may include two bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, and a den. These are great options for seniors who want to retire in a homelike environment without dealing with the hassle of homeownership. Convenient amenities and engaging activities Las Vegas independent living communities strive to help seniors maintain a carefree yet engaging and active lifestyle. Break a sweat in the fitness center, work on your latest piece in the art studio, or swim a few laps in the pool. After, grab a snack at the poolside bistro or lounge in the whirlpool spa. You can also enjoy gourmet, restaurant-style dining and release the responsibilities of cooking your own meals. Get a new hairstyle or manicure from the comfort of your new home in the on-site beauty salon and barber shop. Even your beloved pet can enjoy the new lifestyle, as all of A Place for Mom's partner independent living communities in Las Vegas are pet-friendly. Popular activities at Las Vegas independent living include private performances from Las Vegas entertainers, happy hours, parties, on-site fitness classes, outings to casinos, and continuing education opportunities. When you're not exploring the city with friends and family, consider joining one of the community's resident-run interest clubs. "}
