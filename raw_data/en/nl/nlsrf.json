This is different from most pills or shots, which send medicine into the whole body. It is important for you to use your inhaler correctly so the medicine works best. Are all inhalers the same? There are different types of inhaler devices. One main type is called a \"metered -dose inhaler.\" These have a spray like an aerosol can and usually require you to press down on a canister or button at the same time you are breathing in. Usually you need to breathe in slowly and deeply. Most require shaking before use and \"priming\" (one or more test sprays). Another main inhaler device is called a \"dry -powder inhaler.\" These usually require you to breathe in quickly and deeply to pull the powdered medicine from the inhaler into your lungs. They should not be shaken. There are d ifferent instructions for different inhalers, so it is very important for you to know how to use the specific inhaler that's prescribed for you. How can I learn to use my inhaler? Your prescriber or pharmacist can show you the exact steps for using your in haler. He or she can tell you whether or not to shake the inhaler before use, if it needs to be primed or cleaned, how to store it, and how to keep track of how many doses of medicine are left. You'll also find instructions in the packaging that have all o f this information. Consider bringing your inhaler to the pharmacy or to appointments with your prescriber. You can show how you use it. Then your pharmacist or prescriber can give you tips if you are having any problems.

Vaccine -preventable diseases haven't gone away. The viruses and bacteria that cause illness and death still exist and can be passed on to those who are not protected by vaccines. In a time when people can travel across the globe in just one day, it's not hard to see just how easily diseases can travel too. 2. Vaccines will help keep you healthy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccinations throughout your life to protect against many infections. When you skip vaccines, you leave yourself vulnera ble to illnesses such as shingles, pneumococcal disease, influenza, and HPV and hepatitis B, both leading causes of cancer. 3. Vaccines are as important to your overall health as diet and exercise. Like eating healthy foods, exercising, and getting regular check -ups, vaccines play a vital role in keeping you healthy. Vaccines are one of the most convenient and safest preventive care measures available. 4. Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death. Vaccine -preventable infections are dangerou s. Every year, approximately 50,000 US adults die from vaccine -preventable diseases in the US. 5. Vaccines are safe. The US has the best post -licensure surveillance system in the world making vaccines extremely safe. There is extraordinarily strong data fr om many different medical investigators all pointing to the safety of vaccines. In fact, vaccines are among the safest products in all of medicine. 6. Vaccines won't give you the disease they are designed to prevent. You cannot \"catch\" the disease from th e vaccine. Some vaccines contain \"killed\" virus, and it is impossible to get the disease from them. Others have live, but weakened, viruses designed to ensure that you cannot catch the disease. 7. Young and healthy people can get very sick, too. Infants a nd the elderly are at a greater risk for serious infections and complications in many cases, but vaccine -preventable diseases can strike anyone. If you're young and healthy, getting vaccinated can help you stay that way. 8. Vaccine -preventable diseases ar e expensive. An average influenza illness can last up to 15 days, typically with five or six missed work days. Adults who get hepatitis A lose an average of one month of work. 9. When you get sick, your children, grandchil dren and parents are at risk, too. A vaccine -preventable disease that might make you sick for a week or two could prove deadly for your children, grandchildren, or parents if it spreads to them. When you get vaccinated, you're protecting yourself and your family. For example, adults ar e the most common source of pertussis (whooping cough) infection in infants, which can be deadly in infants. In 2010 alone, 25 US infants died from whooping cough. 10. Your family and coworkers need you. In the US each year, millions of adults get sick fr om vaccine -preventable diseases, causing them to miss work and leaving them unable to care for those who depend on them, including their children and/or aging parents. 10 Reasons to Be Vaccinated Important Dates March/April 2014 Vaccinations : Anytime during Pharmacy Hours (while supplies last) March 14th (Friday) 8 -12: Blood Pressure and Blood Glucose Screening March 28th (Friday) 8 -12: Cholesterol Screening April 11th (Friday) 8 -12: Blood Pressure and Blood Glucose Screening April 25th (Friday) 8 -12: Cholesterol Screening adultvaccination.com , accessed (2/22/14) Are you up -to-date on your Hy Pharmacy Meningococcal MMR Influenza Pneumococcal HPV(Gardasil) Shingles Tetanus Stop by the pharmacy today to pick up a copy of the recommended adult immunization schedule and let us help you determine which vaccines are right for you.
