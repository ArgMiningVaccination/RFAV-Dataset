It's an easy and effective protocol to tackle parasites, candida and potentially cancerous cells. Typically, I do this cleanse first in January to detoxify some of the excessive sugar, junk food and alcohol consumption from the holidays. Here is a quick video for you to help clarify how I do it: Here is a follow up video with few answers to some questions that many of you have asked: I would suggest you watch both videos and then decide if this cleanse is right for you, especially if you are motivated to take your health to the next level.

This formulation is broad spectrum meaning that it covers over 100 different parasites, the adult onset and the eggs. Including liver flukes. Mycocyde We bundle these two together and put a 10% discount on them.

This special formulation also cleanses and purifies the blood. Every 6 months, I go through a 2 oz bottle of each. I take 1/2 dropper full of each blended in the same water 2-3 times a day until the bottles are gone. Feel free to find the times that work best for you. I find this most effective when taken on an empty stomach. If this is your first time doing this cleanse I would highly recommend going through a 4oz bottle of each. (Please note that for the Clarkia-100 formula we suggest taking it for 2 weeks and then taking a 1-week break until it is gone. When I do this bi-annual cleanse I don't take the break, but if it's your first time, it is strongly recommended.) The key is consistent use until all three are gone. This will give you the motivation to dial your nutrition in. Prevention and herbal love at its finest! Much love, Jane and the Barlow Herbal Team XO Comments will be approved before showing "}
