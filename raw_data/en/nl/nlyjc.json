It is based on the idea that the laws of nature can be used to understand the inner workings of the body. Your health, like the universe at large, is subject to excesses and deficiencies. An imbalance between any of these forces,( fire, earth, air, water and wood,) can cause a blockage in the flow of your qi (or vital energy) traveling through your body along invisible pathways known as meridians. Chinese Medical practitioners typically use herbs to help unblock your qi and bring your body back into harmony and wellness. The focus of Chinese Medicine is to treat the root cause of illness. In modern-day terms, Chinese medicine is holistic in its approach. It views every aspect of a persons' body, mind, spirit, and emotions as part of the whole being. Chinese Medicine treats the patient and not the disease. The Chinese believe that redirecting or unblocking the flow of vital energy through your body and that certain herbs rebalance a patient's organs, tissues and glands. Western medicine, with clinical studies, shows that chinese medicine works by triggering the release of endorphins, natural pain-killers. Chinese medicine has been extremely successful in dealing with patients with pain. Now, new studies at the National Institutes of Health, have proven that along with pain management, chinese medicine is also successful in dealing with nausea, digestive disorders, infertility, low back pain and menopausal symptoms, only to name a few. Qi, or one's vital energy, is the basis for Chinese Medicine. This \"prana\" or vital force, is considered to be the force that animates and informs all things. In the human body, Qi flows through meridians, or energy pathways. Twelve major meridians run through the body, and it is over this network that Qi travels, sending messages to the entire body. Keeping the meridians clear is imperative for the body's self-regulating action to occur. The philosophy of Qi is the same as God's living \"breath\" that sustains all life. The Ancients knew that the vital \"breath\" of life heals and regenerates us all. We use the philosophy of Chinese Medicine of hot, cold, deficiency and excess in protocols that we give to patients.
