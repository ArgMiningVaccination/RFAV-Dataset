Aids in Post-Exercise Recovery Low-fat chocolate milk is an excellent choice for post-workout recovery. It's a natural source of high-quality protein to build lean muscle, has proteins and carbs to refuel muscles, and provides fluids and electrolytes - like calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sodium - to rehydrate.

Boosts Your Energy Ever feel energized after drinking a glass of milk? There's a reason for that. Dairy milk has lactose (unless it's lactose-free milk), a naturally occurring sugar that provides energy. Protein might play a role too. While not directly related to providing energy, protein helps you feel satisfied and full and avoid sugar crashes. Helps You Stay Hydrated Staying hydrated is critical to your overall health. Dairy milk can help. Milk is full of electrolytes like calcium, potassium, sodium, and magnesium that help you recover what's lost in sweat and rehydrate.

Milk alternatives like oat and almond milk often add ingredients and are fortified with nutrients to mimic milk. Depending on the brand you choose, you're drinking different ingredients every time you choose a milk alternative, unlike dairy milk which is always the same and always natural.
