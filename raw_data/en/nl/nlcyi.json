Program enrollment is currently focused on small physician practices who routinely vaccinate their patients as well as providers that are prioritized for vaccine allocation by local health departments. Providers who do not routinely vaccinate may contact the [COVID Call Center](mailto:covidcallcenter@cdph.ca.gov) about eligibility. When enrollment opens up for non-traditional vaccinators, providers must be [credentialed/licensed](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Authorized-Licensees.aspx) in the jurisdiction where vaccination takes place, complete all required training, and comply with federal and state requirements all of which are outlined in the [California Vaccination Program](/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVID-19Vaccine.aspx). COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use by California providers under an FDA emergency use authorization (EUA). In order to participate in the program, providers will need to register and agree to a number of [specific conditions](https://eziz.org/assets/other/IMM-1307.pdf) (PDF). Among these are three important ones to consider before enrolling. Participating vaccinators must: - Submit order requests through the myCAVax system and maintain current organization and provider contact information. - Report COVID-19 doses administered within 24 hrs of administration [ to your local immunization registry](http://cairweb.org/cair-regions/) (IIS) (e.g. CAIR2, Healthy Futures, or SDIR). - Report COVID-19 doses in inventory at least weekly by close of business on Fridays to [VaccineFinder](https://covid.locating.health/).
