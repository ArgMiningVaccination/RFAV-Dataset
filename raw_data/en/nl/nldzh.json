You may be visiting this site for a variety of reasons. From my own frustrations in practicing conventional medicine and its noted limitations in preventative and managed care, I elected to 'look outside the box' and recognize that there are many more options of treating patients in a holistic manner, which veterinary school does not necessarily teach us. I have listened to numerous clients express their frustration in how their pets with chronic disease are managed (i.e. synthetically based medications, surgery, processed diets and chemical overload). What I have gathered from many clients is that there is a disconnect with western medicine. They might see improvements in their pet's health, but it is often limited to the treatments provided. Once those treatments are discontinued, the symptoms typically recur. So we are dealing with a system that addresses the symptoms and not necessarily the underlying root cause of the issue at hand. Often my services are sought out because an animal can no longer tolerate medications, the medicine is losing its efficacy or the patient is a high risk candidate for anesthesia and surgery. I also find that as people begin incorporating a more natural form of healing into their own lives, they start seeking it for their animals as well. Our new office patient check-in area is bigger and better to serve you and your pet. See you soon! IVS now offers on-site digital X-Rays. Before diving further into the information contained in this site, I would like to emphasize that the modalities of treatment I offer are heavily rooted to nutrition (I am a firm believer in that what we put into the body will dictate what its optimal function - or demise will be). I believe Spinal Manipulation, from a functional neurologic perspective, is key in ensuring that the body's organs and tissues are being sent the correct signals for optimal performance. I have also incorporated and witnessed tremendous benefit in the practices of Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine. I began studying eastern medicine theory due to a frustration in allopathic management regarding many forms of chronic disease in our pets. Cancer, chronic organ failure, behavioral issues, skin and gastrointestinal disorders, just to name a few, are rampant in our pet populations. In my studies and practice, I have learned there is something more we can offer - another approach to analyzing why our pets are suffering so much. I believe poor nutrition, repeated vaccination and chemical overload are common denominators in our pet populations and can be contributors to poor health. I realized that we have the ability to offer another dimension to the standard of care that conventional veterinary medicine provides. In doing so, I need to emphasize and encourage that animal caregivers and the veterinary community embrace these options, not soley as the primary treatment, but incorporating them with conventional medicine and surgical options. The goal is trying to achieve longevity with our pets and improving their quality of life while they are here with us in this lifetime. The modalities offered by Integrative Veterinary Services of Southeast Michigan can help achieve this goal. Enjoy your visit.
