INTRODUCTION: Adherence to healthy lifestyle recommendations has positive effects on cancer outcomes yet adherence is low among cancer survivors. Differences in adherence between women and men, phase of survivorship, and other factors that might increase adherence, like the use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM), need to be explored. We aimed to study the adherence to national recommendations for a healthy diet (daily intake of 5 portions of fruit/vegetables), physical activity (150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of high-intensity/week), normal body mass index (BMI) (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), non-smoking, and low-risk alcohol consumption (women 10 g/day, men 20 g/day) among Norwegian cancer survivors and their associations with sex, the use of T&CM, and survivorship phase. METHODS: We used logistic regression, independent sample t-test, and chi-square test to study self-reported (diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption) and measured (BMI) adherence in 1530 cancer survivors (40 years and above, participating in the population-based Troms\u00f8 Study conducted in 2015-2016 (65% attendance). We dichotomized all assessed lifestyle recommendations (adherence = 1 point, non-adherence = 0 points), and created a score for every recommendation (0-5 points). Adherence to individual lifestyle recommendations and the use of T&CM as well as the phase of survivorship was adjusted for sex, age, income, and living with a partner. RESULTS: Adherence to recommendations was 7.5% for diet, 85.3% for physical activity, 30.5% for BMI, 89.3% for non-smoking, and 87.6% for alcohol consumption. In total 2.3% adhered to all five recommendations concurrently (mean score 2.96 [SD = 0.86]). Women adhered to more recommendations concurrently compared to men (3.03 [SD = 0.90] vs. 2.89 [SD = 0.80] points respectively, [p = .012]). In total, 31% reported the use of T&CM and there were no differences in adherence to individual lifestyle recommendations or concurrent adherence in overall T&CM use compared to non-use. Users of self-help techniques were more likely to adhere to the recommendations of diet (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.45-4.98) and physical activity (aOR 6.26, 95% CI 1.51-25.92). Users of traditional healers and users of more than one T&CM modality were less likely to adhere to the low-risk alcohol consumption recommendation, (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.77, and aOR 0.53, 95% CI 1.08-2.17, respectively) compared to T&CM non-users. Survivors with cancer previously (1162) had higher odds of adhering to the recommendation of diet (aOR 2.66, 95% CI 1.36-5.19) than survivors with cancer presently (n = 368), but not to other recommendations. CONCLUSION: The health of cancer survivors can be improved through adherence to lifestyle recommendations, yet our study found partial adherence among survivors in Norway, in accordance with findings from other countries. Although overall T&CM use was not associated with higher adherence to lifestyle recommendations, differences in adherence were seen among individual modalities like the use of self-help techniques and traditional healers. Our results suggest the need for intensified follow-up of lifestyle with attention to male survivors and diet among all survivors throughout the the Indian to Doctor Chernoviz: experiments to cure leprosy in nineteenth-century Par\u00e1. analyzes an experiment to cure leprosy using the assacu plant (Hura crepitans L.) conducted in Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, in 1847, by an Indigenous man named Antonio Vieira dos Passos. The experiment was later repeated in other Brazilian provinces and abroad. This article establishes relationships between medical practices in other parts of the country while focusing on the dialog between official and Indigenous medicine. Newspaper articles and official documents of the time show that Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants was widely recognized and utilized by physicians wishing to incorporate it into the official therapeutic repertoire. O artigo analisa uma experi\u00eancia nas plant genus within the Rutaceae family comprising over 17 species, which are widely distributed in Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Furthermore, these species have been used in traditional medicine to treat fever, pain, and dysentery. Several reports have also extensively studied the leaves, seeds, stembark, and bark of Murraya from 1965 to 2023 to explore their natural product composition. Various phytochemical studies have revealed the isolation of 413 compounds recorded, comprising coumarins, terpenoids, flavonoids, and aromatics, as well as alkaloids, which constitute the largest proportion (46.9%). These isolated compounds have long been known to exhibit different bioactivities, such as cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory properties. Cytotoxic activity has been observed against HCT 116, HeLa, HepG2, and other cell lines. Previous studies have also reported the presence of antifungal, hepatoprotective, antihyperlipidemic, antidiarrheal, and antioxidant effects. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of Murraya species, highlighting their phytochemistry, biological activities, and potential as a source of active 33-42, 2023. Native mushrooms are valuable non-timber forest products used worldwide, although they are under-exploited in Africa. This study focused on evaluating ethnomycological practices in Nigeria. The study was based on structured questionnaires in three of Nigeria's six geopolitical regions. Findings revealed that mycophagy is not a gender-based activity (P 0.05) in all the sites assessed. There were no significant differences (P 0.05) between the sites evaluated, but the responses were quite different. Most interviewees (75.6%) ate mushrooms. Mushrooms were predominantly associated with delicious taste, exotic aroma, and flavor (37.0%), a meat substitute (37.0%), medicinal resources (20.3%). Among the L. squarrosulus and Termitomyces titanicus, Russula meleagris, A. campestris, and A. auricula-judae. The main edible and medicinal dual-use are L. P. tuber-regium, Lactifluus and and children (78.2%) are the major collectors/gatherers of mushrooms. The mushrooms are utilized to treat skin problems (21.5%), high blood pressure (12.3%), as blood tonic (9.2%), to treat fever and measles (13.8%), and diabetes (13.1%). Preservation practices include mainly direct sun-drying (48.7%) or washing and then sun-drying (27.8%). Mushrooms 'fufu' (cereal-boiled cakes) (48.0%), and 'gari' (cassava-boiled cakes) (15.7%). Mushrooms are often made in soup (44.1%), cooked with meat (15.3%), or with vegetables (28.0%). Respondents were able to differentiate between toxic mushrooms and were familiar with some e0288389, 2023. In Cambodia, traditional medicine was commonly described as being used by pregnant women at two time points: one month before birth and during early postpartum. The present study aims to describe traditional medicine consumption during postpartum phase for women enrolled in the TA PROHM study and to investigate the possible association between traditional medicine consumption and acute liver toxicity. An ethnobotanical survey was conducted in 2 groups of HBV-infected pregnant women (with and without postpartum hepatocellular injury) enrolled in the study. Hepatocellular injury was defined by having Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 times the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN = 40 U/L) at the 6th week postpartum visit. Interviews were done using a standardized questionnaire. Plant samples were collected and later identified by two traditional healers. Chi-square test was used to find the association between hepatocellular injury and traditional medicine consumption or a specific plant species. In total, 75 women were enrolled and 52 (69.3%) used at least one traditional remedy composed of 123 different plants and 12 alcoholic macerations of porcupine stomach. Orally consuming at least one remedy with alcohol was significantly associated with hepatocellular injury (33% vs 13%, p = 0.034). Among the 123 plants species identified, four were found to be associated with hepatocellular injury, namely Merr. [Dilleniaceae] (p = 0.079). Consumption of traditional medicine in postpartum is a common practice for women enrolled in the TA PROHM study. Alcohol-based remedies may exacerbate the risk of acute hepatocellular injury in HBV-infected women already exposed to immune restoration. The complex mixtures of herbs need to be further evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. 23(1): 285, 2023 Aug 11. BACKGROUND: In respect of the WHO's commendation to incorporate traditional medicine (TM) in health care, the Cameroon government wants to promote the use of the traditional medicine and is resolute on encouraging the treatment of patients with alternative medicine from traditional sources. This study explores the use of herbal tea by Cameroonian adults to prevent or treat diseases and the socio-demographic determinants of tea use among participants. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 307 Cameroonian adults (18-65 years) randomly selected within 4 hospitals and 4 communities in the Centre and Southwest regions of Cameroon between 04/01-20/04/2022, using interviewer administered semi-structured questionnaires. Binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between variables. RESULTS: Over four-fifth (89.3%) of participants had taken herbal teas at least once within the last 2 years prior to the survey, and most participants used the teas for the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 (67.9%), malaria (59.7%) and typhoid fever (35%). Most respondents took the teas warm (75%), and the treatment dosage used by most respondents (51%) was \"one glass in the morning and evening for one to two weeks\". The teas taken by 70% of users had bad or bitter taste and 52.2% of them were uncomfortable with the bad taste. However, the majority of users completed their treatment dosage (72%), 90.5% of them were willing to use teas for treatment if prescribed in health facilities in future, and 90.1% were in support that herbal teas should be prescribed in hospitals. There was no significant association (p 0.05) between sociodemographic characteristics of participants and herbal tea use. However, the major motivating factor for acceptability of herbal tea use was treatment effectiveness (52.7%). CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of herbal tea use among adults Cameroonians in the studied settings in the Centre and Southwest regions of Cameroon, with a positive opinion and willingness to use teas if prescribed in health facilities. Authorities must ensure the effectiveness and safety of traditional medicine served in health facilities, to enhance compliance and adequate (Burseraceae) is a tree distributed in India, China and Thailand. In traditional Ayurvedic medicine, it is used to treat asthma, rheumatism, blood impurities, syphilis, fever, epilepsy and cough. Toxicological information is currently unavailable warrants present research. Ethanol leaf extract obtained by soxhlet extraction was used to investigate its toxicity. The acute toxicity data showed ethanolic leaf extract is safe up to 2000mg/kg dose in female albino mice. There were no behavioral or physiological alterations or gross clinical abnormalities. The ethanolic leaf extract was administered orally to Wistar rats (n=5) of both sexes at a dose of 300, 600 and 1200mg/kg/d for 90 days during the investigation of sub-chronic toxicity. There were no treatment-related deleterious effects on general behavior, body weight, relative organ weight, biochemical and hematological parameters in the sub-chronic trial when evaluated daily/weekly. Organ histopathology revealed no significant abnormalities. Additionally, the ethanolic leaf extract improved rats' cholesterol and metabolic profiles. There is no apparent harm with ethanolic leaf extract treatment for 13 weeks, unless the dosage is quite high. Thus, it implies that the leaves are safer to use as a traditional medicine remedy for a variety of conditions in a wide dose fortalecimento Rede de to treatment in communities of two indigenous areas of the Western Brazilian Amazon: A cross-sectional 07. BACKGROUND: The indigenous populations of Brazil present poor health indicators and a disproportionate prevalence and case-fatality rate of neglected tropical diseases, including snakebite envenomations (SBEs). This study aims to estimate access to medical care for SBEs and analyze the barriers that prevent victims from accessing healthcare in indigenous communities in two health districts located in the Western Brazilian Amazon. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study used semi-structured interviews to collect data from individuals who experienced SBEs in the Upper Rio Solim\u00f5es and Upper Rio Negro indigenous health districts. Of the 187 participants, 164 (87.7%) reported that they had access to healthcare and received assistance in a hospital in the urban area of the municipalities. Frequency was 95.4% in the Upper Rio Solim\u00f5es SIHD, and 69.6% in the Upper Rio Negro SIHD (P<0.0001). The study found that the availability of indigenous medicine as the only choice in the village was the main reason for not accessing healthcare (75%), followed by a lack of financial resources and means of transportation (28.1%). Four deaths were reported from SBEs, resulting in a case-fatality rate of 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In the study areas, there are records of SBE patients who did not receive medical attention. Availability of pre-hospital emergency transport using motorboats, a greater number of hospitals and better navigability of the Solim\u00f5es River and its tributaries would make access easier for indigenous people living in the region of the Upper Solim\u00f5es River. The implementation of cross-cultural hospital care needs to be considered in order to reduce the resistance of indigenous populations in relation to seeking treatment Update on Nutrition, Phytochemicals, Processing Effects, Analytical Testing and Health Effects of Chenopodium album: A Non-Conventional Edible Plant (NCEP).](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/en;/mdl-37446567) [Molecules](http://portal.revistas.bvs.br/transf.php?xsl=xsl/titles.xsl&xml=http://catserver.bireme.br/cgi-bin/wxis1660.exe/?IsisScript=../cgi-bin/catrevistas/catrevistas.xis|database_name=TITLES|list_type=title|cat_name=ALL|from=1|count=50&lang=pt&comefrom=home&home=false&task=show_magazines&request_made_adv_search=false&lang=pt&show_adv_search=false&help_file=/help_pt.htm&connector=ET&search_exp=Molecules); 28(13)2023 Jun Bathua (Chenopodium album) is of extensive-ranging nutrients, including bio-active carbohydrates, flavonoids and phenolics, minerals, and vitamins that translate to countless health benefits such as anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activity.

The genus of Ferula belongs to the family Apiaceae, and many Ferula plants are used as traditional Chinese medicines. Ferula plants were initially identified as early as the \"Newly Revised Materia Medica\" written in the Tang Dynasty (AD 659), and several of them are also recognized as the traditional medicines of the Uygur, Kazakh, and Mongolian. Ferula plants are distributed in China, Russia, India, Africa, Central Asia, and other places. Currently, the chemical components derived from Ferula plants are mainly coumarins, sesquiterpenes, and volatile oils. Ferula plants can exhibit diverse pharmacological activities such as anti-allergy, analgesia, relieving cough, anticoagulation, and anti-tumor. Therefore, this article summarized the domestic research conducted on the genus Ferula, appropriately combines the research status of the foreign genus Ferula, and describes the chemical composition, biological activity, toxicity issues, and Q-marker prediction. In addition, all the related studies about the genus Ferula are summarized by analyzing the various databases such as J.

BACKGROUND: Traditional and complementary medicines (T&CMs) are not typically covered in medical curricula despite 80% of the world's population using some form of herbal product as part of their healthcare. Concurrent use of T&CMs with conventional therapies is common, and both are primarily accessed in pharmacies. There is an expectation that pharmacists should be knowledgeable about T&CMs. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate what is currently known about pharmacists' T&CMs education and training to inform developments in pharmacy education. METHODS: Eligible studies published between 01/01/2016 and 28/02/2023 were identified across six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect and MEDLINE). Data were extracted from included studies and categorized into key themes and sub-themes and reported descriptively. FINDINGS: Fifty-eight studies were identified, conducted across 30 countries, that included information about pharmacists' T&CMs education and training. Within the four main themes extracted, six subthemes were identified including: T&CMs education and training received; inadequate education and training opportunities; knowledge, and confidence towards T&CMs in the pharmacy setting; professional practice behaviour associated with T&CM; university education for pharmacy students; and continuing professional development for practicing pharmacists, including T&CM-drug interactions, interpreting T&CM research, T&CM-specific communication skills, T&CM use in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and efficacy and safety of T&CM in specific conditions. CONCLUSION: Overall pharmacists are receiving limited T&CM education in undergraduate and continuing professional training and report a lack of resources to inform the advice they provide to consumers. The findings of this review can inform developments in T&CMs curriculum and accreditation standards that support the training needs of pharmacists who play a role in fostering the safe and appropriate use of these products. [Community 2023. There has been accumulating interest in the application of medicinal plants as alternative medicine to treat various diseases and/or to develop modern medicines. Vitex negundo is one of such medicinal plants that has been of interest to many researchers and has been of use in traditional medicine. V. negundo is found in Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Malaysia, India, China, The Philippines and East Africa. Therapeutic properties of V. negundo have previously been reviewed. Different parts, preparations and bioactive components of V. negundo possess potential protective and therapeutic effects against cardiovascular disease and related conditions as demonstrated in previous studies. We review the present state of scientific knowledge on the potential use of V. negundo and some of its bioactive components in protecting against cardiovascular diseases and related pathologies. Previous studies in animal and non-animal experimental models, although limited in number and vary in design, seem to support the cardioprotective effect of V. negundo and some of its active components. However, there is need for further preclinical and clinical studies to validate the use of V. negundo and its active constituents in protection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, since only a few V. negundo compounds have been evaluated, specific cardioprotective effects or mechanisms and possible side effects of other V. negundo compounds need to be is often treated and prevented using the pharmacological properties of traditional medicinal plants. These healthcare systems are among the most well-known, conveniently accessible, and economically priced in India and several other Asian countries. Traditional Indian Ayurvedic plants have the potential to be used as phyto-therapeutics, to create novel anti-asthmatic drugs, and as a cost-effective source of pharmaceuticals. Current conventional therapies have drawbacks, including serious side effects and expensive costs that interfere with treatment compliance and affect the patient's quality of life. The primary objective of the article is to comprehensively evaluate the advancement of research on the protective phytochemicals of traditional plants that target immune responses and signaling cascades in inflammatory experimental asthma models. The study would assist in paving the way for the creation of natural phytomedicines that are protective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory against asthma, which may then be used in individualized asthma therapy. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study demonstrates the mechanisms of action of phytochemicals present in traditional medicinal plants, diminish pulmonary disorder in both in vivo and in vitro models of asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature on conventional plant-based asthma therapies was performed from 2006 to 2022.
