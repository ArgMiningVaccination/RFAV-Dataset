A week ago, the Asia De-velopment Bank published a 250 page report based on the situation in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. This report is not optimistic, many islands have populations that depend on agriculture. As the seas will rise, these islands will no longer exist. In the Mekong delta and in Jakarta the sea water is entering the fresh water systems which will affect the rice growing. Animals may have to leave their ecosystem and move into an ecosystem which is not suitable.This is the \"outer landscape,\" but what is the \"inner landscape\"? If we take agriculture as an example we can identify three inner landscapes. The chemical, the organic, and the biodynamic. Hans then characterized the three inner landscapes in his talk. (note; Ecology comes from the Greek oikos=house and logica=study of. The science of interconnecting biosystems. This word was coined by Ernst Haeckel in 1866.) Chemical landscape: \"lifeless\": only material world exists, monoculture through the use of chemical fertilizers break down of the ecosystem. NPK fertilizer, break down of soil structure, loss of humus, water run-off. High tech cultivation, high fossil fuel use (CO2 -global warming.) Overgrazing for meat production. Hybrid seeds and GMO. However, 7kg of grains needed for 1 kg meat. 16kg soybeans for 1kg meat. 20.000 liters of water for the production of I kg of beef whereas only 1/10 to 1/3 for I kg of grain. Social upheaval-migrant workers to cities or other countries, often very bad living conditions. Cornelius Pietzner, Paul MacKay, Raphael Lazo, Jane Gilmer at the Asia Pacific Anthroposophical Initiative Group meeting.2Organic: \"life processes: biodiversity restored. Soil fertil - ity through compost (solid and liquid), crop rotation, green cropping, fallowing, return of the animals (importance of the cow), seed collection, breeding programs, no GE. Green energy, water harvesting. Biodynamic \"Soul, Spiritual:\" The Agricultural course was given by Dr. Steiner at Whitsun 1924. He gives a soul-spiritual landscape. The \"Farm Individuality\" in which the farmer stands as a meditating conscious ego (consciousness soul). Nature needs the co-creative presence of the human being, farmer. There is an interrelationship between earth and uni-verse. Finding and reconnecting the rhythms of the cosmos and of Nature. The use of the herbal preparations, made by the human being out of mineral (soil), plants (flowers), and animal (sheath). This is a new creative aspect or example of the co creative presence of the farmer. What is new in biodynamic farming is that is a \"Sun\" agri- culture. The social aspect of this new inner landscape: people back to meaningful life on the land. New community building, a community of \"Common will.\" Goethe and Dr. Steiner gave us a path to think within Na- ture to rethink the thought that is in the object. See \"Theory of Knowledge based on Goethe's World Conception.\" In the Calendar of the soul, the inner/outer is taken a step further. What the greater world reveals through time is like the swing of a pendulum in the human being, taking place outside time. Man can feel his being when open to the sense impressions as corresponding to the warmth and light nature of summer and can feel his/her being firmly anchored with him/herself and of living in his own world of thoughts and will. Corresponding to winter in the outer world. Rhythm of summer-winter in nature Rhythm of outer senses and inner thoughts and will in the human being. When in harmony great secrets of existence can be revealed. (See introduction to the 1912/13 Calendar of the Soul by Rudolf Steiner) Then Hans closed his talk by identifying three challenges to day; Profit versus sustainability, Economy versus ecology, Glo - balization (world community) versus local/regional community. New Sustainable Economy: Paul Mackay If you would characterize the task of economy: to serve the consumer, to preserve life, to create habitable conditions for human beings. Foundation of economics to serve human needs, what needs do we have in culture, shelter, food etc. Also love, health, then the soul is moved. What the teacher does in the class room is fulfilling a need, a service. How is it possible that needs can be fulfilled? The needs can be diverse, from needs for warmth to cultural needs. In traditional economic teaching there are 3 production areas in which we fulfill needs: 1) nature-w e live by the grace of nature, .How do econo- my and ecology relate to each other? 2) labour ; tak e the mangoes of the ground 3) capital. Ho w to handle capital in a serving way. Nature: do we always live in economic life to the detriment of the ecology? In the 1980s , a striving to pass on nature in the same or better way to the next generation. It makes long term economic sense to pursue environmentally sound solutions. Is business life setting conditions for long term profits? If taking short term profits, the long term profit suffers. It is a challenge in economic life to see the long term picture. How can we take care of nature in long term sense- then ecology. Example; a cow gives 9 litres of milk. When they started to improve the milk quantity, they found that the fertility of cows dropped. If there is too much greed, one hurts one's self for the long term. Labour-how do we handle it? In earlier days we traded labour-slaves. Now we have a labour market We do not trade the people , we trade labour.+ their products. Can we shape the economy so that labour is freed of being a good to be traded? Can we separate out labour from wages? There is more and more the need to take initiatives to which we are committed. The human being wants to give her/his contribution. Going in the direction that labour is a service. How can we handle it in such a way that more and more this can come about. Possibility for a school to come to an arrangement with the coworkers-how do we use our income? How we might share with one another. Different from being told what has to be done because this is a job which is well paid. Christoph Wiechert lecturing at the Asia Pacific Conference in the Philippines.3Capital: money, human faculties, assets, time, knowledge. What is it? What is behind money? It allows me to have a portion of GDP. There is no capital without human intelligence. That is spirit at work. The source of capital is always human intelligence. How does it come about? The child needs to be educated-we differ from other species-wisdom in plant and animal. As human being we need education, how to activate the forces in the human being in becoming. Can go to school, to university, do very well- set up a business- can you realize your human potential, to make something of your education, of your capacities etc. Human intelligence can be gathered and then we can also use it to serve others. Capital=human intelligence. Creating teachingRealizing means of productionResults goods and services(in economic sense) and they can be consumption. Certain goods are not consumed, they are capital goods eg. House. They can be used for production etc. How do we handle capital in a sustainable way?How do we handle the results of capital? Need money to exchange goods and services. Need trading money Need loans to allow a company to finance certain initiatives. Need credit and investment. Credit: risk element -goes into means of production but always a risk, so need investments. How do we finance the creation of faculties?Gifts( taxes are obligatory gifts. Loans investments and credit.Trade money.What is a gift? In exchange money we trade bananas for money, the action is direct, both win. In loan- some of the money left over to exchange so it can be invested. Out of selling goods and services it can pay back the money and maybe invest and interest so indirect return. With gift no direct return but new capacities can come about. Some ask: Why not do this by loan on the other? In modern economy it means we are more and more in- terdependent. We can not live of each other but have to take care of each other. Can we govern economics in that sense or do we still see it as a business and only think of ourselves? Paul sees the crisis making us conscious that we are living in a global village and the local economy needs to work on that basis. Discussion followed.Going back to ecology every generation has to buy the land from the previous generation. The bank has to be paid-cash crop. This is not helpful and land should be taken out of the buying and selling cycle. Nature is God given- capital is man made. Taiwanese participant: Going back to old wisdom. We tend to create another problem when we solve one. We have to rediscover nature in us and the world and not be bogged down by the material life. Paul: Biodynamics is understanding nature in a deeper way and see it as no longer able to take care of itself. It needs Nana Goebel of the Friends of Rudolf Steiner Education, a key organizer of the Asian Waldorf Teachers conferences, together with participants at the 2009 conferences in Manilla.4the human being. We need to recognize as human beings the responsibilities of bringing nature back to health. The earth is dying- in a healthy way or because we are making use of it in an unhealthy way. Look back to what people did out of their spiritual knowl - edge. What spirit is at work? Walter: Small amounts of medicine in the water. The water is not able to take care of itself, but there are methods intro-duced by human beings which help in a healthy way. Also there is GM breeding and biodynamic breeding.Raph: The economic crisis challenges us in our relation- ship with material things, between a supplier and consumer, between colleagues etc. Beijing participant: Crisis is combined with danger and opportunity in the Chinese character. Every 5 year 20 million people move from the country side to the city. Last year 20 million lost their job. Government gave money but that only helped 10 million, half. What about the others? Paul: His understanding of Anthroposophy is that the knowledge of the West is intellectuality. Task of Anthroposo - phy is not to wipe it out but to take hold of it and transform it into real human intelligence. That is the big task we have. The New Community: Cornelius Pietzner What is community? Everybody wants it. Rudolf Steiner draws the attention to the fact that in the age of the conscious - ness soul we can feel separated, more than ever before. This feeling is in a way a driver towards new communities. Social research: A person has about 4-7 0r 5-8 close friends he/she trusts. And beyond that we know about 150 people. e.g people we have met, send Christmas cards to etc. In the last years, facebook - you do not count unless you have at least 200 friends in your face book. Does this virtual community, a network of friends meet our needs? What are the social spiritual forces that are important in a community context, what are some of the social processes? 1) W here are we sleeping and waking spiritually? We fall asleep into the other person, blend into his/her being when we meet, when we are listening-sympathetic response. On the other hand ,awakening response, drawing back in antipathy. We need to have both together. Picture of the other human being. It has to do with the sense of word, sense of thought, sense of ego. Rudolf Steiner calls these the social senses. They have to do with the perception of what takes place in the other outside ourselves.3 social senses. 2) R efers to early childhood which are the foundations for social life. Koenig said that they are the result of three steps we take in early childhood-uprightness and being connected to the sense of the word. Around age 1 when the child stands upright ,he/she is begin - ning to understand that language is being transmitted. This sense of word is connected to the child learning to speak. When the child learns to fashion language, it is the basis for the sense of connected system to thinking and the child begins to say I to itself. Koen-ing describes the organ for the social organ -the ear- the sense of hearing. Think of the ear, where is it, what is the gesture. It is creating a space towards the back of the head. Gesture of openness, to do with enabling, with holding back, creating space for the other, not passive but an active holding back. Story of Jacques Lusseyran -\"And there was light\"-, his capac - ity to hear into the other. 3) Do w e live our temperament in social life? Can we become playful with our temperament so we become artistic? Do we always have to be our own tempera - ment?. See what is needed in this painting. Paint a social painting every time we are in a social situation. Be playful in such a way we can be helpful in the situ - ation . If you think you know what some one is going to say, you do not listen anymore. We can practice stepping outside ourselves to help a situation. 4) It is helpful to dev elop a peripheral consciousness. We have central ego and ego in the periphery. Need to have inter play, a breathing between the two. Some people can see the dynamics of a group naturally , others are blind to it. 5) Interest in the other - capacity to see with new eyes esp those who push our buttons. Develop interest in people who are not so interesting to us. Picture of a dried sponge and the warmth of interest flowing over it. Learning to see the old with new eyes. Issues of social life in community building, heard from Peter Sang of the society for organic development. This is what Christof shared with us the following morning. Rudolf Steiner's spiritual idealism for coherence. When we find coherence we can invite a spiritual being. This spiritual being needs to be nurtured, cared for as a living being or it becomes obscure and hidden. One way is to build an image bank archetypal images that are connected to the star. We get swallowed up over time by practical matters. Can we find what holds us together in our common purpose? Practicing again and again, making our will smaller, making the space to enable the initiative of the other. How can I help you achieve what you want to do in the community? It has to do with holding your own will back. See Dr. Steiner's social motto. Awareness of the spiritual beings that are connected to the common endeavour. Connect ourselves through our own angel to the larger spiritual beings which connect themselves with our work And then connect with even greater spiritual beings eg. The Archai- Michael, the spirit of our time. 5Report from Taiwan Ya Chi Chan,Yilan, Taiwan [Edited from the original report presented at the Asia-Pacific Initiative Group delegates meeting in Manila, Philippines, May 2009] During the past 15 years our main emphasis in Taiwan has been on cultivating Waldorf education for the island's 23 million people. Besides these educational activities, there have been several other exciting developments since 2007. Educational InitiativesAlong with the two Waldorf schools and one Waldorf- inspired school in existence two years ago, two new Waldorf-inspired schools are now in operation - Ren Mei in Taoyuan and San Mei Zhan in Taichung. In the mountain town of Wulai near Taipei, there is also a government school with aboriginal children that is influenced by Waldorf education, and two home school groups will begin in Taipei and Hsinchu next year. In addition, a group of parents and teachers from Ci Xin School are working on providing a class 10 in September, ini-tially as a home school, with the intention of developing into a Waldorf senior high school up to class 12. As well as the existing training courses in Taichung and Yilan, there is a private studio in Taipei and a registered as-sociation in Hsinchu, connected with the university, which offers workshops and study groups. Other InitiativesThere are now 57 members of the Anthroposophical Society registered with the Goetheanum and 8 members of the First Class in Taiwan. We had our first Class Lesson in June 2008 and have three further lessons since, given by Hans Mulder. There are plans for a national society to be established next year. The Anthroposophical Healthy Community Association in Taiwan (AHCAT) was inaugurated last year with the goal of developing community support for biodynamic agriculture, Waldorf education and curative work. A part-time biodynamic agriculture course will open next year in cooperation with Chung Shin University in Taichung and Island Farm in Yilan. Subject to numbers, a part-time post-graduate medical training is also planned for next year in connection with the Medical Section of the Goetheanum. In response to the urgent need for Chinese translations of Steiner's work, a number of people from Mainland China and Taiwan came together in Hong Kong in June last year at the invitation of Nana Goebel. We worked on a glossary for Chinese anthroposophical terminology and made plans for the translation of ten books. The Freunde are generously financing the translation costs and looking for a publisher in Taiwan. Ci Xin Waldorf School in Yilan Chun Shu (Sue) Chang, the school's founder, met Waldorf Education in Germany in 1991 and three years later invited John Thomson from Emerson College to help her transform her 20-year-old kindergarten in Yilan into a Waldorf-inspired school. Out of this, in 1999, there grew a small class 1. Three years later the fledgling primary school of 3 classes entered into a contract with the local government for state support on an experimental basis for 6 years. The school now has double stream classes from 1 to 8 and a single grade 9. Kindergarten: 110 children, 7 groups, 12 teachers and staff. Class 1-9: 465 chil - dren, 18 classes (as from August 2009), 44 teachers and staff This could not have happened without the enormous support of experienced teachers from overseas. We would like to thank all the trainers who have come to support us and especially to Marjorie Theyer, Hans Mulder and Benjamin Cherry who have been coming regularly over the past 10 years. Recent Achievements: 1) With a g rade of Excellent following a rigorous gov- ernment evaluation, we successfully negotiated a 2nd 6-year contract in August 2008. 2) After sev eral years of dialogue with the local authori - ties, we are now receiving funds to employ special education teachers. We have networked with expe - rienced teachers from overseas and have organized several curative seminars. Currently around 13% of the children in our school need special educational support. 3) W e have a Taiwanese eurythmy teacher at last and eurythmy is part of the curriculum for almost all the classes! 4) W e will begin building 12 new classrooms this sum - mer, due for completion in 2011. As a state-funded school and the first and biggest Chinese- speaking Waldorf school in Asia, Ci Xin carries a strong responsibility for Waldorf education. There has been a lot of publicity surrounding the school, which has inspired interest Taiwanese & mainland Chinese sharing a meal together at the third Asian Teachers Conference in the Philippines.6not only among parents and teachers but with government and universities. There is a steady stream of applications to visit the school and there are student waiting lists for all the classes. Several teacher training courses rely on the school to provide facilities for practice teaching by students, but the need is greater than the school can satisfy. Growth has been rapid and our continuing challenge over the past seven years has been to deepen our work and train new teachers. Our 3-year part-time teacher preparation course (consisting of 10 intensive weekends a year) has about 90 participants and receives input from a number of experienced teachers from overseas. There is a constant need for further study and mutual support among the teachers in the school. As in many other schools, we have the continuing chal- lenges of working together, being creative and overcoming tiredness. A major issue is the class 9 exam for entrance into senior high school. It requires a lot of preparation and we have to find a balance between ensuring that the students are properly prepared for it and maintaining our commitment to the spiritual and artistic impulses of Waldorf education. A further challenge, shared by all Chinese-speaking Wal- dorf schools, is to develop a curriculum appropriate for the teaching of Chinese language, literature and history. Foundation Stone High School in Yilan (Edited from a longer report by June Yu) Our aim is to extend Steiner/Waldorf education up to class 12 in a way that accords with our culture in Taiwan and the spirit of Rudolf Steiner's ideal of a threefold social order. As class 9 is the end of compulsory education in Taiwan and of government support for Ci Xin School, children are facing competition for high school entrance earlier and earlier. With the pressure of the examination and its dependence on textbooks and extra lessons outside school, we realize that the only way to bring our children up 'in a Waldorf way' within our society is through a complete 12-year Waldorf school program. The initiative has arisen from a group of people working in a number of different fields, including education, agriculture, social work and business, under the auspices of the Anthro - posophical Healthy Community Association. Most of us are teachers and parents in Ci Xin School as well as other Waldorf schools in Taiwan. Our first step has been to gather together all possible resources for extending into class 10. Apart from attending to the legal and financial situation, we realize that the most important work will be the preparation of teachers. Last year parents started fund-raising for our first high school teacher training with the help of the Ci Xin Foundation. A German high school teacher, Robert Neumann, gave a seminar on Mathematics and Physics for 9 th grade. He also presented an inspiring picture of a Waldorf high school. We are very grateful to Ineke and Hans Mulder who also came to help last year. Hans has been with us at each stage of the development of Waldorf education and Anthroposophy over the last 12 years. Ineke worked on team-building, the es - sence of a Waldorf high school curriculum and the understand - ing of students. It was then that we chose the name Foundation Stone Waldorf High School. They will come again to help us this summer before the school opens on 1 st September. Most of the students will come from this year's class 9 at Ci Xin. Some will also return who were in class 9 last year and there will be two more from Fengle Waldorf School. We expect about 10 students altogether for the first year. In our first three years we will slowly build up to 12 th grade, perhaps also going down to 9th grade for the students who want to continue Waldorf education without the interruption of having to prepare for the public high school entrance examination. Parents in the initiative group will carry responsibility for the administration and finances of the school. Depending on our fund-raising situation, we will have at least one full-time class teacher, with the likelihood of a further six or more teach - ers supporting part-time. We will need more teacher-training for most subjects in the school. There will be a dual location - Bridge Studio near Ci Xin, and Island Farm, a community-supported B-D farm. Four prospective teachers recently went to a class 10 train- ing course in Kassel in Germany and the Mulders will be with us from the end of May to June for six weeks. We will have open talks in May, after the public high school entrance exami - nation is over. We are also planning workshops for students and parents in the summer. We would like to invite Waldorf high school teachers as well as experienced Waldorf teachers to help with our teaching and teacher training. Anthroposophical Education Foundation in YilanThe foundation was established in 2001 with the aim of promoting anthroposophical ideas and practical work in vari-ous areas. Its present goal is to support Waldorf education and it is the legal body of Ci Xin School. It is responsible for the Ya Chi Chan speaking at the second Asian Waldorf Teachers Conference in Thailand in 2007.7Waldorf trade mark throughout Taiwan (contact person Ya Chih Chan) and for the teacher preparation course at Ci Xin. Our next step is to organize a curative education course and to publish resources to support education in Chinese-speaking Waldorf schools. The Anthroposophical Healthy Community Association in T aiwan The Anthroposophical Healthy Community Association in Taiwan (AHCAT) was registered as a non-profitable orga-nization in Taiwan in 2008. It is working with the ideals of Anthroposophy and with the developing community to sup-port the initiative work for Biodynamic agriculture, Waldorf education, and curative work. The Community Supported Farm\u2014the idea of Biody - namic Agriculture was brought to Taiwan in 1997 with the first visit of Hans Mulder. In 2004, Io-Gon Chan changed his career from a teacher to return to his family farm working to prepare his land for Biodynamic farming. In September 2006, Hans Mulder gave a session on the \"Agriculture course\" by Rudolf Steiner, and again in October 2007. Island farm now is providing 30 families with rice and 10 families with vegetables. A further Biodynamic course will be given by Hans Mulder in the National Zon-Cin University and Island Farm in June this year. The farm has become a centre for the community, supporting the gardening lesson and giving the opportunity for children with special needs from the Waldorf School and other local schools. The IPMT (International Postgraduate Medical Training) will be held next year (2010) April in Taiwan. The Association is now working on the preparation work and fund-raising for this work and the starting of the Foundation Stone Waldorf High School in September 2009. Taichung Waldorf Kindergarten With the longest history in middle Taiwan, Taichung Wal- dorf Kindergarten w as j ust interviewed by a famous magazine, as one of the top seven kindergartens in Taiwan. The kinder - g arten is fourteen years old, with 76 children in 6 groups, 11 teachers and 3 co-workers. I n the first ten years, t he aim was to build up a professional teaching group. A nd when t hey get into the second ten years, they aim to cultivate parents supporting parents to deepen kno wledge in anthroposophy. T his work is very successful. Taichung Waldorf Kindergarten also issues a newsletter every two weeks. Leichuan Waldorf SchoolLeichuan Waldorf School has grown from humble beginnings over the past 7 years to accommodate 127 students, 12 full-time teachers, 7 part-time subject teachers and 8 administration staff members. Currently, we are at full capacity for Classes 1,3 and 4. And Class 1, for our next school year, has already been filled to capacity with an additional twenty- plus children on the waiting list. In February 2008, we moved to our very own, newly built campus in the northern district of Taichung City. Our first semester began with an evaluation by the Department of Education, which we passed with flying colours, and the Department recommends our school to prospective parents! As of September 2008, we opened our first Class 7 and thus the birth of our Junior High School. Future plans are already underway to establish a Waldorf High school (Senior High) and there is solid support from the Parents-Teachers to take this initiative forward. In 2008, Leichuan Waldorf School Orchestra was also founded, consisting of students from Classes 5 - 7. There have been other great developments in the school over the past year and the process of moving the school has had an exceptional effect on building our school community; the Parent-Teachers have grown by leaps and bounds, through workshops, lectures and sharing sessions, to build a strong foundation for the years to come. Last month we celebrated our school's anniversary, in our new campus, with our pupils' performance, a fete and parents sharing session. In July of this year, in co-operation with Ci Xin Waldorf School in Yilan, we plan to hold an educational research seminar to share ideas and experiences gained from our lower, middle and upper school teaching. An impulse has also just been ignited to promote Waldorf- Steiner education in the mainstream education system in Taichung City. This impulse was begun by the Parents As-sociation and has the backing of the College of Teachers, as well as local politicians. It has been two very eventful years for Leichuan and we have gone from strength-to-strength and developed very clear goals for the future. Shan Mei Zhen School & Educational AssociationThis is the 9 th year of our school in Taichung County, Taiwan. We have had very busy and fruitful years. Kindergarten:In 2000, we started a Waldorf nursery school in a small town called Wuci. In 2007 we had our second kindergarten in Taichung. The total number of children in the kindergartens is nearly 200, 30 teachers and staffers are working for these dear children. Grade school:February 2007, we finally registered the grade school. 8The number of children in the school is 48 this year. Now we have 3 classes, grade 1, grade 2 & 3 and grade 4 & 5. We will have 80 students this fall; 15 teachers and staff members are working for the school. Educational Association:In December 2008, Shan Mei Zhen Waldorf Educational Association was established. The main goal of our association is not only promoting anthroposophy, but also trying to blend Taiwanese culture into Waldorf education and applying it to our own children. There are about 100 members. The biggest event that we held was introducing \"London Eurythmy\" to Taiwan; their very first performance and workshop in Taiwan. Challenges:As a new grade school we found that to translate the Waldorf teaching resources into Chinese is urgently needed for the teachers, to further blend our culture with Waldorf education. We hope that all the Waldorf schools in Taiwan can co-operate to establish the \"Chinese Waldorf Teaching-Resources Link\" to share the teaching materials in Taiwan. It will fasten the positive development of Waldorf education in Taiwan as a whole. Also we need to find a new location for our school from grade 1 to 8; that means we need more financial sponsors. We hope the government will pass a new law for \"ideal schools,\" then we can have more freedom and more space to carry on our educational programs. Feng Le School in Taichung CityThe very first Class 1 started in 2001 and is now the Class 8 now at Feng Le School. The school settled in the spring of 2004 by the Feng Le City Park of Taichung City. Hence the name Feng Le which means \"abundant happiness.\" This 6.75 hectar city park liter - ally becomes our campus. Many outdoor activities happen in this park, such as vegetation observations, ball games, and martial art lessons. The school now has only 39 students total, from class 2 to class 9, in four combined classes. We rented some apart - ment buildings and remodeled them into 5 classrooms, one multiple-function room, a library, and a kitchen. We provide organic lunch and afternoon snack to the whole school each day. In the school backyard are student vegetable gardens, 2 goats, 3 ducks and student play ground. This school has no school principal. Financial support is fully by the parents of the students. Now the school has four class teachers and one administrative person and some subject teachers. Each class teacher has a lot of freedom but it is also our challenge: sometimes we lack coordinated direction. Another challenge is that we do not have our own kindergarten, which accounts partly that we don't have class 1 this year. Kaohsiung Initiative Working Group of AnthroposophyKaohsiung is in the southern part of Taiwan. There are three Waldorf Kindergartens and a study group here. The three Kindergartens are Joyful, Wild Bird and Hong-kuang. The first two were transformed to Waldorf style in 2002 and the third in 2008. The study group started in 1997 and has 9continued till now. Members of the study group consisted primarily of teachers and parents from the three Kindergartens mentioned above. Other interested people are also welcomed into the group. April 2008 was a very active month for Kaohsiung area. It sponsored the National Meeting for Waldorf Kindergarten Teachers. In the process of preparation for this meeting, the local teachers learned what it meant to work as a team and how to work together. This activity, by gathering together the Waldorf Kindergarten teachers across the country brought out a form as well as a content for future team work. During the same visit a connection was made with Shu-der University. The seminar, which dealt solely with Waldorf education, was open to the public. In September of 2008, Marjorie Thayer visited the three Waldorf kindergartens in Kaohsiung and worked closely with their teachers and parents. Joyful and Wild Bird have both advanced a big step in their process of transformation. Their experienced teachers are now able to bring new teachers forward; serving both as helpers and as companions. The newly transformed Hong-kuang has gained friendly support from the other two Kindergartens, though it still is struggling and experiencing challenges. During the coming years Kindergarten teachers are ex- pected to visit other Kindergartens as a way of mutual learn-ing and self-growth. Co-operative teacher training programs and short-termed visitor programs from abroad are still very much needed. The Development of Waldorf Education in TaipeiIn Taipei, ideas about Waldorf education were introduced some ten years ago; Waldorf senior teachers from England and New Zealand gave lectures about childcare and pre-school edu - cation. A professional Eurythmy group from Switzerland gave a performance in Taipei. And various visits are still going on. Today, there are two kindergartens (Yidima, Qwangmu) in Taipei which make efforts to educate according to a Waldorf approach. A studio named Zi-Ya-Er gives Taiwanese parents the concepts of anthroposophy in childcare by means of study groups. We are making our way to set up the first Waldorf elementary school in Taipei in the near future. In 2009, there will be a gathering of the Project of Taipei Waldorf School, with the support of Anthroposophical As-sociation\u2014Social Art for Healthy Community (AASAHC). Project of Taipei Waldorf School is one of AASAHC's an-nual programs. We hope that it can be run successfully in this coming September. Workshops and Courses on Waldorf Education at NHCUE, Hsinchu For the past five years, various Waldorf education work- shops and courses have been available for parents, teachers and college students at the National Hsinchu University of Educa - tion. A few colleagues at the NHCUE have been committed to organizing and making arrangements for those learning activities\u2014often in cooperation with other Waldorf education communities in Hsinchu, Yilan and Taichung. Meanwhile, in 2007 and 2008 respectively, the university sent two groups of students and interested participants to the Freie Hochschule, Mannheim, for an intensive summer course, and may continue such projects in the future. In prospect, the NHCUE are seeking to strengthen cooperative relationships with Waldorf education communities and institutions in Taiwan and all over the world. Hopefully, the NHCUE can offer a quality and affordable teacher preparation program in the near future to advance the Waldorf education movement in Taiwan. A Waldorf-inspired Home School in Hsinchu A Waldorf-inspired elementary school will begin in Hsin- chu this August, 2009. The children of this school all come from a home-based Waldorf kindergarten, Sunny Garden. Because there is no Waldorf school in Hsinchu and these parents would like to let their children continue receiving Waldorf education, they are building a study group, holding weekly meetings and looking for teach-ers, consultants and a place to set up the school. So this school is totally founded and supported by parents. They are beginning as a home school because of budget limitations and government laws. They are looking for a trained Waldorf teacher to join the school, with parents taking care of administration and cur - riculum development. The school plans to open on August 31 with 10 first grade students. It is hoped that it will expand by a further grade each year. Wu-Lai Junior High and Elemen- tary School Wu-Lai Junior High and Elementary School is a mountainous school located in Taipei County and there are in total about three hundreds students. About 10eighty percent of them are from Tayal tribe which is one of the aboriginal groups in Taiwan. Aboriginal people are full of passion and are talented in arts, music and sports. However, they get fewer achievements in regular school performance and many of the children are from low social-economic families. Besides, many parents do not pay much attention on the school affairs. Therefore, teachers here need to do more efforts in teaching works and be more patient with their students. The experimental teaching based on multiple intelligences theory was adopted more than three years ago and it was put into practice from kindergarten to the fifth grade. The teaching staff tries hard to learn about Waldorf Education and put it into practice. We have discovered that the students are more confident and get better attainments in learning by way of this approach. We hope to carry out this teaching method from kindergarten to class 9 in the coming 4 years. Live the Question: Don Bosco Foundation for Sustainable Development-- Mindanao , Philippines Ineke van Florenstein Mulder, Christchurch, New Zealand When asked by a class of graduate students in develop- ment management from a university in Davao City what her development strategy was, Betsy Ruizo-Gamela of the Mind - anao Michael Group answered, \"Development work consists basically in being able to help people ask questions and find answers to them and in being able to live these answers. As they live the question, become the question, their very lives trigger the question for others. When we can ask the right question, we also find the right answer and that is one of the most important aspects when developing biodynamic agriculture.\" They asked further: \"What is your development theory?\" To this Betsy replied, \"We do not follow a theory. When I look back, what we did was to facilitate questions. We asked the farmers: \"Why are your yields down and your costs up?\" \"The theory was that the Green Revolution would bring prosperity. If Green Revolution was indeed the answer, why have they become poorer, deeper in debt? We simply ask them how come the experience (abject poverty) d oes not jive with the theory (a promise of prosperity)? So we worked to motivate the farmers to ask questions and then to find answers to the questions. Then we ask the farmers to live their question, so they can find true living answers and in the process, more questions. That is our process of development.\" Betsy Ruizo-Gamela and Romano (Nono) Salazar Laurilla are the two initiative takers of Don Bosco Foundation for Sustainable Development (formerly Don Bosco Diocesan Youth Center) in Makilala, North Cotabato, two hours drive from Davao, Mindanao, in the Philippines. The Don Bosco initiative started in 1990 to promote sustainable agriculture as strategy for rural development focused on farming families. The teaching/training centre is in Batasan, Makilala, North Cotobato. Why the name Don Bosco? In 1986 at a seminar, Betsy was given by a priest a little booklet: \"Great Dreams Come True,\" the life of St. John Bosco, who lived in Turin, Italy in the 19th century and is the patron saint of youth. This booklet inspired Betsy for all the work she has done in her life. Working with youth stands as central in her life. What is now called the Don Bosco Foundation for Sustain - able Development (DBFSD) started formally in 1994. When it started, it had many NGO contemporaries working on sustainable agriculture but mostly confined to organic agriculture practices, all doing their own thing and not working together. The Go vernment of the day continued its aggressive policies and programs promoting the Green Revolution tech - nology package of using synthetic chemical fertilizers, pesticides, hybrid seeds in mono - culture system despite the system's failure f or more than two decades and despite the envi-ronmental and health costs involved. In the beginning nobody took DBFSD seriously as it was so small. They walked and worked quietly among the farming families in the rural villages, facilitating the paradigm shift from chemical-based agriculture to sus - tainable agriculture using the biodynamic methods. It was better that the government and the agrichemical companies did not no-tice the changes they were ushering in. They 11reasoned that the ripe time will come when they shall have cre - ated more than enough anomalies to the existing paradigm of Green Revolution agriculture that cannot anymore be denied by peddlers of chemical-dependent agriculture; when farm-ers themselves shall be the ones announcing and celebrating their liberation. At the very beginning of the initiative, B etsy and Nono did all the workwith the farmers themselves-- teaching, planting, developing the biodynamic methods, etc. But in the year 2 000, t hey went public during the campaign against genetically modi - fied organisms (GMO's). A significant number of their farmer- partners from all over the province of North Cotabato put their weight behind this campaign and people took notice a t what had been built up. From no farmers in 1993 when the extension program began, the number of farmers rose to more than 3,000 in 2000. Largely, the success of their sustainable agriculture program owes much to the applied science of bio-dynamics in agriculture without which they could not have achieved their success. At the beginning of their program in sustain- able agriculture they relied only on organic methods. With the organic methods there had been many arbitrary failures, h owever, in the middle of 1996 after the introduction of biodynamic methods to the farming families in the lowlands, they experience real success. When the biodynamic method for rice growing had been mastered in the low lands with the full range of bio- dynamic preparations now available to the farmers, along with the introduction and use of milk and honey spray i n crops (introduced by Hugh Courtney of the Biodynamic Farming & Gardening Association of the U SA), they went to the uplands into the cornfields. More than two thousand hectares of monoculture corn were converted to organic and biodynamic diversified farms w ith ba- nanas, coconuts, r ubber, fruit trees such as mangos, durian, etc, as alternative to monoculture GE corn. Several local government units around Mindanao heard of these suc-cesses and seeing the results through educational visits, became interested. Till this moment Don Bosco did not work with government and had not wanted to. Finally , after the period of \"pushing\" biodynamic farming, they have come to a stage where they were now \"pulling\" i nterest into biodynamic farming--many local government units, civil society organizations, NGO's, academe and government agencies seek their partnership to be able to learn bio-dynamic agriculture. But a lot of these interests were really pushed by farm-ers who requested from their NGO partners and the government agencies training in biodynamic agriculture with Don Bosco after learning from other farmers about how biodynamic agriculture changed their lives. No w Don Bosco has come to a point where they have forged legis- l ated partnerships with several local government units creating stronger advocacy f or socially and environmentally responsible public interest farming. However, not all local government officials were open to the idea of biodynamic agriculture. In one of the towns of North Cotabato, a government official fought against the accreditation of Don Bosco in the municipality with his per - ception that Don Bosco was really launching an \"economic sabotage\" b y t eaching farmers the alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. However, the success experienced by many farmers cannot be denied. And the local government units could not help but notice because the farmers were the proof that the system works. A number of local government units from all over Mind - anao and even Visayas have undergone training in biodynamic agriculture which begins with Phase I-An Introduction to the Basic Principles and Practices in Sustainable Agriculture, Phase II-Introduction to the Principles and Methods of the Applied Science of Biodynamics in Agriculture (whic h has fundamentals in anthroposophy), a nd Phase 3 -Advances in Quantum Agriculture (where Ayurvedic/Homa Farming, Biodynamics and Anthroposophy are integrated) ... In the municipality of Surallah, South Cotabato, the local government unit has ad-opted Biodynamic Farming as the main strategy in its flagship program and executive agenda to \"rebuild paradise\" through 12its PARAISO program in sustainable agriculture. The local government with the leadership of the Mayor Rumulo Solivio is even starting to build a library/ resource pool in biodynamic agriculture in the municipality and is now in the process of integrating biodynamic agriculture in the curriculum of its community college (Surallah National Agriculture School) and even established Tiangge Organika as the product outlet for organic and biodynamic farm produce of the adopters of PARAISO program which number around 600 farming fami-lies. In the 5th National Organic Agriculture Conference, the Mayor of Surallah presented its biodynamic agriculture pro- g ram referred to as Biodynamic Agriculture, The Surallah Experience where he got a standing ovation. Just recently, this program won recognition as the best LGU initiative on Sustainable Agricul - ture in Region XII. Don Bosco hopes to forge more LGU partnership ventures in the future to advance the advocacy for biodynamic and sustainable agriculture. Regularly Don Bosco is audited by teams appointed by the funders. One time a team came from Europe as they were then assisted by funds from the EU. One woman asked a farmer: \"If bio-dynamics is really good, why isn't every farmer in the community doing it?\" To that the farmer answered: \"Because, madam, good things are very hard to do.\" Indeed, good things are very hard to do and take so much hard work and dedication. Don Bosco has come a long way from a small initiative of young people to become a major stakeholder in the field of sustainable agriculture. T hey have come full circle from production to enterprise development, from seeds to shelves. A t the moment a lot of effort goes into the building up of the marketing of biodynamic produce of the farmers with the aim of balanc- ing service and development of sustainability. D on Bosco has established its own grains center to be able to adhere to the strict standards of organic and biodynamic production. Six shops have already been established and the hope is to open shops in more areas ... S trict internal quality control system, accreditation standards are adhered to from seeds to shelves. A third party certification process is ongoing through the Smallholder Group Certification system. But the challenges of the future are manifold. T here are many threats to the initiatives of sustainable develop - ment. Mindanao is an ideal place for farming as it is virtually typhoon free, the soil is very fertile and it serves as the food Biodynamic workshop with Hans Mulder in Mindinao, Philippines. 13basket for the Philippines. Yet, there are two main threats for the future work; the aggressive development of agribusinesses. They have always occupied the prime agricultural lands, the most fertile lands of the lowlands but as fertility drops in these areas after decades of conventional chemical a griculture regime, they startmoving to the highlands as well. Not only do they compete with the lowland rice farm-ers for the irrigation water supply, the water sources are in danger of pesticide contamination endangering the health of the people.! The human costs of exported banana is very high. There is a high incidence of kidney problems and cancer, near the plantations and among those who have worked in such plantations. There were even c lass action suits from former plantation workers against these banana plantations n umbering by the thousands. Aerial spra ying of pesticides or boom spraying accompany the op- eration of these banana plantations. Aerial spraying of pesti - cides h as been done for many decades that there are countless cases of health problems associated with it globally. T here are villages around banana plantations in other provinces where a larg e percentage of the population are afflicted with skin dis- eases as the pesticide drift from aerial spraying hit even the baby c lothes hanging in clothes lines. Currently, a court battle is being waged at Court of Appeals o ver the constitutionality of the City Ordinance of Davao banning the use of aerial spraying of pesticides in banana plantations. The protagonists are the a ssociation of banana growers and exporters (multina - tional corporations at the helm) and the city government of Davao and the civil society. After the City Ordinance won in the Regional Trial Court, the banana growers and exporters' association appealed the decision with the Court of Appeals where the court decided in favor of the banana growers citing the ordinance was against the constitutional right of businesses to aerial spray. This decision is under motion for reconsideration cit- ing the constitutional right of the natural persons to healthful environment as above the right of the juridical persons to conduct their business. This matter may need to be brought to the Supreme Court for final decision. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the agribusiness companies, the local government will not be able to stop the companies from aerial spraying. T his would establish precedence which will gi ve the corporations the upper hand to question the local ordi - nances and provisions of the Environment Code of North C o- tabato and Bukidnon pro vinces banning aerial spraying of pesticides whic h were painstakingly crafted by stakeholders from government and civil society. The other threat is mining. The State has made it as de - velopment policy and strategy to attract multinational mining companies. Chin a wants minerals and the mining companies lobbied for concessions. Currently, two thirds of the whole of Mindanao is covered with pending applications for mining contracts or agreement. The North C otabato province forbids open pit mining and aerial spraying in its Environment Code. Betsy was par t of the technical working group that crafted and developed a the Code, an environmental policy for the province. Apart from the threats of the future, the specific c hal- lenges for thebiodynamic initiative of Don Bosco Founda- tion for Sustainable Development are establishing the local production of the biodynamic preparations, developing a local farmer's market for organic and biodynamic produce in every public market, supporting all other biodynamic initia- tives not directly within the area of operation Don Bosco and finally, spreading the knowledge of anthroposophy , the basis for the spiritual renewal of agriculture. T he first challenge will n eed production of the herbs which need to be acclimatized to tropical Philippines, a real big challenge. W hile Betsy's group ha ve discovered local Philippine oak, local equisetum variety (e. ramossisimum), the same they have yet to successfully grow Chamomilla matricaria. If they will be able to produce and make accessible the biodynamic preparations at very affordable prices, Betsy hopes to be able to facilitate faster the spread of biodynamic agriculture. Knowing the commitment and the will of Betsy's Mindanao Michael Group and Don Bosco Foundation for Sustainable Development this is exactly what they dream to accomplish in the not so distant future. The Near-Death Experience: A Glimpse of a Positive Life After Death By Katrina Ann C. Tan, Manila, Philippines The perennial query in most people's minds is, \"What happens to us when we die? Do we merely disintegrate into nothingness, as theorized by materialistic science? Or does a part of us, by some divine means, continue to live on beyond physical death, as taught by various religions and philoso - phies of the times?\" Consider the following narration taken from Raymond A. Moody's Life after life: the investigation of a phenomenon---survival of bodily death: \" A man is dying and, as he reaches the point of greatest physical distress, he hears himself pronounced dead by his doctor. He begins to hear an uncomfortable noise, a loud ringing or buzzing, and at the same time feels himself moving very rapidly through a long, dark tunnel. After this, he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical body, but still in the immediate physical environment, and he sees his own body from a distance, as though he is a spectator. He watches the resuscitation attempt from his unusual vantage point and is in a state of emotional upheaval. After a while, he collects himself and becomes more accustomed to his odd condition. He notices that he still has a 'body', but one of a very different nature and with very different powers from the physical body he has left behind. Soon other things begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help him. He glimpses the spirits of relative and friends who have 14already died, and a loving, warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered before---a being of light--- appears before him. This being asks him a question, nonverbally, to make him evaluate his life and helps him along by showing him a panoramic, instantaneous playback of the major events of his life. At some point he finds himself approaching some sort of barrier or border, apparently representing the limit between earthly life and the next life. Then, he finds that he must go back to earth, that the time for his death has not yet come. At this point, he resists, for by now he is taken up with his experiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love, and peace. Despite his attitude, though, he somehow reunites with his physical body and lives. Later, he tries to tell others but he has trouble doing so. In the first place, he can find no human words adequate to describe these unearthly episodes. He also finds that others scoff, so he stops telling other people. Still, the experience affects his life profoundly, especially his views about death and its relationship to life.\" The aforementioned account is the true story, more than eight million people from different walks of life across the globe have universally lived to tell. It is the profound spiritual-scientific phenomenon that gives us a glimpse of a positive life after death--- The Near-Death Experience. The near-death experience (NDE), a term coined by Raymond A. Moody, Ph.D., M.D., in 1975, is basically used to describe a spiritual occurrence that happens to people who almost die, or go through actual clinical death and then come back to life after being revived. Despite the recent founding of the term, it has been ascertained that near-death experi-ences are not at all contemporary occurrences. Neither are they exclusive to a certain age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, or religious group. Such spiritual episodes have been in existence from the time of the ancient philosopher Plato who, in his Republic, wrote about a B.C. Greek soldier's brush with death. They are even mentioned in Aztec, Celtic, Native American, and Polynesian literatures, as well as in the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of the Dead---compilations of centuries-old teachings in ancient Egypt and Tibet's prehistory. In addi - tion, portions of near-death elements are scattered in various medieval Christian writings. NDE testimonials of that time include those recorded by Saint Benedict, Pope Gregory the Great, and The Venerable Bede. In the Philippines, accounts resembling the near-death experience emanating from myths and other tribal narratives of the Bontocs, the Mamanuas of northeastern Mindanao, and the Ifugaos are among those which have been reported and documented. Contemporary NDE accounts include those undergone by adults, children, infants (a 9-month old baby who had un-dergone cardiac arrest narrated his experience at age 7), blind people (yes, blind people can \"see\" during an NDE), gays and lesbians, Catholics, Christians, Muslims, Jewish people, atheists, agnostics, priests and religious individuals. Even celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor, Ozzy Osbourne, and Sharon Stone have had such a spiritual experience. Today, with the influx of modern NDE accounts in books, journals, television shows, motion pictures and the internet, more and more people are familiar with the phrase \"light at the end of the tunnel\", as the near-death experiences of various individuals give humanity a deeper understanding of death and the afterlife. Indeed, the near-death experience is an inspirational glimpse of a positive spiritual life after physical death. It has The Near Death Experience as a Glimpse of a Positive Life After Death - Katrina Ann C. Tan, 2007 5 x 11 feet (irregularly-shaped), Oil on canvas, Katrina's thesis painting on the near-death experience symbolically portrays the key elements of the NDE namely, Feeling intense physical pain or stress followed by the out-of-body experience; Going through the tunnel; Being lovingly embraced by Divine Light; Having a life-review; Coming to a border or limit and returning to earthly life, and; Being a deeply renewed individual after the experience.15the capacity to instill in the present materialistic society the much needed spiritual awareness that death is a fact only in the physical world, and that by some divine means, a part of a person continues to live on beyond worldly death. Katrina Ann C. Tan The Peaceful Bamboo Family Ha Vinh Tho, Switzerland The Peaceful Bamboo Family is a vocational training com- munity for youngsters living with mental disability, as well as a training center for special education and social therapy. This community also develops organic agriculture and wants to promote a responsible life style respecting the spiritual, cultural, social and natural environment. Saturday evening, April 11 2009, we welcomed the Swiss delegation with almost 30 friends, most of them professionals in the field of special education and social therapy. After a festive dinner in the inner courtyard, the guests shared their experiences working and living with disabled children and adults, and spoke about the Camphill Movement, an international organization that has been a pioneer in this field. It was an inspiring evening for our team from the Peaceful Bamboo Family. Easter Sunday, our team worked late and got up early to prepare everything for the ceremony that begun at 7:30 AM. It is a lovely morning, and the sun is shining bright and hot. The Swiss delegation has come with a bus to Tu Hieu Monastery, the root temple of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, and they have walked for 10 minutes through fields and bamboo groves from the temple to the Center. The altar is filled with fruits, flowers and other traditional offerings, and a delegation of monks from Tu Hieu monastery, supported by three head nuns from other local temples, recite sutras and prayers to bless the Center. A deceased friend has donated the funds to buy the vegetable garden and we have engraved a stone to commemorate her, the monks bless the stone to honor her memory. I give a short talk in the name of the team, the Swiss friends perform Eurythmy and sing in a choir. Everyone shares a tasty breakfast with traditional Hue cakes and homemade jam from our workshop with the youngsters. Then we all go for a walking meditation to Tu Hieu monastery. This is only a summary of the visible activities of this wonderful morning. The most important event is made up of the relationships that are created between people, cultures and traditions that meet in a spirit of respect, mutual tolerance and appreciation and this sets the tone for the spirit of our Community. The next day the first curative education and social therapy conference begins, as a starting point of the ongoing training facility that the Center wants to develop. About 80 participants have come together: special teachers from the seven schools that Eurasia has created, professors from the department of education of the Hue University, educators and therapists from Switzerland and the team from the Peaceful Bamboo Fam - ily. The participants divide in several workshops and explore various pedagogical and therapeutic activities: painting, music, Eurythmy, physical therapy, special education, Padovan method. After these practical experiences, several round table conversa-tions offer an opportunity to share and exchange on questions and challenges as a special educator. This first conference confirms the needs of educators to have more opportunities to share and learn together, and to be offered continuing training in their field. On Tuesday the official inauguration time has arrived. Since Monday afternoon, the whole team, supported by many vol-unteers has worked hard to prepare everything for this event. A tent is put up in the courtyard, there are so many colorful flowers everywhere, and large banners announce the event. Teachers dressed in traditional Ao Dai welcome the guests and Dedication ceremony at the new Peaceful Bamboo Family facility in Vietnam.16show them to their seats under the tent. More than 200 people have come for the opening ceremony and the Swiss Ambassa-dor Jean-Hubert Lebet has come from Hanoi. The youngsters from the Center open the ceremony with a Vietnamese and a French song. Some officials hold speeches, including the Swiss Ambassador and the deputy chairman of the province, there is a symbolic cutting of the ribbon and the Swiss delegation offers choir singing. We then visit the Center and have an informal time to socialize and exchange around a delicious buffet. The sky has been good to us during these days; the weather was perfect, with sunshine in the morning and a refreshing rain in the afternoon. There was a threefold opening ceremony of the Peaceful Bamboo Family, representing three dimensions of the com- munity: The spiritual dimension on Sunday with traditional rituals The human dimension on Monday based on sharing, learning from one another and open dialogue The social and material dimension on Tuesday, with the participation of the authorities and the representatives of the political institutions. We are very thankful that so many generous and compas- sionate people have come together to support this project, and this wonderful beginning is an inspiration to develop our work for the wellbeing of disabled youngsters.Buildings at the new Peaceful Bamboo Family facility in Vietnam. The Roshni Project in PakistanShahida Perveen Hannesen, Lahore, Pakistan \"The whole of humanity is one body. If one organ is ill, the whole body is suffering.\" -- Dschalaludin Rumi In March we celebrated eight years of work at Roshni. Now Roshni is well known in Lahore. Around 75 special persons have received the light of Roshni (Roshni is the local word for light). More than 70 guests from Germany have been living here for shorter or longer periods. So Roshni Project is fulfilling its mission: \"Gottes ist der Orient, Gottes ist der Okzident...\" (\"God is with the East and also the West . . .\" -- Holy Quran,) We have now 43 persons with special needs working in four workshops, textile, wood, bakery and gardening. Nine of them are living in our first community house. We have quite a few on the waiting list for residential care. For them we are building a second living unit. We have planted more than 300 trees, we have 25 staff, two buffaloes, 4 geese, 60 hens, 11 cats, a donkey and many flowers. Four volunteers from Germany are helping us. A social therapist from Germany, Dirk Kruse 17came for three weeks to train our staff. We have also started a project of solid waste management and composting in the neighbouring villages. This is very much welcomed by the lo-cal villagers. Last week we had harvesting celebrations. After prayer and accompanied by drums the wheat has been cut by hand. Many special persons and school children have taken part actively. The Green Earth Roshni School is also growing. From Kindergarten up to grade 5 we have now 98 children. Nine teachers are busy with me in the school. We were lucky to have two experienced Waldorf teachers visiting us and working with us in this school year. A parent/teacher Group from Bad Nauheim Waldorf School has made and sent 20 harps for the children. One of our volunteers is practicing harp and recorder with all the children. Recently we had a workshop on puppets with the help of another German guest. A few days ago we received a young German farmer from Berlin University. He will help us to improve and extend our organic farming and gardening at Roshni. Together with my husband Hellmut Hannesen we have started an anthroposophical study group with the coworkers so that they understand more about the background of this work. There is also a lot of interest in the city that Roshni, being outside the city, should get active in town and start social therapy and a Waldorf school there. A new Kindergarten inititave has started in Lahore. A good friend of mine was impressed by Waldorf education. She did a training course in Toronto, Canada and came back recently. Now she started a Kindergarten with the help of two teach-ers who trainned in Roshni. They have beautiful premises, wooden toys, stuffed animals, and puppets from Roshni. This Kindergarten is meant for well off, educated families. Of course you are all aware of the political situation in Pakistan. We are also concerned about this development. We are thankful to God that in our area it is rather peaceful and we do not feel disrupted in our work. The Redemptive Art of Drama Robyn Hewetson, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand The importance of drama to the Ancient Greeks can be seen in how they fashioned their theatres for the performance of plays. The huge amphitheatres were open to the great, natural lights of sun, moon and stars. The seats ranged round, rising higher with each row, so that every person could see all the action, and could hear every word. These plays were put on for the entire community. People did not pay to attend them, everyone came for free. The beauty and grandeur, the acoustic wonder of these places for plays indicates how much effort the community put into creating a space for drama in their lives. The actors prepared in four fundamental ways. Beside the theatre was a large arena where the sand was raked to about 18 inches. Here the actors trained in the five traditional Greek gymnastic arts of running, jumping, wrestling, discus throwing and spear throwing. These especially dynamic activities helped train the actors' bodies to be able to bear the word and to carry the roles of the great classical dramas. Hence the first role of an actor was to become an excellent athlete. Of course, they then had to learn the long speeches of the dramas and to declaim them to a large audience. These plays were long, as were Shakespeare's plays over a thousand years later. So they had to develop an incredible faculty of memory for both word and action. Thus they needed to develop the craft of acting. Near the theatre a temple was also built. Here the great rituals of reverence to the gods took place. Who were the priests and priestesses of the temple? They were the same people who were the athletes and the actors. The connection between drama and the spiritual world was understood as an integral part of the \"Plays\" of that time. The Greeks knew that an actor's task was filled with spiri- tual responsibility. It is the arts from which we learn \"Response Ability.\" No other art prepares one quite so much for flexibility of response as the performing arts! Also near to the complex of theatre, arena and temple, there would be a hospital. Who were the Physicians and Healers? They were the same people. Therefore the Actors had to be healthy and athletic, spiritually developed and able to serve the sacraments to the gods, and they were the healers of the people. Thus Actors in Greek plays had all four roles, of athletic ability, craftsmen of the art of acting, priestly tasks and the ultimate task of healing. What a tremendous picture this can be for us today! For a person who is teaching as a class teacher or in high school what a difference it would make if they considered for a mo-ment that it might be possible to work with the children so they could experience even a little of what truly stands behind this mighty work of becoming an actor or of helping to put on a play for the community. Peter Bridgemont in his book \"Liberation of the Actor\" states that when movie making first began they copied the Theatre, and that was comic. But today theatres copy the movie makers, and that is tragic. Today, even in our schools, our plays are heavily influenced by what we see on the manifold screens of our daily lives. Much is done to interest the eye, and often way to little is done to even consider the needs of the ear. Today we still call theatre goers an \"audience\" as even the word remembers that it is what is heard that is of ulti - mate importance. Spectacles belonged more to the Roman coliseums where the mob was entertained with bloody, visual spectacles. It is often notable in our education today how many children have to wear glasses (spectacles) before they reach puberty. Could this be a result of an over education of the eye? Certainly the ears of the children are either under great assault from the huge decibel level of the daily noise they are surrounded by, or neglected by under educating the 18true needs of the ear. Today memory illnesses are amongst the most severe to attack our elder citizens. Could good, healthy drama help to heal some of these ailments? Teaching children by ear, instead of by eye, learning by memory, training the body to move with skill and grace on the stage, and directing plays knowing that it is for the audience and not for the other actors that we design stage movement would go a long way to correcting some of this. This neglect is often the case, even in Waldorf schools and anthroposophic com-munities where so many of Steiner's principles have come into common practice. Many of our children have the life giving art of eurythmy included in their weekly schooling. Many schools employ a school doctor who prescribes natural homeopathic remedies. Our children receive the Extra Lesson and Art or Music Therapy. Many attend Christian Communities and many more eat Bio-Dynamic food. But the last of Steiner's gifts to us, brought in the last year of his life, the work he gave on how to put on a play and how to prepare for the mighty task of representing another human being or a dialogue between people on stage has been largely forgotten. Recently I went to the Arts Festival in Dunedin, New Zea- land. I had been thinking of saving my money to come back to the USA for a visit, and then I thought, \"No, I will go and see what is happening to drama in New Zealand.\" Dunedin is a small city at the southern end of New Zealand, but home to an excellent university community and home to a great deal of theatre and the arts. One of the most established theatres put on a very challenging version of Jane Eyre. I went to see it. On going back to my hotel I realised that I would not be happy with seeing a good play only once and on the next morn - ing returned to the theatre to purchase another ticket. It was a Sunday morning and many of the actors were there, as was the director. They asked me what I wanted, and I said I was back to buy a ticket. \"But weren't you here last night?\" One of them asked. \"Yes,\" I said, \"and that is why I want to come back.\" We began a warm and friendly conversation. Going out for coffee together I thought I would see what they would think of some of Steiner's indications about stage directions. So I asked if they were up to a conversation about staging. \"Go ahead!\" said the director. I launched into a description of Steiner's advice that all drama has to be directed from the point of view of the audience. I spoke of the task of the actor to turn the audience into participators, not spectators. Steiner points out that if a dialogue takes place on stage it has to be arranged so that the audience clearly sees the face and reactions of the speaker, so that they feel the actor is speaking right to them. When this happens, the imagination of the audience is aroused, and they participate in the unfolding of the drama. I demonstrated this with a small piece of their play. All of them were looking at me with their chins on their chests! One said, \"I have always felt this, but we are never taught it at act - ing school.\" The director said, \"I would never have thought I would learn anything from Steiner.\" Imagine my delight when I returned to the theatre later that day to see they had changed some of the staging! When the play was over, some of the actors whispered at me as I left, \"Did you see that? Did we do it right?\" I was overjoyed. As with many of the other indications Steiner gave, for early childhood, for nutrition, for meditation, the indications for the actor and for the process of putting on a play are full of common sense ideas. Just as in the \"Philosophy of Freedom\" where Steiner makes the prosaic remark that the brain produces thoughts every bit as much as a jug produces the milk, in the speech and drama work which was carried on by Marie Steiner and then handed on to people like Maisie Jones, my teacher, there are wonderful treasures to be found. Steiner points out that all acting is made up of three parts: the words, the gestures, the movement. He speaks of the folly of beginning with movement. However, most plays, even Waldorf school plays begin with \"blocking.\" Steiner points out that in Shakespeare's plays there are almost no directions. (Except for 'The Winter's Tale, which has my favourite stage direction of all time: 'Exit, Man being eaten by a bear.') This is because the actors had first to learn all their lines. No act-ing can begin until the actor has taken all the import of the words into his own soul. Only then can the actor find the gestures which go with the words. When word and gesture have united, then - and only then - can the movement on stage be rightly found. Steiner speaks of the play already existing in a spiritual The teacher training course at Taruna College in New Zealand performs an annual play as part of their speech and drama training.19condition far above our heads, and that as we learn the words the play begins its gradual journey to the earth. We learn the words and begin to feel what we would do with our hands and arms. The play descends further. As we find the stage move - ment the play meets the earthly and the actor stands fully in the play. Isn't it so simple? It is so obvious, and yet it is like other great riddles - something that is hidden in plain view. Test out an audience with a small group of players who learn a play in this way, who use the golden triangle of staging, making sure the speaker faces the audience and the listeners of the dialogue face the speaker - and observe what it does to the audience. Invariably the audience responds by saying things like, \"What wonderful actors!\" or \"I heard every word,\" and \"What a wonderful play.\" Why is this? Because the audience was so engaged they brought their own imagination to meet the inspired speech of the actors. They then saw the play they created together. In this way both the actors and the audience are healed. This is the great magic of the theatre\u2014it is a redemptive art! One of the my greatest wishes is that Steiner's work on drama will be discovered by our school communities and used to enliven, bring healing and well being to us all. The Gifts of Storytelling Cindy Sydow, Honolulu, Hawai'i I have hardly said hello before I hear the words, \"tell me a story!\" My nearly four year-old grandchild, Maryam, has been greeting me this way for a number of months now. \"Just a minute,\" I reply, my mind already searching through the images of the past day or so for a story theme, \"I need a little more time to cook one for you.\" I manage a few warm greetings to her twin baby brothers and to her mother, my daughter, but Maryam knows that a story is on the way. She is looking at me and smiling. As I sit on a large cushion and take her on my lap, this very active, effervescent girl settles down like a bird in its nest. Her clear brown eyes look into mine and I am reminded anew of the joy and responsibility of presenting a story to a young child. The years that I have spent as an early childhood teacher have helped me to become familiar with the elements of sto-rytelling and how it plays such an important role in a child's overall development. Waldorf Education is premised on a holistic approach to child development that includes body, soul, and spirit. Just as a growing child needs healthy food for her body, she also needs healthy nourishment for her soul and spirit. At the very heart of a child's relationship to the world is her own inner life of imagination. In the Waldorf Early Childhood curriculum this central capacity is nurtured through the use of age-appropriate stories and fairy tales. Fairy tales embody a perennial wisdom, the fruit of an ancient spiritual-ity. Authentic folk and fairy tales contain a moral catalyst that can be released into the child's imaginative life through the art of storytelling. By providing this gift we are helping young children to tap into their own inner wellsprings of imagination that can then flow spontaneously into their play, providing an important source of enjoyment and meaning. Storytelling becomes a nurturing art when the teller is able to transmit wisdom lovingly through words and gesture. Children's play is intimately connected to their ability to imagine. In the \"magical years of childhood\" (around ages three to five), children are able to transform and enchant the simplest things in their social and physical environment. By doing so, they are discovering an inner source of adventure that provides meaning to their lives. For example, Maryam sees her mother cooking each day. She then finds her own pots and pans outside and forages among the garden plants for the \"spices\" that her recipe requires. All the while she is softly singing to herself. If I enter the scene, I am given instructions on who I am to be and what I am to do to assist in the ongoing preparations. I am then, almost always, the one required to do the \"eating\" of the prepared dishes, unless there is some other lucky player nearby. This wonderful capacity to imagine tends to be missing in children who have been exposed to too much electronic entertainment. \"Teachers report that children in our electronic society are becoming alarmingly deficient in generating their own images and ideas.\"[Fool's Gold: A Critical Look at Com-puters and Childhood] Children become bored easily due to the consequent lack of integration and heartfelt connection to the world around them. They may feel empty, confused, and angry and their lives may reflect this through immature and antisocial behaviors. This will have long-term consequences not only personally but for the whole of our society. Storytelling starts in infancy. A baby hears his mother sing - ing the same song while she bathes him each day. Then she speaks softly to him as she dresses him. Even though the baby does not yet comprehend the meaning of his mother's words, there is a mysterious and vital interchange going on between the two of them. The quality of her mood, the way that she is touching her child, the human love living in her voice: these elements and more are not only helping the baby to learn about language, they are the beginnings of his discovery of 20his own unique \"story\" in relation to all that lives around him. The baby is being welcomed into the human community in the most intimate of ways. Nursery rhymes told or sung are perfect first stories for very young children. Singing or humming while housework is being done is a wonderful way for a parent or caregiver to reassure and be in communication with a little one while practical needs are being met nearby. A nearly endless supply of finger plays is available from all over the world. These little stories, poems and songs are accompanied by finger movements, hand gestures, and rhyth-mic elements that help the child to participate fully and to be actively engaged with the adult in the \"telling\" of the story. In the kindergarten, finger plays usually begin the story time session for they get everyone to focus together in an enjoy-able way. The stage is then set for the story about to be told. When the story begins, it is the quality of the teacher's voice and the mood she creates as she tells the story that brings to life the imaginations for the listening children. Very short, simple tales that have repeated elements like \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\" or \"The Gingerbread Boy\" are perfect for preschool-age children. Children often ask to be told the story over and over for they are just beginning to form the inner imaginations of the story and they greatly enjoy knowing what is coming next. Lately, my grandchild Maryam has been asking for a story that has been \"cooked\" by me. I interpret this to mean a story that is made up. \"Grandma, tell me a boy story,\" she may say, or \"tell me a story about a turtle.\" Sometimes I feel caught off guard and cannot find my way and have to say something like, \"there is no more fire to cook with right now so let's sing a song!\" Often she protests and begs for \"just a little one.\" I have discovered in my quest for simple stories for a three-to-four-year-old a wealth of material right in or near her home. Stories that recreate activities from their own lives are perfect for telling to young children. They love to hear the details of bread baking that happened yesterday morning, or the little red cardinal that visits the neighbor each day and waits and waits on the roof to be fed its daily feast of cashew nuts! Once we start really paying attention, there are so many possibilities for wonderful, simple stories right in front of us each day. And don't forget to sprinkle in humor! It works like leaven in bread. I have a collection of these kinds of stories that I have written down and saved to use in my kindergarten. Some of them are longer nature stories perfect for five- and- six- year- olds, where a real event from the kingdom of nature is described, giving emphasis to the unique \"personality\" of each individual character. There is the tale of the \"robber cat\" who daily stole our good hen's eggs until we finally outsmarted him or the one about the wild boars who ate avocados in the moonlight right outside my daughter's bedroom window, and how upsetting it was for our little dog. Children enjoy hearing these kinds of stories for they are entertaining, but more importantly, they are loved by me and are intimately connected to my life. By telling my stories to them, I am sharing my understandings and experiences of our world with them. This is what Maryam is seeking in her voracious appetite for stories, not only her Grandmother's loving attention but more information about the world around her in a way that is digestible, so that she can begin to weave together a comprehensible picture of life's meaning and eventually make her way into her own desti - ny. Modern children, especially those living in urban areas, are born into a mostly manmade world. The growing global ecology crisis is the consequence of our human alienation from nature. More than ever, our children need to be taken out into nature, on walks in parks, trails, beaches and also wild places. They need to experience plants and animals, water and rocks, stars and clouds for themselves. The realm of nature helps us to breathe deeper, helps our senses and our hearts to open and our minds to reflect, and provides endless play and story opportunities. Interesting items found in nature can be brought home and collected in a special box or placed on a nature table to be enjoyed together. The day's explorations can then be remembered at dinner time together or as a bed time story. In time, our children may tell these stories to their own children! And remember, stories, those gifts of imagination, bring great joy to the teller as well. Young children's healthy development today will in the future metamorphose into attributes that will make it possible for them to unfold their creative talents and make valuable contributions to social and cultural life. \"The power to generate playfully one's own images and to transform them in the mind's eye, later become the capacity to play with challenging mathematical, scientific, and cultural concepts in ways that create new insights.\" [Fool's Gold, Ibid.] Focus: International Initiative Forum Dornach, Switzerland. April 5-9, 2010. There is a community of individuals who have agreed to re-imagine the world. Some have taken up their tools as craftsmen, sculpting and forming the substance of the earth. Some are grappling with the thought forms that hold us to the present image of the world, and are attempting to free these thoughts from their entrapment. Some are searching on hidden pathways for the heartland' s language. They are all artists and all have different tasks. They recognise each other as essential for the activity of re-constituting existence. All argument has ceased, and the roles played are recog-nised. This is a new sister-brother-hood. It seeks to bring the imagination of the future beyond the narrowness of the present picture by breathing heart heat into the ice of today to create the water of tomorrow... Over the last 10 years, the YouthSection has been hold- ing regular International Initiative Meetings. During this time, various individuals and numerous initiatives around 21the world have contributed to the expansion of a nameless network. In 2010, a slightly different kind of initiative meeting will take place at the Goetheanum. It will be born out of the meetings of the past, but will aim to make space for what is streaming towards us from the future. It feels full and ripe and ready. Like we are pregnant midwives. Like there has been so much work in the garden of this place. Like we've learned enough that we can be a community without a place. Like we've learned to grow our own food where we need to be. Like there is an uncertainty of course, but maybe it' s a healthy amount of uncertainty, and a healthy amount of self-reliance...we are professionals... This network crosses borders - it goes beyond the Youth- Section, beyond youth. It rings out in the world like a bell. It shines on all, for all, without favoritism, like the Sun. Like many suns. Like the word \"Yes.\" It unites and includes everyone. Next year, therefore, the initiative meeting will seek to expand in accordance with the expansion of the network as a whole. It will open its doors to all - youth, as well as 'older' people - who feel a connection to this no-name network. This meeting will attempt to consolidate, strengthen and celebrate the existing active network. It will also make space for others who feel connected to this work. We welcome, therefore, everyone who has been to previous initiative meetings, as well as those who'll be attending for the first time - all present and future initiative takers. Focus: International Initiative Forum hopes to strengthen the space between all those who are, or who are seeking to be, active in the world out of this force -who strive with re-sponsibility, and with trust. It aims to build up the substance between all human beings who feel a connection to this 'invis-ible' network. A tree has been growing gradually over the years, forming deeper roots, a stronger trunk, and higher branches... We hope to recognise and work with that which already exists, as well as create together, as active co-responsible participants, a space for that which is 'not yet,' including new initiatives. Focus will be a festival of the world which poses the ques - tions: What is being asked of us now? How can we support each other - as individuals, as well as initiatives? And, How can we bring about a more focused co-working for the future - for the world? In addition, it asks: Can we find questions that transcend our specific work and life situations, and carry our co-learning back into our daily lives? In a time of so-called crisis, there are many themes that affect us all. Whether your interests are money or meditation, can we meet at a place where what affects us all can move towards a common activity which is strengthened by acknowledging our differences? Are there ways to work that move beyond these differences to a culture of care and support which can be carried into our individual life and work?

Tan East Meets West Breathing Light: A New Yoga of the SensesNotes from talks by Florian Sydow http://www.scribd.com/doc/17443337/East-Meets-West-July-11 The Art of Education and Medicine The Role of Integrating the Artistic within the Curriculum as a Heal-ing Force for Education.A Kolisko Conference, July 15-21, 2010St Ignatius College, SydneyContact: Sue Scott, PO Box 112, Pennant Hills, 1715 NSW Australia Biodynamic workshop with Hans in Hawai'i Paul G Haygood, Honolulu, Hawai'i It was a very special experience to be reading Sergei Pro- kofieff 's newly translated Anthroposophy and the Philosophy of Freedom during the author's recent, first time visit to Hawai'i. The text and the diagrams helped to clarify and deepen the importance of Rudolf Steiner's seminal philosophical work while Sergei's earnestness and enthusiasm in person were es - pecially enlivening. Here was a new friend speaking not about Anthroposophy, but out of Anthroposophy. His lectures and conversations demonstrated many years of leading-edge research while one-on-one conversations with him were warm and friendly. Here was a man who had grown up under Soviet, iron-curtain oppression, and whose subsequent life seemed a celebration of modern Christian esotericism. Sergei Prokofieff first visited the island of Maui where he viewed a sunrise atop Haleakala (which means \"House of the Sun,\" in Ha - waiian), a sacred site and 10,000 foot tall, dormant volcano cra - ter. On the slopes of Haleakala stands a Waldorf school of the same name where a meeting with mem-bers and friends took place. Between speak - ing engagements, Ser - gei could be found 40 yards offshore fully engaged in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, was like his youthful summers spent swim - ming in the Black Sea. Sergei began his visit to the busy O'ahu Island with a spon - taneous and vigorous hike up the inside crater wall of world-famous Diamond Head. The 360-degree view from the highest point is magnificent, and affords one a detailed overview of the green mountain ridges, the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu, and the multi-hued greens and blues of the ocean and sky. This was a good start to a visit to the islands. The subsequent two days were spent with friends as tour guides, alternating among sightseeing, meeting the local An-throposophical and Waldorf communities and, of course, a daily swim in the ocean. Author, artist, teacher and local Society chairperson, Van James, showed Sergei some of the sacred sites of ancient O'ahu, as detailed in his guidebook. The formal visit in Honolulu began with a conversation with members and friends at the Society Center in Manoa Valley, near the University of Hawai'i. There the discussion ranged from a brief biographical look at growing up and studying anthroposophy under the watchful eyes of the KGB, to reflections on the differences between East and West, and the nature of esoteric study in today's contemporary world. The following day, a all-day conference took place at the Kahumana residential community on the west side of the island. Sergei's morning lecture focused on the historical de - velopment of the being Anthroposophia and the emergence of new group souls who can respect human freedom. Both of these aspects are related to the task of renewing and ex-ternalizing the Michael School on the earth, beginning with a study of Rudolf Steiner's work and a subsequent enlivening of heart-thinking with help from the Foundation Stone Medita-tion. After a tasty lunch, Florian Sydow presented a detailed power-point description of the esoteric foundations and back - ground of our work. Local eurythmist and master-gardener, Paula Lee, led us in some eurythmy, a moving celebration of yet another aspect of Rudolf Steiner's work. In the late afternoon lecture, Sergei Prokofieff shared his most recent research concerning Rudolf Steiner's major con - tribution to modern Christian evolution and the mystery of Golgotha, that of the \"Five Commu - nions.\" As this ma-terial is detailed and complicated, we will patiently await the English translation of his new book, due out in the next year or so. After an evening conversation with a small group, this warm, full and enriching day with Sergei Prokofieff drew to a close in this rural community setting. On Sunday morning, Sergei gathered with members of the School of Spiritual Science back at the Society Center. Wearing a full suit jacket and tie in the sub-tropical weather, he presented a rendering of the sixteenth Class Lesson and then, following a short break, he shared an illuminating over - view of the entire nineteen Lessons with us. At this time, one could enter the earnest mood of living esotericism. Following a friendly potluck lunch and afternoon rest, Sergei returned once more for a last swim in the central Pacific Ocean waters of Hawai'i. We look forward to a future visit and renewed meetings with this remarkable representative of the work of anthroposophy in the world. 23 R S S A 2 0 0 9 N A T I O N A L C O N F E R E N C E A five-day conference that will transform your teaching.

Dr. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler will be the keynote speaker ad - dressing the theme of R eading the Needs of Children and Understanding the Stages of Human Development--Birth to Age 21. This conference, named for Eugen Kolisko (1893-1939), is intended for doctors, nurses, therapists, teach-ers, e ducators and interested parents. Dr. Kolisko was the school doctor for the first Waldorf School and he worked closely with Rudolf Steiner on extending health care practices for school age children. Kolisko conferences explore the ways in which therapeu - tic medicine and Waldorf educational practice can mutually fructify the ways that teachers, doctors and therapists work with and understand the growth and development of children. How can we meet children with true and accurate assessment, diagnosis, medical interventions, and educational programs that are integrated in a holistic manner? How can the knowl - edge available to modern naturally-extended medicine be made available to teachers so that they can better work as artists of education, helping the development of thinking, feeling and will in children? Can the work of the classroom teacher help the ways that medical practitioners work with and understand children? Specifically how are we meeting the needs of chil-dren through education and medicine? In addition to Dr. Gl\u00f6ckler's morning lectures, the conference will present a wide range of group sessions and workshops by international presenters. Both medical and pedagogical themes will be offered, as well as combinations of the two. There will be scheduled time for grade level and special interest meetings, optional excursions, and cultural presentations. [] Conference fee: US$200, includes snacks, 3 lunches and 2 dinners.

Polynesian Cultural Center. (Some entrance fees may apply). Workshops:Group A (Morning) A1. The Study of Man and the Teachers` Meditations as a Source of Healing in Education with Ben Cherry Anthroposophy itself is therapy. The search for deeper understanding changes the way we are and becomes a source of insight, inspiration and vitality. In this workshop we will find in the Study of Man and the two Teachers` Meditations given by Rudolf Steiner, a source of practical healing for our work as teachers. Main format: short presentations and conversation. A2. Eurythmy for Developmental Milestones: The 7 and 9 Year Old Child with Anne Cook 25How do we know if a child has successfully completed their pre-seven work and is ready for classroom learning? Can we help each student be ready for and complete the nine year change? What can we do to support children during these crucial developmental periods? We will explore how thera-peutic, hygienic and pedagogical eurythmy can help strengthen students so they can overcome their challenges. Please bring eurythmy shoes for this active and fun workshop. A3. On the Conference Theme with Michaela Gl\u00f6cklerA4. The Plays the Thing! with Robyn HewetsonAn introduction to Rudolf Steiner's indications for put- ting on a play; participants will gain an understanding of the threefold approach to learning one's part. The goal for the play will be: \"To Hear Every Word!\" A5. The Waldorf Classroom as Therapeuticum: How does the Waldorf Curriculum Address the Different Learning Styles of Our Students? with Paul Gierlach Children with different learning styles (learning differences) challenge all teachers to become more conscious of their work. We will look at this concern as we seek to make a learning environment for all children who choose a Waldorf education. A6. Lessons in Human Biology - A Key to the Way Young People Understand Themselves with Peter Glasby We live in a world, where despite prom- ising breakthroughs in natural science, the pervading paradigm is neo-Darwinian. It lives as an implicit conclusion unconsciously in the communication and the language of our time. Unconscious conclusions work deeply into the souls of young people and the lessons on human biology should be lessons that awaken wonder and reverence for the human being, not cynicism and despair. The biology lessons of grades 7, 8 and 9 can awaken a wonder for the human body and its place in Nature. The biology lessons of the upper high school have the potential to penetrate existential questions about the evolution of humanity in a way that does justice to the potential freedom of the hu - man spirit. This workshop will have presenta-tions, experiments, opportunity for discussion and dialogue, and will be flexible to the needs of the participants. A7. You are Funnier than You Look: Cul- tivation of the Comic Mind with Ronald Koetzsch Humor is one of the great healing forces in life and a humor-full attitude is especially important for teachers and healers. The workshop will include games, exercises, and individual and group activities that enliven the thirteenth human sense\u2014the sense of nonsense. We will work toward presenting a mini-cabaret of skits and songs on the final evening of the conference. Designed for the humorous and the humorously challenged. A8. Pre-conception, Gestation & Birth with Dr. Claire H. Leve We will look at the wonder of incarnation and the myster- ies of embryology, the myths and the realities of newborns, birth today and how we can create a Holy space for it. A9. Understanding the Child: Working with the Four Sheathes as the Basis for Helping the Child with Dr. David Richie The aim of this workshop will be to develop a living picture of how the physical, etheric, astral and ego organiza - tions function in the child and how teachers and therapists can use this knowledge to help them work more deeply with individual children. A10. New Perspectives on Rudolf Steiner`s Pedagogical Law with Astrid Schmitt-Stegmann The pedagogical law gives us insights into how our various members affect one another in health or illness. Knowing this enables the teacher to live a healthier life, to understand how s/ he can affect students in a salutogenic way, and to get deeper insights into the consequences of past karmic influences on Schedule (subject to change) 26this present life. A11. Invite the Spirit: Moving the Soul with Color with Iris Sullivan Following an introduction into the lawfulness of spectrum colors participants will create two pictures using the medium of pastel; one using the luster or day consciousness colors and one using the image colors. Discussion will be on how we have soul-spirit experiences of color. A12. Informed Parenting: Care of the Very Young Child (Birth to 7 Years) with Bella and Jake Tan This workshop will focus on the child's first seven years of life - the foundation years. The format will be combined lecture, sharing/discussion, Q & A. Topics: Conception, pregnancy, childbirth; reforming the inherited body - fever and how to manage it, childhood illnesses & immunization; health & nutrition - milk, weaning process; forming good habits - establishing rhythm, sleep, toilet-training, healthy boundaries; the child's inner & outer environment - imitation, play, imagination, task of the adult & self-development; and others related to the developing child. Group B (Afternoon) B1. Form Drawing and the Economy of Teaching: Ex- ploring History and Nature through Form with Lynn Aaberg Steiner describes the effects of form drawing and geometry as harmonizing every part of the human being, and the im- portance of sleep in bringing about this harmony and vitality. Form drawing and geometric drawing can be used to enhance the curriculum content as well. We will explore a variety of forms and geometrical figures that relate to specific aspects of the curriculum: Celtic knots, Indian kolams, Islamic and Persian tiling, cathedral rose window, and Navajo sand paint-ings can be used to deepen students' experience of history and culture, while drawings from nature of plant and animal forms (flower patterns, Fibonacci forms in pinecones and pineapples, the symmetries of jellyfish and corals) awaken students' aware - ness of the harmony of nature. Participants are encouraged to review lecture 9 in A Modern Art of Education by Steiner. B2. Thinking, Feeling and Willing in Stone with Jack Bryant Participants will develop an oloid form working in soapstone or alabaster. This remarkable shape will provide the medium for engaging in a truly balancing, formative activity. B3. Sex Education in Waldorf Schools Grades 4-12 with Douglas Gerwin In this inter-active workshop, we will resume the work be- gun at the 2002 Kolisko conference in Finland, which resulted in a European source book on sex education for Waldorf schools, grades 4-10. Through presentations of research, small-group conversations, and sharing of resources, we will create the framework for an expanded North American ver - sion of this publication. Participants should bring articles and curriculum materials for distribution at the workshop. B4. Working Psychotherapeutically with Speech and Drama as Transformative Pedagogies in Child Development with Jane Gilmer This workshop will take the form of a presentation, along with experiential exercises, that enable participants to explore the ideas and themes of the workshop. B5. Storytelling and the Creation of Curative Imagery with Paul G Haygood How can we improve our storytelling skills to create cura- tive pedagogical stories? We will discuss this question while in dialogue about story selection, preparation and delivery. We will share both a dramatic biographical event in an original story and any imaginations arising from our work together (bring your favorite story resources). B6. The Aesthetic Education of the Adolescent with Van James Art is important at every stage of the child's development but it has a unique significance in the life of a teenager. The word aesthetic means the ability to respond or response-ability, and this is something that has far reaching effects on the soul-formation of boys and girls of high school age. We will do some artistic work and look at the 9 th grade History of Art and the 12th grade History of Architecture (in the context of a 12 year education) as key courses within the high school curriculum. B7. From Developmental Movement to Acrobatics with Regina LumsdenActive movement! It can be outdoors on the grass or inside a classroom. Comfortable clothes. We will go over move - ment activities that recapitulate the stages of developmental movements in the 1 st year of life progressing into acrobatic activities and how they support the senses of balance and self-movement to aide the school aged child. B8. Eurythmy and the Adolescent in an Electronic Age with Laura Radefeld This eurythmy workshop will explore the needs of children living in a culture saturated with electronic media. We will seek to understand, through eurythmy, the challenges children are facing and what eurythmy can offer in schools in light of these challenges. B9. An Introduction to the Veiling Technique in Watercolor Painting with Anne Riegel Colors in sky phenomena arise out of the interaction be- tween darkness and light, filling us with wonder and reverence. So too can our experience of flowing color pigments on paper give us a similar opening and healing soul experience. This workshop will offer a basic understanding of the method of veiling\u2014layering translucent washes of watercolor. In our paintings, a simple image from nature may reveal itself out of the weaving interactions of the colors. B10. Classroom Movement for the Lower School with Ingun Schneider Because of the varying abilities of today's children, choos- ing, teaching, and working with movement in the classroom can be daunting for the teacher.

This journey is designed, and will be led, by Mr. Bert Chase, who has visited India on many occasions. He is an architect and anthroposophist, who has devoted his career to integrating Rudolf Steiner's indications for architecture into his professional practice. Bert serves Waldorf schools and anthroposophical initiatives throughout North America and Hawaii. As a major proponent for an anthroposophical approach to architecture, he is widely known both for his architectural work and for his writing, lectures, and teaching on the subject. Bert also represented North American architects in the International Symposium of Transformative Architecture held at the Goetheanum. For over thirty years he has cultivated a deep interest in the relationship between sacred architecture and the religious philosophies out of which it arises. His extensive travels have deepened his understanding of how sacred architecture provides a unique opportunity to experience something essential about ourselves, and our society. At the foundation of our contemporary consciousness is the mystery that is India. It is here that the roots of western civilization and spiritual life have their beginnings. Through countless ages, at a deep and profound level, the manifold cultures and spiritual streams of the sub-Himalayan continent have called out to something hidden in the experience of our common humanity. Throughout this journey, Bert will enliven our experience of each site, elucidating its philosophical and spiritual origins. An Indian guide will also escort us for our entire journey. Ample time is allowed for in-depth conversation, and personal exploration. Bert will enrich our experience by sharing parallel impulses and developments arising in other parts of the world at the same time. His intention is that through our experience of the richness and wonder of India, we have an opportunity to explore some essential element in ourselves that is lost to us in our intellectual, fast- paced, every day lives. In our time, when sectarian violence and cultural misunderstanding is ever escalating, Bert feels one of the greatest tools for going beyond these divisive tendencies is to actively cultivate an acute interest in how religious thought and experience gives expression to cultures and their sacred places. He has increasingly felt it is critical to open ourselves to the essence of unfamiliar cultures, thus developing a love and respect for the manifold traditions that enrich human civilization and spiritual life. Only then can we gradually begin to experience the wonder of what lies behind all traditions, the essential nature of our common humanity.
