We have answers to some of the most common questions thanks to [Dr. Sarah Palmer](https://fad.ecommunity.com/provider/Sarah+B+Palmer/384875?unified=palmer&sort=availability_density_best%2Cnetworks%2Crelevance), a pediatrician with Community Physician Network and a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics. What Causes Autism? There's still a lot we don't know about autism, but we're learning more every year. Here's what we currently know about the development of autism spectrum disorder. - It's partially based on genetic factors. We know this because if one child in a family is autistic, future children have a higher probability of developing the disorder. [Genetic testing](https://www.ecommunity.com/services/genetic-testing-counseling/prenatal-pregnancy) can help with early detection. - It's also based on environmental factors. The medical community suspects that prenatal environmental factors also play a part. - Boys are four times as likely to develop autism. They're also diagnosed earlier on than girls. If you're the parent of a young child, keep an eye on developmental milestones. [Autism Speaks](https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism) has put together [a helpful roadmap](https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/First%20Concerns%20Roadmap_0.pdf) to help you understand the early signs of autism, and how to reach out for help. \"Your pediatrician at Community will do a developmental test during your 9-12-month visit, and a specific autism screening at the 18-month or 2-year mark. But it's never too early to ask questions,\" says Dr. Palmer. Is Autism on the Rise? In 2014, the CDC released a report that one in 68 children was on the autism spectrum, which was a 30% increase over 2008. Today that number is closer to one in 54. While it might look like autism is on the rise, the reality is a bit more complicated. \"Autism is a spectrum, and one that's much broader than originally thought,\" Dr. Palmer explains. \"We're getting better at diagnosing children at different points on that spectrum.\" So the same boy who may receive a mild autism diagnosis today might not have been perceived to be on the spectrum at all in 2014 or 2008. It's not necessarily that there are more autistic people today \u2014 it's that we're now able to recognize them and [connect them to the resources they need to live a fulfilling life.](https://www.inf2f.org/) And one important note from Dr. Palmer \u2014 \"A diagnosis of autism doesn't change who your child is. It's not a limitation. It just helps us understand how we can best support them now and throughout their life.\" Is there a Link Between Autism and Vaccines? In short, no. There is no known correlation between vaccines and autism. This dangerous misconception has been around for years, and relies on debunked science and misinformation. In 1998, an infamous article by a British physician suggested a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It was later discovered that the physician's research was falsified. The article was retracted, the physician was struck from the UK medical register, and his study was categorically debunked. Other research studies have looked at millions of children and found absolutely no correlation between vaccines and autism. Another factor that may contribute to this misconception is the timing of vaccinations and when we're able to diagnose autism. Children receive many important vaccinations in the first three years of life. That timeframe also happens to be when the first developmental signs of autism can be spotted. Although they happen roughly around the same time, the two events are completely unrelated. \"It's understandable to have questions!\" says Dr. Palmer. \"Vaccines are one of the first significant medical events in your child's life, so it's natural to be hesitant. But you can rest assured, there's no link at all between vaccines and autism.\" If you have questions about autism or about your child's development, look no further than Community Health Network's pediatricians.
