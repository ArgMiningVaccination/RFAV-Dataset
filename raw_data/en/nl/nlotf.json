This herb's potent astringent and antibacterial properties aid in balancing the Kaphadosha. To help with symptoms, the bark of the Lodhra tree can be used as a vaginal wash or boiled in water and drunk as tea. 2. Ashoka (Saracaasoca) Ashoka is thought to be especially useful for endometriosis and female infertility. Many gynaecological disorders, including irregular menstruation and abnormal vaginal discharge, can be effectively treated by the ingredients found in its bark. After boiling a bark of the Ashoka plant in one glass of water, you can drink it as tea; or else you can use the boiled water as a vaginal wash. 3. Guduchi (Tinosporacordifolia) Guduchi is a vital remedy in the Indian system of medicine and is rich in anti-inflammatory and anti-ageing properties. The stem of the Guduchi plant can be boiled in water and used as a vaginal wash to help maintain a healthy flow of vaginal discharge. 4.
