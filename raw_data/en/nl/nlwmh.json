As a natural product, AAA Natural Stone does not 'engineer' stone for specific environments and/or applications, so it is the client's sole responsibility to determine if any natural stone will perform effectively for their purpose. For instance, natural stones that do not test well under many freeze-thaw cycles may do well in a subfreezing climate if there is little precipitation. Performance can also be impacted greatly by factors such as installation orientation (horizontal vs vertical), or the use of sealers to repel moisture or reduce absorption. If you absolutely love a particular type of stone for a particular application, we highly recommend consulting with your architect and/or contractor and reaching out to a company that manufactures natural stone sealers to understand which products and application processes will help your project endure.
