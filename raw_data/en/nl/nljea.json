See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de informaci\u00f3n What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the covering of the brain and the spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000-1,200 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who live, another 11%-19% lose their arms or legs, have problems with their nervous systems, become deaf, or suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people 16-21 years. Children with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen, have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. College freshmen living in dorms are also at increased risk. Meningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such as penicillin. Still, many people who get the disease die from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2Meningococcal vaccine There are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4) is the preferred vaccine for people 55 years of age andyounger. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s. It is the onlymeningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. Both vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. There are other types of meningococcal disease; the vaccines do not protect against these. 3 Who should get meningococcal vaccine and when? Routine vaccination Two doses of MCV4 are recommended for adolescents 11 through 18 years of age: the first dose at 11 or 12 years of age, with a booster dose at age 16. Adolescents in this age group with HIV infection should get three doses: 2 doses 2 months apart at 11 or 12 years, plus a booster at age 16. If the first dose (or series) is given between 13 and 15 years of age, the booster should be given between 16 and 18. If the first dose (or series) is given after the 16th birthday, a booster is not needed. Other people at increased riskCollege freshmen living in dormitories. Laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed tomeningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the worldwhere meningococcal disease is common, such asparts of Africa. Anyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleenhas been removed. Anyone who has persistent complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder). People who might have been exposed to meningitisduring an outbreak. Children between 9 and 23 months of age, and anyone else with certain medical conditions need 2 doses for adequate protection. Ask your doctor about the number and timing of doses, and the need for booster doses. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people in these groups who are 9 months through 55 years of age. MPSV4 can be used for adults older than 55. 4 Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine or should wait. Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening)allergic reaction to a previous dose of MCV4 orMPSV4 vaccine should not get another dose of eithervaccine. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy toany vaccine component should not get the vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the timethe shot is scheduled should probably wait until theyrecover. Ask your doctor. People with a mild illnesscan usually get the vaccine. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnantwomen. MCV4 is a fairly new vaccine and has notbeen studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4has. It should be used only if clearly needed. Themanufacturers of MCV4 maintain pregnancy registriesfor women who are vaccinated while pregnant. Except for children with sickle cell disease or without a working spleen, meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Brief fainting spells and related symptoms (such as jerking or seizure-like movements) can follow a vaccination. They happen most often with adolescents, and they can result in falls and injuries. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes after getting the shot\u2014especially if you feel faint\u2014can help prevent these injuries. Mild problems As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a mild fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. 6 What if there is a serious reaction? What should I look for?Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or otheremergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get the personto the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your doctor. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to theVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor might file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www .vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions. They do not give medical advice. 7 The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. 8How can I learn more? Ask your doctor . Call your local or state health department. Contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): - Call 1-800-232-4636 (1-800-CDC-INFO ) or - Visit CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines Information Statement (Interim) Meningococcal Vaccine 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-2610/14/2011Office Use OnlyInformation about Meningococcal Disease and Vaccination and Waiver for Students at Residential Schools and Colleges Massachusetts requires all newly enrolled full-time students attending a secondary school (e.g., boarding schools) or postsecondary institution (e.g., colleges) who will be living in a dormitory or other congregate housing licensed or approved by the secondary school or institution to: 1. receive meningococcal vaccine; or2. fall within one of the exemptions in the law, which are discussed on the reverse side of this sheet. The law provides an exemption for students signing a waiver that reviews the dangers of meningococcal disease and indicates that the vaccination has been declined. To qualify for this exemption, you are required to review the information below and sign the waiver at the end of this document. Please note, if a student is under 18 years of age, a parent or legal guardian must be given a copy of this document and must sign the waiver. What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is caused by infection with bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis . These bacteria can infect the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord called the \"meninges\" and cause meningitis, or they can infect the blood or other body organs. In the US, about 1,000-3,000 people get meningococcal disease each year and 10-15% die despite receiving antibiotic treatment. Of those who live, another 11-19% lose their arms or legs, become deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, become mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. How is meningococcal disease spread? These bacteria are passed from person-to-person through saliva (spit). You must be in close contact with an infected person's saliva in order for the bacteria to spread. Close contact includes activities such as kissing, sharing water bottles, sharing eating/drinking utensils or sharing cigarettes with someone who is infected; or being within 3-6 feet of someone who is infected and is coughing or sneezing. Who is at most risk for getting meningococcal disease? High-risk groups include anyone with a damaged spleen or whose spleen has been removed, those with persistent complement component deficiency (an inherited immune disorder), HIV infection, those traveling to countries where meningococcal disease is very common, microbiologists and people who may have been exposed to meningococcal disease during an outbreak. People who live in certain settings such as college freshmen living in dormitories and military recruits are also at greater risk of disease. Are some students in college and secondary schools at risk for meningococcal disease? College freshmen living in residence halls or dormitories are at an increased risk for meningococcal disease as compared to individuals of the same age not attending college. The setting, combined with risk behaviors (such as alcohol consumption, exposure to cigarette smoke, sharing food or beverages, and activities involving the exchange of saliva), may be what puts college students at a greater risk for infection. There is insufficient information about whether new students in other congregate living situations (e.g., residential schools) may also be at increased risk for meningococcal disease. But, the similarity in their environments and some behaviors may increase their risk. The risk of meningococcal disease for other college students, in particular older students and students who do not live in congregate housing, is not increased. However, meningococcal vaccine is a safe and efficacious way to reduce their risk of contracting this disease. Is there a vaccine against meningococcal disease? Yes, there are currently 2 types of vaccines available that protect against 4 of the most common of the 13 serogroups (subgroups) of N. meningitidis that cause serious disease. Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is approved for use in those 2 years of age and older. There are 2 licensed meningococcal conjugate vaccines. Menactra\u00ae is approved for use in those 9 months - 55 years of age and Menveo\u00ae is approved for use in those 2-55 years of age. Both the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines provide protection against four serogroups of the bacteria, called groups A, C, Y and W-135. These four serogroups account for approximately two-thirds of the cases that occur in the U.S. each year. Most of the remaining one-third of the cases are caused by serogroup B, which is not contained in either vaccine. Meningococcal vaccines are thought to provide protection for approximately 5 years. Currently, students are only required to have a dose of polysaccharide vaccine within the last 5 years or a dose of conjugate vaccine at any time in the past (or fall within one of the exemptions allowed by law). However, please be aware that in October 2010 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended booster doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine for healthy adolescents 16-18 years of age. Persons up to 21 years of age entering college are recommended to have documentation of a dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine no more than 5 years before enrollment, particularly if they are new residential students. Is the meningococcal vaccine safe? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems such as severe allergic reactions. Getting meningococcal vaccine is much safer than getting the disease. Some people who get meningococcal vaccine have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. These symptoms usually last for 1-2 days. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a fever. The vaccine can be given to pregnant women. Anyone who has ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome should talk with their provider before getting meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Is it mandatory for students to receive meningococcal vaccine for entry into secondary schools or colleges that provide or license housing? Massachusetts law (MGL Ch. 76, s.15D) requires newly enrolled full-time students attending a secondary school (those schools with grades 9-12) or postsecondary institution (e.g., colleges) who will be living in a dormitory or other congregate housing licensed or approved by the secondary school or institution to receive meningococcal vaccine. At affected secondary schools, the requirements apply to all new full-time residential students, regardless of grade (including grades pre-K through 8) and year of study. All students covered by the regulations must provide documentation of having received a dose of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine within the last 5 years (or a dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine at any time in the past), unless they qualify for one of the exemptions allowed by the law. Whenever possible, immunizations should be obtained prior to enrollment or registration. However, students may be enrolled or registered provided that the required immunizations are obtained within 30 days of registration. Students may begin classes without a certificate of immunization against meningococcal disease if: 1) the student has a letter from a physician stating that there is a medical reason why he/she can't receive the vaccine; 2) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) presents a statement in writing that such vaccination is against his/her sincere religious belief; or 3) the student (or the student's parent or legal guardian, if the student is a minor) signs the waiver below stating that the student has received information about the dangers of meningococcal disease, reviewed the information provided and elected to decline the vaccine. Where can a student get vaccinated? Students and their parents should contact their healthcare provider and make an appointment to discuss meningococcal disease, the benefits and risks of vaccination, and the availability of this vaccine. Schools and college health services are not required to provide you with this vaccine. Where can I get more information? Your healthcare provider The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Immunization at (617) 983-6800 or www.mass.gov/dph/imm and www.mass.gov/dph/epi Your local health department (listed in the phone book under government) Waiver for Meningococcal Vaccination Requirement I have received and reviewed the information provided on the risks of meningococcal disease and the risks and benefits of meningococcal vaccine. I understand that Massachusetts' law requires newly enrolled full-time students at secondary schools, colleges and universities who are living in a dormitory or congregate living arrangement licensed or approved by the secondary school or postsecondary institution to receive meningococcal vaccinations, unless the students provide a signed waiver of the vaccination or otherwise qualify for one of the exemptions specified in the law. After reviewing the materials above on the dangers of meningococcal disease, I choose to waive receipt of meningococcal vaccine.
