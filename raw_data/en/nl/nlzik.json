Endowed and Term Professorships - Ekaterina Heldwein, PhD Ekaterina (Katya) Heldwein, PhD, is professor of molecular biology and microbiology at the School of Medicine. She earned her PhD in biochemistry from the Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU) and completed her postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School. She has been at Tufts since 2006. Heldwein's lab investigates how herpesviral particles enter their target cells and move within them to establish infection, and how progeny herpesviral particles assemble and exit the cell to infect new cells and hosts. Her laboratory uses a multidisciplinary approach that combines the power of biophysics, cell biology, virology, and biochemistry. Heldwein also employs structural biology to determine the three-dimensional structures of herpesviral proteins. Early in her career, Heldwein made a breakthrough discovery in how herpesviruses penetrate their host cells to establish infection that was published in Science. Her recent work on deciphering the structural basis for how herpesviruses control their movement in nerve cells has led to a patent that covers the use of this technology in herpesvirus vaccination and oncolytic vector therapy. She is also a co-founder of Thyreos LLC, a startup that focuses on developing vaccines against neurotropic herpesviruses. Heldwein has received several accolades for her research, including the Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)'s Director's New Innovator Award, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award, the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) Young Investigator Award, and the Merck Irving S. Sigal Memorial Award. In 2016, Heldwein was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Faculty Scholar, and in 2019, she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. She has also received several teaching awards from Tufts. Heldwein is an editorial board member of Virology and the Journal of Virology and is a member of the VIRA (Virology A) Study Section at NIH.

Coffin, PhD John Coffin, PhD, is professor of molecular biology and microbiology at the School of Medicine. He joined Tufts in 1975. Coffin's scientific career has been centered on developing an understanding of the association of retroviruses with their hosts. As a student with Howard Temin, he performed some of the initial studies defining subviral structures and their presence in cells as markers of infection. As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Charles Weissmann, he developed methodology to show the nuclear synthesis of retrovirus RNA by RNA pol II and performed some of the initial studies on genetic structure of the retrovirus genome. In his subsequent work, he has analyzed many facets of retrovirus biology, including genome structure and genetics, mechanisms of replication, coevolution of viruses and hosts, and pathogenic mechanisms. Coffin has also been active in the field of HIV research. He was the founder and director of the HIV Drug Resistance Program of the National Cancer Institute and served on a number of government review and oversight committees relevant to the AIDS crisis.

HPV infections cause approximately 5% of all human cancers, including almost all cases of cervical carcinoma, and a large percentage of other anogenital tract cancers, as well as head and neck tumors. He has identified the cancer-causing genes encoded by HPVs and has uncovered important mechanisms by which infections with these viruses drive cancer initiation and progression. His work has also led to the identification of specific vulnerabilities of HPV-infected cells that may be harnessed therapeutically. His work has been continuously supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than 20 years, and he has contributed more than 180 publications to the HPV field. Munger has served on multiple NIH study sections and advisory panels. He is an elected member of the American Academy of Microbiology.
