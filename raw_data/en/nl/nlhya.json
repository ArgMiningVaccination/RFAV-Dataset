Cellulite affects around 90% of women over 20 and it doesn't discriminate (men get it too). For many people cellulite is considered unsightly and can sometimes make people feel bad about themselves. If cellulite is a concern for you, there are a number of ways it can be treated naturally. AcuMedic skin expert Reduce cellulite from the inside-out... Cellulite is caused by lymphatic congestion and the accumulation of fat. When the accumulation of fat is present along with emotional imbalances, such as [stress](/can-we-help/condition/stress/) and worry, stagnation occurs and eventually builds cellulite. An AcuMedic doctor can assess the underlying cause and use [acupuncture and herbal medicine](/therapy/acupuncture-full-chinese-herbal-consultation/) to treat the internal imbalances. Some common causes include: - Qi Stagnation - According to Chinese medicine, cellulite is connected to water metabolism. When Qi stagnation is present, proper fluid management cannot transpire which causes cellulite. - Spleen Qi Deficiency - The Spleen is responsible for the transportation and transformation of fluids. If there is deficiency, dampness can accumulate and as a result cellulite may occur. - Kidney Qi Deficiency - The Kidney plays an important role in managing fluids and excreting waste from the body. Your AcuMedic doctor may recommend other treatments such as: Massage Therapy [Massage](/our-services/massage/) is another great treatment for breaking down fat deposits as it works to improve circulation and as a result evens out the skin surface. [Tuina massage](/therapy/tuina-massage/) is especially recommended to stimulate lymphatic drainage and firm the skin. If you can't get a professional massage done, use your fingers to massage the affected area daily for at least 10 minutes. Cupping [Cupping](/therapy/cupping-therapy/) and Gua Sha are also useful treatments used by Chinese medicine practitioners as they help to break down the stagnant fluid, draw toxins to the surface and bring fresh blood to the affected area. This has a smoothing and firming effect on the skin. Lifestyle Changes: Keep in mind at all times that when we look after our inside, the outside takes care of itself. A good place to start is to decrease the load on the lymphatic system by [reducing your toxic intake](http://www.acumedic.com/pdf/staffuploads/954_daydetoxguide.pdf). Here is a list of some factors to watch out for: - Eating too many damp producing foods: e.g. alcohol, dairy, wheat, sugar and greasy, fried, processed fast foods. - Over thinking / Worry - Repressed emotions - Sitting for long periods of time - Lack of sleep - Not enough exercise If you maintain a well-balanced diet, exercise regularly and get enough rest, you will gradually minimise the fat deposits causing your cellulite. Increase circulation... Cellulite can be kept to a minimum by improving the circulation and lymphatic drainage. The more you move the better. Try Yoga or Tai Chi as both practices enhance lymphatic drainage and detoxification. Homemade peel... A homemade seaweed peel is a fantastic 'at home' treatment to reduce the appearance of cellulite. Seaweed is rich inminerals and can help increase blood circulation. Mix with sea salt or sugar, almond oil and 1 drop of geranium oil. Apply to the affected area every day before you shower. You can buy [seaweed](https://shop.acumedic.com/shop/product/tea-haic/94/), [almond oil](https://shop.acumedic.com/shop/product/oil-almc/110/) and geranium.
