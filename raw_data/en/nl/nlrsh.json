Planning Consultant: Gwendolyn Hilton Mapping Consultant: Cindy Pellett, LatLong Logic Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 4 Introduction Purpose This Comprehensive Plan updates Dover -Foxcroft's 2005 Comprehensive Plan. It is designed to reflect the desires of citizens today, with consideration for current conditions, anticipated trends and future needs. The Plan charts a course for the next decade based on extensive data collection, research and analysis, predictions for the future, and most importantly, public input. The Plan contains a vision for Dover -Foxcroft 's future and makes recommendations for how the vision might be achieved . Once the Plan is adopted, the Town implements the recommendations with ongoing input from citizens. Since the Plan is advisory, actual changes, such as municipal expenditures or regulatory modifications, must be voted on by citizens at future town meetings or referendums . The Plan is not set in stone, but it can be revised as needed to best serve the Town. This Plan is organized into two parts : Volume I - Recommendations (this document) The recommendations include the vision, goals, policies and implementation strategies. The vision describes the community's desir es for the future. The goals, policies and strategies are designed to advance the vision. The goals express intent, the policies are directives, and the strategies are specific actions to implement the policies. The strategies are prioritized with respect to timeframe, and th e entities responsible for implementation are identified. The recommendations also include the Future Land Use Plan (Chapter 9) and the Capital investment Plan (Chapter 10). Volume II - Inventory and Analysis Volume II contains the background information that provides the data , analysis and findings to support Volume I. Topics include population characteristics , housing, economy, community facilities and services, transportation, parks and recreation, municipal finance, natural resources, historic and cultural resources, agriculture and forestry, and land use.

Regional Co llaboration Summary The Town of Dover -Foxcroft , as the county seat and a primary regional service center , plays a critical role in the region that includes Piscataquis County, a nd adjacent areas of Penobscot County. Dover - Foxcroft provides many services to the region , including government al services , healthcare and social services, retail and business services, employment opportunities , educational services, a range of housing options , and recreational, cultural and social offerings . In serving in this role, the Town must coordinate and collaborate with other towns, the county, the state , and other public and private entities to provide necessary services for the region. The Comprehensive Plan includes many recommendations that focus on regional collaboration . This Plan support s continuation of many current efforts with some recommended improvements for future consideration. Each chapter of this Plan has specific recommendatio ns for regional coordination. The following is a summary. Economy: The Town of Dover -Foxcroft actively promote s economic development that benefits the region, such as working with the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council and the Piscataquis Cou nty Chamber of Commerce on marketing and other economic development initiatives . Many of the Town' s efforts, such as revitalization of the downtown and policies to support business and industrial devel opment add vitality to the region. Additionally, the To wn's effort to improve internet communications and promote renewable energy also impact neighboring communities. (See Chapter 1) Housing: The Town supports and promotes many different types of housing opportunities , some of which that are usually not available elsewhere in the region, such as senior housing and multifamily housing near county seat services. (See Chapter 2 ) Historic and Archaeological Resources: The Historic Society's efforts to showcase the history of Dover -Foxcroft is of great benefit to neighboring communities whose histories and culture are intertwined with those of Dover -Foxcroft. (See Chapter 3) Natural Resources: Many of the natural resources within Dover -Foxcroft ar e shared with other communities; most notably the Piscataquis Riv er, Sebec Lake , and the vast forested areas that provide important wildlife habitat and preserve water quality . The Town also has a considerable amount of conserved land that is shared, such as Peaks Kenny State Park, the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Ar ea and the Northeast Wilderness Trust 's land . (See Chapter 4 ) Agriculture and Forestry: Increasingly the Town is serving as a hub for agriculture and forestry with federal, state and county agencies, the UMaine Cooperative Extension, the Piscataquis County Fairgrounds, and the Dover -Cove Farmer's Market. (See Chapter 5) Community Services and Facilities: In order to provide high -quality, efficient services and facilities, the Town collaborates with county, state and federal agencies, educational institution s including RSU 68 and Foxcroft Academy, area municipalities, and many other public and private sector entities. Examples where collaboration is important include emergency services, recycling and solid waste disposal, health and social services, and the Dover -Foxcroft Water District 's work with Guilford in maintaining the Town's public water supply . (See Chapter 6) Transportation: The most significant co llaboration in transportation is advocacy for impro vements to state and state -aid highways that are critical to Dover -Foxcroft and other communities in the region. A coordinated approach to managing local roads serving adjacent communities can also be Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 6 beneficial. Another area of concern with a regional focus is adequate public transportation alternative s for the aging population . (See Chapter 7) Parks, Recreation and Open Space: Dover -Foxcr oft serves as a gateway to the H ighlands Region by providing vital services for tourists, second homes residents and others recreating in the region. Mut ual promotion of the region is important. Many of the Town's recreational facilities are available to residents in the region, including the Regional YMCA, Peaks Kenny State Park, public acce ss facilities to ponds and the r iver, local parks and playgrounds, and the many recreational trails that are connected to regional systems. (See Chapter 8) Future Land Use Plan: This Plan recommends that Dover -Foxcroft coordinate with neighboring communities in the following ways: ensuring that land use regulations and districts are consisten t in adjacent areas; consulting with towns regarding plann ing projects for adjacent areas; and collaborating in reviewing and permitting of projects that effect the communities, particularly for very large, high -impact projects, such a major utili ty/highway corridors. (See Chapter 9) Capital Investment Plan. This Plan recommends working with neighboring communities, the county, and other public and private partners to provide essential services equitably for mutual benefit. (See Chapter 10) Monitor ing Implementation and Plan Evaluation The Comprehensive Plan's success in attaining Dover -Foxcroft's Vision for the future is dependent on the citizens of the Town implementing its recommendations. Monitoring progress in implementing the Plan should be accomplished as follows: at a minimum, an evaluation of the Plan should be conducted within five years of the Plan's adoption to determine the degree, to which the Future Land Use Plan strategies and other strategies have been implemented and the steps taken toward implementing the Capital Investment Plan . This evaluation should also include an assessment of overall development trends. If the Committee's evaluation concludes tha t portions of the current plan or its implementation are no longer effective or desired, the Committee should propose changes to the Comprehensive Plan .

Utilize Pine Crest Development Corporation for specific economic development projects, such as the Pine Crest Business Park and the Mayo Mill Commercial Office Plaza and Data Center . 1 Cross reference note: Recommendations related to economic development are also included in other chapters, as applicable - such as the chapters on: Community Facilities and Services; Parks, Recreation and Open Space; Agriculture and Forestry; Histori c and Archaeological Resources; Transportation ; the Future Land Use Plan; and the Capital Investment Plan. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 11 iii. Monitor the effectiveness of the economic development program and the workload of the Town Manager and PCEDC in current capacities . If necessary , consider expanding capacity for economic development and grant writing through additional T own staffing. As an example, a staff position might be project based , such as through the Maine Downtown Network Community Program or a special grant program. b. Utilize targeted approaches (project -based) such as Community Development Block Grants, USDA Rural Development f unding, tax increment financin g,2 and private funding to undertake specific activities and provide support for ongoing economic development efforts. c. Take advantage of state and regional programs to promote economic activity, such as assistance through the Eastern Maine Development Corporation, the Maine Development Foundation, the State of Maine (Department of Economic and Community Development, Office of Tourism, etc.), Coastal Enterprises, and others. d. Collaborate with local partners, such as the Piscataquis County Chamber of Commerce, Kiwanis, Center Theater, the Historical Society, the Dover Cove Farmers Market, the snowmobile and ATV clubs , and others to increase economic vitality. e. Encourage volunteerism by supporting the efforts of local organizations and volunteers. Responsibility : Board of Selectpersons, Town Manager, Pine Crest Development Board, Chamber of Commerce, PCEDC, other partners / Timeframe : ongoing 2. Promotion a. Promote Dover -Foxcroft as a great place to live, work, obtain goods and services , operate a business and to socialize and recreate because it is a rural community where you have everything you need - a full-set of services, county and state government, health care, great schools, active cultural and social atmosphere, accessibility to Bangor metr opolitan area, parks and recreation including urban area facilities (YMCA, fairgrounds, walkable neighborhoods, theater, library, older adult facilities, etc.) and many housing options , including generally affordable historic homes . b. Develop the slogan /theme /brand, such as \"Dover -Foxcroft, the Center of Things .\" The T own is the geographic center of the state at the crossroads of major highways, a service center, job c enter, healthcare center, education/career center; there is Center Theater and Central H all. The \"Town Squares \" are Dover -Foxcroft's town center. Include this theme in state -wide publications and promotional efforts. c. Continue to improve the Town's website , including the listing of government agencies, non-profit organizations and businesse s. Incorporate a. and b. above . Ensure that websites for other organizations have links to the T own's website . Conside r utilizing professional services either through contract or collaboration with another entity for marketing and branding services. d.

Encourage the Piscataquis County Chamber of Commerce, PCEDC, Maine State Agencies (e.g., Bureau of Tourism , Parks and Recreation ) and other organizations in promoting the region. 2 Tax increment financing (TIF), a sophisti cated economic development tool, allows a T own to use property tax income from new development for specific ec onomic development activities. A town must define a TIF District (area where TIFs can be granted) and adopt policies for granting TIFs. Some or all of the new property -tax income can b e used in the TIF District . A major fiscal benefit is that new valuation from the d evelopment is not added to the t own's t otal valuation. The higher the town's valuation, the higher its proportional share of funding for schools, the more it pays in county taxes, and conversely the less it gets in state revenue sharing and gene ral purpose school funding. Dover -Foxcroft has a TIF policy and two districts: Pleasant River Lumber and the Moosehead Mill Redevelopment Project.

If this evaluation concludes that portions of the current Plan or its i mplementation are not effect ive, the Planning Board should propose changes as needed. Responsibility: C EO, Planning Board, Town Manager / Timeframe : at least every five years Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 44 Future Land Use Plan Narrative Overview The Future Land Use (FLU) Plan builds on existing patterns of development and systems for managing growth, and makes recommendations for guiding future growth and development that is consistent with the Town's Vision. The FLU Plan's recommendations are designed to be used in concert with the rec ommendations from other sections of the Comprehensive Plan, such as Economy, Community Facilities and Services, Transportation, Housing, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Forestry and the Capital Investment Plan, which means the coordinated use of both re gulatory and non -regulatory approaches to effectively guide the Town's future. Dover -Foxcroft's existing Land Use Ordinance (LUO) serves as the backbone of the T own's land use program. While the LUO is not a state -mandated ordinance, state law does requir e that the LUO be consistent with an up - to-date comprehensive plan prepared in accordance with Maine's Growth Management Act.11 The overall goal of the Act is to encourage orderly growth and development in appropriate areas of each community and region whil e protecting rural character, making efficient use of public services and preventing development sprawl. Dover -Foxcroft's 2005 Comprehensive Plan was deemed consistent with Maine's Growth Management Act. The 2005 Comprehensive Plan also stated that \"the ultimate goal of growth management is to regulate land use development to the extent necessary to protect natural resources, property values, and public safety. The imposed regulations should not make Town's residents feel that they have lost their freedom as landowners and, therefore, over -regulation must be avoided. In particular, land use regulations should not be so restrictive that they have negative impacts on existing land use practices.\" This FLU Plan updates and improves upon the 2005 Comprehensive Plan. The Vision and the Future Land Use Plan This FLU Plan is based on the Vision for Dover -Foxcroft for the next decade and beyond, which seeks to achieve a prosperous and demographically stable population through moderate population and economic growth . Providing economic oppor tunities while maintaining the T own's most desirable characteristics as a rural shiretown with \"everything you need\" is key aspiration . Improving economic prosperity for the Town and the region means strengthening Dover -Foxcroft a s the county seat and primary service center for a large rural area of Piscataquis County and portions of nearby Penobscot County. This Plan seeks to accomplish this by ensuring there are areas with infrastructure in Dover -Foxcroft to allow services necess ary to the region and the community to thrive. Enhancing the community as a great place to live, work, shop, invest in, and recreate is a primary goal. The Town has an infrastructure designed to support its service center role with centralized public sewer and water systems with excess capacity for development , and a transportation infrastructure that includes several arterial and major collector state highways. This Plan responds to recent development trends and desires for the future by encouraging and p roviding opportunities for population growth and economic development, particularly in designated urban and growth areas. The Plan also recognizes the importance of the Town's vast rural areas and encourages land uses that will enhance the rural economy, s uch as the growing agriculture sector, commercial forestry, and outdoor recreation. The Plan also recognizes the Town's scenic rural landscape, waterbodies, fisheries and wildlife habitats, and special natural areas as important to the community's rural wa y of life. 11 Growth Management Act (30 -A MRSA Sec 4312 et seq.) http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/30 -a/title30 -Asec4312 Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 45 Summary of Key Regulatory and Non -Regulatory Approaches Dover -Foxcroft uses a multipronged approach to directing future growth and development that consists of both regulatory and non -regulatory mechanisms. The primary regulatory tools are Dov er-Foxcroft's Land Use Ordinance, Shoreland Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance, combined with State regulations, such as the Natural Resources Protection Act, Stormwater Law and Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Law. The Town also utilizes Maine's Uni form Building and Energy Code. The primary non -regulatory tool to guide growth is the provision of a high level of services and infrastructure within urban and growth areas. Many of the capital investments envisioned for the next decade focus on maintainin g and improving urban area infrastructure. Other non -regulatory mechanisms include promoting the current use property tax programs, Tree Growth and Farm and Open Space, supporting lake associations and land conservation organizations, encouraging best mana gement practices for water quality protection, educating citizen's to promote compliance with state and local laws, and making referrals to agencies, such as the Piscataquis County Conservation District and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Ser vice, both with offices in Dover -Foxcroft . Urban and Growth Areas Urban and growth areas are designed to be suitable for orderly residential, commercial or industrial development, or a combination of those types of development, and into which most developm ent projected over ten years is directed. Dover -Foxcroft's Land Use Ordinance, Capital Investment Plan, transportation and other policies are designed to promote orderly development and redevelopment in within these areas. Providing adequate infrastructure is fundamental to promoting desired land use patterns. Nearly all recommended capital investments are located in these areas. The Town's public sewer and water capacity for additional development , along with adequate streets, parking, sidewalks, parks, pu blic spaces, and reliable utilities , combined with excellent services, community events, and economic incentives can be effective in attaining desired development in the downtown and other urban areas. Urban and growth area districts are designed to reflec t existing patterns of development with space for new development, redevelopment, infill and expansions depending on the area. Past developmen t trends and desires for future compatible development are reflected in the types of uses allowed, dimensional sta ndards, performance standards and other requirements. This Plan builds on the existing urban area districts and recommends changes including expansions and boundary changes to several districts , and the designation of several new districts. The Plan envisi ons the following urban and growth area districts: Village, Downtown, Hamlet (new ), Commercial, Light Industrial , and Industrial (new). The existing Residential District is eliminated, with portions being included in several other districts (i.e., Village District, Hamlet District , and Farm and Forest District), as displayed on the Map 19 Future Land Use . This change reflects the existing character of these areas. Urban and growth a rea districts are consistent with the community's vision. The most densely d eveloped area is the Downtown District where additional mixed uses and compact development are desirable. The Village District is predominately residential on relatively small lots interspersed with areas of public, semi -public and commercial uses. The Ham let District, a new designation, is designed to better accommodate small rural neighborhoods in outlying rural areas where lot sizes and dimensional standards could allow more compact development than in surrounding rural areas. Given that all of these dis tricts are mixed use districts, the Plan recommends close scrutiny of permitted uses and \"good neighbor standards \" to assure compatibility. The Commercial District accommodates primarily highway commercial uses that require larger lots and access to a main thoroughfare. The Light Industrial and Industrial Districts are consistent with the existing patterns and types of developments , and provide opportunities for expansions and new development. Consideration for Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 46 compatibility of uses is important to encourag e development in these areas, such as limitations on most residential uses. Nearly all urban and growth area districts are supported with necessary infrastructure: public sewer and water are potentially available in all these districts, with the exception of Hamlet Districts, and the Pleasant River Industrial District, where only public water is available. All these districts are served by state highways, either directly or in close proximity, which means access management to maintain highway capacity and s afety is important and is addressed in Chapter 7 Transportation. Urban and growth area district s are designed to take advantage of the suitable terrain and soils prevalent in these areas. The extensive availability of public sewer allows for development a t densities not otherwise possible in some areas. The Piscataquis River which runs though the urban areas provides amenities for the urban area, including scenic parks along its banks. Natural constraints in urban and growth areas include shorelands and fl oodplains of the River, some areas of hy dric soils and several wetlands . Wetlands and areas of hydric soils that can't be developed can serve important growth area functions, such as for parks and open space, for stormwater control and water quality protec tion, habitat for urban wildlife, and as natural buffers. Critical natural resources associated with the River include important fisheries habitat, two rare plant habitats, and potential archaeological resources. State regulations, municipal shoreland zoni ng and floodplain regulations, and performance standards provide protection for these areas. Shoreland zoning and other performance standards, including stormwater provisions, are designed to protect water quality, particularly in urban areas with many imp ermeable surfaces. (See Map 19 Future Land Use , Map 20 Development Constraints , Map 6 Importan t Habitats and Natural Areas , Map 5 Water Resources , Map 4 Historic District Inset , Map 15 Land Cover, Map 16 and Map 17 Land Use (existing districting), and Map 18 Shorelan d Zoning ) Village District (V) The Village District, which surrounds the downtown, is intended to be a vibrant, walkable, convenient place to live, work and play in close proximity to goods, services, and recreational areas. The District accomm odates medium to high -density residential uses, including multifamily housing, apartment houses, and mobile home parks, and other compatible neighborhood and community uses. Other than single and two family homes and a few other low -impact uses, all other new uses must meet performance standards to ensure compatibility. Incompatible uses, such as extractive industries, junk yards, and intensive commercial and industrial uses, are prohibited. Dimensional standards allow relatively high density development, p articularly on public sewer. Infill and redevelopment are desirable, and there are still some areas for new development. An important feature of the Village is its many beautiful historic homes and other buildings. The Historic District (overlay) is design ed to provide some protection for these structures.12 The Piscataquis River and a few tributaries, as well as a few wetlands, are all protected though local and/or state regulations. (See Table 9 -1 and Map 19 Future Land Use) Downtown District (D) (Renamed from Commercial) The Downtown District, which encompasses downtown areas on both the north and sou th sides of the Piscataquis River, is the civic, cultural and business center of the community. The district is designed to support a vibrant, authentic, mixe d-use downtown at relatively high densities. Walkability, attractive public space s, and thriving businesses are the goal. The district contains a variety of typical downtown commercial uses, semi - public and public uses and some residential uses, including the new mixed -use Moosehead Riverfront Project. 12 See Chapter 3 Historic and Archaeological Resources Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 47 Infill and redevelopment are desirable, including use of second stories. The historic buildings and character of the downtown are important features that are included in the Historic District overlay .13 Other than single and two -family homes, most uses must meet performance standards and good neighbor standards to assure compatibility, and incompatible uses are prohibited. Since sewer and water are available, the area could accommodate higher density developmen t. Prohibited uses would be those that detract from the character of the downtown, and/or would be better located elsewhere in the community. (See Table 9-1 and Map 19 Future Land Use ) Village and Do wntown District Recommendations 1. Revise the statements of purpose in the LUO to more accurately reflect this Plan . 2. Review land uses and performance standards to assure protection, compatibility, and priorities for mixed uses. \"Good neighbor\" standards should be considered. 3. Consider standards with respect to new types of downtown uses, such as temporary pop -ups, farmers markets, street vendors, and other shared or temporary uses. 4. Ensure that the standards allow affordable and market -rate housing opportunities for all age groups, such as older -adults and mixed -use developments that provide easy access to services. 5. Village: Consider changes to dimensional requirements and standards to encourage infill and redevelopment where harm will not be caused to existing homes and neighborhoods. 6. Downtown: Consider increasing the flexibility of dimensional standards and requirements for parking14 to allow high -density development, including upper story uses, infill and redevelopment. Reduce the setbacks for development on sewer, including zero setbacks, where appropriate. 7. Revise the Planned Unit Development provisions to accommodate developments like the Moosehead Redevelopment Project and similar projects under a unified development plan. 8. Consider changes in the boundaries of these districts to accommo date uses, includ ing densities and intensities: a) expansion of the Downtown to allow more compact development consistent with adjacent downtown development; b) expansion of the Village to include an area between Essex Street and Vaughn Road - an area whic h has, or could ha ve access to public sewer; and c) redistricting of an area to Light Industrial between the Pine Crest Business Park and the airport. (See Map 19 Future Land Use ) 9. Given the density of uses in these districts, and the desire to make these areas desirable places to live, a property maintenance ordinance or policy is recommended .15 10. Capital investments for these districts include revitalization of the downtown infrastructure (both T own and state), additional parking in the downtown, f a\u00e7ade improvements, sidewalks and other pedestrian -friendly improvements, improv ed vehicle and pedestrian access to the Riverfront Redevelopment project, improvements to parks, upgrades to stormwater infrastructure, and ongoing upgrades to public water and sewer systems. (See Chapter 10 Capital I nvestment Plan) Historic District (H) The Historic District overlays portions of both the Village and Downtown Districts. It is designed to encourage long -term preservation of properties listed on the National Regis ter of Historic Places. Proposed land use activities involving structural development associated with recognized historic buildings within this district must be submitted to the Historical Review Committee for their review. The CEO or Planning Board must c onsider these comments and require that these historic properties be protected to the maximum extent practicable . The recommendations for changes to this district include expansion of the review to other historic buildings and the 13 See Chapter 3 Historic and Archaeological Resources 14 More parking is needed in the down town, which should be addressed if parking requirements are relaxed. 15 See Chapter 2 Economy, Strategy 6.c. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 48 development of design gui delines. (See Chapter 3 Historic and Archeological Resources and Map 4 Historic District Inset ) Hamlet District (H) (New D istrict) The Hamlet District is proposed to accommodate very small villages or clustered residential neighborhoods in outlying rural a reas, with the goal of enhancing the historic or existing character by allowing the traditional smaller lot sizes and corresponding dimensional standards. Typical uses would include single and two family homes, home occupations, a corner grocery, a small c hurch or other public use. East Dover, South Dover, and residential clusters associated with Branns Mill Pond and Sebec Lake , and perhaps other similar places would benefit from this designation. Good neighbor standards would ensure compatibility with exis ting uses, and incompatible uses would be would be restricted. The only capital investments envisioned are improvements to the state highways serving these areas to include wilder shoulders for pedestrians, and improvements to any water access facilities. The Hamlets associated with Sebec Lake , Branns Mill Pond and the Piscataquis River would have shoreland zones t o provide protection for these water bodies. These water bodies, as well as others , would also be protected through state laws and local performa nce standards. (See Table 9-1 and Map 19 Future Land Use Map ) Commercial District (C) (Renamed from Commercial 2) The Commercial District, which is located along West Main Street west of the Village District, accommodates commercial and compatible manufact uring uses that require larger parcels (larger buildings, more parking, outdoor storage) , and access to a state highway, such as shopping centers, commercial complexes, auto sales and repair, restaurants, larger retail and service businesses, warehouses, a nd motels. Prohibited uses are those that present conflicts, such as new residential uses , and those uses that would be more suitable in other areas of the community, such as churches, public schools and heavy industries. All uses must meet site plan revie w standards. Overriding goals of this district are to encourage efficient use of land and infrastructure (state highway, sewer, water), to maintain carrying capacity and safety through access management on West Main Street (Guilford Road), and to limit st rip development and sprawl. While much of the buildable road frontage in the existing district is occupied, there may be additional land available for uses that don't require a lot of road frontage and/or that could located set back from the highway. This Plan proposes a limited expansion of this district westward along the north side of the Guilford Road , and adjustment of the rear district line to reflect a large wetland in that area. This district is consistent with existing uses, has access to infrastru cture, and has areas suitable for infill and additional development with few development constraints. Shoreland zoning regulations provide protection for those areas of the district adjacent to the Piscataquis River, and state and local land use regulation s protect wetlands and small streams. (See Table 9-2 and Map 19 Future Land Use) Commercial District Recommendations 1. Revise the purpose statement in the LUO to more accurately reflect this Plan . 2. Review land uses and performance standards, in general; specific performance standards for shopping cente rs or commercial complexes would be beneficial ; address any new uses of concern , such as marijuana dispensaries, if allowed . 3. Consider two boundary c hanges: a) a westward expansion of the district on the north side of the Guilford Road, and b) rezoning the most northern strip of the district to Rural Residential to more accurately reflect the extensive wetlands in that area. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 49 4. Access management is a h igh priority to maintain safety and highway capacity (See Chapter 7 Transportation) 5. Capital investments for this district include improvements to the state highway (shoulders wide enough for bicycles and pedestrians would be desirable), expansion of pub lic sewer and water and stormwater systems as development occurs. Light Industrial District (LI) (Rename from Industrial District - I) The Light Industrial District is designed to support existing and new business and light industrial uses. The distinct c urrently encompasses the Pine Crest Business Park, which is situated off the Dexter Road (State Route 7), and is surrounded on three sides by the Village District. The Business Park has several occupants, including a government office, a day care/preschool facility, and a vacant building. The remaining six vacant lots are all pre - permitted with necessary infrastructure. The d istrict accommodates compatible business and light industrial uses, such as professional offices, boat building and repair, light manu facturing, wholesale businesses, commercial schools, and fitness facilities. New residential uses, junkyards and demolition and waste disposal are prohibited. All new uses require site plan review to assure compatibility with adjacent districts and interna l uses. This plan proposes to expand this district to include the municipal airport area, and to allow airport -related uses as well as other business and light industrial uses. The entire district as proposed is consistent with current uses; either has, o r has the potential to have, access to sewer and other infrastructure; and has vacant land for additional growth with few development constraints and no known critical natural resources. However, t here is an area with critical natural resources associated with a large wetland complex just south of the district which would be protected through state laws and land use ordinance performance standards, such as buffers and setbacks . (See Table 9-2 and Map 19 Future Land Use ) Light Indu strial District Recommendat ions 1. Revise the purpose statement in the LUO to more accurately reflect this Plan . 2. Consider expanding this district to include the airport area . (See Map 9 Future Land Use ) 3. Review and amend land uses and performance standards to accommodate any p roposed changes in the district, including consideration for airport -related uses and buffers and setbacks along district boundaries. 4. The planned development design tool should be available to support unified design proposals. 5. No capital investments are envisioned, however , expansion of the district to include the airport area suggest s the need to expand infrastructure in the area as demand arises. Industrial District (I) (New D istrict) The new Industrial District designation supports expansions of existing industries, industrial redevelopment, and new industries in and around ar eas of existing industrial uses to include the Pleasant River Lumber area and the Landfill Road area including the Verso log yard, the closed municipal landfill and the regio nal transfer station. Providing adequate space for expansions and new industrial uses is a high priority. This district accomm odates manufacturing , and medium and heavy industrial uses, recycling, the solid waste transfer station, demolition and waste dispo sal, forest products -related industries, energy generation - biomass, medium -large scale solar, etc. Uses that would present conflicts, such as new residential uses would be prohibited (any existing uses would be grandfathered). Performance standards would be developed to address industrial land use concerns, and also provide buffers and setbacks in areas adjacent to other districts with residential uses. Dimensional and design standards w ould accommodate these types of uses. Capital investments envisioned for these districts include improvements to the state highways, such as the Milo Road, and the Town's Landfill Road to accommodate new development. Public sewer and/or water systems improvements may also be necessary, but these would likely be funded by de velopers. Adequate power for expanded or new industrial uses may be an issue that will need to be resolved, even though three -phase power is already available. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 50 These districts have areas of developable land, interspersed with some wetlands that would be protected through state and local standards. The Pleasant River area abuts Daggett Brook which is protected through shoreland zoning, and an associated wetland that can be protected through state law and LUO performance standards. A candidate deer wint ering area has also been identified in the Pleasant River District, which would be verified with any expansion. (See Table 9-2 and Map 19 Future Land Use ) Rural Areas Essential to Dover -Foxcroft's vision for the future i s preserving and enhancing the T own' s vast rural areas, which occupy about 90% of the community's land area. W hen considering the Town's rural areas it is important to realize that Dover -Foxcroft has the land area of two towns, as it once was. Rural areas are deserving of some level of reg ulatory protection from unrestricted development for purposes that may include, but are not limited to, supporting agriculture, forestry, sand and gravel extraction, open space, wildlife habitat, fisheries habitat and scenic lands, and away from which most incompatible and non -resource - based development projected over ten years is diverted. An overriding purpose is to maintain the existing rural character, including critical and important natural resources, and the rural economy that is dependent on these resources, such as high -value farm and forestland, scenic areas and other land valuable to outdoor recreation. Rural area districts, Rural Residential (RR) and Farm and Forest (FF), promote these goals, with RR surrounding urban areas and FF occupying the vast outlying areas. This plan supports maintaining the existing types and intensities of land uses while ensuring that new uses are compatible and consistent with the Vision and goals of this Comprehensive Plan. Additionally, this rural area districting i s consistent with areas in adjacent towns. The new designations of urban and growth area districts, such as expan sion of the Commercial District and the Light Industrial District, and the new Industrial District and Hamlet District, are designed to encour age many commercial, institutional and industrial uses to these areas rather than rural areas, where maintaining agriculture, forestry and open space for outdoor recreation are high priorities. Redistricting most of the area between Essex Street and Vaughn Road, and outlying areas around East Dover to Farm and Forest also serves to recognize the important farmland in this area. Overall, these changes will help m inimize traffic impacts on the Town's rural roads from more -intensive types of new development. Natural opportunities within both these districts are abundant, and include extensive areas of productive farm and forestland including prime and important farmland soils, large areas important to outdoor recreation, such as Peaks Kenny State Park, the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area, the Northeast Wilderness Trust's land and other conserved lands. Rural portions of the Piscataquis River and other water bodies (e.g., Sebec Lake, Branns Mill Pond), abundant wildlife and fisheries habitat, unique natural areas, and an attractive rural landscape are also natural assets. Areas with constraints to rural development provide important functions, such as wetlands and floodplains providing benefits for wildlife, wate r quality, and buffers against flood hazards to development . Most commercial forestland is enrolled in the Tree Growth Property Tax Program and an increasing amount of commercial farmland is enrolled in the Farmland Property Tax Program, both programs the Town promotes. Critical natural resources, suc h as important wildlife and fisheries habitats, unique natural areas, public water supplies, and high -yield aquifers, are protected through federal and state regulations, T own shoreland zoning and floodplain regulations, Land Use Ordinance districting and performance standards, educational programs and volunteer efforts, land conservation, and the Tree Growth and Farm and Open Space Property Tax Programs. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 51 Rural area infrast ructur e is limited to state highways, rural Town roads, and private roads. Some private roads serve multiple residences, such as the camps asso ciated with Sebec Lake and the T own's other ponds. The relatively few municipal roads in rural areas serve to dis courage sprawl and allow for large areas of unfragmented wildlife habitat. Adequately maintaining the T own's rural roads is a significant challenge due to fiscal constraints, but is important to serving the rural economy in agriculture, forestry and outdoo r recreation. The other public facilities in rural areas are public recreation and water access facilities at Sebec Lake and several of the ponds, and trail systems. Anticipated capital investments focus on maintaining this infrastructure. The Town's waste water treatment plant is located in the rural area, but considered part of the urban area infrastructure. Rural Residential District (RR) (Rename d from Rural Residential 1 - RR1) The R ural Residential District accommodates areas of existing rural resident ial uses and home occupations, while maintaining rural character, protecting and supporting agriculture, forestry, and open areas for outdoor recreational uses, and providing for overall low -density residential growth interspersed with non -residential rura l uses, such as cottage industries, outdoor recreation facilities, and other uses typically found in rural areas. More intensive uses, such as mobile home parks, multifamily dwellings, and most commercial, industrial and semi -public uses must meet performa nce standards to assure compatibility and consistency with the goals of the district. Open space for wildlife and fisheries habitat, and a scenic landscape are important aspects of this area. With the exception of s maller parcels located along main roads, most parcels are relatively large in this district. (See Table 9-3 and Map 19 Future Land Use ) Farm and Forest District (FF) (Renamed from Rural Residential 2 - RR2) The F arm and Forest District accommodates rural residences, home occupations, agriculture and forestry uses and related uses, low intensity outdoor recreation and open spaces and water bodies, and other rural uses that do not detract from the rural character or natural resource -based economy of the area. With the exception of clusters of smalle r lots along main roads, most of the parcels are large. Open space for wildlife and fisheries habitat, unique natural areas, and the scenic landscape are important aspects of this area. Peaks Kenny State Park, Sebec Lake, the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Managemen t Area, the Northeast Wilderness Trust's land are all located within this district. Major portions, if not all of the watersheds (in Dover -Foxcroft) of Sebec Lake and the Town's other great ponds and streams are located within this District; shoreland zoni ng districts are immediately adjacent to these water bodies. Most second homes, camps and other seasonal uses are clustered along the shores of these water bodies. The T own's high -yield aquifer which follows Black Stream is also in this district, and this Plan recommends that standards be put in place to protect this important aquifer, portions of which are used for sand and gravel extraction. (See Table 9-3 and Map 19 Future Land Use ) Rural Residential District and Farm and Forest District Recommendations 1. Revise the statements of purpose in the LUO to more accurately reflect this Plan. 2. Revise uses in each district to be consistent with goals of preserving rural character, promoting agriculture and forestry, outdoor recreation, and other natural resour ce-based uses. 3. Consider mechanisms to limit the intensity of uses that may negatively impact agriculture and forest ry or place an undue burden on T own infrastructure and services. (e.g., limits on size of subdivisions, larger subdivisions must set -aside some ope n space and address impacts on T own roads, limits on size and intensity of other uses). 4. Revise dimensional standards and performance standards to be consistent with this Plan. 5. Revise planned unit development and conservation subdivision d esign provisions to provide more incentives for use of these tools to promote preservation of open space, important farm and forestland and other important natural resources. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 52 6. Consider proposed redistricting described elsewhere in this Plan to encourage and support land uses consistent with the Vision and land use goals.16 7. Other recommendations particularly important to these rural districts are included in the following sections: Chapter 5 Agriculture and Forestry, Chapter 4 Natural Resources and Chap ter 8 Parks, Recreation and Open Space. Critical Natural Resources Critical natural resources are very important to Dover -Foxcroft's vision for the future. The y are an essential part of the T own's quality of life and contribute significantly to the economy in outdoor recreation, tourism and second homes. Critical natural resource areas are comprised of one or more of the following: 1) shoreland areas; 2) large habitat blocks; 3) multi -function wetlands; 4) essential wildlife habitats and threatened, endangered, and special concern species [bald eagle nests, wood turtle habitat, etc.]; 5) significant wildlife habitats [mapped high - moderate value waterfowl and wading bird habitat, high -moderate value deer wintering areas and sig nificant vernal pool habi tat]; 6) significant freshwater fisheries habitat (Salmon and brook trout) and 7) 100 -year floodplains.17 Most of t hese areas are displayed on maps within the Comprehensive Plan. The Plan makes reference to the Beginning with Habitat Maps, as well. State, federal and local regulations and non -regulatory measures, such as land conservation and existing use - property tax programs (Tree Growth and Farmland and Open Space) are designed to protect critical natural resources to the greatest practicable exte nt from the impacts of incompatible development. At the state level the Natural Resources Protection Act , in particular, provide s a considerable amount of protection. At the local level protection is provided through Shoreland Zoning, the Floodplain Regula tions , the Subdivision Ordinance , and the Land Use Ordinance. Both the Shoreland Zoning Ordinance and the Floodplain Ordinance are consiste nt with state and federal laws. Many critical natural resources, such as large habitat blocks and deer wintering area s, receive some protection through rural area districting which seeks to limit development intensities and associated road building, and forestry and farmland using best management practices can be very compatible with protection of critical natural resour ces. Critical natural resources are also conserved within the Peaks Kenny State Park, the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area, the Northeast Wilderness Trust , and other conserved land. Habitat for important fisheries, such as Atlantic salmon and brook tro ut, receive protection through Shoreland Zoning, as well as best management practices by the public works employees and certified contractors working in shoreland areas. Education on protection of important and critical natural resources includes informati on and activities through the U niversity of Maine Cooperative Extension and the Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District (both have offices in Dover -Foxcroft). The Sebec Lake Association and water quality monitors also provide protection to critical natural resources. Capital investments associated with critical natural resources include grant funding and collaboration to identify and remediate problem areas, such as Brownfields Projects, wastewater system upgrades, addressing erosion 16 The existing rural areas allow a very broad range of land uses, some that are inconsistent with the goals of these districts. Creation and expansi on of growth area districts for commercial and industrial uses is designed to encourage many commercial and industrial activities in these areas as opposed in designated rural area districts. The Hamlet Districts accommodate existing clusters of homes and other neighborhood uses. 17 Maine's Growth Management Act define s \"Critical natural resources\" Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 53 and sed imentation associated with boat launches, bridges and roadways, and improvements to public access to water bodies. Critical Natural Resource Recommend ations 1. Consider rezoning an area currently zoned as Shoreland Limit ed Commercial between West Main Street and the Piscataquis River to Shoreland Residential or Resource Protection to be consistent with the adjacent Rural Residential and Farm and Forest Districts. 2. Utilize new information on critical natural resources, such as the Beginning with Habitat information, to amend land use regulations and for educational and conservation efforts. 3. Amend the LUO to be consistent with state law, such as protection for non -community public water supplies. 4. Consider amending the LUO to protect important high -yield aquifers, such as potential future water supplies for the community or industry, such as the aquifer located along Black Stream and the Branns Mill Pond. 5. See Chapter 4 Natural Resources for more recommendations. Other Land Use Recommendations to Co nsider 1. New Energy and Communications Uses a. Develop land use standards to address wind, solar and other forms of energy generation, and uses related to new technology in communications and utilities. Consider associated facilities, such as transmission lines and substations. b. Depending on the size and potential impacts of these projects, generally allow relatively small scale installations with standards to assure compatibility in many areas of Town, while limiting large scale, more intensive commerci al installations to certain districts, such as an industrial district where they can be safely and compatibly accommodated. Properly located and regulated in rural areas, particularly where uses are related to agriculture or forestry may also be appropriat e. 2. Other New Uses a. Develop land use standards to address uses, such as marijuana facilities, adult entertainment, and drug treatment facilities, where location relative to residential neighborhoods and schools, and public safety may be significant con cerns. These uses might be most suitable in districts where there are few residences and public places (e.g., commercial district, industrial district) b. Make ordinance revisions to accommodate new housing arrangements and business models, such as senior s housing options, ecotourism, agrotourism, pop -ups and street vendors in the downtown, and commercial or industrial incubators with shared facilities or services. c. Develop performance standards for industrial scale, high intensity agriculture, such as large commercial greenhouses and marijuana growing operations, and large livestock and poultry facilities. d. Make ordinance revisions to address different kinds of corridors t o include intensity and impacts, such as \"mega\" versus \"mini' recreational corridors. 3. High -impact Uses; Mega Projects18 a. Develop a permitting process and standards to address large, high -impact uses, such as industrial -scale water extraction, large wi nd farms, major chemical pipelines or power transmission line corridors, and major utility/transportation corridors to include both public and private sector projects. If federal and/or state law preempts local regulation, the Comprehensive Plan and Ordin ance standards c an be used to advocate for the T own's concerns in negotia tions and the federal and state permitting process. 18 These types of projects are regulated at federal and state levels, often by multiple agencies, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 54 b. Require, or strongly recommend that developers hold community meetings to get input prior to submitting an application. Public i nput should be recorded and submitted to the T own. c. Require, or strongly recommend that developers meet with local officials, the state and other potentially involved entities to get input prior to submitting an application. Input from these meetings should be recorded and submitted to the Town. d. Require that developers submit all federal and state application materials and provide copies of permit approvals, as applicable. The Town should consider participating in, or coordinating with state and federa l permitting processes (e.g., interested parties, interveners). e. Require at least one preapplication meeting with Town staff to consider sketch plans for the proposed project, application requirements, the need for economic and environmental impact studi es, and potential impacts fees, mitigation and community benefits, and other concerns. f. Require coordination with other impacted communities , including participation in the state permitting process. Joint p articipation as interested parties or interveners with other impacted communities might be beneficial to the Town from the perspective of effectiveness and cost. g. Require that developers pro vide funding so the T own can retain the legal and technical exp ertise necessary to review the application. h. Develop land use standards to adequately a ddress T own concerns such as: 1 ) overall consistency with the Vision and the recommendations of this Co mprehensive Plan; 2) impacts on existing and future land uses; 3) impacts on the local economy, including attractiveness for future developme nt consistent with the Vision; 4) impacts on citiz ens' ability to earn a living; 5) impacts on community character, such as cultural heritage, social atmosphere, scenery, recreati onal opportunities and overa ll enjoyment of the community; 6) impacts on public facilities and services, such as emergency services (e.g., fire, police, ambulance, hospital, evacuation ro utes), and overall access to government services ; 7) impacts on the transportation system in cluding state and local roads; 8) impacts on downtown businesses and activities ; 9) impacts on exist ing businesses and industries; 10) impacts on agriculture, fores try, outdoor recreation and tourism; 11) impacts on property val ues a nd the property tax base; 12) impacts on air and water quality, and other environmental concerns, such as noise and light pollution; 13) impacts on the natural environment, such as the Piscataquis River , Sebec Lake and other water bodies, groundw ater resou rces, public water supplies, wildlife and fisheries habitats, and other unique and important habitats; 14) and impacts on overall health, safety and welfare. i. Since these uses may not be specifically allowed in any district, consider the use of planned development districts or provisions,19 which if approved become land use districts in the Land Use Ordinance. There could be Mega Planned Development Districts and Major Planned Development Districts to provide flexibility for mixed use development, such as in the Downtown District. 19 Examples: 1) The Planned Development ordinance provision is required for certain projects to ensure adequate public review, encourage unified planning and development, promote economica lly beneficial development patterns that are compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods, allow design flexibility, and encourage the pro tection and conservation of natural resources. 2) Planned Development District (PDD). Planned development d istricts are intended to allow flexibility in development and encourage the use of innovative site planning techniques resulting in developments with improved design, character, and quality which preserve natural and scenic open spaces. A PDD is characteri zed by a plan that may incorporate housing of different types and densities and compatible commercial, institutional, and industrial developments. Furthermore, a PDD allows for the establishment of dimensional and use requirements unique to the property to accommodate flexibility in the arrangement of uses within the project for the general purpose of promoting and protecting the public health , safety, and general welfare. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 55 j. Require as appropriate , community benefits, exactions or impact fees that meet nec essary legal tests, including: 1) they are legally permissible in Maine; 2) the requirements (fees or improvements) are linked to the i mpacts o f the new development; 3) the requirements are pr oportional to the impacts; and 4) there is a reasonable connection between the use of the requirements (fees or improvements) and the benefits produced for the new development. 3. Other Recommended Revisions a. Ensure that T own ordinances are consistent with federal and state laws . b. Ensure that ordinances are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan . c. Review and revise definitions so they are consistent and complete. d. Review and update performance standa rds to address recommendations within this Plan . e. Require that access to back land (i.e. land that does not have frontage on a public road or private right - of-way) is retained as land is developed. f. Review and amend, as necessary, the existing contract zone provisions to assure it will achieve its indented purpose, which is to provide flexibility while being consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 59 Chapter 10 - Ten Year Capital Investment Plan Overview The Capital Investment Plan contains a summary of municipal capital investments anticipated during the ten- year planning period necessary to implement the recommendations of this Comprehensive P lan. Capital investments typically include the repair, renewal, replacement or purchase of capital items. These differ from consumables, which are ordinarily budgete d as operating expenses. Capital investments usually have the following characteristics: they are relatively expensive (e.g., acquisitions of $5,000+); they generally don't reoccur annually but have a useful life of 3+ years; and usually result in fixed as sets. Capital items can include buildings and real property, equipment and machinery, utilities and longterm contracts , and are often funded through the financial reserves. In some cases further study is necessary to identify specific capital investment needs, priorities and funding mechanisms. Dover -Foxcroft has a formal budgeting and six -year capital planning process. Each year the six-year plan is used to determine the budget for the upcoming year, and then updated to include the next six years . The goa l is to anticipate major capital outlays, and to prioritize and schedule funding for projects in a fiscally sound manner that minimizes drastic changes in tax levels and cost -effectively manages interest payments on borrowed money. By anticipating future needs the Town is also better able to take advantage of creative funding approaches and outside funding opportunities. Dover -Foxcroft strives to maintain a balanced financial approach that utilizes short -term capital outlays through current year revenues a nd annual contributions to reserve accounts and longer -term financing for large projects, such as the following: Bonding, such as through the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, USDA Rural Developm ent, or Camden National Bank or other competitive means .

Local: Plan for, finance, and develop an efficient system of public facilities and services to encourage popul ation growth and economic development , while also being prepared for any unanticipated downturn in the local economy . Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 60 Policies 1. Improve the community's fiscal health by working to grow and diversify the property tax base. 2. Finance existing and future facilities and services in a cost -effective and affordable manner. 3. Continue multi -year capital improvements programming to prioritize and fund necessary capital improvements, to facilitate use of a broad range of funding mechanisms , and to minimize dr astic changes to local property taxes. 4. Continue to seek out -side sources of funding, such as through the state and federal programs and private sector contributions. 5. Balance the need to adequately provide services and maintain T own assets (e.g., roads, bridges, buildings) to keep from falling behind while controlling property tax increases.20 6. Maintain an appropriate balance between providing public infrastructure to encourage development and having new development pay its own way in providing th e infrastructure it requires. Implementation Strategies 1. Overall Fiscal Health a. Maintain a strong, diverse, and growing tax base through efforts to support population growth, adequate services and facilities, economic and community development, and preservation of community character. b. Ensure an equitable system of property taxation by maintaining up -to-date property valuations consistent with market trends and the overall goals of the community. c. Ensure equitable regional participation in share d services, such as emergency services, recycling and solid waste disposal, through service agreements and other mechanisms. d. Advocate for adequate state and county funding for services and facilities, such as schools, roads, and emergency services . e. Continue to aggressively seek outside sources of funding to support necessary capital investments with assistance from the Piscataquis Economic Development Council. f. Address the relatively high proportion of tax -exempt properties in Dover -Foxcroft, such a s state and county government properties , the hospital a nd other non -profits, through contributions (e.g., fees, services, equipment, and infrastructure) in lieu of taxes which can be used to su pport services provided by the T own. Responsibility : Board of Selectpersons , Town Manager, Bud get Committee, Treasurer, Assessor / Timeframe: ongoing 2. Capital Improvements Pr ogramming a. Utilize the Comprehensive Plan as a guide for ongo ing capital improvemen ts programming with the following objectives: i. To prioritize and schedule funding for capital projects in a fiscally sound manner . ii. To minimize drastic changes in property taxes from year to year . III. To cost-effectively manag e the T own's borrowing capacity and debt load . iv. To adequately maintain the Town's capital infrastructure and assets into the future . 20 Property tax increases are limited by LD 1 An Act to Increase the State Share of Education Costs, Reduce Property Taxes and Reduce Government Spending at All Levels (enacted 1/20/05). The purpose is to keep the percentage growth in taxes below the percentage increase in per sonal income. The tax c ap is applicable to state, county, and local governments. Volume I Recommendations Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan Volume I , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 61 b. Continue multi -year capital improvements programming; utilize this in developing the annual budget, with recommendations from the Budget Committee. c. Continue to use rese rve accounts, bonds, loans , gran ts, state road subsidies, lease agreements, trust accounts, refinancing options, fundraising , voluntary contributions, and general funds for capital improvements. d. Utilize as applicable other funding mechanisms, such as user fees, tax increme nt financing, and impact fees. e. Maintain adequate funding in existing and new reserve accounts for ongoing capital purchases (major equipment and buildings ) based on depreciation values, to keep from falling behind. Responsibility : Board of Selectperso ns, Town Manager, Bud get Committee, Department Heads / Timeframe: ongoing 3. Transportation Management System a. Continue the Road Management Program to include an ongoing inventory and scheduling of capital improvements in order to spread the costs out o ver time. b. Utilize the town -wide paved road assessment completed by a consultant in 2015 to de velop a multi -year capital plan to affordably bring the transportation infrastructure u p to standards and then seek to adequately maintain this infrastructure with the goal of not falling behind . c. Seek T own adoption of a multi -year capital plan for the transportation system , which can then be used to develop annual budgets in future years. d. Expand the program to include other transportation improvements, suc h as gravel roads, sidewalks, parking, and stormwater infrastructure, as funding capacity grows. Responsibility: Board of Selectmen, Town Manager, Budget Committee / Timeframe: ongoing 4. Equitable Sharing of the Costs of Development a. Maintain an affordable balance between public and private involvement in funding any infrastructure required by new development, such as sewer, water, sidewalks, parking, and roads, through enactment of policies and ordinances to address this issue. b. Work with the Town Wastewater Department and Dover -Foxcroft Water District as needed to address system improvements and expansions associated with new developments, including consideration for developer participation in paying for improvements. c. Consider approaches, such as tax increment financing, cost -sharing, impact fees, community benefits, incentives, and other mechanisms designed to ensure that new development pays its fair share and improves the public infrastructure specifically needed for the deve lopment. Responsibility: Board of Select persons , Town Manager, Budget Committee, Wastewater Department, Water District, Planning Board / Timeframe: ongoing 5. Regional Coordination and Collaboration a. Work with n eighboring communities and the c ounty to p lan for and finance shared capital investments to increas e cost -savings and efficiencies, such as: i. Emergency services through the county, including dispatch, communications, and emergency planning , and expanded collaboration in providing municipal poli ce and fire services. ii. Transfer station (solid waste and recycling) , and solid waste disposal iii.

Growth -related In vestments Continue to d irect a minimum of 75% of new municipal growth -related capital investments into designated growth and urban areas. Responsibility : Board of Selectmen, Town Manager, Department and Agency heads/ Timeframe: ongoing Ten -year Capital Investments Summary Table 10-1 summarizes identified capital investment s for the next decade . These projects and priorities may change over time depending on a variety of circumstances, such as unforeseen opportunities and shifting community opinions. Some projects may require further study to determine specific needs and approaches. It must be noted that the Town has not been able to adequately fund capital needs due t o fiscal constraints associated with very minimal growth of the tax base, cuts to municip al revenue sharing and state aid to education, LD 1 limitations ,21 and a s tagnant economy that has limited citizens' ability to pay higher taxes . As a result, many of the capital investments displayed in Table 10-1 represent an effort to maintain the existi ng infrastructure without falling too far behind. Most of these capital investments are located in urban and g rowth areas, where most of the T own's infrastructure is located, with the major exception of rural roads. All of the projects listed are importan t, but given fis cal constraints, the projects have been assigned a priority with potential funding mechanisms . In general, all these projects are considered high priorities for funding through grants and other non -municipal funds. 21 LD 1 An Act to Increase the State Share of Education Costs, Reduce Property Taxes and Reduce Government Spending at All Levels (enacted 1/20/05). The purpose is to keep the percentage growth in ta xes below the percentage increase in per - sonal income. The tax cap is applicable to state, county, and local governments.

A stable, demograph ically diverse population, particularly in age make -up, is necessary to support a community's overall economy and the infrastructure and services the population needs and desires. One of the greatest challenges facing Maine, and rural areas in particular, is the overall aging of the population and slow population growth. Maine is the oldest state in the nation, and its rural counties tend to be even older demographically. As baby boomers retire, employers are increasingly faced with the possibility of more job openings than people to fill them. In addition, the skill sets of the younger generations may not match available openings. Demand for health care workers of all sorts will rise as the baby boomers require more medical care. A larger and larger elderly population will depend on a smaller and smaller working population unless more working -age people move into the state. In order for Maine's population to be sustainable and companies to find the employees they need, in -migration to Maine must increase.1 Dover -Foxcroft faces these challenges, particularly given its location in rural Piscataquis County. Overall Population Characteristics The Town's population is estimated to be 4,135 for 2015; the 2010 population was 4,216. The Town's median age is 45, as compared to 48.1 countywide and 42.7 statewide for 2010. About 6.4% of the population is under age 18; 6.4% is age 18 to24; 51.9% is age 25 to 64; and 20.2% of the population is age 65 years and older. In 2000, 17.7% of the population was age 65 years and older. Anticipated Population Changes and Implications Dover -Foxcroft's year -round population is expected to remain stable over the next decade. The Town's older population overall is attributed to more deaths than births (natural change), and older peopl e moving to Dover -Foxcroft to reside in one of the senior housing facilities . During the 2000s when the population increased by 3 individuals, from 4,213 to 4,216, it was the net result of 210 more deaths than births, and the net in -migration of 213 people . The Town anticipates the continuation of in -migration, particularly with its efforts to become more attractive as a place to reside. Two contributing factors to this trend are the closure of schools in nearby small communities which suggests that famili es may move to Dover -Foxcroft to be closer to the schools, and the Town's efforts to provide senior housing close to services. Maintaining a stable population size with demographics that support a healthy, prosperous community require s that more people mov e to the Town. Young families who both increase the number of births and provide a wo rkforce would bring more long -term stability . More middle -aged people and seniors would also contribute to economic stability particularly given that people are working lo nger. The Town's strategy to maintain a stable population should consider regional trends, such as the projections for population growth (even though modest) in Bangor and Newport. Piscataquis County, including nearly all of the communities around Dover -Foxcroft, is projected to experience loss in population over the next decade. As the service center and shiretown for the region, Dover -Foxcroft would benefit from population growth countywide. 1 Maine Population Outlook 2013 - 2028, Maine Land Use Team (March 30, 2010) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 7 An increasingly older population can mean an overall older workf orce, fewer people available to be in the workforce, skill sets less likely to match current workforce demands and shifting needs , such as those for housing, transportation, health care, social services, and recreation. An older population can also mean more people willing and able , and with special skills, to contribute to the community. Non -resident Population The non -resident population is important to the social fabric and economy of the community. The non-resident population includes people who own sec ond homes or stay at short -term lodging - accommodations, such as campgrounds, bed and breakfasts , and motels. The 2010 Census found 451 \"seasonal, recreational or occasional use\" housing units - about 18% of all housing units. The daytime population increas es significantly with people coming to work, shop, socialize and obtain health care and other services. This daytime population provides considerable economic benefits. Dover -Foxcroft supports its non -resident and daytime population by serving as the county seat of Piscataquis County and a regiona l service center with government services, a hospital, health care and social services, educational services and a broad range of businesses and employers. Educational Attainment, Income and Poverty Overall, the Town's residents appear to be better educated and financially better off than in the past. Almost 94% of residents age 25 and over were high school graduates for the 2010 Census. This compares to 83% for the 2000 Census. The percentage of residents age 25 and over with a bachelor's degree or higher was 19% for the 2010 Census, which was higher than educational attainment county wide , but lower than statewide. In 2000, 17% of residents age 25 and over had a bachelor's degree . Education al attainment is a good predictor of the economic success. Potential employers seek an educated workforce when considering where to locate a business or industry. Since educational attainment and economic prosperity are closely linked, it is not surprising that the Town's population appears to have overall higher incomes than countywide, but lower incomes than statewide. Income levels in rural areas are typically less than those in urban areas because there are fewer job opportunities in rural areas . Poverty data suggest th ere is significantly less poverty in Dover -Foxcroft today than in the year 2000. Poverty rates also appear to be significantly lower than countywide and statewide. Population in Group Quarters There were 183 individuals, or 4.3% of the population living in group quarters with 111 institutionalize d and 72 non -institutionalized (2010 Census). The institutionalized population include s residents of the Hibbard Nursing Home, Pleasant Meadows, and Hilltop Manor, inmates of the Piscataquis County Jail, and residen ts of the Charlotte White homes. Non-institutionalized individuals include those living in the dorms at Foxcroft Academy. The percentage of residents living in group quarters in Dover -Foxcroft (4.3%) was higher than countywide (1.1%) and statewide (2.7%) a ccording to the 2010 Census. Section 1.2 Economy While Dover -Foxcroft's economic prosperity is highly dependent on the overall health and vitality of the regional, state and national economies , the Town is best able to promote prosperity if it understands its economic strengths and challenges, and potential opportunities within the context of the long -term economic trends affecting the country today . Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 8 A detail analysis of the economic trends is beyond the scope of this document, particularly given the ongoing debate amongst experts on what the trends mean and how they might affect the future. But a basic understanding of these trends may be helpful in planning for the Town's future. The primary factors driving the overal l economy today are globalization, technology , financialization, and demographics. Increasing income inequality with the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer and a shrinking middle class is also a structural trend that may be affecting the ability of the middle class to prosper. These long - term structural trends are resulting in fundamental changes to the country's economy, and are the most important to consider in comprehensive planning. Less important are c yclical changes, such as periods of growt h and recession , because they are temporary changes that do not affect the long -term structure of the economy. The following is a brief description of each of these structural factors. Globalization is defined as the increasing process of international int egration and interdependence of economic and cu ltural activities.2 Globalization has been the primary factor in driving the loss of jobs in manufacturing over the past several decades both in the U.S. and in Maine: a trend that is expected to continue. Coupled with globalization, technology continues to shap e the economy, with the pace of technological change expected to accelerate. Changes in technology and the demand for innovation have increased the need for skilled workers in terms of knowledge, skills, and abilities required for job performance. Financialization describes an economic system or process that attempts to reduce all value that is exchanged (whether tangible or intangible, future o r present promises, etc.) into financial instrument s. The in tent is to reduce any work product or service to an exchangeable financial instrument, like currency, thereby mak ing it easier for people to trade . As a result financial markets tended to dominate over traditional industrial and agricultural economies .3 Another , perhaps equally important trend affecting the national economy is the aging population and the impending retirements of baby boomers, which is profoundly impacting labor markets and reshaping long - standing patterns of demand for goods and services . This is particularly true in Maine, which is the overa ll oldest state in the country. In summary, perhaps the wisest advice for a Dover -Foxcroft is reflected in the following statement: \"Increasingly, Maine's competitiveness is determined by the quality and availability of human capital. Much of the growth will have to come from entrepreneurship and initiative of Maine's smaller businesses, and entrepreneurial startups. \"4 Challenges and Opportunities5 The long -term structural changes occurring in the econ omy today are impacting Dover -Foxcroft and Piscataquis County , presenting both challenges and opportunities. Dover -Foxcroft has many assets upon which to build a prosperous future, such as an excellent quality of life. Key to this endeavor is providing acc ess to state -of-the-art telecommunications, particularly given the Town's location in rural Piscataquis County. If the Town is to maintain and promote economic prosperity it must continue to improve its competitive advantage to grow its population and eco nomy. Historically, Dover -Foxcroft's economy thrived when it had a competitive advantage in terms of its location proximate to timber for making wood products and a ccess to the river for movement of logs and making electricity. Today's economy is increasin gly reliant on reliable, high - 2 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization 3 Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization 4 Sources: The Maine L and Use Team (The Maine Economy: Year -End Review and Outlook 2008) 5 Other chapters of the Comprehensive Plan will focus on t opics that are relevant to the T own 's economy , such as the chapters on Services and Facilities, Transportation, Agriculture and For estry , and Recreation. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 9 speed telecommunications: the new \"river\" for moving information and services into and out of the Town. While the Town's access to state -of-the art telecommunications may never be substantially better than other areas, if it is not eq ual to other areas, the Town will cont inue to fall behind. Dover -Foxcroft's quality of lif e could in and of itself be a competitive advantage in terms of ability to attract a workforce , entrepreneurs , and other investments but this advantage could easily be negated if Town's capacity for high speed internet isn't present and accessible . Economic Strengths and Weaknesses Population growth and stability requires more job and business opportunities, combined with adequate affordable housing, services and facilities, and cultural and social amenities. Dover -Foxcroft has many strength s to be emphasized in growing the population and economy: o The Town is a small , close -knit community located in central Maine surrounded by a vast rural landscape with forests, farms, lakes and many pri stine natural resources. It is clean, safe and beautiful . o As the county seat and primary service center for the region, it has a diversified economy and tax base. Economic sectors include healthcare, social services, busin ess services, retail, government services, manufacturing, natural resource -based industries, and arts, recreation and cultur e. The strongest sector is in healthcare and social services, particularity as a result of the Mayo Hospital, social services agenci es, and other related businesses. o While governmental services and non -profits may not contribute directly to the local tax base, they do bring people to the community to live, shop and conduct business. o The Town is within 35 miles of the Bangor metropoli tan area where there is an international airport, several colleges and technical schools, major employers, shopping malls, etc. o The Town is at the intersection of state routes 6, 7, 15, 16 and 153, and i s 25 miles from Interstate 95. o The Town has an indust rial park with infrastructure including access to high -speed fiber optic internet, and the lots are pre -permitted for future occupants. o The Town has excess sewage treatment capacity, an d plentiful drinking water supplies . o Land and homes are affordable com pared to many other service centers in the state. o The Town has excellent schools including an award -winning high school, with students coming from as far away as the county of China. o The Three -Ring binder fiber optic network can potentially allow businesse s and residents access to high -speed internet. Telecommuting means people can live in Dover -Foxcroft and work and sell services and products to just about anywhere in the world. o Dover -Foxcroft is at one of the primary gateways to Maine's North Woods with Peaks -Kenny State Park, Borestone Mountain, and many other attractions easily accessible for day trips or longer stays. There are many opportunities in nature -based tourism. o The Town has many enthusiastic volunteers working to improve the community. Dover -Foxcroft's most significant challenges include: o Providing access to state -of-the-art high speed internet throughout the community , which critical for many reasons, including for employment, accessing services, conducting business, telemedicine, etc. o The Town's distance from the Bangor area and I -95 makes it less attractive for certain types of economic activity. This distance makes transportation of goods and materials more costly, and means longer commutes for residents working outside the region, such a s in Bangor. o The Town lacks direct access to rail service, which may discourage some types of development. o Adequate maintenance of state roads connecting the Town to the Bangor area and I -95. Adequate roads to surrounding areas are also important to area residents traveling to Dover -Foxcroft for work, shopping and other business. Maintaining local roads is also a challenge due to the cost. o Access to utilities - power is a limitation for certain types of expansions. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 10 o Limited Town funding for economic develo pment and to support maintenance and improvement of the infrastructure is a major constraint. o There are w orkforce constraints, such as having a workforce with the appropriate skills and training to support economic growth. Economic Development Priorities As the county seat and primary service center for Piscataquis County, Dover -Foxcroft plays a critical role in providing jobs and services to residents of the region. Expansion and diversification of the economic base in Dover -Foxcroft and the region by bot h public and private interests is vital for ongoing economic stability and prosperity. Dover -Foxcroft collaborates with the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council (PCEDC), and towns in the region to promote economic development. The Piscataquis Ch amber of Commerce is also a partner in economic development in the region. The Town Manager, working on behalf of the Selectmen oversees the Town's economic development activities, which involves extensive use of the expertise of PCEDC to develop programs and financing for infrastructure and business development. PCEDC has assisted the Town in obtaining a number of grants for projects, including the Riverfront Redevelopment Project, redevelopment of Central Hall, and business assistance to BS Farms and GLOB Eco LLC. Dover -Foxcroft's highest priorities for economic development include: o Providing high -speed internet throughout the community through connection to the Three -Ring Binder fiber optic network. o Improving and maintaining the infrastructure critical to the economy , such as transportation systems other municipal facilities and services. o Improving transportation linkage to I -95 and the Bangor area. o Downtown revitalization including advancing the Maine Downtown Network Community initiative. o Supporting the Riverfront Redevelopment project , including the Mayo Mill Commercial Office Plaza and Data Center, renewable energy generation, high -speed int ernet, and spin -off development nearby. o Build -out of Pine Crest Business Park - identifying best uses and focusin g on the Park's unique assets. o Seeking more affordable energy alternatives, including renewable energy resources, such as hydropower, solar and geothermal power. o Improving access to utilities, including adequate energy (e.g., 3 -phase power) for economic gr owth. The Town is at the end -of-the-line in many cases - natural gas, power transmission, etc. o Determining the Town 's position on highway and/or utility corridors. o Increased growth in the property -tax base and the number of good jobs. o Given funding constraints, recommendations must identify priorities for the next decade. o Economic policies must consider all inter -related aspects of planning for the future, such as adequate affordable housing; education; work -force training; services; f acilities; social, cultural, recreational and other amenities; and a supportive and balanced fiscal and regulatory climate. Downtown Dover -Foxcroft's downtown serves as the civic, cultural and commercial center of the community and the region. Its strengt hs are its many historically significant buildings and its setting along the Piscataquis River and at the intersection of several major thoroughfares. The community treasures its downtown as evidenced through ongoing revitalization efforts. A citizen initiative led to the development of the Downtown Revitalization Plan (2003) and Dover -Foxcroft becoming a Maine Downtown Network Community. The Town is also a Tree City USA. There is a wealth of information and ideas on how to revitalize the downtown, and dedicated volunteers and organizations working to implement the many recommendations. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 11 Primary goals of downtown revitalization include: o Increasing vibrancy (commerce, civic, social, and cultural ). o Improving the infrastructure - public spaces, streets, sid ewalks, parking, trails, parks, lighting, signage, etc. (making the downtown more pedestrian friendly ). o Supporting businesses and organizations . o Encouraging more business, infill and redevelopment of vacant land and buildings. o Beautification - facades, lan dscaping, pocket parks, sidewalk amenities, lighting, trees, eliminating overhead power lines, eliminating blight, etc. o Supporting businesses and organizations through community events, and cultural and social offerings, such as the Center Theater, Histori cal Society, Kiwanis, Farmers Market, etc. Redevelopment of the historic Moosehead Mill complex , which has enormous potential for the entire community, and specifically the downtown. Town ordinances and economic development plans should be modified to take advantage of this development. The Town receives financial and/or technical support for revitalization through the Maine Development Foundation's Downtown Center and the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council (PCEDC). While the Town has obtained a number of grants t o support revitalization , the major challenge is funding. Tourism and the Seasonal Population Outdoor recreation and nature -based tourism is a significant part of the local and regional economy. The Town in collaboration with the PCEDC and the Piscataquis Chamber of Commerce promote and support the region's four -season recreational opportunities. Efforts include providing public access to water bodies, providing parks and recreational programs, putting on events and activities, and gener ally providing a broad range of services to second -home residents and short -term visitors. The Town offers many cultural activities such as those through the Historical Society, and Center Theater. Dover -Foxcroft includes information on the Town website to promote the community and provide information valuable to seasonal residents and tourists. Home Occupations There are many home occupations . In some cases home occupations have grown into larger businesses. The community supports and encourages home occ upations. The Town's land use regulations allow home occupations in nearly all areas of the community. Areas for Industrial and Commercial Development Dover -Foxcroft's Land Use Ordinance allows a range of businesses and industries in a number of locations, including the Pine Crest Business Park, the Industrial District, the Village District, two Commercial Districts, and in rural areas, as appropriate. The ordinance's performance standards are designed to assure that development is compatible with surroundi ng land uses and the landscape. The Industrial District does not allow residential uses. Ordinances and regulations should be evaluated to determine if they are serving the vision and goals of the community with respect to the economy. For example: o Do regu lations support mixed -use development (e.g., Riverfront Redevelopment ) in the downtown? o Are there areas with infrastructure and appropriately zoned to support desired commercial and industrial development? o What types of heavy industry might the community w ant, if any, and are there appropriate locations where this might be encouraged? o Do land use regulations adequately address new uses, such as utility corridors, pipelines, highway corridors, wind farms, adult businesses, marijuana dispensaries, water extr action, or other potentially controversial uses? Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 12 Adequacy of Public Facilities for Future Economic Development Dover -Foxcroft's strengths with respect to public facilities include public sewer and water with capacity for expansion, the Pine Crest Business Park, its access to several state highways , and potential access to the Three -Ring Binder fiber optic network. The biggest gaps in infrastructure include: o Affordable high speed internet connection to the existing \"first mile\" Three Ring Binder fiber optic system. The \"middle mile\" and \"last mile\" connections to residents and businesses however remotely located are needed. o Maintenance of adequate state and local roads and bridges is a major challenge. o Downtown deficiencies as described previously. o Affordable energy resources, including renewable resources. o Adequate power capacity, such as 3 -Phase power or natural gas, in areas where industrial expansion or new facilities might be desirable. Economic Development Incentives Dover -Foxcroft currently has two Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts designed to support economic development; both are located in growth areas: o The Riverfront Redevelopment TIF district was established in 2012/2013 to support redevelopment of the Moosehead Manufacturing Mill complex and area. TIF goals are to: maintain/ increase property t ax revenues within the district; create long -term, stable employment; improve the tax base; provide revenues for investment into public facilities and economic development; and to restore the landmark historic buildings. Arnold Development leases the property from Pine Crest (a municipally created non - profit) and is developing the mixed -use \"Mayo Mill Commercial Office Plaza and D ata Center\". The project will include Town ownership /involvement in renewable energy facilities, including hydropower, photovoltaic solar panels, and geothermal shafts under the parking lot. o The Pleasant River Lumber TIF district was established in 2001 to support modernization of the mill. Pleasant River Lumber is a major employe r and taxpayer. Other TIFs that might be considered include a downtown TIF and an affordable housing TIF. PCEDC and the Town have provided other types of incentives for growth, such as business assistance (revolving loan program, grants) to new/expanding businesses, and suitable locations with infrastructure to support commercial and industrial development, such as the Pine Crest Business Park. Affordable energy and high -speed internet are very important incentives for economic development. Free or low cos t high speed internet (Wi -Fi) in the urban area would be a strong incentive to encourage growth in that area of Town . Unique Assets to Promote Economic Growth Dover -Foxcroft has a wealth of unique assets for promoting economic growth, as described above. As the county seat and primary service center it offers services essential to the region's residents and visitors . Dover -Foxcroft provides an active social and cultural environment for the region, and is the only community in the region that has a YMCA and indoor pool . Unlike other communities in Piscataquis County, Dover -Foxcroft has many indoor recreational and cultural offerings that are available particularly when the region's renowned outdoor offerings are not available due to weather conditions. The P iscataquis County Fairgrounds located in Dover -Foxcroft is an underutilized facility. Dover -Foxcroft has an active Historical Society and Chamber of Commerce, and sponsors a number of events, such as the Balloon Festival and Homecoming Festival. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 13 Dover -Foxcroft needs to publicize itself better. As a starting point, the Town should inventory its assets as a great place to live, work, develop a business, and visit and then seek low cost ways to promote itself, such as improved promotion on the Ma ine Bureau of Tourism website . An inventory of the Town 's assets can also be used to identify weaknesses in offerings, such as gaps in certain types of businesses (lodging, restaurants, certain types of retail establishments) or opportunities (spin -offs off's related to the Mayo Hospital, Pleasant River Lumber, assisted living facilities , or the new Mayo Mill Commercial Office Plaza and Data Center). The new Mayo Mill Commercial Office Plaza and Data Center may fulfill some of these needs. See Map 2 Labor Marke t Area (Volume I Appendices) Section 1.3 Housing A town's housing stock reflects the health and well -being of the community. Housing issues important to planning for the future include housing type, supply, condition and affordability. Understanding demogr aphic trends is important to evaluating future housing needs. A noteworthy trend in many parts of Maine is the significant increase in the number of new housing units over the past decade even though there has been relatively slow population growth. Severa l reasons for this include: smaller household sizes resulting in the need for more housing units per person; people upgrading by building new homes; people downsizing to smaller housing types ; and people building second homes or purchasing homes as an inve stment. Adequate, affordable housing to a range of household incomes is essential to a healthy community. Changing demographics suggests there will be proportionately more middle -age people and senior citizens in the future, and there will be fewer young adults and children. Housing needs change as the population ages. Middle -age people, often at their peak earning capacity, may want larger homes, especially if they still have children at home. People approaching retirement age or concerned about living on a reduced income may want smaller, lower maintenance, more energy -efficient housing. Some seniors may want assisted living and, in some cases, nursing home care. People commonly affected by a shortage of affordable housing include senior citizens on fixed incomes, single parents, first -time home buyers, young families, and grown children seeking independence from parents. In some cases, seniors looking to downsize may be competing with first -time home buyers for smaller homes to purchase, and these same gr oups may be seeking rentals. Housing Characteristi cs According to property tax records there are 1,388 single family homes, 57 doublewides, 245 mobile homes, 277 seasonal homes, and 129 multifamily structures (two or more units) in Dover -Foxcroft. Multifamily structures include housing developments (i.e., Th ayer, Country Meadows, Riverview, Main Street Assisted Living, Foxcroft Academy Apartments), which account for 138 units. Other multifamily structures are smaller with fewer units, where the combined number of units is not easily calculated. Census counts of housing units are somewhat inconsistent with the local count, which is not unusual. However, it is important to keep this in mind when looking at Census information, which is the only way to compare the Town's historical trends, and make comparisons to countywide and statewide data. About 71% of housing units were single -family, about 18% were multifamily units, and 12% were mobile homes (2012 Census estimates ).6 About 72% of housing units were occupied year -round, 18% of housing units were for seasonal , recreational or occasional use, and 10% of housing units were vacant (2010 Census). 6 These estimates are based on sample data for 2008 through 2012, which is how the data is now collected and tabulated. The other 2010 Census data is based on the traditional census, which is often a 100% sample size. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 14 Almost 73% of Dover -Foxcroft's year -round housing was owner -occupied and about 27% of year -round housing was renter -occupied. Between 2000 and 2010, 34 new owner -occupied units were added and 81 new r enter -occupied units were added (2010 Census) . Future Housing Needs Even if the year -round population stays the same over the next decade, there will continue to be a demand for new housing, including different types of housin g. The Town should plan for an additional 250 to 350 housing units over the next ten years, which would be 25 to 35 units per year. This estimate includes all types of housing, and reflects the assumption that the size of the population will remain stable with modest growth . (Since 2000, there has been an increase of about 22 housing units per year based on the Town's property tax records, and an additional 42 units of multifamily housing was constructed in 2015/16 (See below ). Given the aging population an d overall smaller household sizes, there will continue to be a demand for smaller housing units, multifamily housing, condominiums, r ental units, and senior housing. Two new multifamily housing developments have been constructed recently: t he Moosehead Redevelopment (20 market rate un its already sold) and North View Apartments ( 24-units senior housing ). Even with the addition of these two senior housing projects there may continue to be a need for senior housing, both market -rate and subsidized. Dover -Foxcroft has an abundance of large, older homes that were designed for larger households. The future of these older homes depend s on the ability of owner s to maintain and utilize them. The 2010 Census vacancy rate for owner -occupied units was 3.9% or 53 units for sale, which suggests an adequate choice in housing, particularly given very slow population growth. In a faster growing community, 3.9% would suggest a tight housing market. The 2010 Census vacancy rate for renter -occupied units was 12.8%, o r 70 units for rent, which suggests an oversupply. The rental vacancy rate does not include seasonal, recreational or occasionally -used ho using. Locally, it is reported there is a shortage of adequate rental housing, which means that some of the vacancies reported in the census may not be of the type, cost, or condition for adequate rental housing. Housing Affordability Housing prices in Dover -Foxcroft and the Dover -Foxcroft Labor Market Area (LMA) are considered \"affordable\" according to Maine Housing (Mai ne State Housing Authority). Rental housing in Dover -Foxcroft and the Dover -Foxcroft LMA is considered \"unaffordable\" according to Maine Housing. Maine Housing calculated that 53% of all renter households in Dover -Foxcroft cannot afford the average 2 -bedro om rent of $711 (includes utilities). Affordable rental housing in Dover -Foxcroft includes three subsidized housing developments with a total of 38 subsidized family units and 56 subsidized senior units. Rents are based on income. The waiting list for sen ior units at Thayer has about 50 people listed. The combined waiting lists for family units (Country Meadows and Riverview) average around 35 people. All three housing managers indicated there was a need for more subsidized housing in Dover -Foxcroft. Other affordable housing options include five mobile home parks, mobile homes on lots outside parks, and accessory apartments in single -family homes. Foreclosed homes can also be affordable for people willing to fix them up. Year -round Use and Conversion of Sea sonal Housing Often seasonal camps, particularly lakefront properties, are converted to homes that could be used year - round. This trend generally improves the structures and upgrades septic systems, and serves to increase property values and the local tax base. The downside is that local people are less likely to be able to afford the traditional family camp on the lake. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 15 There is a need to upgrade septic systems for some camps. Conversions may also be impacting the number of rental units available. Hou sing Conditions The overall age of the housing stock can be an indicator of housing condi tions. Older housing often requires more upkeep, and may need new wiring, energy -efficiency improvements and lead paint remedia tion, which together raise health and safety concerns. Dover -Foxcroft's housing on average is older than countywide and statewide. o According to the 2000 Census, more than 40% of Dover -Foxcroft's housing stock was built prior to 1939, compared with almost 31% countywide and 29% statewide. o According to the 2011 Census, a bout 46% of Dover -Foxcroft's owner -occupied housing was built prior to 1940 as compared to 38% countywide and 24% statewide. Most of Dover -Foxcroft's renter -occupied housing was constructed after 1940, and similar to countywi de and statewide over 50% of renter - occupied housing was built after 1960. The last housing study to evaluate housing conditions and needs for Dover -Foxcroft was performed in 2001, and was the basis for obtaining the 2003 Community Development Block Grant . Given the age of the housing stock, it may be time t o reevaluate housing conditions. There are a number of government programs available to towns and individuals for housing, such as those available through Penquis, Efficiency Maine, Maine Housing, and t he Maine Department of Economic and Community Development Community Development Block Grant Program. Regulatory Impacts on the Development of Affordable, Workforce Housing Dover -Foxcroft's Land Use Ordinance (LUO) allows a variety of affordable/workforce housing options in nearly all areas of the Town. The ordinance allows higher density housing, including multifamily structures and mobile home parks, in areas served by sewer and water. Accessory apartments are allowed in all districts where residential us es are allowed. Multifamily housing and mobile home parks are also permitted in some rural districts. Clustered subdivision development is also permitted. Single -family mobile homes and manufactured housing are treated the same as stick -built housing and generally allowed throughout the Town. Community living arrangements, nursing homes, and convalescent facilities, and mixed use planne d unit developments are also allowed in several districts. The dimensional requirements (road frontage, building setbacks, etc.) are not overly constraining to the development of affordable housing. In the future, the Town may want to allow higher densities and more flexibility in the village, such as small - and large -scale mixed -use development (second story accessory apart ments above commercial uses, redevelopment of existing structures, etc.). Also, the Town should review the ordinance to assure that it will allow senior housing alternatives, such as assisted living arrangements. Lastly, the Town began administering the M aine Uniform Building and Energy Code (MUBEC) on July 1, 2012. Dover -Foxcroft is one of the few communities within the immediate region that is required to administer the Code because it has a population of over 4,000. This is perceived as being unfair, an d may be driving up the cost of building or renovating a home in Dover -Foxcroft, and discouraging people from living and/or investing in residential properties in the Town . Section 1.4 Historic and Archaeological Resources Dover -Foxcroft's rich cultural he ritage is evident today in its overall pattern of development and many historically significant features. The community showcases these features through the Historic Society's Blacksmith Shop and Observer Building museums, the sites on the National Registe r of Historic Places, the Historic District, and the recent redevelopment of the American Woolen Company Mill (Moosehead Redevelopment Project). The redevelopment of the Mill into a modern, mixed -use facility that maintains its Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 16 historic charm demonstrates the importance of preserving important historic and archaeological features for the future. The preservation and reuse of Central Hall to serve today's uses is another example of the importance of preserving the historic assets. The Town, in collaboration with the Historical Society and others, should explore other opportunities to enhance the unique character and charm of Dover -Foxcroft, particularly those that would revitalize the downtown. Historic Patterns of Settlement Still Evident Today Dover -Foxc roft's historic patterns of settlement are still evident today. The villages of Dover and Foxcroft, two separate towns prior to 1922, developed as a result of their location along the Piscataquis River and the construction of early roads and the railroad. While the railroad is gone, the T own continues to have several state highways converging within the village. Just as in the past, the Town's open lands are being used for forestry and agriculture, and there are camps on the shores of Sebec Lake and Branns Mill Pond . Dover -Foxcroft currently serves as the Piscataquis County seat and the largest service center in the region. Dover's designation as the shire town of the newly -formed Piscataqui s County occurred in 1838. The Town's many well -preserved historic homes and buildings are e vidence of the Town's past. Protective Measures for Historic and Archaeological Resources The Dover -Foxcroft Historical Society is very active in preserving the T own's history and culture. As examples, current activities include: o Operation of the Blacksmith Shop Museum and the Observer Building Museum; both buildings are on the National Register of Historic Buildings. o Work with the Congregational Church and Foxcroft Academy to preserve, catalog, index, and display their records. T he Society hopes to do the same with other churches and organizations. o Coordination with the Thompson Free Library to microfilm and to put up on the Internet all of the past issues of the Piscataquis Observer (1838 to present). o Collaboration with the Town and area agencies in the restoration and reuse of Central Hall. The Town and it partners achieved listing of the American Woolen Company M ill on the National Register of Historic Places ,7 and use of Historic Preservation Tax credits in the redevelopment o f the mill. The Town's land use regulations provide some protection for historic and archaeological resources: o Land Use Ordinance Historic District - Historical Review Committee advises on land use activities involving structural development of properties listed on the Nation al Register of Historic Places (See Map 4 Historic District Inset in the Volume I Appendices). o Shoreland zoning, floodplain and subdivision regulations provide consideration for important historic and archaeological resources, particula rly if the site or structure is eligible to be listed, or listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These is no regulatory consideration for historic and archaeological resources that do not fall under one of the regulations cited above, such as outside the shoreland zone, floodp lain, or historic district, and development not covered through the subdivision regulations. The Town's ordinances do not require a survey for historic or archaeological resources. However, the Town has identified many historic structures. The Maine Historic Preservation Commission recommends that an inventory be conducted to identify significant historic and archaeological resources so these resources can be preserved . MHPC also 7 The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the Nation's Historic places worthy of protection. The National Park Service administers the program which is designed to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate and protec t America's historic and archaeological resources. Some of the benefits to owners of \"certified\" historic structures include access to grants and technical advice for preservation activities, and access to federal historic preservation investment tax credi ts for income -producing properties. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 17 recommends t here be a mechanism for revie w of all construction or other ground disturbing activity in known archaeological sites and other identified archaeologically sensitive areas so that development can be designed to minimize impacts to important resources. MHPC has mapped of areas sensitive for prehistoric archaeology (See Map 3 Historic and Archaeological Resources in the Volume I Appendices ). Significant Historic Resources and Ways to Preserve Them The Historic Society's Blacksmith Shop Museum and the Observer Building Museum are both wel l- maintained and on the National Register of Historic Places. The Historical Society and its partners are working to restore and reuse Center Hall. The Historical Society has an extensive list of historic structures . Property owners are encouraged to have eligible structures and sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, which can provide access to technical assistance, g rants, and federal tax credits. The Historical Society encourage s appreciation and support for preservation of important s tructures. Maps: Map 3 Historical and Archeological Resources and Map 4 Historic District Inset (See Volume I Appendices) Section 1.5 Water Resources Clean, plentiful water is essential. Water resources provide potable water for human consumption, water fo r plants and animals including aquatic habitats, waterbodies for recreation, scenic beauty, and water for renewable energy production. Dover -Foxcroft has a wealth of excellent quality surface and ground water resources as displayed on Map 11 Water Resources in the Appendices of Volume I . Drinking Water and Groundwater Resources Dover -Foxcroft's public drinking water supply is provided by the Dover -Foxcroft Water District. The water source is Salmon Pond in Guilford. Rural area residents rely on ground water wells. Dover -Foxcroft has five non -community public water supplies, including the wells at the Charlotte White Center, Peaks Kenny State Park, Dover -Foxcroft's beach, and the Dover -Foxcroft Golf Course. Dover -Foxcroft has a band of signifi cant aquifers, potentially capable of producing large quantities of water, located along Black Stream and Branns Mill Pond. High yield aquifers can be valuable for community or industrial water supplies, including water extraction for bottled water compani es. These areas are also a source of sand and gravel resources, which can threaten ground water quality if not conducted in an environmentally sound manner. Surface Water Resources Dover -Foxcroft has an abundance of surface water resources with very good w ater quality. The Piscataquis River is a very significance and visible natural resources, particularly as it flows through the center of the urban area and along two major gateways to the community. In addition to its scenic attributes, the river is used f or hydroelectric power and recreation, and provides important plant and wildlife habitat. The water quality of the river has improved dramatically over the past decades due to ongoing efforts by the State and communities along its length. Sebec Lake is als o a significance water resource that is shared with several other communities. It is important for recreation, and as fisheries and wildlife habitat. Two volunteers monitor the lake's water quality, and the lake has above average water quality. Other water bodies include Branns Mill Pond, Garland Pond, Snow's Pond, several other small ponds, and many wetlands. Water quality monitoring indicates that Garland Pond has average water quality. Water quality monitoring of other ponds do es not appear to be occurri ng, but should be encouraged. There are many streams and brooks, including: Alder Stream, Black Stream, Bog Brook, Cotton Brook, Daggett Brook, Dunham Brook, Hanson Brook, and many others. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 18 Threats to Water Resources Potential point sources (direct discha rges) of water pollution include wastewater outfalls, landfills, transfer stations, salt piles, service stations, fuel storage facilities, junkyards, malfunctioning septic systems, chemical pipelines, and other similar uses. There are two wastewater outfal ls to the Piscataquis River: the Water District discharge and the Town's wastewater treatment plant discharge; both are licensed and in compliance. Storm water separation was completed within the past decade, which means combined overflows of untreated wat er no longer occur . The Town's closed landf ill, transfer station, and sand/ salt facilities are secure and currently meet Maine DEP standards. The Town has a covered salt storage facility, and sand is stored separately outdoors. The facility is located in an area served by public water so it is unlikely to affect drinking water. Water quality monitoring is done at the closed landfill and at the construction/demolition debris landfill. The Town is not aware of any other potential point -sources of water pollut ion at this time. Every community has non -point sources of pollution. The issue is whether these sources are causing significant levels of pollution and whether steps are being taken to mitigate the pollution. Non -point sources of pollution are usually the result of storm water runoff that flows over the ground until it reaches a water body. Storm water runoff can carry pollutants, such as soil, fertilizers, pesticides, manure, and petroleum products that may originate from places like farms, drive ways, roads, golf courses, forestry operations, and lawns located within a watershed. This type of pollution can be particularly harmful to lakes and ponds. Dover -Foxcroft's lakes and ponds have good water quality; however ongoing development is a potentia l threat. Water extraction can lead to the depletion of water supplies that can have impacts on adjacent properties and other users of the water source. Protection for Water Resources Both regulatory and non -regulatory tools are used to protect important water resources. The Town's public water supply, Salmon Pond in Guildford, is well -protected because the Water Distinct owns most of the land around the pond and manages uses on the pond to protect the water quality. Federal, state and local regulations p rovide considerable protection for water resources , however, given the importance of these resources and the fact that once they are contaminated it can be extremely expensive, if not impossible, to restore them, the Town should do the following: o Be vigila nt about enforcement of existing regulations, including notifying state authorities about potential violations . o Review the Town's existing regulations, and consider amendments to improve protection where needed (a few recommendations are provide below) . o Maintain adequate and compliant shoreland zoning and floodplain regulations. o Amend land use ordinances to provide protection for non -community water supplies (e.g., Charlotte White Cen ter, Dover -Foxcroft Golf Course ) to include notif ication when development is proposed in the vicinity o f wellheads and to establish wellhead protection zones. o Amend land use regulations to be consistent with current state and federal laws. For example, the Maine DEP recommends that towns utilize storm water runoff performance sta ndards8 consistent with the state storm water law. Two other areas for improving regulatory protection for water resources include: o More protection for lakes and ponds through specific guidance to developers on h ow to reduce phosphorus runoff . 8 Stormwater Management Law and Stormwater Rules (Title 38 MRSA Section 420 -D and 06 -096 CMR 500 and 502) and referenc e the current stormwater manual. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 19 o More protecti on for significant aquifers through requirements to prohibit potentially contaminating uses in recharge areas. Lastly, with respect to regulations, every permit for development should require consideration for impacts to important water resources, such as protection for wellheads, appropriate septage disposal, storage and use of potentially polluting material s, storm water runoff and contamination of water bodies, etc. Public Works Use of Best Management Practices to Protect Water Resources The Public Works Department (PWD) uses best management practices to protect water resources in their daily operations, including on Town -owned property and Town projects (e.g., salt/sand pile maintenance, culvert replacement, street sweeping, and public works garage operations). PWD personnel should receive periodic training, and perhaps certification, to stay up -to-date on best management practices and regulations designed to protect water quality.9 The Town can continue to promote state training and certific ation for private contractors by publicizing the state programs. Opportunities to Partner with Local or Regional Advocacy Groups There are many non -regulatory approaches to protecting water resources that can involve coordination with government agencies, non-profit groups, and volunteers. The Town is a partner in the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council's Brownfield's Program, and recently completed a Brownfield's cleanup at the former \"Maine Leathers Tannery\" site on Vaughn Road.10 The Council i s also seeking to conduct a county -wide environmental assessment to identify other sites that may require remediation. The Sebec Lake Association and two water quality monitors advocate for protection of Sebec Lake. The organization also monitors for inva sive plants. Lake associations and volunteer water quality monit ors should be encouraged for all the Town's ponds. Statewide lake protection organizations include the Maine Lakes Society, the Maine Environmental Lakes Association, and the Maine Volunteer 's Lake Monitoring Program. The U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service and Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District have a number of programs available to protect water quality, including educational materials, technical assistance , and in some cases funding for water quality protection and restoration projects. There Maine Department of Environmental Protection offers programs for water quality protection including educations materials, technical assistance, and grants for specific projects, including replacement of failing wastewater disposal systems for income eligible individuals. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife has an interest in water quality for fisheries and wildlife habitat. See Map 5 Water Resources (Volume I Appendices) Section 1.6 Critical and Important Natural Resources Natural resources contribute greatly to the economy and quality of life in Dover -Foxcroft and the Maine Highlands Region . The Maine Highlands are renowned for their vast undeveloped forestlands; numerous lakes, ponds, rivers, streams; mountains; outstanding wildlife and fisheries; and scenic beauty. The area is known for forest products, for natur e-based tourism and recreational opportunities such as wildlife watching, fishing, huntin g, boating, snowmobiling, ATVing, canoeing, hiking, cross -country skiing, as well as other activities. 9 Training is available through state agencies, such as the Maine Department of Environmental Protection . 10 A program through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designed to deliver land and buildings that have real or perceived hazardous materials bac k to the marketplace. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 20 Critical natural resources are those most vulnerable to the impacts of development, including sensitive shoreland zones and floodplains; large habitat b locks; multi -function wetlands; essential wildlife habitat s for threatened and endangered species, and other species of special concern; high value waterfowl and wading bird habitat s; high value deer wintering areas; significant vernal pool habitat s; and s ignificant fisheries habitat s.11 Critical rural areas are areas deserving maximum protection from development to preserve natural resources and related economic activities that may include, but are not limited to, significant farmland and forestland; high value wildlife or fisheries habitat; scenic areas; public water supplies; scarce or especially vulnerable natural resources; and open lands functionally necessary to support a vibrant rural community.12 Maine's Comprehensive Planning Rules13 define critical natural resources as those natural resources which under federal and state law warrant protection from the negative impacts of development, including the following: Resource protection areas established by Maine's Shoreland Zoning Act. Wetlands o f special significance identified in the Maine DEP's wetlands and water bodies protection rules. Significant wildlife habitat as defined in Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA). Threatened, endangered and special concern animal species identifie d by Maine Endangered Species Act. Significant freshwater fisheries spawning habitat identified by Maine's Departments of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and Marine Resources. Threatened or endangered plant habitats identified by the Maine Natural Areas Pro gram. Imperiled or rare natural communities identified by the Maine Natural Areas Program (MNAP). Important natural resources as defined by the Growth Management Act are those areas in the community important for strategic conservation planning purposes, and not classified as critical natural resources, comprised of one or more of the following: 1) large habitat blocks and habitat connections as identified by the Beginning with Habitat Program (BwH);14 2) Focus Areas of Statewide Ecological Significance as identified in Maine's Wildlife Action Plan, prepared by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MIFW); and 3) Exemplary Natural Communities as defined by the MNAP. The Extent and Nature of Important Natural Resources A number of critical an d important natural resources have been identified in Dover -Foxcroft by state agencies and their partners. Most of these are displayed on Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas in the Volume I Appendices , and include: Significant wildlife habitats: whi ch if mapped and rated, are protected through the NRPA. o Numerous waterfowl and wading bird habitats, moderate and high value, protected through NRPA. o One significant vernal pool, mapped, rated, protected through NRPA. o Numerous candidate deer wintering area s, none rated, not protected through NRPA. Essential wildlife habitats (rare animals): protected or managed under the Maine Endangered Species Act: o Tidewater Mucket (threatened) o Bald Eagle (special concern) o Canada Lynx (special concern) 11 Maine's Growth Management Act 12 Maine's Growth Management Act; some of these are discussed in other sections of this Plan. 13 Maine's Growth Management Act 14 The Beginning with Habitat Program includes Maine Inland Fisheries and Wil dlife, Maine Natural Areas Program, Maine Audubon, Maine Land Use Team, U. S. Fish and Wildlife, Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit, Southern Maine Regional Planning, Nature Conservancy and Wells National Estuarine Research Preserve. Maps at http://w ww.beginningwithhabitat.org Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 21 o Wood Turtle (spec ial concern) Rare, threaten and endangered plants with very limited protection: 3 threatened species and 4 species of special concern . Rare and exemplary natural communities and ecosystems: o Raised level bog - Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area (State). o Northern white cedar swamp - Foxcroft/ Sangerville Bog - many rare plants, candidate deer wintering area - limited protection through NRPA (for wetlands), and Forest Practices Act. o Enriched northern hardwoods forest (maple -basswood -ash) - Center Range Road - very limited protection through Maine Forest Practices Act. Significant fisheries: o Piscataquis River - Atlantic salmon spawning and rearing habitats, American eel habitat. o Sebec Lake - outstanding landlocked salmon fishery, wild brook trout habitat, exc ellent coldwater fishery. (Sebec Lake is one of the original landlocked salmon fisheries in Maine) . o Sebec Lake tributaries, Piscataquis River, Black Stream, Daggett Brook, few other streams - wild brook trout habitat. o Important sport fisheries in other wat er bodies, such as Branns Mill Pond with small and large mouth bass, chain pickerel , white perch and stocked brook trout. Alder Stream Focus Area: Area of Statewide Ecological Significance: o Large area in Atkinson with some portions in Dover -Foxcroft and G arland. o Includes wetlands, waterfowl and wading bird habitats, deer wintering areas, Atlantic Salmon habitat, wild brook trout habitat, and a Raised Level Bog Ecosystem. o Includes the Bud Leavi tt (Bull Hill) Maine Wildlife Management Area, managed by the MD IFW (908 acres in Dover -Foxcroft). o Includes a portion of the Greater Alder Stream/Piscataquis River Project located in the southeastern corner of Dover -Foxcroft (about 137 acres in Dover -Foxcroft owned by the Northeast Wilderness Trust). The entire project straddles both Piscataquis and Penobscot counties and consists of a roughly 20,000 -acre complex of protected lands. o Large habitat blocks and habitat connections - extensive with some barriers (development, roads, bridges, culverts) to wildlife, including fish. o Important shorelands, multifunction wetlands and floodplains. Conservation land in Dover -Foxcroft includes: o Bud Leavi tt Wildlife Management Area (State) - 908 acres. o Northeast Wilderness Trust - 137 acres. o Peaks -Kenny State Park - 562 acres. o Several landowners with land in the \"open space\" property -tax designation - 40 acres. Protection for Critical and Important Natural Resources The very rural nature of the Dover -Foxcroft region provides extensive and rich natural habitat for a variety of plants an d animals. While development threatens natural habitats through direct loss of habitat and through fragmenta tion of existing large areas of habitat, it presents less of a threat in the Dover -Foxcroft region than in more developed areas of Maine. Fragment ation of habitats by roads (particularly high -speed travel corridors), buildings and other development isolates some plants and animals limiting their ability to travel, feed and reproduce. Fragmenta tion also creates an edge effect where disturbed areas b etween developed and natural areas are more eas ily colonized by non -native species. As development and fragmentation continues, more rare species can become increasingly threatened. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 22 Dover -Foxcroft's efforts to encourage and support development in its urba n areas through land use regulations and provisions for infrastructure help direct development away from important wildlife habitats and natural areas. Shoreland zoning and protection of shoreland areas is critical to conserving water quality, and both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Conservation of critical and important natural resources serves multiple purposes. For example, maintaining large tracts of forestland for forestry can benefit many species of wildlife, help maintain water quality, and provi de areas for recreation. Protection for important natural resources can be both regulatory and non -regulatory. A balance of federal, state and local regulations combined with education and conservation measures can provide considerable protection. The primary state and federal laws designed to protect critical and important natural resources include the Federal and State Endangered Species Acts, the Maine Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA), and the Forests Practices Act. Maine's Natural Resour ce Protection Act (NRPA) regulates activities in, on, over or adjacent to natural resources, such as lakes, wetlands, streams, rivers, fragile mountain areas, high and moderate value waterfowl and wading bird habitats, high and moderate value deer winterin g areas, and significant vernal pools. Enforce ment of state laws by state agencies can be sporadic due to staffing levels relative to the vast areas to be monitored, which ca n mean that compliance with regula tions is primarily left to individual landown ers. In many communities there is greater monitoring and enforcement of state and federal regulations through the local code enforcement officer. Dover -Foxcroft's land use regulations provide some protection for critical and important natural resources, i ncluding: o Shoreland zoning, consistent with state law, and consistent with neighboring municipalities. o Subdivision regulations, consistent with state law, and with conservation subdivision provisions. o Town -wide zoning and urban infrastructure to encourage many types of development in built -up areas as opposed to rural areas, thereby reducing impacts to important natural areas. o Dover -Foxcroft's land use ordinance site plan review, review criteria and performance standards address a number of natural resourc e concerns. Local regulations could be improved by incorporating the information in this Comprehensive Plan into future land use planning and permitting, and using it to educate landowners. Local regulations could require that projects potentially impactin g identified habitats be reviewed by scientists at the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or Maine Marine Resources agencies. Other issues that might be considered include addressing wildlife and fisheries concerns associated with cell towe rs, wind turbines, and high -speed highways and major utility corridors. The Public Works Department's use of best management practices to protect water quality benefits aquatic habitats and fisheries. Bridges and culverts can be designed to allow fish pas sage. Partners in Conserving Natural Resources Regional and inter -agency collaboration is important to conserving critical and important natural resources because habitats often extend across town boundaries. Many natural resources, such as unfragmented h abitat blocks, moderate to high value water fowl and wading bird habitat, deer wintering areas, the Alder Stream Focus Area, the Fox croft/Sangerville Bog, Atlantic Salmon an d brook trout fisheries are all shared natural resources. The State of Maine and s everal organizations are actively protecting and conserving important natural resources in Dover -Foxcroft and the region. Examples include: Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 23 o State facilities - Peaks Kenny State Park and the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area. o The Northeast Wilderness Tru st's Greater Alder Stream/Piscataquis River Project which includes land in Dover -Foxcroft, Atkinson and Garland. o The Sebec Lake Association efforts to protect Sebec Lake resources, including the tidewater muckett, the bald eagle, brook trout, landlocked s almon, loons, etc. o The Piscataquis County Resource Conservation Service's educational programs and materials. Other shared natural resources where coordinated efforts might benefit include: o Sangerville/Foxcroft White Cedar Bog o Alder Stream Focus Area o Black Stream brook trout habitat In general, planning boards and code enforcement officers from neighboring towns should monitor and reference adjacent shoreland zoning issues in neighboring municipalities when addressing shoreland zoning in their own towns. See Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas (Volume I Appendices) Section 1.7 Community Services and Facilities Community facilities and services are provided to protect the public health and safety, and to insure the general welfare and well -being of residents and visitors. The availability and adequacy of these facilities and services reflect the community's desirability as a place to live, work, recreate, and locate a business. The condition and capacity of these services and facilities is examined to determine what improvements might be needed to serve and/or stimulate population growth and economic development within the next ten years and beyond. Overall Adequacy of Municipal Services to Meet Changes in Population and Demographics15 Population grow th and economic development is needed to provide the property -tax base and economic vitality necessary to support adequate community facilities and services. The population is projected to remain stable, but increasingly older overall. As the primary servi ce center and county -seat, Dover -Foxcroft plays an important role within Piscataquis County. Equitable and m utually beneficial sharing of services and facilities among the communities, county and state is important to consider in looking ahead. All of the community's facilities and services will continue to require ongoing maintenance and upgrades to meet future needs. Some of the most significant needs include: o Adequate high -speed inter net to residents and businesses. o Affordable and renewable energy optio ns. o An affordable solution to address solid waste disposal as of the March 31, 2018 contract termination with the Penobscot Energy Recovery Company. Partnerships t o Share Services to Reduce Costs and Improve Services As the region's primary service center and county seat Dover -Foxcroft is host to a number of state and county agencies, and other organizations that provide regional services. Dover -Foxcroft is a partner in sharing services for the following: o Overall emergency planning and disaster response i s a collabora tive effort between the Piscataquis County Emergency Management Agency, the Dover -Foxcroft Polic e, Fire and Highway Departments, Mayo Regional Hospital and Ambulance, the Piscataquis County Sheri ff's Office, the Maine Department of Inland Fish eries and Wildlife, the Maine Bureau of Forestry, and the Maine State Police. 15 Also see Section 1.8 Parks, Recreation and Open Space, and Section 1.9 Transportation. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 24 o Dispatch for emergency calls is primarily provided through the Piscataquis County Emergency Communications Center located in Dover -Foxcroft. o The Dover -Foxcroft Fire Department h as mutual aid agreements with communities in Piscataquis County and neighboring Penobscot County communities. o The Dover -Foxcroft Police Department receives assistance from the Piscataquis County Sherriff's Department and State Police, and has mutual aid ag reements with Brownville, Milo and Greenville. o The Maine Regional School Unit School #68, a pre-k system, includes the towns of Dover -Foxcroft, Charleston, Monson and Sebec. The district contracts with Foxcroft Academy, a private high school in Dover -Foxcr oft to provide an education for its secondary students in grades 9 -12. The district also operates an adult education program. o The Dover -Foxcroft's Regional Solid Waste and Recycling Facility is utilized by the communities of Atkinson, Barnard, Bowerbank, Sebec, Sangerville and Dover -Foxcroft. o The Dover -Foxcroft Library allows non -resident use at $20 per year. o Dover -Foxcroft utilizes the services of the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council to promote economic development in the T own and the regio n. Dover -Foxcroft Water District The Water District has substantial excess capacity to meet future needs, with its current capacity at about 670,000 gallons per day. Excess capacity is about 61% of total capacity. The District has made considerable progres s in upgrading the water supply system, but there is more work to be done. The District is developing a 15 -year plan for future upgrades to improve service and efficiencies. Funding comes from state and federal loans/grants, and user fees. The District do es not anticipate any line extensions or an expansion of the service area. The District also does not have a policy to require hook -up if a water line runs past or nearby a particular location. Areas designated for future growth and development should cons ider those areas most easily served by the public water supply system. The capacity of the system to serve additional development could be used as an incentive for development. The Town should support the District in planning for future development, and in upgrading and expansion of the system, as needed. In some cases the Town has access to funds that the District does not have access to, such as Community Development Block Grants. Wastewater Department The wastewater treatment system has considerable excess capacity to serve additional wastewater, including from new users, and is generally in good condition. The T own adopted a sewer ordinance in 2010 that requires the owner of any habitable building situated within the service area and within 200 feet of an existing sewer main to connect to the system . The Department's major capital needs for the next decade include : upgrade of lagoon s #2 & #3 aeration system s for electricity conservation ; upgrade/replacement of the storage building heating system, and driveway and parking area paving. Areas designated for future growth and development should consider those areas most easily served by the sewer system. The capacity of the system to serve additional development should be used as an incentive for developm ent. Disposal of Septic Tank Waste Individuals pay private haulers to dispose of septic tank waste at licensed facilities outside of Town. The wastewater treatment facility is not licensed to receive septic tank waste, but there is some discussion about th e department becoming licensed to do so in the future. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 25 Stormw ater Management Facilities Stormwater systems consist primarily of roadside ditches, and catch basins and drainage pipes along state roads and most Town roads in the urban area. MaineDOT is res ponsible for the system along state roads and highways. The Public Works Department is responsible for drainage systems along Town roads, and works with the Wastewater Department in managing the stormwater system in the urban area. Most of the Town 's urba n area storm water system is comprised of old abandoned sewer s dating back to the 1920s. System failures (flooding) are most risky during periods of heavy rain fall and snow. The Town should study this situation to determine what is needed. The Town 's land use regulations should be consistent with state stormwater regulations to address cumulative impacts from future development . Education Dover -Foxcroft's schools offer an excellent education to the community's students. RSU #68's SeDoMoCha Elementary and Middle School facilities are in good condition and no major capital improvements are anticipated within the next ten years. Student enrollment is stable with a slight increase in enrollment expected in the future. RSU anticipates having adequate capaci ty to serve the expected enrollments. Foxcroft Academy, a private school, contracts with RSU #68 to provide education for grades 9 -12. The facilities are in excellent shape. The school's ten-year facility plan is to add instructional space , as needed , and to include a gym addition, auditorium, student union, and instructional classrooms. Foxcroft Academy will be able to support the educational needs of the community as it anticipates that enrollment rates will decline and be steady at around 300 students pe r year (400 students total with 100 boarding students each year). Boarding students are often from other countries which add to the cultural experience for local students. More community interaction with international students would be beneficial . Both sch ools are located within the urban area near residential neighborhoods. Sidewalks extend to the schools allowing staff and students to walk to and from the school s. Both schools are also located within the Land Use Ordinance's Village District, which is des igned to support residential and other compatible uses at relatively high densities. As in many rural northern Maine communities, the climate combined with safety issues, makes walking or bicycling to and from school challenging. MaineDOT grants are availa ble to improve pedestrian facilities connecting residential areas to schools. Emer gency Response Systems Emergency services, while generally adequate at this time (with a few exceptions), can be significantly impacted by future development and other change s, such as more extreme weather events and economic downturns. Meeting government mandates, insurance requirements and staying abreast of technological improvements can be costly and challenging. Federal grants are available to assist in covering the costs of some equipment and programs. The Piscataquis County Emergency Management Agency coordinates emergency planning and response. The Agency is developing an updated Emergency Operations Plan for the County. The Town is developing a flood emergency action plan for 3 dams that are on tributaries to the Piscataquis River . The Town participates in the F ederal Flood Insurance Program. Emergency communications (radio) could be improved within rural areas of the County and Dover - Foxcroft to eliminate \"dead spots\" , such as at Sebec Lake. Emergency shelters and warming centers are available in Dover -Foxcroft, including the Town's Fire Station, the Town Office Complex, and the Town's Police Station. Both the Police and Fire Stations have generators. Foxcroft Academy has been identified as another location with the capacity to handle emergency shelter. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 26 The Police Department has adequate staffing for the foreseeable future. The Police station (1821 building with an addition) needs a number of capital improvements to im prove operations and energy efficiency. The Department replaces its two primary cruisers every three years and seeks grants for the other two cruisers. Other major capital expenditures include ongoing equipment upgrades and purchases. The Fire Department , a volunteer department, may have to seriously consider increased staffing to handl e administrative functions and provide necessary coverage when volunteers are usually at their day jobs. Area towns are becoming more and more reliant on the Department due t o the decline in the size of their populations, and fewer volunteers. The Fire station was constructed in 1927, with an addition added in 1955. A number of capital improvements are scheduled for the facility. Other major capital expenditures include ongoin g equipment upgrades and purchases. Solid Waste and Recycling System The regional transfer station and recycling facility should be adequate for the foreseeable future . The Town will need to address solid waste disposal in anticipation of the March 31, 2018 contract termination with the Penobscot E nergy Recovery Company. The recycling rate has remained stable at about 40% of the waste stream. The sale of recyclables incre ases revenues and decreases the cost of disposing of non -recyclables. More publicity and incentives can be used to encourage recycling. A \"pay -as-you-through\" system is an option, but would require public support. Any increase in commercial haulers fees pr ovides a monetary incentive, since recycling is free. Telecommunications and Energy Infrastructure Adequate and affordable high -speed internet throughout the Town is a very high priority . Existing service is very inadequate and a significant constraint to future prosperity . Reliable cell phone service at acceptable speeds is not available in all areas of the Town. Central Maine Power provides electrical service to the Town. There is a CMP substation located in Dover - Foxcroft. Three phase power is available within the urban area, and along major highways and some roads extending into the rural areas. Adequate capacity for major industrial operations, depending on their location, is an issue. Emera Maine (Bangor Hydro ) provides service to a few areas in nort heastern parts of Dover -Foxcroft. More affordable energy and more renewable energy options are needed. The Town's Riverfront Redevelopment Project is to include hydro, solar and geothermal power. Health Care Facilities and Public Hea lth and Social Servic e Programs Many health and social services are available in Dover -Foxcroft, such as through the Mayo Hospital and other social service and private facilities. Where services aren't available locally, residents may travel to Bangor, or even further for spe cialized services. Specific services that are not available locally include: o Maine Department of Health and Human Services office in Piscataquis County . o Drug treatment facilities (methadone clinic) in Piscataquis County . o Dialysis treatment facility, Brewer is the closest . o Some cancer treatments, Bangor area is the closest . The needs of the region's aging population are served by the Mayo Hospital and Nursing home, and other senior housing facilities. The Town is actively pursuing more senior housing options . The Maine Highlands Senior Center is a new non -profit organization whose goal is to repurpose Central Hall to house \"The Maine Highlands Senior Commons ,\" an event and activity center, and \"The Highlands at Central Hall ,\" a medical model adult day center for dependent seniors. Other Town Facilities and Services Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 27 The Town's Administrative Capacity should be adequate for the foreseeable future. The Town Office Complex houses administrative offices and leased space. The facility is in fairly good condition and is large enough to serve the community's needs well into the future. The Town would like to lease additional space. The sharing of administrative functions between the Town and other entities could be explored. Overall, Public Works facilities, planned e quipment replacements, and staffing should be adequate for the foreseeable future. Thompson Free Library would like to make a number of improvements to the Library and hire a literacy specialist. Trust funds and fundraising will be used extensively. Town Cemeteries will be more than adequate for the next decade and beyond. Increasingly people are choosing cremation, which takes less space than burials, and in some cases ashes are not buried. Nearly all of Dover -Foxcroft's public facilities are located wit hin the existing urban area, and nearly all future investments are anticipated to be located within the urban areas. Tree Planting and Maintenance Program Dover -Foxcroft has an ongoing tree planting and maintenance program for the downtown and in -town areas, and plans to expand the program into rural areas. Tree planting and landscaping enhance the downtown and riverfront areas to create more vibrant, pedestrian friendly public spaces . Many of the improvements will be made using grants, donations, and volu nteer efforts. Dover -Foxcroft officially became a Tree City USA Community on Arbor Day 2013. See Maps 8 and 9 Community and Recreation Facilities and Map 11 Water and Sewer Systems (Volume I Appendices) Section 1.8 Parks, Recreation and Open Space Parks, recreation and open space are important to the quality of life in Dover -Foxcroft . These amenities provide places where people can pursue healthy lifestyles socializing , recreating, and exercising . Public access to parks, trails, o pen space and water bodies allows for many recreational activities, such as boating, fishing, swimming, ice skating, walking, camping, picnicking, hiking, snowshoeing, cross -country skiing, snowmobiling , ATV riding , hunting, trapping, and wildlife and bird watching. Parks a nd open space also provide habitat for wildlife and contribute to the scenic beauty of the area. Dover -Foxcroft's recreational and cultural offerings also include indoor facilities, such as the YMCA, the library, museums and Cent ral Hall. P rivate recreational businesses , such as the golf course and the Sebec Lake marina, also contribute to the community's recreational offerings. Publicly accessible o pen space and water bodies and recreational and cultural resources are economic assets for ecotouris m, second -home development , and overall population and economic growth in the region . Dover - Foxcroft sits at one of the primary gateways to the Highlands Region. As the largest community in the region, the Town has much to offer those recreating, vacationi ng and living in the region, including its historic downtown, museums, theater, the Piscataquis River, Sebec Lake, Peaks Kenny State Park, the YMCA and the Piscataquis County Fairgrounds. Recreational Facilities and Programs Dover -Foxcroft's parks and recr eation program is a collaborative effort between the Town's Recreation Committee, Foxcroft Youth Sports and the Piscataquis Regional YMCA. The Town -appointed Recreation Committee is responsible for providing direction for recreation programs and facilitie s. The goal is to provide programs and facilities for people of all ages. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 28 There appear to be gaps in recreation programs for very young children, and for children and teens looking for alternatives to the sport s programs offered. A number of families tran sport youth to gymnastic, dance and other programs available in Bangor. Given funding constraints and other higher priorities, such as roads, it is unlikely that additional resources from the general budget will be forthcoming. The Town will need to priori tize facility improvements and recreation programming, continue to rely heavily on volunteers, and seek other funding sources. Since population projections do not suggest much growth over the next ten years, the current level of recreation programs and fac ilities should generally be adequate. However, the following should be noted: o Demographic trends indicate an overall older population in the future . o If the Town wants to attract more residents, of particular age groups (retirees, young families), then prog rams and facilities should be designed to meet their needs. o Overall, more residents in Town and users of programs and facilities may make them more cost - effective to provide. Specific Recreational Needs Ongoing maintenance is necessary at all of the Town' s recreation facilities, but the Town has limited funding dedicated to recreation. The following potential needs have been identified: o Riverfront Walk along Piscataquis River - portable toilets and e xercise stations . o Browns Mill Park - benches, picnic tab les, gazebo, and amphitheater. o Cove Boat Landing - address build -up of sediment and vegetation alongside boat launch. o More/better access is needed to Sebec Lake; existing facilities can become crowded during the summer. Open Space Available for Public Recr eation There is a wealth of publicly -owned or publicly accessible open space available for recreation. Town -owned open space within urban areas is particularly valuable because many people can walk to these areas, such as the Riverfront Walk Park, Browns M ill Park, and Kiwanis Park. The public also has access to open areas at the Piscataquis County Fairgrounds. State -owned open space includes Peaks Kenny State Park and the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area. Most of the land in Dover -Foxcroft is privately owned, including large tracts of working forests . Most landowners allow public access for a variety of uses. However , as land becomes developed public access is often restricted and issues such as the relocation of snowmobile trail s or postin g of land traditionally used for hunting may present challenges. Public Access to Significant Water Bodies Overall, public access to important water bodies appears to be adequate . Sebec Lake has one T own -owned access (beach, marina) and two state accesses (boat launch and at Peaks Kenny State Park). Town -owned moorings are leased to Merrill's. Improved access is needed during busy seasons. Piscataquis River : three boat and/or canoe accesses - Cove Boat Landing, Vaughn Road (East Dov er) Launch, and Brown s Mill Park . The Riverfront Walk Park is along the River. Branns Mill Pond State Boat Launch (more parking needed) . Garland Pond has Town -owned canoe/small boat access. Carry-in access to Snow's Pond and Dunham Pond. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 29 Recreational Trails There are a number of non -motorized trails including: o The in -town/downtown walking routes utilizing sidewalks and shoulders . o Waterfront Walk (Riverfront Redevelopment Project ) (may add exercise stations) . o Browns Mill Park walking, skiing and snowshoeing trails . o Kiwanis Park walking trails . o Peaks Kenney State Park Trails for walking, skiing and snowshoeing . o SeDoMoCha to/from Town Office Complex nature trail . Trails for both motorized and non -motorized uses include: o Four Season's Multi -use trail - (better parking needed on Dove r-Foxcroft end) o Snowmobile trails including two ITS routes and local club trails . o ATV trails, including Four Season trail and local trails . o Penquis Valley Bicycle Tour - 56-mile highway/road loop . Maintenance of trails can be costly, and in many cases is d one by volunteers and with limited funding. Grants can sometimes be used for this work. Conflicting uses on trails is sometimes a problem, such as when non-motorized users don't want to share trails with motorized users. Land Conservation Mechanisms and P artnerships The Town does not have an open space fund or a formal partnership with a land trust. The only known land trust active in Dover -Foxcroft is the Northeast Wilderness Trust with its Alder Stream/ Piscataquis River Project , a 20,000 -acre complex o f conservation lands, situated in both Piscataquis and Penobscot counties . The Trust owns 136 acres in Dover -Foxcroft. There are other land conservation organizations active in the region, such as the Forest Society of Maine and the Appalachian Mountain Club; both have large tracts of land in publically -accessible conservation. Given the amount of conserved land in the region, and publically accessible open space in Dover -Foxcroft, there does not appear to be a critical need to establish a Town open space fund, or develop a partnership with a land trust to conserve additional land at this time. Scenic Resources16 Piscataquis County's scenic resources are vital to the region's economy , particularly given its dependence on second -home residents, nature -based tourism and outdoor recreation. The region's beauty also serves to attra ct year -round residents. As the shire town Dover -Foxcroft plays an important role in maintaining the county's scenic assets . The Town has worked to enhance its scenic and aesthetic character, particularly in the downtown and in - town areas. Examples include the establishment of the Historic District, ongoing beautification efforts (tree planting and landscaping), and efforts to enhance community gateways. The Town's Downtown Revitalization Plan (2003) includes recommendations for improving scenic beauty and aesthetics. There are a number of tools the Town could utilize to enhance it scenic character. A first step is to identif y those scenic views most important to the community and then to use non-regulatory and regulatory approaches to protect and improve these views. See Maps 8 and 10 Community and Recreation Facilities (Volume I Appendices) 16 Scenic areas are considered \"critical rural areas\" under Maine's Growth Management Act. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 30 Section 1.9 Transportation The tra nsportation system provides access to and from areas outside as well as within the Town. It ties together the various the land uses, and must remain efficient and functional to ensure the continued well -being and economic vitality of the community. In addi tion to highways, streets and bridges, transportation planning includes consideration for public parking, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, public bus transportation, and air and rail transportation. Transportation planning and land use planning must work hand -in-hand to protect highway safety and mobility, and enhance economic opportunity, community livability, and environmental quality. Dover -Foxcroft's transportation policies, such as those that are incorporated into capital improvements programming an d land use ordinances help assure that future development does not increase traffic congestio n or overtax existing roadways . Such policies also seek to assure that transportation systems function cost - effectively at acceptable levels. Transportation System Concerns for the Future The State Highway system is a vital economic link to the greater Bangor metropolitan area and to the Interstate. Adequate maintenance of this system is a top priority. These highways are particularly important given the lack of rai l as an alternative for transporting goods to and from the region. A number of state and regional transportation planning studies have identified these corridors as being critical to the well-being of the region. The following should be considered within t he next ten years: o Major upgrades to the Dexter Road (Route 7) as an important regional artery connecting Dover - Foxcroft to the Interstate and points south. The Town should consider seeking designation of this route as a State Priority 2 highway, instead o f the current Priority 3 designation. o Adequate maintenance of the Bangor Road (Route 15) as an important regional artery connecting Dover -Foxcroft to the Interstate and the Bangor area. o Maintenance of other state roads within the region to provide other n ecessary connections. o Adequate maintenance and management of West Main Street and the Guilford Road including to address high crash locations. This is a congested area with many entrances and driveways. o Develop ment of regulations to assure the T own's inter ests regarding the local economy, natural resources, scenic resources and other critical concerns are addressed when/if a highway , utility and/or communications corridor or other major development is proposed. o A major upgrade to East Main Street and the Ba ngor Road from the traffic signal downtown to the Pine Crest Business Park, to include downtown improvements, such as moving overhead utilities to improve aesthetics, sidewalk and other pedestrian amenities, and other improvements identified in downtown economic development plans. o Reconfiguration of the downtown intersection of South Street and East Main Street to more safely accommodate truck traffic. This intersection has a low level of service acco rding to MaineDOT. o Address the cost and financing of adequately maintaining Town -owned transportation infrastructure, particularly paved roads. Consider the results and recommendations of the 2015/16 consultant study designed to evaluate specific transportation needs. Conflicts Caused by Multiple Road Uses (Major Thoroughfare through the Downtown ) State Route s 6, 7, 15, 16, and 153 converg e in the urban area, and f unnel traffic to major destinations in the Town and beyond. All types of traffic are handled by these routes including local and regional traffic associated with in -town services, commuter traffic, local service trucks, logging trucks and other large trucks traveling in and through the region. This traffic inflicts a tremendous amount of wear and tear on highwa ys and roads in Dover -Foxcroft. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 31 In gene ral, the community accepts its role as a major transportation hub for the region, but expects that as such, it deserves greater support from the State in maintaining the system. Minimizing conflicts in the downtown is particularly important to the viability of the downtown for commerce and social interaction. Traffic speeds as traffic enters Dover -Foxcroft and at dangerous locations is a concern. The Town would like to install gateway signage at key locations along the Guilford Road and the Milo Roa d to alert travelers of the upcoming developed areas. Gateway signage is already installed on the Bangor and Dexter Roads. Planning and Budgeting for Road Maintenance and Capital Improvements Dover -Foxcroft spends about $88,000 per year for road improvem ents. This equals the amount of money the Town receives from the state in Local Road Assistance and only covers improvements to address crisis situations on the worst roads. This amount of funding is far below what is needed, which means that each year the Town is falling further and further behind in maintaining its transportation infrastructure. Historically, the townspeople have voted against raising an additional amount for road improvements. A town -wide assessment of paved road needs was completed in 2 015. The assessment will be used to develop a multi -year capital plan to be considered by the public in the following years. Parking Public parking in downtown Dover -Foxcroft includes Town -owed parking lots, street -side parking and parking associated with County offices and other public agencies. There is not an adequate amount of public parking in the downtown, including parking conveniently located for businesses and activities. This is particularly evident when during special events, such as at Center T heater. Any increase in activity in the downtown including new businesses and more social interaction will further exacerbate the problem. Improved parking should include additional parking and management of parking through signage and integration with the street network to improve the public's use and access to these areas. More parking and improved signage would also improve traffic flow in the downtown. The 2003 Downtown Revitalization Plan made recommendations for improving parking, such as parking area s with paving, curbing, lighting, landscaping, signage, and well -defined pedestrian ways. Land Use Ordinance provisions governing parking should support and compliment the T own's desire for more economic development in the downtown and other urban areas. Pedestrian and Bicycle Amenities Dover -Foxcroft has an extensive network of sidewalks serving downtown shopping areas, public agencies, recreation and cultural destinations, the Mayo Hospital complex, Foxcroft Academy, SeDoMoCha School, and some residential neighborhoods. Adequate maintenance of sidewalks is a challenge. Given funding constraints, it is important to prioritize sidewalk improvements based on use (e.g., downtown, schools, senior housing, etc.), and to coordinate sidewalk improvements with stre et upgrades utilizing grant funds to the maximum extent. Snow removal and sanding of sidewalks are also a challenge. When sidewalks are absent, pedestrians and bicyclist utilize road shoulders. The shoulders along many streets and roads are narrow and unpa ved, making walking and bicycling challenging, particularly when there is a lot of traffic. Accommodations for pedestrians and bicycles should be considered in any upgrade of highways, roads and bridges. The Town's land use ordinances and economic developm ent plans for the downtown, in particular, should include consideration for pedestrian and bicycle amenities. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 32 Recreational Trails There are a number of non -motorized trails including: in-town/downtown walking routes, the Piscataquis River waterfront walk, the Branns Mill Park trails, the Kiwanis trails, Peaks Kenny State Park trails, and the trail between the Town Office complex and the SeDoMaCha School. Trails for both motorized and non -motorized uses include the Fo ur Season's Multi -use trail, and other snowmobile and ATV trails. Adequately maintaining trail systems is difficult given funding constraints, and is usually accomplished through volunteer efforts and some instances grant funding. The Penquis Valley Bicycl e Tour is a 56 -mile loop on highways and rural roads through portions of Piscataquis, Somerset, and Penobscot Counties, including Dexter, Dover -Foxcroft, Guilford, St. Albans, and Cam bridge. Adequate, paved shoulders are important to safe use of bicycles. Public Bus and Taxi Service There are no intercity bus services providing regular service to Dover -Foxcroft. The closest intercity bus terminals are in Bangor. Penquis, a social service and transportation agency based in Bangor, provides public transporta tion (LYNX buses ) and social service transportation in Penobscot and Piscataquis counties, including Dover -Foxcroft. This service is open to the public, but is most often utilized by seniors, individuals with disabilities or special needs, and those with l ow-incomes. The only taxi identified was Bragdon Taxi Service that provides s ervices in the Bangor and Dover -Foxcroft areas . This service includes Bangor International Airport pick -ups and drop -offs, as well as long -distance transportation within Maine to all points in the Northeast. Public transportation services will become increasingly important as the overall population ages and is less able to own and/or drive a vehicle. A recent study entitled \"Linking the Rural Regions of Four Counties in Maine to Enhance T ransportation Opportunities and Improve Quality of Life \" recommends increasing transportation options in rural areas through expansion of existing programs (Penquis) and establishing new programs to support ride -sharing, volunteer drivers, communit y ride boards, neighborhood cell -phone networks, and official/unofficial park and ride lots. These options would be implemented by a Transp ortation Management Association . Dover - Foxcroft should consider involvement with the new association, if beneficial, and/or could encourage local agencies, businesses to establish programs of their own.17 Access Management and Land Use Regulation MaineDOT Highway and Driveway Entrance Rules require a permit for all new driveways and entrances (or where there is a change of use) connecting to rural portions of state highways. Driveways and entrances connecting to State mobility corridors (Guildford Road, Dexter Road and Bangor Road) are required to meet more stringent access management standards to maintain highway capacity to efficiently carry traffic that serves an intrastate purpose. MaineDOT Rules and Regulations Pertaining to Traffic Movement Pe rmits address access ways expected to carry more than 100 passenger car equitant trips in the peak hour. The Town's land use and subdivision ordinances contain provisions to require that new development does not negatively impact public highways and roads. The Land Use Ordinance addresses traffic access, circulation and parking: All uses must be designed to promote traffic safety. Uses subject to Site P lan Review must meet the following requirements: o Entrance and exit driveways shall be located to afford maximum safety to traffic. 17 http://www. emdc.org Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 33 o Entrance/exit design shall facilitate maximum possible sight distances. o Parking and circulation, vehicle and pedestrian, sha ll be safe and convenient. o Public and private ways shall be constructed to Subdivision Standards. o Other requirements address adequate emergency vehicle access, lighting and stormwater facilities. Standards Applicable to Subdivisions include: o Subdivisions will not cause unreasonable highway or public roads congestion or unsafe conditions with respect to use of highways or public roads existing or proposed. o Detailed road design standards, including required sight distances for access to public ways. o No subdiv ision may have direct vehicular access to a state highway. o Subdivisions generating more than 200 trips per day must have two accesses to public ways . o Traffic impact analysis is required for subdivisions generating more than 500 trips per day. o The only limi tation on the length of dead -end streets is 1,000 feet for commercial or industrial streets. The following should be considered to improve ordinances: o Assure consistency with MaineDOT regulations, and require evidence of approved MaineDOT permits with appl ications for Town permits, as applicable. o Review and update as appropriate road and street standards to assure adequate sizing and design while not being overbuilt. o Standards to encourage more compact and efficient street systems in subdivisions. o Consider provisions for pedestrians and bicycles, particularly for urban areas. o Review list of uses to determine if transportation standards should be applicable to uses such as day care centers, churches, and service clubs (uses not currently subject to Site Plan Review) o Add standards to support more interconnected development designs to limit direct access to public roads, such as along West Main Street. o Add more specific standards for off -street parking and for loading and unloading areas, without discouraging de velopment in the urban area. o Update language to cover current practices, such as the frontage requirement along a driveway built to Town standards for new development on backlots. o Address transportation impacts from major projects, such as an east -west hig hway, to include consideration for the traffic impacts on Dover -Foxcroft. Air Transportation The Bangor International Airport, located about 36 minutes from Dover -Foxcroft , is the closest full -service airport. The Airport provides national and international commercial passenger and cargo service as well as civil defense operations. Car rental services are available at the airport . The Charles A. Chase Jr. Memorial Field Airport , activated in 1958, is a very small Town -owned and operated airport . The airport is unattended, but there is a wind indicator and parking with tie downs . The airport receives very limited use. Aircraft operations for 12 -month period end August 2014 were: 80% transient general aviation; 13% local general aviation; and 7% military. The airport is in a rural residential zone away from residential uses. The Land Use Ordinance does not address conflicts between airport uses and nearby residential uses. Railroad s There are no active rail lines in Dover -Foxcroft. T he rail line t hat once existed was abandoned a number of years ago. A portion of this line is owned by the State and utilized as a multi -use recreational trail. Some major industries may not locate in Dover -Foxcroft because it does not have rail service. See Maps 12 a nd 13 Transportation, and Map 14 Sidewalks and Parking in the Volume I Appendices Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 34 Section 1.10 Fiscal Capacity Dover -Foxcroft's financial condition with respect to meeting the community's future needs is important to comprehensive planning . While a detai led financial analysis is beyond the scope of this plan, a general assessment can provide some insight into the Town's overall ability to provide services and facilities to accommodate anticipated growth and development over the next decade. Financial info rmation, in cluding property valuations, tax rates, revenues and expenditures, long -term debt and capital budgeting are considered . Funding Government An increasing property valuation is crucial to the fiscal health of the community because property taxes currently provide about 75% of funding for municipal services. Based on state valuations for the Town, the Town's valuation increased by 43% between 2004 and 2009, when it peaked at $318 million. Between 2009 and 2013 the valuation decreased by 7.3% to ab out $294.9 million. The decrease in valuation since 2009 can be attributed to the economic recession, slow population growth and the lagging economic recovery. In the future, property taxes will continue to provide most of the revenues to support Town serv ices, which is why a growing property valuation is so important. As state revenues, such as revenue sharing, local road assistance, and aid for education, continue to decrease there will be increasing reliance on property taxes. The Town already utilizes grants and other types of funding and financing to offset increases in property taxes, but will need to continue to explore these types of options in the future. The Town has little control over school and county budgets, as well as the costs of energy, fu el, and other expenses, where there is limited choice in vendors. Careful planning and budgeting will help manage future expenditures where the Town has control over costs. Funding Future Capital Investments Dover -Foxcroft funds capital improvements through a capital budgeting process that includes annual contributions to reserve accounts, equipment leasing, state transportation funds, tax increment financing , grants, trust accounts, and long -term borrowing , including refinancing to improve interest rates . The Town also recently hired a consultant to develop a plan for prioritizing capital improvements to the Town's paved roads. These funding sources and mechanisms, and others as identified, will be used to su pport the capital investments identified in this Comprehensive Plan. Borrowing Capacity The Town had approximately $ 6.5 million in long term debt (principal and interest) as of the June 30, 2014 . This debt is well within the legally allowed amount of debt . Based on th e borrowing capacity analysis , the Town appears to have sufficient borrowing capacity to fund additional capital investments, but should proceed cautiously. Property valuations need to be increasing if the current level of services and facilit ies are to be maintained. Regional Collaboration in Funding Capital Projects Regional collaboration to fund capital improvements can reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Areas where the Dover -Foxcroft has or might share in capital improvements include: o Emergency services through the county, including dispatch, communications, and planning . o Regional School Unit School #68. o The Dover -Foxcroft's Regional Solid Waste and Recycling Facility . o Solid waste disposal through PERC through 2018; thereafter to be determined in the future . o Recreation facilities and programs - Piscataquis YMCA, Foxcroft Academy, etc. . Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 35 As the primary service center and county -seat, Dover -Foxcroft plays an important role within Piscataquis County. Equitable and m utually beneficial shar ing of services and facilities among the communities, county and state is important to consider in looking ahead. Section 1.11 Existing Land Use An analysis of land use is one of the most important elements of the Comprehensive Plan because it provides the basis for the Future Land Use Plan and the management of future growth and development . The inventory and analysis examines land use patterns, identifies development trends , and predicts how much future growth might occur. The Town 's land use regulations and their administration and enforcement are also examined. Key policy issues to be addressed include: to what extent does the Town wish to direct future development; how can the Town best prepare for future development; how does the Town ensu re that new development will be compatible with existing uses; and how can the Town assure that new development will not over -tax public facilities and services. Recent Development Trends and Consistency with the Town's Vision Residential Development: New residential development has been modest over the past decade consisting of about one to two small subdivisions per year (less than 15 lots each, except for one 24 -unit multifamily development) and an average of about 22 new residential units per year. Tr ends include: o About \u00bd of subdivision lots/units (including multifamily) were in the urban area. o Most new single -family residences (homes and mobile homes) have been located in the rural area on lots outside of subdivisions. These new homes are often locat ed along or near major highways, such as the Dexter Road and the Bangor Road. o Nearly all new units associated with multifamily housing and mobile home parks have been located in the urban area. o There are still vacant lots in existing subdivisions; some sub divisions are entirely vacant. o Land divisions to accommodate family members are common. o Not much residential development has occurred in the Residential District ; the growth district that extends from the Village District to East Dover. o Developable shoref ront on Sebec Lake is nearly built -out. Seasonal camps are common. Most developable shorefront along Branns Mill Pond is built -out. o Conversion of camps to homes suitable for year -round habitation occurs occasionally. Non -residential Development: Non -residential development sin ce 2009 has included commercial, public and semi -public uses. These have included three cell towers, a credit union, Family Dollar, Dunkin Donuts, a nursing home, a nursery/garden center, Central Hall redevelopment, Foxcroft Academy expansions, Two Rivers Child Development project , several home occupations and a number of small business expansions. The Moosehead Redevelopment Project, a major mixed use development , was also developed in the downtown. With the exception of several chur ches and cell towns, most new non -residential uses were located in the urban area. Consistency with the Vision: Development trends have been fairly consistent with the goals of the existing Land Use Ordinance - that is, a signifi cant proportion of developm ent over the past decade has occurred in growth /urban areas. Where recent development trends have fallen short of the Town's vision, is in the overall limited amount of development that has occurred . Specifically , the Town would like to see more redevelopment of existing properties in the urban area including revitalization of the downtown, and build -out of the Pine Crest Business Park. Regulatory Actions to Promote Development Consistent with the Vision A stable population with a flourishing eco nomy is necessary to affordably support community services and facilities over the next decade. In general, the Town should promote good quality redevelopment and new Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 36 development in areas most cost -effectively served. The Town has more than enough public s ewer and water capacity to support additional development. A multi -pronged growth management program will be most effective to achieving the Town's vision. This program should include land use planning and regulation, an ongoing capital improvements progr am, the downtown revitalization plan and other economic development plans, housing programs, and other tools designed to achieve the community's vision for the future.18 Overall, the Town's existing designation of growth, rural, and natural resource protec tion areas appears to be supporting the community's vision for the future. This is within the context of current rates and types of growth . In considering future redevelopment and other growth opportunities, the Town should review urban area zoning to assu re the following: o Adequate flexibility to encourage redevelopment, infill and new development at desired densities, including consideration for mixed -use developments in appropriate areas . o Adequate \"good neighbor\" standards to make more densely developed a reas attractive for development and to protect existing uses and reduce the probability of conflicts. o An adequate amount of land available for expansion of desired uses, without encouraging sprawl that will be more expensive to serve. The Town may want to consider : Expanding the Commercial District further west along West Main Street . Changing the Residential District from a growth district to a transitional or rural district; the village of East Dover (cluster of homes) could be its own district. Expanding the Village District in areas that would be most easily served by centralized sewer and water in the future. With the desire to build -out the Pine Crest Business Park, it is important to assure that land use regulations are aligned with the vision for par k development. If the Town's vision is for more industrial development (with consideration for type of development), land areas potentially suitable for this type of development should be identified and zoned appropriately. With respect to \"distribution corridors including highways, pipelines and high tension transmission lines\"19 the Town should take a comprehensive approach to address all types of corridors so that all potential, future concerns are addressed. The Land Use Ordinance should be amended as necessary to address uses, such as marijuana dispensaries, industrial scale energy production (pellet mills, wind, solar, geothermal), and any other potential uses that do not appear to be addressed. Assuming more forestry and agricultural uses are desira ble, the Town should evaluate land use regulations to assure adequate protection from conflicts for these uses, and the regulatory flexibility to allow diversification, as appropriate (See Section 1.12 Forestry and Agriculture). Assuming the Town's desire to maintain rural character and protect important natural resources, land use regulations should be reviewed to determine their effectiveness in this regard. A number of non -rural uses are currently allowed in rural areas. While conservation subdivisions a re allowed, and allow density bonuses for preservation of important open space, these provisions have never been used. 18 The findings and conclusions from each chapter of the Inventory and Analysis should be considered in the development of a multi -pronged future land use plan and growth management program. 19 Moratorium Ordinance, Re: Private Distribution Corridors to Inclu de Paved Highways, Pipelines, and High Tension Transmission Lines ; enacted December 15, 2014. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 37 Non -Regulatory Actions to Promote Development Consistent with the Vision Providing adequate infrastructure is fundamental to promoting desired land use patterns. The Town's public sewer and water capacity, along with adequate streets, parking, sidewalks, parks, public spaces, and services, community events, and economic incentives can be effective in promoting desired development in the u rban areas. Adequate roads are important to rural areas, particularly those roads that serve farming and forestry operations. Roads can also have other impacts, such as encouraging sprawl in areas that may be more costly to serve and serving as barriers to wildlife habitats. Property tax programs, such as Tree Growth, and the Farmland and Open Space Program can support forestry, agricultural, and open space uses. Land conservation has been used by land trusts and state agencies in Dover -Foxcroft and the re gion to protect important natural resources, and is another non -regulatory option for land use planning. Administrative Capacity to Manage Land Use Program The Town has a full -time person who serves as the certified Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) and also serves in a number of other capacities. This person is responsible for permitting, compliance, enforcement, maintenance of records, and staffing the meetings of the Planning Board. This individual also serves as the assessor's agent assistant and maintain s on-line assessing records and maps, serves as the E -911 addressing officer, and serves as the health officer and building inspector. The Town began administering the state -mandated MUBEC code in 2012, which increased the CEOs workload somewhat. Applicant s must hire their own certified, third -party inspectors to assure compliance with MUBEC. Currently, the Town hires another person as a part -time plumbing inspector to permit and inspect subsurface wastewater disposal systems and plumbing installations. While the Town's current capacity to administer its land use regulations appears adequate at this time, any increase the amount of activity in any one of the areas of responsibility of the person serving as the CEO could impact this individual's ability to adequate manage land use permitting, compliance and enforcement. An efficient and effective land use permitting system is important to facilitating future growth and development. Floodplain Management The Town participates in the National Flood Insuranc e Program (NFIP), which makes federally backed flood insurance available for all buildings, whether they are in a floodplain or not. Flood insurance covers direct loss caused by surface flooding, including a river flowing over its banks, a lake storm, and local drainage problems. In order to participate in the program, the Town maintains an up -to-date Floodplain Ordinance as required by the NFIP. 100-year floodplains subject to the requirements of the Floodplain Management Ordinance are found along portion s of the Piscataquis River, Fox Brook, Alder Stream, Black Stream, Branns Mill Pond, Daggett Brook, and Sebec Lake. The Town's floodplain maps are available on the Dover -Foxcroft web site. See Map 15 Land Cover, Maps 16 and 17 Land Use Districts, Map 18 Sho reland Zoning, Map 20 Development Constraints, and Map 21 Soil Potential for Low Density Development (Volume I Appendices) Section 1.12 Forestry and Agriculture Agriculture and forestry are significant endeavors in Dover -Foxcroft. The Town's forests and agricultural land are the foundation of its rural landscape , and combined with human settlements are an important aspect of the community's cultural heritage. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 38 Commercial forestry is a tradition and an ongoing source of income for landowners. Historically , Maine farms were diversified, with landowners producing various food crops for families and neighbors, and utilizing their woodlands for firewood and other forest products for personal use and for sale to local mills. Today, there appears to be resurgence in the traditional family farm and woodlot operation. Forestry and A griculture : Important Cultural, Economic, Scenic and Biological Values Air and water quality protection Source of income for landowners and operators Jobs for local people Business for services associated with forestry and agriculture (e.g., equipment, fuel, repairs) Locally grown food and fiber Habitat for fisheries and wildlife Scenic , quiet , rural landscape , and o pen lands for outdoor recreation Undeveloped resource base for the future Importance of Forestry Commercial forestry is a mainstay of the region. While over 70% of the Town is covered with forests, there is proportio nally less commercial forestry in Town than many other less -populated areas of the region. Nearly all forest landowners in Dover -Foxcroft are small woodlot owners, as opposed to large industrial or investment landowners. Two mea sures of commercial forestry include: o There are 159 parcels with a combined total of 14,000 acres of forestland enrolled in the T ree Growth Property Tax Program (intended for commercial forestry). o Maine Forest Service timber harvests permits indicate there are an average of 56 timber harvests per year and about 1,289 acres harvested per year. Pleasant River Lumber is one of the largest taxpayers and employers in the Town. The industry is a major market for spruce and white pine saw logs, and adds value to the resource for export to other areas. CMP Bucksport LLC has a large wood yard where wood is brought in and then shippe d to the Verso p aper mill in Jay. There are many other markets for forest products in the region and state. Given the vast industrial forests of the region it is likely that forestry will remain a stable and major activity in the future. Importance of Ag riculture Commercial agriculture activity is growing in Maine, Piscataquis County and Dover -Foxcroft, as a part of the local foods and buy -local movement. Land cover data indicates 11% of Dover -Foxcroft is cultivated, pasture or hay land. In Piscataquis C ounty between 2007 and 2015 the number of farms increased by 7%, the land in farms increased by 37%, and the average size of farms increased by 28%. Twenty commercial farm operations were identified in Dover -Foxcroft, and there are very likely more. Many of these operations are diversified, and the list of products include maple syrup, Christmas trees, vegetables, herbs, fruits, poultry, eggs, beef, pork, lamb, flowers, honey, hay, and many value -added products. Several of these businesses offer Community Supported Agriculture arrangements . Farm woodlots are also an important source of firewood and lumber and as income for many farms. There are also several commercial equestrian facilities. There are 18 parcels with a combined total of 1,541 acres , consisti ng of 713 acres of farm and open space, and 828 acres of woodland, enrolled in the Farm and Open Space Property Tax Program (intended for Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 39 commercial agriculture). The number of parcels and amount of land enrolled has increased by 158% since 2005. Local growers organized the Dover Cove Farmers Market in 2012. Access to markets is a major challenge for many farms in Dover -Foxcroft . Many people have gardens, tap trees for maple syrup, or raise poultry or livestock for personal use. Support for Productive F orestlands and F armlands Dover -Foxcroft places a high value on its productive forests and farmlands , and supports these land uses in the following ways: o Encouraging the use of the state's current use property tax programs (Tree Growth, Farm and Open Space P roperty Tax Programs) . o Supporting the Dover Cove Farmers Market . o Serving as the host community for businesses and agencies that support forestry and farming, such as equipment supply businesses, livestock services, businesses that sell local products, the Piscataquis Soil and Water Conservation District, etc. o Land use regulations with rural areas designed to protect forestry and agricultural uses . o Land use regulations that support uses associated with agricultural and forestry, such as sawmills, firewood pr ocessors, veterinary clinics, and farm stands . The Town should consider updating its land use regulations to improve support for agriculture and forestry, such as amendments to clearly allow farms to diversity their activities, and to fully utilize their properties . The Northeast Wilderness Trust, which owns 137 acres in Town state s as its goals to expand and further connect the network of protected lands, which includes areas devoted to wilderness, sustainable forestry, and organic farming. Several lando wners have established land trusts for their properties. Threats to Forestry and Agriculture The Town is not aware of any situations where the proximity of new homes or other incompatible uses has affected the normal operations of commercial farmers or fo restland owners. In general, the conversion of productive forest and farmland to other uses has not been a concern due to slow population growth. Population projections suggest this will continue to be the case. However, major developments, including some types of major highway corridors can have significant impacts, such as: o Directly converting productive forest and farmland to other uses . o Reducing the size of parcels making them less viable for commercial farming and forestry . o Creating barriers for agri cultural and forestry operations . o Creating conflicts between incompatible uses . Community Supported Forestry and Agriculture The Dover Cove Farmers Market utilizes Town -owned property on South Street adjacent to the Chamber of Commerce. Founded in 2012, th e market has significant economic and community health benefits. The Town could explore the benefits and possibilities for a Town forest or community garden. This could be accomplished collaboratively with an agency and/or interested landowner. In many wa ys, Dover -Foxcroft is an agricultural hub, due to the following: o The Piscataquis County Fairgrounds is a major asset that brings people interested in agriculture and forestry together from within the region. o The Dover Farmers Market has the potential to g row, and can serve farmers and consumers both from within and outside the community. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 40 Two important resources for those involved in agriculture and forestry include: o The USDA Resource Conservation Service and Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District, both located in Dover -Foxcroft. o The University of Maine Cooperative Extension is also located in Dover -Foxcroft . There are a number of statewide organizations that support forestry and agriculture, such as the Small Woodlot Owners Association, th e Maine Organic Gardeners and Farmers Association, the Maine Farmland Trust. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Conservation is the primary state agency that provides support for forestry and agriculture. See Map 7 Farmland and Forest Land and Map 15 Land Cover (Volume I Appendices) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 41 Chapter 2 - Population Characteristics Section 2.1 Year -round Population: Past, Present and Future Dover -Foxcroft's population generally increased in size, with a few fluctuations, between 1860 and 1990. The figures prior to 1922 when Dover and Foxcroft were two separate towns were combined in Figure 2-1 below. The year -round population peaked at 4,657 for the 1990 Census. By the year 2010 the population was 4,216, which was a loss of 441 individuals over the twenty years since 1990. The 2015 population was estimated to be 4,053 (Maine Office o f Policy and Budget, 20 13), which is 82 people less than the 2012 Census estimate of 4,135. Population project ions done by the Maine Office of Policy and Budget suggest the population will continue to decrease in size through to the 2030. These projections must be interpreted with caution . They are based on assumptions and past trends that may or may not hold into the future. In some ways, these projections represent what will happen under a business -as-usual scenario where all the moving pieces (including migration rates, life expectancies, and sprawl patterns) continue on their current trajectories. Figure 2 -1, Source: U.S. Census (1860 through 2010); Maine Office of Policy and Management , 2013 (2015 -2030) Population Growth Comparisons The following c onclusions can be drawn by looking at past population growth and state projections (Figure 2-2 and Table 2 -1): Dover -Foxcroft's population decreased in size by about 10% between 1990 and 2010, and is projected to further decrease in size by about 16% betwe en 2010 and 2030. Piscataquis County's population decreased in size by 6% between 1990 and 2010 even though there was a nearly 2% increase during the 2000s. The County'spopulation is projected to decrease in size by 14% between 2010 and 2030. Penobscot Cou nty experienced a slight loss in population during the 1990s, but experieced a 5% net gain in population between 1990 and 2010. The County's population is projected to experience a 2.4% gain in population between 2010 and 2030. Maine experienced an 8% popu lation growth rate between 1990 and 2010, and is projected to continue to grow very modestly between 2010 and 2020, but then decrease for a net loss in population of 0.1% between -Foxcroft Population Change: Past, Present and Future Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 42 Figure 2-2, Sources: U.S. Census (1990, 2000, 2010); Maine Office of Policy and Management , 2013 (2015 -2030) Population projections for neighboring towns, Penobscot and Piscataquis Counties, and area service center commuities, may be helpful in determining how Dover -Foxcroft might approach the future. With the exception of Garland, all of Dover -Foxcroft's neighbors are projected to experience losses in p opulation. Area service centers, Dexter, Guilford, Greenville and Lincoln, are also projected to los e population. Areas where the population is projected to grow , albeit modestly, include Newport, the City of Bangor, and Penobscot County. Again, it is important to note that the projections are based on the past , and do not take into consideration any unanticipated changes such as the loss or gain of a major employ er. However, if Dover -Foxcroft desires to grow its economy, which means maintaing a stable population, it should look to those communities where grow th is anticipated to determine how to take advantage of any connections or collaborations.

During the 1990s there were 98 more deaths than births and net out -migr ation was 348 individuals (Table 2-2). During the 2000s when the population increased by 3 individuals, from 4,213 to 4,216, it was the net result of 210 more deaths than births, and the net in- migration of 213 people. One factor to consider is that older people may be moving to Dover -Foxcroft to live at one of the three nursing or boarding homes. This could affect both death rates and in - migration. Figure 2 -3, Source: Maine Bureau of Vital Statistics, Dover -Foxcroft Town Clerk Secti on 2.2 Population Characteristics Median Age Median age data from the Census can be used to compare population age trends. The median age for Dover -Foxcroft is estimated to be 45 (margin of error is +/-3.2% ). This is an increase from median age figures for the 1990 and 2000. These figures also suggest the Town and county continue to have overall older populations than statewide . Figure 2 -4, Source: U.S Census, 1990, 2000, 2010 (2008 -2012) ACS 5 -Year Estimat es20 20 Census data can be helpful to understanding a community's demographics. Some census data is based on a nearly 100% sample size, while other data is based on a s maller sa mple size. Small sample sizes are less accurate and require greater scrutiny to interpret. Some of the most current data is from th e American Community Survey (ACS) 2008 -2012 5 -year estimates. The ACS 5 -year estimates for rural communities is base d on very small samples, and therefore are subject to often -substantial sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown is the 90% margin of error which can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90% probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate Table 2-2 Population Growth: Natural Change and Migration Decade Population Change Births Deaths Natural Change* Migration* 1990s -446 438 -210 213 *Notes: Natural change = births +/ - deaths (residents).

Figure 2-5, Source: U.S. Census, 2000; (2010 ) ACS 5 -Year Estimates The 2010 estimates should be used with caution due to sampling errors, but the overall trends are evident. This data indicates the following: The overall school -age population (ages 5 to 1 8 years) decreased by 1 35 between 2000 and 2010 . The population age 18 to 24, often those who are either pursuing a post secondary school education or starting out in the work force, increased by 22 between 2000 and 2010. The working -age population age 25 to 50 , the largest age category for both 2000 and 2010, decreased by 170 individuals by the year 2010. The working age population age 50 to 65 increased by 187 between 2000 and 2010. Some of these people may be retiring in the near future. Ther e were appr oximately 69 more people age 65 and over in 2010 than in 2000. The largest age group of those ages 65 and over was the age 65 to 75 for both 2000 and 2010. plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value.

The total population of the County is projected to decrease by 1,203 from 16,956 people in 2015 to 15,753 people by 2025. Figure 2 -6 displays the proportional aging of the population with fewer younger people an d increasingly more, older people between 2015 and 2025 . These projections have the same caveats as those for the Town , and reflect what has happened in the past. Figure 2-6, Source: Maine Office of Policy and Budget , 2013 Gender There were proportiona tely more females (54%) than males (46%) living in Dover -Foxcroft according to 2012 Census estimates.

Figure 2-7, Source : ACS 5 -Year Estimates (margin of Error is =/ -2.9% ) Racial Diversity According to the 2010 Census, Dover - Foxcroft has very little racial diversity with 96.5% of residents indicating they were white (Figure 2-8).

This was an increase of ab out 10% over the 2000 figure of 83%. Figures 2-9 and 2-10 Source: U.S Census, 2000 ; 2010 ACS 5 -Year Estimates About 19% of Dover -Foxcroft residents age 25 and over had a bachelor's degree or higher, which was higher than countywide, but lower than statewide (2010) . While the 2010 figure is about 2% higher than the 2000 Census figure (17% ), the margin of error makes it difficult to reach a conclusion. However, the 2000 data does suggest that overall educational attainment for Dover -Foxcroft is higher than countywide, but lower than statewide. Median Household Income The median household income for Dover -Foxcroft was $45,371 with a margin of error of about +/ - $6,000 (2012 Census estimates - Figure 2 -11). The median household income for th e Town was higher than countywide , but lower than statewide. For the 2000 Census, the median household income was $28,250, considerably l ess than countywide and statewide. Census estimates for 2010 have a higher margin of error than the 2012 data, but the data matches fairly closely.

The data in Figure 2-11 again suggest income levels in Dover -Foxcroft fall between income levels countywide and statewide. Figure 2-12, Source: U.S. Census ACS 5 -Year Estimates Poverty Overall poverty rates for families in Dover -Foxcroft appear to have declined significantly since the 2000 Census (Figure 2 -13). These figures correspond to the median h ousehold income data in Figure 2 -11. When compared to poverty levels countywide and statewide, Dover -Foxcroft appears to have proportionately fewer individuals living below the poverty level (Figure 2 -14). Individuals and families most likely to live in poverty include single, female , head -of-household families with children under age 18 , and the elderly . The most current Census data for these groups has such high margins of error that it is not helpful to this analysis. Figures 2 -13 and 2 -14, Source s: U.S. Census, 2000; (2012) ACS 5 -Year Estimates Characteristics of Households Most households (63%) in Dover -Foxcroft were \"family\" households that consist of a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption (2010 Census -Table 2-4*). About 24% of households were family households with their own children under 18 years of a ge. There were more than twice as many female householders without a husband with their own children under 18 (104), than male householders without a wife and their own children under 18 (42). This can be a concern, because women are more likely to live be low the poverty line than men . Of the nonfamily households, about 543 were householders living alone. Of those householders living alone and age 65 or over, many more women (311) than men (23 ) live alone, including those 65 years and over. There were 173 w omen age 65 or older living alone as compared to 84 men age 65 or older living alone. 5.2% 3.3% 13% 1.7% 9% 0% Percent Below Poverty Level Margin of Error Figure 2 -14 Families: Percenatge Below the Poverty Line, 2012 2 -13 Families: Percentage Below the Poverty Line, 2000, 2012 of Error 2012 Margin of Error Figure 2 -12 Per Capita Income, 2010 and 2012 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis County Maine Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 48 Section 2.4 Seasonal Population Dover -Foxcroft had 451 \"seasonal, recreational or occasional use\" housing units according to the 2010 Census. This is about 18% of all ho using units within the community. Some tourists stay at short -term accommodations in Dover - Foxcroft, such as campgrounds, sporting camps, bed and breakfasts and motels. Although there are a significant number of tourists passing through Dover -Foxcroft on t heir way to the Moosehead Lake region, local opinion indicates that most people simply pass through Dover - Foxcroft on their way to the Moosehead Lake (2005 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan) . Section 2.5 Group Quarters21 The proportion of Dover -Foxcroft's population living in group quarters increased from 3.7% in 2000 to 4.3% in 2010. Dover -Foxcroft had 183 individuals, or 4.3% of its population living in group quarters with 111 institutionalize d and 72 non-institutionalized for the 2010 Census. The institutionalized population would include residents of the Hibbard Nursing Home, Pleasant Meadows and Hilltop Manor, inmates of the Piscataquis County Jail and probably residents of the Charlotte White homes. Non-institutionalized individuals would include those living in the dorms at Foxcroft Academy. For the 2000 Census, there were 155 individuals , or 3.7% of the populat ion living in- group quarters in Dover -Foxcroft . This consisted of 130 institutionalized individuals and 52 non-institutionalized individuals . The percentage of residents living in group quarters in Dover -Foxcroft (4.3%) was higher than countywide (1.1%) and statewide (2.7%) for the 2010 Census . 21 \"Group quarters\" is a place where people live or stay, in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organi zation providing housing and/or services for the residents. \"Institutional group q uarters \" include facilities for people under formally authorized, supervised care or custody at the time of enumeration. Generally, restricted to the institution, under the c are or supervision of trained staff, and class ified as \"patients\" or \"inmates, \" such as correctional, nursing, and in -patient hospice facilities, psychiatric hospitals, juvenile group homes and residential treatment centers. \"Non-Institutionalized group qu arters\" i ncludes other types of group qu arters such as college dormitories, rooming houses, religious group homes, communes, and halfway houses.

The community serves a large rural area with outstanding natural resources, and at a gateway to Maine's North Woods. Many would say the community's quality of life is exceptional because it is a small, tight -knit community with the full range of services necessary to meet residents' and visitors' needs. Section 3.2 Inve ntory of Businesses and Organization The following table displays an inventory of current businesses and services within Dover -Foxcroft. With the broad range of business and public and private services, it clearly illustrates the Town 's role as the primar y service center in the region. While this list includes some major employers, such as the Mayo Regional Hospital and Pleasant River Lumber, it primarily consists of many small to medium -sized businesses, some owner - operated, and some with no employees. Th e list also includes non -profits and public agencies which are employers and important to the community's economy. This inventory was created using information from the 2005 Comprehensive Plan, the business listing on the Town 's WEB page, an internet searc h, and an update by Town staff utilizing g property tax records. It is intended to be as comprehensive as reasonably possible, but there may be unintentional omissions or listing may be listed incorrectly, for which we apologize. 22 See Chapter 5 Historic and Archeological Resources for a brief historical perspective on how and why the curr ent economy of the community and region developed.

Major employers located in the Labor Market Area (LMA) outside of the Town are listed in Table s 3-2 and 3-3.The majority of employers in Dover -Foxcroft and the region have less than 20 employees ; many of these are family businesses and home occupations. The top 25 private employers in Piscataquis County as id entified by the MDL are displayed in Table 3 -3.

Given the aging population, there will continue to be a strong demand for health and social services. Public schools are major employers whose employment levels may be impacted by decreasing enrollments. However, Foxcroft Academy draws students from outside the region, and would not be as impacted by regional economic factors. Major e mployers in manufacturing, c onstruction businesses, and retail and service providers would be more likely to be impacted by overall economic trends. Section 3.4 Employment and Workforce Statistics Employment in rural Maine can differ substantially from that of urban Maine. Rural areas often have fewer jobs per capita, lower labor force participation, and higher rates of unemployment. Occupations in rural areas typically differ from those in urban areas, reflecting greater reliance on manufacturing. Since rural residents must commute greater distances to find work, benefits are diminished by increased commuting time, transportation costs, and lack of access to child care and services. As will be seen in the following material, the resid ents of Dover -Foxcroft are generally better off than people living outside of the Town in more rural areas. The following summarizes 2013/14 data from the Census and Maine Department of Labor which is presented in more detail on the following pages. Dover -Foxcroft's unemployment rate (8.4%) was lower than the rate for Piscataquis County (9.6%), but higher than the rate for Penobscot County (7%) and statewide (6.7%). The City of Bangor had an unemployment rate of 6.2%. Almost 60% of Dover -Foxcroft's adult po pulation was in the labor force; higher than countywide (55%), but lower than statewide (64%). The data suggest the need for daycare is higher in Dover -Foxcroft than countywide and statewide. About 81% of Dover -Foxcroft families with ch ildren less than 6 years of age had all parent s in family in the labor force and 76% of familie s with school -age children had all parents in the labor force. About 57% of Dover -Foxcroft working -age residents worked in Dover -Foxcroft. About 53% of Dover -Foxcroft's workforce lived outside of Town. Occupations in Dover -Foxcroft reflect its role as a county seat and primary service center . o 37% of workers were in management, busines s, science , and arts occupations o 20% were in service occupations o 18% were in sales and office o 14% were in natural resources, construction, maintenance occupations o 12% were in production, transportati on, material moving occupations The most significant shifts in occupations since 2000 were: for service occupations - from 14% (2000) to 20% (2013), and for sales and office occupations - from 24% to 18% (2013) , and for production, transportation, material moving occupations - from 17% to 11% (2013) . Dover -Foxcroft's workforce by industry was also typical of a county seat and primary service center . o 34% o f workers were in e ducational services, health care, and social assistance o 10% in manufacturing o 9% in retail trade o 9% in a rts, entertainment, recreation, food and accommodation services o 38% in all other categories combined The most significant shift s in wo rkforce by industry since 2000 were: for educat ion, health and social services - from 27% (2000) to 34% (2013) ; for manufacturing - from 17% to 10% (2013) ; and for retail trade - from 17% to 9% (2013) . About 79 % of Dover -Foxcroft' s employed population were private wage and salary workers, 13% were government workers, 8% were self -employed in their own not -incorporated business workers and 1% were unpaid family workers . Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 55 The most significant changes since 2000 were: for private wage and salary workers from 7 6% to 79% (2013) and for government workers from 16% to 13% (2013) The following six pages provide more detailed information . Labor Force and Employment Statistics from the MDL define the labor force as those who are residing in an area who are employed or unemployed; unemployed are those who are rece iving unemployment compensation (Table 3 -4). T hese figures do not include those who are unemployed and not receiving unemployment compensation, but who may still be looking for work. Those not participating in the labor force may be going to school or may be retired , or may have family responsibilities that prevent them from working. According to these statistics for 2013, Dover -Foxcroft had 1,784 people in the labor force, of which 1,635 were employed and 149 w ere unemployed for an unemployment rate of 8.4% (Table 3-4). Dover -Foxcroft's unemployment rate (8.4%) was lower than the rate for Piscataquis County (9.6%), but higher than the rate for Penobscot County (7%) and statewide (6.7%). This is not surprising gi ven Dover -Foxcroft's rural location. Of the jurisdictions displayed in the table, the City of Bangor had the lowest unemployment rate, 6.2% .

Dover -Foxcroft's labor force was estimated to be 2,113, about 330 individuals larger than the MDL figure of 1,784. The Town's unemployment rate shown below is 8%, lower than the MDL employment rate of 8.4%. Similar to the MDL data, Dover -Foxcroft's unemployment rate is lower than countywide (9%), but higher than statewide (7.7%). Almost 60% of Dover -Foxcroft's adult population was in the labor force, which was higher than countywide (55%), but lower than sta tewide (64%). About 55% of women in Dover -Foxcroft's labor force were employed. The data suggest that the need for daycare is higher in Dover -Foxcroft than countywide and statewide. For Dover -Foxcroft 81% of families with children less than 6 years of age, had all parents in family in the labor force, which was much higher than both countywide (53%) and statewide (69%). The data for families with school -age children indicates that 76% of Dover -Foxcroft families had all parents in the labor force as compared to countywide (64%) and statewide (76%).

Some census data is based on a nearly 100% sample size, while other data is based on a smaller sa mple size. Small sample sizes are less accurate and require greater scrutiny to interpret. Some of the mo st current data is from th e American Community Survey (ACS) 2008 -2012 5 -year estimates. The ACS 5 -year estimates for rural communities is based on very small samples, and therefore are subject to often -substantial sampling variability. The degree of uncert ainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown is the 90% margin of error which can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90% probability that the interval defined by the estimat e minus the margin of error and the estimate Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 57 Commuter Patterns According to Census estimates, about 79% of Dover -Foxcroft residents commute to work alone, compared to 80% countywide and 78% statewide. Dover -Foxcroft commuters are slightly more likely to carpool or walk than countywide and statewide. About 5.5% of Dove r-Foxcroft's workers worked at home as compared to 6.1% countywide and 5.3% statewide. The estimated mean travel time to work for Dover -Foxcroft residents was 24.1 minutes , as compared to 24.9 minutes countywide and 23.3 minutes statewide.

Most other residents commuted to major employment centers in the greater Bangor area and the larger towns in the region. The farthest commute was to Boston, and about 1% (23) of Dover -Foxcroft residents made that commute. About 47% of Dover -Foxcroft's workforce resided in Dover -Foxcroft. Another 23% of the Town's workforce commute d to Dover -Foxcroft from Milo, Guilford, Sangerville and Dexter, combined. The Dover -Foxcroft LMA designation is base d on commuter patterns (See Map 2 Labor Market Area in Volume I Appendices ). plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value.

According to 2013 Census estimates in Table 3-8, Dover -Foxcroft's workforce by occupations was as follows: 37% of workers were in management, busines s, science and arts occupations 20% were in service occupations 18% were in sales and office 14% were in natural resources, construction, maintenance occupations 12% were in production, transportati on, material moving occupations The work force (civilian employed population 16 years and over) was 1,807 for the 2000 Census and 1,944 according to the 2013 esti mates. Even though the categories changed slightly between the censuses, the shifts in the proportion of the workforce in occupations between 2000 and 2013 can be compared, and are as follows : Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 59 Increases in the following: For management, business, science and arts occupations - from 34% (2000) to 37% (2013) For service occupations - from 14% (2000) to 20% (2013) For natural resources, construction, maintenance occupations - from 11% (2000) to 13% (2013) Decreases in the following: For sales and office occupations - from 24% (2000) to 18% (2013) For production, transportation, material moving occupations - from 17% (2000) to 11% (2013) Statistics for Dover -Foxcroft's workforce by industry are also typical of a county seat and service center, and a community with a strong health and social services sector. According to 2013 Census estimates, Dover - Foxcroft's workforce by industry was as follows: 34% of workers were in e ducational services, health care, and socia l assistance 10% in manufacturing 9% in retail trade 9% in a rts, entertainment, recreation, food and accommodation services 38% in all other categories combined (Table 3-9) The most significant shift in the proportion of the workforce by industry between 2000 and 2013 was the increase in the workforce in \"education, health and social services\". While this was the largest industry category for both censuses, it is estimated to have increased by about 180 individuals. This proportional shift meant there were proportional decreases in other categories. The following are the most significant shifts proportionally and by estimated number of workers between 2000 and 2013: Increases in the following: For education, health and social services - from 27% (2000) to 3 4% (2013) of the total workforce For arts, entertainment, recreation, food and accommodation services - from 5% (2000) to 9% (2013) For transportation, warehousing, utilities - from 4% (2000) to 7% (2013) Table 3-8 Workforce by Occupation , 2013 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis County Maine Occupation Estimate (Number) Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Civilian employed population 16 years & over 1,944 +/-188 Management, -2013 American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates (See footnote regarding census data) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 60 Decreases in the following: For manufacturing - from 17% (2000) to 10% (2013) For retail trade - from 17% (2000) to 9% (2013) According to the 201 3 Census, 79 % of Dover -Foxcroft' s employed population w ere \"private wage and salary workers ,\" 13% were \"government workers ,\" 8% were \"self-employed in own not -incorporated business workers\" and 1% were \"unpaid family workers .\" Table 3-10 Workforce by Type of Employment, 2013 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis County Maine Estimate (#) Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Civilian employed population 16 years and over 1,944 +/-188 Private wage -2013 American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates (See footnote regarding census data) Table 3-9 Workforce by Industry , 2013 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis County Maine Industry Estimate (#) Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Percent % Margin of Error Workforce - Civilian employed population 16 years and over 1,944 +/-188 Agriculture, forestry, fishing, +/-31 2.4% +/-1.6 2.7% +/-0.8 6.1% +/-0.2 4.9% +/-4.1 4.9% +/-1.4 8.7% +/-7.4 28.6% +/-2.4 27.4% +/-0.4 8.9% +/-4.0 6.9% +/-1.5 -2013 American Community Survey 5 -Year Estimates (See footnote regarding census data) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 61 The proportional shifts between 2000 and 2013 were: An increase f or private wage and salary workers from 76% (2000) to 79% (2013) A decrease for government workers from 16% (2000) to 13% (2013) Self-employed workers in own not incorporated business was 8% for both censuses Unpaid family workers increased from 0.4% (2000) to 0.6% (2013) Section 3.5 Consumer Retail Sales Taxable consumer retail sales data can be used to evaluate the strength and weaknesses of the commu nity's retail sales sectors. Taxable consumer retail sales are those sales where a sales tax is collected, and do not include non -taxable items such as food eaten in the home. Non -taxable food store items typically represent about 25% of actual total sales in food stores.25 The Maine Office of Policy and Management compiles the retail sales data displayed in Figure 3-3. The communities included in these E conomic Summary Areas (ESA s) are listed in Table 3-11. Most notable in Figure 3-3 is the growth in reta il sales (14.3% from 2008 to 2013) for the Bangor Sub ESA, which includes Hampden, Hermon, Newport, Holden, and a number of smaller communities. This rate of growth was more than twice the rate of growth statewide. The Dover -Foxcroft ESA, which includes D over -Foxcroft, Guildford, Garland, Dexter, Greenville, and many other small er communities, had retails sales growth of 1.4% between 2008 and 2013, which was more than for the Bangor ESA, which includes Bangor, Brewer, Orono, Old Town and Veazie and a few o thers smaller communities. The Lincoln ESA, which include s communities along the interstate, experienced greater growth (2.3%) than the Dover -Foxcroft ESA (1.4%) between 2008 and 2013. Retails sales for the Dover -Foxcroft ESA increased somewhat dramaticall y between 2012 and 2013 (3%), which exceeded retail sales growth in the Bangor and Lincoln ESAs . The cumulative rate of inflation from 2008 to 2013 was 8.2% , and t he rate of inflation for 2012 to 2013 was 1.5% .26 This means that with the exception of the Bangor Sub ESA, retail sales in the other ESAs were not keeping up with the rate of inflation for the period between 2008 and 2013. Between 2012 and 2013 retail sales exceeded the rate of inflation in all of the E SAs and statewide, which is not surprising given the more recent improvement in the overall economy. 25 The data on taxable Maine retail sales is derived from state sales tax collections. These data represent sales, not the amount of tax revenue collected. 26 http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 62 Figure 3 -3, Source : Maine Office of Policy and Management, 2014 Economic Summary Areas BANGOR ESA - Bangor , Brewer , Great roft's quarterly consumer retail sales data for 2010 through the 3rd quarter of 2014 are displayed in Figure 3-4. The cyclical natural of retail sales with the most sales during the 2nd and 3rd quarter is quite evident. There was also a steady increase in retail sales between 2010 and 2013, as is made evident from the linear trend line. The 2014 figures appear to be less than prior years, but that may be because complete data for the year is not yet compile by Maine Revenue Services . The cumulative rate of inflation for 2010 through 2014 is about 8.3% ,27 which means that $8 million dollars in 2010 would be about $8.664 million in 2014. This rough calculation suggests that retail sales are increasing only slightly faster than the rate of inflation. Dover -Foxcroft's retail sales by Store Type are displayed in Figure 3-5. Store Types are defined in Table 3-12. The strongest retail sale store types were Auto Trans and Food Store. The General store type also had strong retail sales for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2014.

Thus, each store is coded into one of the store -type groups below depending on its predominant product; i.e., furniture sold by a furniture store will be included in General Merchandise sales while furniture sold by a hardware store will be included in Building Supply sales. Auto : All transportation -related stores, including auto dealers, auto parts, motorcycle shops, aircraft & boat dealers, auto rental, etc. Building Supply : Durable equipment sales, contractors' sales, hardware stores and lumber yards. Food Stores : All food stores from large supermarkets to small corner food stores. The values are non -food items only, since food intended for home consumption is not taxed. The taxable values shown typically repre sent roughly 25% of actual store sales (since three - fourths of all food store sales are not taxed). General Merchandise : Department stores and stores carrying product lines typically found in department stores; including clothing stores, furniture stores, shoe stores, and home appliance stores. Lodging & Restaurants: Hotels, motels, campgrounds, bed & breakfasts, etc. & stores selling food for immediate consumption. Other Retail : A wide variety of stores not covered elsewhere, including drug stores, jewelry stores, sporting goods stores, antique dealers, book stores, photo supply stores, gift shops, etc. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 64 Section 3.6 Dover -Foxcroft's Economic Development Initiatives Dover -Foxcroft's Town Manager, acting on behalf of the Board of Selectpersons, oversees the Town's economic development programs, which often consists of collaborative efforts with other organizations, such as the Pine Crest Development Corporation and the Piscataquis County Economic Development Corporation (PCEDC). Specific economic development a ctivities have included downtown revitalization, the Riverfront Redevelopment Project, the Pine Crest Business Park, several tax increment financing districts, and efforts to get adequate access to high -speed internet. It is important to note that basic mu nicipal services and facilities are critical to economic activity. A thriving economy depends on government services and adequate facilities, such as roads, emergency services, solid w aste disposal, and sewer and water. The Town , usually with assistance fr om the PCEDC, has accomplished many projects utilizing outside funding sources, an d creative financing mechanisms (See Tables 3-12 and 3-13 at the end of this chapter ). The Town is also active with the PCEDC in promoting countywide economic development. Piscataquis County Economic Development Council (PCEDC)28 Dover -Foxcroft participates with PCEDC in promoting economic development both countywide and in Dover - Foxcroft. PCEDC, with an office in Dover -Foxcroft, was established in 1997 by leaders from aroun d the county who recognized the need for a cooperative economic development program. The Board of Directors is diverse and has members from both the public and private sectors. The Board elects an Executive Committee that oversees the staff and PCEDC's dai ly operations. The Council's mission is to leverage local, county, regional, state and federal resources to promote and encourage private and public investment with the goal of stimulating long -term sustainable economic development and growth in the regio n. In order to better promote economic development, PCEDC focuses on attracting businesses to the county, retaining local businesses and assisting in their growth, and developing and promoting the county's unique culture and heritage. PCEDC assists towns and non -profits in a number of areas, such as downtown revitalization, improving community facilities, upgrading water and sewer systems, developing renewable energy projects, preserving historic buildings, redeveloping sites for businesses and creating in frastructure for tourism. PECDC also operates two revolving loan programs: the Brownfields program for clean -up of contaminated sites and the Small Business Revolving Loan Program for development and expansion of small businesses. Piscataquis Chamber of Co mmerce29 The Piscataquis Chamber of Commerce is a non -profit organization with an office and tourist information center at 1033 South Street in Dover -Foxcrof t. The Chamber's mission is to unify and promot e business and stimulate growth in Pis cataquis County. Its vision is to create a truly regional, active, vital partnership between 28 http://www.p cedc.org 29 http://www.piscataquischamber.com PCEDC's Vision: Piscataquis County will have a strong, diverse, and vibrant economy that offers higher quality jobs to support stron g, diverse, and vibrant families and communities. A strong economy is one that is wealth generating, able to survive national economic downturns, productive, and efficient. It's also diverse, containing a numerous, healthy combination of manufacturing, se rvice, and retail businesses. Such an economy must be a vibrant one that values creativity, supports leadership, and is knowledge based. The resulting higher quality jobs will be able to financially sustain individuals, families, and communities. PCEDC wil l continue to build a prosperous future of Piscataquis County for everyone by growing our population, ensuring a viable future for our youth, providing opportunities for lifelong learning and employment, promoting tourism and recreation, and advocating for this county at multiple levels in order to ensure a good quality of life for all of our residents.

The Chamber of Commerce is an active participant in economic development wit hin the region and has a director and several part-time staff. Annual Events There are a number of annual activities that the Town and its partners have sponsor ed to promote the region. These have include d the following: Piscataquis Heritage Hot Air Ballo on Festival Kiwanis Club Piscataquis River Canoe Race (Guilford to Dover -Foxcroft) Whoopie Pie Festival Piscataquis Valley Fair Shiretown/Homecoming Festival Dover -Foxcroft and Milo Kiwanis Club Auctions Maine Highlands State Championship Sled Dog Race Maine Maple Sunday Penquis Valley Regional Expo Downtown Revitalization Dover -Foxcroft's downtown revitalization efforts can be traced back to 2001, when a Vision Committee comprised of downtown's stakeholders (e.g., busin ess owners, consumers, town officials, and civic organizations) worked to create a vision for the area.30 The Vision Committee's work led to the development of the Downtown Revitalization Plan (2003), and then to Dover -Foxcroft's designation as a Ma ine Downtown Network Community in 2009 . The following summarizes these efforts . Summary of Recent Progress A garden and traffic island installed to improve traffic flow in t he area of the Fire Department Farmer's Market established at the Chamber of Commerce Facade i mprovements to downtown b usinesses Tree inventory and trees planted at key locations (Project Canopy) ; became a Tree City USA Plantings established in the triangle at Union Square Historic District enacted - Historical Society make s recommendations related to historic structures. Central Hall revitalized Town became member of Maine Downtown Network Redevelopment of the Moosehead Mill Complex underway Dover -Foxcroft, a Maine Downtown Network Community (2009 to Present) Dover -Foxcroft became a Maine Downtown Network Community in 2009 . This means the Town is a member of the Maine Development Foundation's Maine Downtown Center (MDC) program31 which supports downtown revitalization through technical assistanc e and training in the areas of promotion, design, organiza tion and economic restru cturing. Each Main Street program is loca lly driven, responds to local priorities, and is locally funded . The MDC is a partner in th e revitalization process by providing technical assistance and training. 30 A detailed summary of the Vision Committee's work is included in the Town's 2005 Comprehensive Plan. 31 The Maine Downtown Center's mission is \"to advance preservation -based economic development in downtowns across Maine, resulting in business growth, job creation, building rehabilitation, cultural enhancement and organizational leadership. The Center and i ts Advisors serve as a resource for all Maine communities interested in undertaking downtown revitalization projects and developing sustainable programs.\" See http://www. mdf.org/mdc_overview.php Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 66 The Main Street Four -Point Approach\u00ae developed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Main Street Center emphasizes economic development within the context of historic preservation and is based on principles of self -determination and direct community participation. The four key areas of revital ization are: Organization. Involving all constituencies having an interest in downtown revitalization and management of both human and financial resources. Organization helps everyone work towards the same goals and maximizes involvement of public and priv ate leaders within the community. Design. Implementing projects that improve the appearance and functionality of downtown buildings and physical environment. Design enhances a district's appearance and pedestrian amenities while preserving its historic features. Promotion. Creating programs that market the downtown to potential and existing customers, producing special events and festivals, and promulgating a positive image of downtown. Promotion brings people back downtown by helping to attract visitors , shoppers, and investors. Economic Restructuring. Studying the community's economy and market opportunities and using the information to develop programs that strengthen and expand existing businesses and aid in recruiting new businesses to downtown. Econ omic restructuring stimulates business development and helps strengthen the district's economic base. To implement the Four -Point Approach to advance dow ntown revitalization, Dover -Foxcroft established a Steering Committee, and appointed two working commi ttees: the Design Committee and the Economic Restructuring and Promotion Committee. The MDC provid ed technical support to the committee s through a start -up evaluation and work plan in 2010 (summarized below), and has provided first and second year evaluati ons, and on -going training and other technical assistance through workshops and other activities. Summary Report from the Start -Up Team Visit to Dover -Foxcroft September 2010 The MDC report contains observations and recommendations made by a team of expert s when they visited the community in 2010. In general , the report builds on the Town 's strengths, such as strong community interest in improving the downtown and a number of architecturally and historically significant buildings that help define the unique character of the downtown . The report also recognized the enormous potential of the redevelopment of the historic Moosehead Mill complex for the entire community, and specifically downtown. The report has many recommendations, including those that up -date the 2003 Downtown Revitalization Plan. Since the initial start -up visit, the Steering Committee and two working Committees have established goals for future work and implemented a number of actions. Some of these have included: Steering Committee o Establis hing a budget and seeking funding sources . o Developing a public relations program . Promotions Committee o Expand and develop new promotions - Hometown Holidays, etc. o Develop print brochure and events calendar . o Establish online presence - web site and Faceb ook. Design Committee o Downtown beautification - clean -up, flowers, flags, banners, etc. o Inventory downtown buildings . o Inventory parking availability and make improvements . o Downtown rehabilitation project (s) - storefront, downtown flower gardens . o Educat ion in historic preservation, attended Maine Preservation's Field Service Training . Economic Restructuring Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 67 o Inventory downtown businesses . o Inventory vacant storefronts . o Analyze opportunities for clustering of complementary businesses . o Create downtown brochure and business directory with Promotions Committee . o Conduct a brief intercept survey of people coming to the downtown . o Hold forum for downtown business owners and managers to network and collaborate . In addition to the establishment of committees and goals, the report also recommended the following: Develop a downtown brand logo and slogan statement to be used widely by merchants and businesses to continually reinforce the message and image of the down town. Promote infill development that is compatible with the historic fabric creates attractive places for people and art, as part of your creative economy/local crafts niche. Develop design guidelines for downtown integrating redevelopment that preserves and enhances significant structures (of which there are many) and street character. Utilizing a f undraising approach for income sources: 1/3 from the Town, 1/3 from downtown businesses/ property owners and 1/3 from the residents and special events . The ov erarching slogan for the Main Street program is economic development within the co ntext of historic preservation. Historic buildings provide the distinctive setting for downtown revitalization and, when combined with a beautiful natural setting, are a comm unity's greatest economic development assets. Your good historic building stock is relatively intact, with the exception of a few storefronts that have been significantly modified over time. While many people do, it is important for the entire community to recognize the quality of these irreplaceable buildings, their character -defining value, and their potential to leverage the benefits of incentives such as the federal and state historic tax credits to restore and preserve them well into the future. As we and many others regularly state: historic preservation is a proven economic development tool and will significantly raise the level of revitalization here to the status it deserves. Redevelopment of the Moosehead Mill Complex32 The R iverfront Redevelopment Project, initiated around 2010 consists of the downtown complex of land and buildings formerly owned by Moosehead Manufacturing (Mill), an area of about 3.25 acres with frontage on the Piscataquis River. When Moosehead Manufacturing defaulted on its real e state taxes, the Town assumed ownership of the property. In order to redevelop the property and create jobs, the Town decided to sell the property to Pine Crest, the non -profit corporation created by the Town to develop the Pine Crest Business Park. Pine C rest was the logical choice to lead the redevelopment project, since it was designed to work in concert with the Town to bring new businesses to Dover -Foxcroft. The Town and Pine Crest selected the Arnold Development Group as the lead developer for the red evelopment project. Pine Crest sold the buildings to the developer and then leased back space to build and operate the Mayo Mill Commerci al Office Plaza and Data Center . Arnold Development is rehabilita ting the Mill complex as a LEED -certified community of retail shops, craft ateliers, art studios, commercial offices, data center, renewable energy facilities (hydroelectric plant, photovoltaic solar panels and geothermal plant), restaurant, boutique cafe, residential apartments (20) and a pedestrian Mayo Mil l Riverwalk open to the general public that will give residents of Dover -Foxcroft the opportunity to live, work, and shop in the Town 's downtown business district. The project is to maintain the historic integrity of the buildings while restoring them to p roductive reuse. 32 TIF application. Also see description later in this chapter. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 68 The Riverfront Redevelopment Project represents a $12 million investment that require s an innovative public - private partnership fostering private financing and investment, state and federal grants and community support through Tax Increment Financing (TIF) to revitalize the downtown business district, increase property values, restore the historic buildings to complement the commercial, residential, religious and civic buildings surrounding t he Mill, encourage investment in the downtown, eliminate slum and blight and create new job opportunities. The Dover -Foxcroft Riverfront Redevelopment TIF District is designed to provide a solution to those looking for multi -purpose space in an urban envir onment , and will offer attractive living and working space to the region's growing community of artists, craftspeople, Web designers, graphic artists, software engineers, and medical professionals while providing attr active office and meeting space for a v ariety of business sectors. Downtown Revitalization Plan - Phase I (2003) The Downtown Revitalization Plan was prepared for the PCEDC (on behalf of the Town). WBRC, an architectural and engineering firm based in Bangor , was hired to develop the plan. The following is a summary of the Plan's goals and general recommendations. Gateway Arrival (South Street): Create a first impression that sets the mood and flavor for a clear, beautiful and environmentally conscious community that is attractive to business, i nvestors, visitors and residents. Recommendations include : appropriate lighting, plantings to frame views and buffer uses, common traffic signs and lighting specific to Dover -Foxcroft , curbed streets, historic preservation measures, site and view sensitive utilities, and traffic circulation and pedestrian improvements. Waterfront (Area between South Street and Piscataquis River): Promote and expand cultural and recreational events, facilities, and programming to address the diverse needs and desires of the citizens in our com munity. Recommendations include : creating a sense of identity and place, highlighting natural and historic features, increase usability and attractiveness of waterfront (parking, boat ramp, gathering areas, walking and biking trails, si te furnishings and lighting, signage, etc.), and cleaning up the area and improving aesthetics. Union Square: A downtown center and meeting place that creates identity and sense of place which expresses and accommodates the mixed use nature of a thriving downtown. Recommendations include: making pedestrian spaces and circulation a priority and addressing traffic issues (traffic calming, pedestrian crossings, and signage), developing a sense of community and pride through activities and events (plaza area w ith site furnishings and lighting). The Downtown Revitalization Plan contains a detailed inventory and analysis of conditions in the areas examined, and recommend s objectives with some specific design improvements. Some of the recommendations of the Plan have been implemented, but not necessa rily as specifically suggested. The overall themes - goals and objectives - have the most value in continuing to improve the downtown and adjacent areas. The Town should update the Plan to reflect the Riverfront Redeve lopment Project, since it was not envisioned in 2003. An updated Plan may also be necessary for obtaining grants and other financing for future projects. Tax Increment Financing District (TIF) TIF is a sophisticated economic development tool used for a wid e-range of economic development activities. Simply stated, it allows a town to direct property tax income from new development to a fund for specific economic development activities. To establish a TIF Program a town must define a TIF District (area where TIFs can be granted) and adopt policies for granting TIFs in accordance with state law. Some or all of the new property -tax income can be used in the TIF District or to support development within the district. A major fiscal benefit is that new valuation f rom the development is not add ed to the T own's total valuation. The higher the Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 69 Town's valuation, the higher its proportional share of funding for schools, the more it pays in county taxes, and conversely the less it gets in state revenue sharing and genera l purpose school funding. Dover -Foxcroft has created two TIF districts: The Riverfront Redevelopment TIF district was established in 2012/2013 to support redevelopment of the Moosehead Manufacturing Mill complex and area. The goa ls of the TIF are to: maintain/ increase property tax revenues within the district; create long -term, stable employment; improve the tax base; provide revenues for investment into public facilities and economic development; and to restore landmark historic buildings. As describe d earlier, Arnold Development now owns the property and has constructed a mixed use facility. Pine Crest, the municipally crea ted non -profit, will lease the Mayo Mill Commerci al Office Plaza and Data Center for future development. The project will also inc lude Town ownership and involvement of renewable energy facilities, including hydropower, photovoltaic solar panels, and geothermal shafts under the parking lot. A pedes trian Riverwalk along the water front and connecting to the mill complex and the downtow n is also planned. The Pleasant River Lumber TIF district was established in 2001 to support modernization of the mill. Pleasant River Lumber is a major employer and taxpayer in the Town. Pine Crest Business Park The Pine Crest Business Park was establish ed by the Town in the year 2000 with the goal of creating additional employment opportunities for the residents of Dover -Foxcroft and the surrounding area, and to enhance the commercial tax base for the Town. The Park is managed by Pine Crest, a non -profit corporation with a 10 member Board of Directors. The corporation has criteria and covenants which must be adhered to by all occupants of the facility, including the requirement that all properties pay property taxes. The Business Park, located off Route 7 , occupies approximately 60 acres of land with 12 surveyed lots varying in size from 1.5 acres to 6.5 acres. The Park has complete infrastructure including road s, water, power and sewer, and fiber optic technology is accessible. The P ark's location along t he Maine's Three -Ring Fiber Optic Network is one of its strengths . As of the fall of 2014, three of the lots were owned by a private entity, who leases the lots to the 4 occupants - the Passamaquoddy Indian Tribe (15,000 s/f building formerly Creative App arel Associates, a manufacturing of military clothing), a child care/pre -school facility, and sharing a lot - the Piscataquis County Soil and Water District and the United States Department of Agriculture. There are nine building sites remaining, all of wh ich are pre -permitted. These lots are marketed by the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council as part of its county -wide marketing efforts. Factors affecting build -out of the park include distance from the interstate and large urban areas, workforc e limitations, and the overall economic climate. Summary of Grants and Other Outside Sources of Funding Dover -Foxcroft has benefitted from a considerable amount of outside funding for economic development. Table 3-12 lists Dover -Foxcroft projects fund ed through the Maine Department of Economic Development and Community Development's Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) since 2001. Table 3-13 is a list of grants that the Town received with assistance from the PCEDC .

Many of their recommendations have been implemented. Some of their work continues to be relevant, and may be helpful to future endeavors. It is summarized below. The Vision Committee discussed the downtown's weaknesses which generally fell into four areas: unmet business needs, beautification is sues, lack of cultural amenities, and infrastructure problems , and then focused on developing constructive solutions, including the following: Create a downtown merchant's organization Compile a business directory to coordinate sales and promotions Encour age a high quality restaurant to attract more people to the downtown Orient businesses towards river to take advantage of views Poll residents on their opinion of downtown/purchases Construct a welcome sign Promote more attractive signage perpendicular to the street Create quality sidewalks Improve lighting and street lamps Develop more green spaces with emphasis on Piscataquis River viewsheds Create an \"improvement\" award for window front display and fa\u00e7ade renovations Provide low -interest loans for fa\u00e7ad e renovations Coordinate building color schemes Enhance cultural amenities (a crafts inc ubator, downtown arts and historic district, Center Theater, the Historical Society, and closer association with Peaks Kenny State Park, Sebec Lake, and Borestone Mount ain Develop a downtown walking loop, improve cross walks, create a river walk Investigate snowmobile access to downtown through the Rails to Trails initiative Promotion of a downtown Arts and Crafts District to include many of the area's craftsmen and artisans. Galleries, working studios, arts & crafts incubator/co -op, renovation of Center Street Theater - independent films, highlighting local dramatic talent, and display of artistic creations. Promoting Dover -Foxcroft as an historical district with a variety of architectural styles. Promote downtown Rivers and Mills concept to highlight historical nature of the downtown area with the Piscataquis River providing past manufacturers with a source of dammed energy. Other promotional ideas such as vendors selling and displaying their goods downtown rather than at the Fairgrounds during Homecoming, the crea ting a Farmer's market downtown, creating a light pa rade to help encourage the public to shop downtown after dark, and a downtown promotional that corresponds with the Hiram Maxim Shootoff and the annual Southern Piscataquis County Chamber of Commerce Sled Dog Race . The Vision Committee charged the PCEDC w ith finding programs to promote the vision and make the concepts into reality. Suggestions included: Dover -Foxcroft becoming a Maine Downtown Network Community 33 This information summarizes material in Dover -Foxcroft's 2005 Comprehensive Plan. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 72 Business Education seminars through the Small Business Administration staff at Eastern Maine Development Corporation (marketing, product pricing, cash flow, etc. ) Utilization of funds from the CDBG Downtown Revitalization program and Public Facilities Program (Historic Preservation category ) \"A Profile of the Workforce in the Piscataquis County - Western Penobscot County Region\" (2001) This study was compiled by the USM Center for Business and Economic Research for the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development in October 2001. Labor market areas (LMA) included the Greenville LMA, Dext er-Pittsfield LMA and the Dover -Foxcroft LMA. Data came from random sample phone surveys of households and employers. Key findings were: Employment in the region was much more concentrated in manufacturing at 34.3% of employment as the primary job , and 9.3 % of self-employed, particularly because of the forest products and textile industries. The region ha d a high proportion of service employment with 30.8% as the primary job, 31.6% as a second job and 35.2% of the self -employed. Trade and services compris ed the major industries for second jobs, while construction and services were the major industries for self -employment. The region had a wide diversity of occupations: a high proportion in skilled manufacturing (19.3% primary job), managerial (12% primary job) and skilled trades (10.5% pri mary job and 11.8% second job) . Reflecting the forest products activities in the region, there was a relatively high proportion of transportation workers (7.5% primary job and 11.8% second job). While t he quality of life in the r egion was considered quite good there was concern among employers about transportation, the personal income tax, cost of utilities and the availability of arts and culture. The most serious issues for employers were p roviding adequate pay to new e mployees and finding employees with particular skills. Finding employees in a timely way and with basic skills was a concern. More than 88% of primary jobs in this region were full -time (more than 35 hours per week). Employers reported starting wages for administrative/clerical and manufacturing positions comparable to other Maine region s, but somewhat lower in retail and managerial positions. Professional starting salaries were found to be comparable to other similar regions. About 29% of respondents in dicated they needed childcare to be able to work . Of those who require d child care, 81% indicated that it was somewhat to very hard to find adequate childcare. Employers did not indicate significant concern with the skills of new hires. However, there was a somewhat greater concern about computer skills and analytic/math skills. Over half of employers indicated they must do some remedial training for 50% or more of new hires. Regarding workforce education, more than 92% of the respondents indicated they h ad completed high school or more. However, the percentage of bachelors and post -graduate degree holders was significantly lower than the state average. Education in the arts and the health professions were the two major fields of degrees, but there were a wide variety of other degree fields as well. The mean commute for the region was 23 minutes. The majority of commute times were over 30 minutes . \"Business Perceptions in Four Rural Eastern Maine Towns (February 2001) \" This report was prepared by EMDC . Sur veys were conducted with businesses in four downtowns: Calais, Dover - Foxcroft, Machias, and Millinocket. Key findings were: Downtown businesses are well established in terms of longevity and property ownership. Location is critical in determining the markets available to business located in downtown. Downtowns serve local, regional, and tourism markets. Downtowns tend to lack the draw to be destination shopping. The unique character of downtown is strength. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 73 There is a perception that physical barriers still exist to downtown shopping. There is some need for business assistance services. There is little cooperation among business owners and between business owners and town government. There is a need for coo perative marketing and organization to carry it out. Downtown business owners/operators are not optimistic about the future of their downtown. Identified needs may be met through merchants working together and through business assistance. Recommendation s indicated the need for: Economic restructuring - Increasing sales in the downtowns requires having the right mix of retail and services. Profiling existing businesses and interviewing existing and potential customers may identify opportunities. Organiz ation - Chambers are often challenged to address the specific needs of downtown. A merchants association can develop a working relationship between businesses and the town. Common goals can be identified and pursued. Promotion and Advertising - There is l ittle or no organized marketing in the down towns. These downtowns need to draw shoppers. Marketing should capitalize on the location and unique aspects of the Town. The ideal organization to carry out local promoting and advertising would be a merchants association. Physical Improvements - Town government and downtown businesses need to identify their specific needs and form a plan to address these needs and funding for the improvements. In addition to this study, a trade area analysis of retail sales was conducted by the University of Maine and Eastern Maine Development Corporation for each town. The analysis indicated steady sales in Dover -Foxcroft. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 74 Chapter 4 - Housing Section 4.1 Hou sing Trends According to the Dover -Foxcroft Tax records there are 1,445 single family homes (includes 57 doublewides), 245 mobile homes, 277 seasonal homes (camps), and 129 multifamily structures (two or more units) (Table 1). The 2012 Census estimate was 407 units in multifamily structures, which if added to these figures results in a total number of housing units for the town of 2,3 74. This figure is 85 units less than the 2010 Census figure of 2,459. It is not uncommon for local numbers and Census figure s not to match, and the discrepancy is likely in the Census. Based on the information in Table 4-1, the increase in the number of new housing units was about 22 units per year between 2000 and 2014. This figure will be used to project future housing growt h. Census data can be used to track trends over time. Dover -Foxcroft had a total of 2,459 housing units for the 2010 Census, which means the total number of housing units increased by 331 units since the 1990 Census. The rate of increase in the number of hous ing units between 1990 and 2010 was 15% for both Dover -Foxcroft and Piscataquis County. This compares to a rate of increase statewide of 22% for the twenty -year period, 1990 to 2010. (Table 4-2) The total number of housing units includes all housing units, including occupied and unoccupied units, year -round and seasonal units, single - family homes, mobile homes and multifamily homes. Number of Households Dover -Foxcroft had a total of 1,773 households for the 2010 Census, which means the total number of households increased by 74 between 1990 and 2010. Between 1990 and 2000 there was a decrease in the number of households of 41, followed by an increase of 1 15 households between 2000 and 2010. The rate of increase in the number of households between 1990 and 2010 was 5% for Dover -Foxcroft, 9% for Piscataquis County, and 19% statewide.

The decrease in average household size (persons per households) can be directly attributed to an increase in single -person households and single - parent households, following state and national trends. Smaller household size means that the demand for housin g will increase faster than the growth in population. The trends affecting household siz e are expected to continue over the next decade, which means that even with no increase in the year -round population, there will still be a need for more housing as a result of smaller household sizes and desires for different types of housing. Section 4. 2 Number of Housing Units Needed for the Future While accurately predicting the number of housing units needed for the future is challenging, it is useful for planning purposes. This analysis suggests the Town should plan for an additional 250 to 350 housi ng units over the next decade , which would be 25 to 35 units per year. This estimate includes all types of housing, and reflects the assumption that the size of the population will remain stable. The estimate is on the high side to assure adequate consider ation for the amount of land area, appropriately zoned to accommodate future housing. Two sets of data are examined to determine how many new housing units will be needed for the next ten years: U.S. Census data and local permitting data. According to Cens us data 311 units of housing were added between 1990 and 2010. The total number of housing units includes occupied year -round units, second homes, camps, and vacant housing. Projected forward this rate of increase in the number of new housing units for the upcoming decade would be 167 units. (Table 4-4) Table 4-4 Dover -Foxcroft: Change in Number of Housing Units Census Year Increase 1990 to 2010 1990 2000 2010 Total Units Units/Year All Housing Units 2,128 2,200 2,459 331 16.6 Source: U.S. Census, 1990, 2000, 2010 Data from property tax records indicate an increase of 22 units per year between 2000 and 2014, which was an increase of 18 units per year of year -round housing and 4 units per year in seasonal housing (Table 4-1). Projected forward for a ten year period, this would suggest the need for 220 new housing units. Section 4.3 Housing Occupancy According to the 2010 Census, 1,773 (72%) of the Town's housing units were occupied year -round, 451 (18%) were for seasonal, recreational or occasional use, and 235 (10%) were other vacant units. Of the 235 vacant units, 70 were for rent, 4 were rented but not occup ied, 53 were for sale, 6 were sold but not occupied, and 102 were other vacant units. (Table 4-5) Countywide, about 42% of housing was used seasonally, recreationally or occasionally, which is not surprising given the rural nature of the area. About 10% of housing in Dover -Foxcroft was vacant, somewhat higher than countywide and statewide (2010 Census). 2.45 2.34 2.39 2.27 2.21 2.34 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis Co.

Owner and Renter -Occupancy About 73% (1,302 units) of Dover -Foxcroft's year -round housing was owner -occupied in 2010 (Table 4-6, Figure 4-4). About 27% (471 units) of the Town's -round housing was renter -occupied. Dover -Foxcroft has proportionately more renter -occupied housing t han countywide but less than statewide, which reflects its role as a regional service center with multifamily housing developments. There were 3,105 people living in the 1,302 owner -occupied housing units for a household size of 2.38 (2010 Census). Ther e were 925 people living in the 471 renter -occupied housing units for an average household size of 1.96 (2010 Census). This suggests that renter -occupied units are more likely to be occupied by people living alone and single -head of household families. Between 2000 and 2010 the proportion of renter -occupied units increased from 24% of occupied housing to 27% of occupied housing. This was the result of an increase of 81 units over the ten year period, whereas there was Table 4 -5 Housing Occupancy (All Housing) Occupancy Status Dover -Foxcroft Comparison for 2010 Percent of Total (2010 Census) 2000 2010 Change 2000 -2010 Housing Units # (% Chg) Dover Units 2,200 2,459 259 (12%) Source: U.S. Census, 2000, 2010 Table 4-6 Housing Tenure, Occupancy Status and Vacancy Rates (Year -round Housing) Occupancy of Year-round Units Dover -Foxcroft Comparison 2000 2010 Chg. 2000 -10 Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis Maine Number of Units #/% Chg.

Between 2000 and 2010 the proportion of owner -occupied housing units decreased from 77% of occupied housing to73% of occupied housing. This change was likely due to the constru ction of new multifamily housing, such as Maine Street Assisted Living (Hubbard's), and new apartments at Foxcroft Academy. Vacancy Rates The 2010 vacancy rate for owner -occupied units was 3.9% (53 units for sale), which suggests there may have been adequ ate choice in housing given slow population growth. In a faster growing community, 3.9% would suggest a tight housing market. The vacancy rate for renter -occupied units was 12.8% (70 units for rent), which might suggest an oversupply of rentals. The rental vacancy rate does not include seasonal, recreational or occasionally -used housing or other vacant units (Table 4-7). These vacancy rates do not consider the type, condition or cost of housing that is for sale or rent, and that may explain why town officia ls indicate there is a shortage of rental housing.

Source: U.S. Bureau of Census, 2010 Section 4.4 Housing Types About 71% of the Town's housing units were single -unit (detached and attached), 15% of units were in multifamily 2 -9 unit structures, 3% of units were in multifamily structures with 10 or more units, and 12% were mobile homes. The most significant change i n housing since 2000 was the addition of 63 units in multifamily structures with 10 or more units. (Table 4-9) The increase in larger multi -unit developments since 2000 is attributable to developments like the Main Street West Assisted Living facility asso ciated with Hibbard Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (14 apartments) Table 4-8 A Comparison of Vacancy Rates, 2010 Type Unit Percentage of Year -round Units Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis Co.

More recent multifamily developments include 22 loft apartments (market rate leases) a t the Mayo Mill and 25 un its of affordable senior housing on Summer Street . Dover -Foxcroft has more multi -unit housing than countywide, which is typical of a service center. The Town also has a higher proportion of mobile homes, perhaps due to the five mobile home parks in Town. Multi -unit developments and mobile home parks are often located on public sewer and water, and are more likely to be developed in communities with these systems. Regarding multi -unit homes, it is not uncommon for larger older homes to be divided into one or more apartments. Sometimes these are accessory a partments designed to bring in more income to the primary resident, or to provide for a relative, such as an elderly person or young adult. The larger multi -unit developments include the following subsidized housing: Thayer Parkway with 56 units; Country M eadows with 24 units; and Riverview Apartments with 32 units. These will be covered in more detail later in this document. Dover -Foxcroft has five mobile home parks within its borders, as listed in the table below.

Some census data is based on a nearl y 100% sample size, while other data is based on a smaller sa mple size. Small sample sizes are less accurate and require greater scrutiny to interpret. Some of the most current data is from th e American Community Survey (ACS) 2008 -2012 5 -year estimates. The ACS 5 -year estimates for rural communities is based on very small samples, and therefore are subject to often -substantial sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown is the 90% margin of error which can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90% probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. This chapter contains ACS 5 -Year estimates for 2010 and/or 2012, depending on which samples have the smallest margins of error.

Many mobile homes in northern Maine pre date safety standards established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1976. According to the 2005 Comprehensive Plan, Dover -Foxcroft's Tax Assessor indicated that although he had not performed a detailed study on this subject, he es timated that more than 50% of mobile homes were built before the HUD standards were enacted. As of the enactment of the Land Use Ordinance (2009) all mobile homes moved into Dover -Foxcroft must meet specified design and safety standards. Section 4.5 Housing Affordability Adequate, affordable housing to a range of household incomes is essential to a healthy community. Changing demographics suggests there will be proportionately more middle -age people and senior citizens in the future, and there will be fewer young adults and children. Housing needs change as the population ages. Middle -age people, often at their peak earning capacity, may want larger homes, especially if they still have children at home. People approaching retirement age or concerned ab out living on a reduced income may want smaller, lower maintenance, more energy efficient housing. Some seniors may want assisted living and, in some cases, nursing home care. People commonly affected by a shortage of affordable housing include senior citi zens on fixed incomes, single parents, first -time home buyers, young families, and grown children seeking independence from parents. In some cases, seniors looking to downsize may be competing with first -time home buyers for smaller homes to purchase, and these same groups may be those seeking rentals. Maine's Growth Management Act requires that towns seek to achieve at least 10% of all housing built or placed during the next de cade be affordable. Affordable housing means decen t, safe and sanitary dwellings , apartments, or other living accommodations for a household whose income does not exceed 80% of the median income. Further, an owner -occupied unit is affordable to a household if its price results in monthly housing costs (mortgage principal and interest, insurance, real estate taxes, and basic utility costs) not ex ceeding 28% to 33% of the household's gross monthly inc ome. A renter -occupied unit is affordable to a household if the unit's monthly housing costs (including rent and basic utility costs) do not exceed 28% to 33% of the household's gross monthly income. Affordable housing types typically include, but are not limited to multifamily housing, rental housing, mobile homes, government assisted housing, group and foster care facilities, and accessory apartments. In addition, decreased unit sizes, smaller lot sizes, increased density, and reduced frontage requirements can contribute to a community's afforda ble housing stock. Home ownership is considered affordable in Dover -Foxcroft, the Dover -Foxcroft Labor Market Area ,35 and Piscataquis County according to Maine Housing. Maine Housing has developed an affordability index which is the ratio of home price aff ordable at median income to median home price (Table 4-11). An affordability index of more than 1.00 means the area is generally affordable - i.e., a household earning area median income could afford the payment on a median priced home (30 year mortgage, t axes and insurance) using no more than 28% of gross income. The price of housing in Dover -Foxcroft is considered affordable based on calculations performed by Maine Housing. A Dover -Foxcroft household with the median household income for the Town ($39,122 ) could afford to purchase a home at the price of $130,836. However, a household would only need to have a household income of $22,875 to afford the home at median sales price ($76,500) in Dover -Foxcroft. Maine Housing also calculated that there were 456 households (26% of all households) in Town that were unable to afford a home at the median price ($76,500). This compares to 27% of households in the Dover -Foxcroft LMA (Table 4-11). 35 See Map 2 Dover -Foxcroft Labor Market Area in the Volume I Appendices. The Hous ing Market area is the same area.

Statewide housing is considered unaffordable because the median household income would only be able to afford to purchase a home at $165,374, al most $5,000 less than the median sales price of $169,900. Figure 4-5, Source: Maine Housing, Maine Housing Facts for Piscataquis County, 2013; See Footnote 3 It is important to note the relationship between population growth and housing affordability. G enerally speaking, in areas where there is little population growth, the demand for housing is less thereby reducing housing prices, and often referred to as a buyers' market. Conversely, in areas with a lot of population growth, the demand for housing inc reases and housing prices increase for a sellers' market. Rental housing in Dover -Foxcroft and the Dover -Foxcroft LMA has been identified as being unaffordable according to the analysis done by Maine Housing (Table 4-12). The rental affordability index is the ratio of the 2 - bedroom rent affordable at the median renter income to the average 2 -bedroom rent. An index of less than 1 means the area is generally unaffordable - i.e., a renter household earning the median rent er income could not cover the cost of an average 2 -bedroom apartment (including utilities using no more than 30% of gross income). The index for Dover -Foxcroft was 0.95 and the index for the Dover -Foxcroft LMA was 0.80. According to Maine Housing's calcul ations for the affordability of rental housing in Dover -Foxcroft, 53% of renter households would not be able to afford the average two -bedroom rental with utilities ($711). Maine Housing 36 Maine Housing's sources of data include the Maine Real Estate Information System, Claritas and the MaineHousing Co.

This compares to 59% of renter households countywide who would not be able to afford the average two bedroom rental with utilities for the county ($705). Subsidized Housing Local, state, and federal governments have a number of subsidized housing programs. In most cases, the efforts of the different levels of government are integrated, with funding and operation and jurisdictional fields overlapping. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the primary federal agency dealing with affordable housing. Part of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), also deals with affordable housing. Maine Housing is the state's agency for such issues and Penquis Community Action Program (PCAP) is the regional agency. The town of Dover -Foxcroft does not have a local housing authority but the town does have a General Assistance Program that is used at times to defray housing and ut ility costs. Subsidized units are built with state or federal funding for the express purpose of providing housing to lower income individuals and families. A housing project or development may consist of all subsidized units, or subsidized units mixed with market rate units. Subsidized units are typically available to individuals below certain income guidelines, and residents are expected to pay a fixed percentage of their income as rent. Housing is also subsidized through certificates and vouchers. Especially when su bsidized units are not available, Maine Housing will provide monies for citizens to use as payment for rent for non -public units. The town is also reimbursed by the state for general assistance money, which may be given to citizens with short -term immediat e needs for housing. Finally, low interest loans through the federal or state governments are also a form of subsidy. 37 Maine Housing's sources of data include the Maine Real Estate Information System, C laritas and the MaineHousing Quarterly Rent Survey.

These forms of assistance are often more expensive than providing actual units, and thus it may be in a community's best interest to facilitate the construction of housing units and/or projects. According to Maine Housing, as of 2011 there were 129 units of subsidized housing in Dover - Foxcroft, which is 23% of the 553 subsidized housing units countywide (Figure 4-7). There are three federally subsidized multifamily housing complexes in Dover - Foxcroft that provide a total of 112 units. Currently, 18 of these units at Riverview Apartments are not subsidized, which means there are actually a total of 94 subsidized units at these facilities. The waiting list for senior units (Thayer) has 50 people on it and the combined waiting list for (Country Meado ws and Riverview) can be as large as 35 people. All of the housing managers indicated there was a need for more subsidized housing in Dover -Foxcroft. Information on each of these is presented in Table 4-13. Based on the number of individuals on the waiting lists, it is quite evident that there is a need for more subsidized housing. A new 25 -unit senior housing complex is currently being developed on Summer Street that will help fill the need.

The ordinance allows higher density housing, including multifam ily structures and mobile home parks, in areas served by sewer and water. Accessory apartments are allowed in all districts where residential uses are allowed. Multifamily housing and mobile home parks are also permitted in some rural districts. Clustered subdivision development is also permitted. Single -family mobile homes and manufactured housing are treated the same as stick -built housing and generally allowed throughout the Town. Community living arrangements, nursing homes, and convalescent facilities, and planned units developments (mixed use) are also allowed in several districts. Road frontage, lot width, building setback, maximum lot coverage, and maximum building height are dimensional standards that can affect the cost of housing. The dimensional requirements in Dover -Foxcroft's ordinance are not overly constraining to the development of affordable housing. In the future, the Town may want to consider amendments to the LUO to allow higher densities and more flexibility in the village district, suc h as small and larger scale mixed -use development (second story accessory apartments above commercial uses, redevelopment of existing structures, etc.). Also, the Town should review the ordinance to accommodate senior housing alternatives, such as assisted living arrangements. Lastly, the Town began administering the Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code (MUBEC) on July 1, 2012. Dover -Foxcroft is one of the few communities within the immediate region that is required to administer the Code because it has a population of over 4,000 and. The concern is that it is perceived as being unfair, and may be driving up the cost of building or renovating a home, and discouraging people from living and/or investing in residential properties in Dover -Foxcroft. Section 4.6 Housing Conditions The overall age of a community's housing stock is an indicator of housing condi - tions. Older hou sing often requires more upkeep, and may need new wiring, winterization and lead paint remedia tion, which together raise health and safety concerns. Septic systems may also need to be repaired or replaced. These homes are more likely to be deteriorating and, therefore, depreciating in value, or requiring extensive rehabilitation before becoming mar ketable. This can negatively affect surrounding home values within a neighborhood. Dover -Foxcroft's housing on average is older than countywide and statewide. More than 40% of Dover -Foxcroft's housing stock was built prior to 1939, compared with almost 31 % countywide and 29% statewide for the 2000 Census . Census data for 2011 suggests Dover -Foxcroft continues to have an older housing stock than countywide and statewide (Table 4-15).

Most of Dover -Foxcroft's renter -occupied housing was constructed after 1940, and similar to countywide and statewide over 50% of renter -occupied housing was built after 1960. A numbe r of the units built af ter 1960 may be located in the T own's multi -family housing developments. Census data suggest that very few structures lack indoor plumbing and complete kitchen facilities, which are other indicators of housing conditions. Initiatives to Improve the Housing Conditions Dover -Foxcroft has undertaken two housing rehabilitation projects since the year 2000. The first was housing program utilized a 2003 Community Development Block Grant of about $301,400 and the second was 2010 Community De velopment Block Grant of $250,000. It appears the first was rehabilitation of a number of units around Town, while the second was pass -through funding to the Charlotte White Center and Penquis Mental Health to rehabilitate and weatherize housing associated with their facilities and/or clients. The last housing study to evaluate housing conditions and needs for Dover -Foxcroft was performed in 2001, and was the basis for obtaining the 2003 Community Development Block Grant. Given the age of Dover -Foxcroft's housing stock, it may be time to reevaluate housing conditions, particularly weatherization and heating needs. There are a number of government programs available towns and individuals for housing assistance. Funding levels and eligibility criteria can ch ange from year to year so the following is a general description of these programs with websites links . Maine Community Development Block Grants (CDBG): Maine's CDBG program is administered by the Office of Community Development within the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development . The agency works with municipalities, regional partnerships and non -profit groups to meet a broad array of economic and community development needs . The Housing Assistance Grant Program provides funding to address housing problems of low and moderate -income persons. Eligible activities are those directly related to assisting or creating residential housing units including acquisition, code enforcement, conversion of non -residential structure s, demolition, historic preservation, housing rehabilitation, new housing construction, relocation assistance, and removal of architectural barriers. See www.mai ne.gov/decd/meocd/cdbg Maine Housing Programs: Maine Housing (Maine State Housing Authority) h as programs that provide funding and assistance to homeowners, first -time home purchasers, renters, homeless people, developers, subsidized housing owners/ managers, non -profits and government entities. See www.mainehousing.org Penquis: Based in Bangor bu t with an office in Dover -Foxcroft, is a public agency whose mission is to assist individuals and families in preventing, reducing, or eliminating poverty. Penquis primarily serves low and moderate -income individuals in Penobscot, Piscataquis, and Knox Cou nties. Penquis offers many services related to housing, such as home loans, heating and utility assistance, subsidized housing, housing rehabilitation, weatherization, and lead and radon testing. Some services are based on income eligibility, while others are offered on a sliding scale fee and fee for service. Penquis also assists towns in applications for housing -related projects, such as the CDBG Housing grants mentioned previously. See: www.penquis.org Maine Small Community Grant Program (SCG) for Septi c System Upgrades: By participating in the Maine Department of Environmental Protection's Small Community Grant Program towns can assist homeowners and small businesses in obtaining grants to replace malfunctioning septic systems that are polluting water b odies or causing a public nuisance. Individual families may qualify if their federal taxable income for the previous year was $40,000 or less. Commercial establishments may qualify if their gross profit for the previous year was $100,000 or less.

First settled in the opening decade of the19th century, the two towns soon attracted craftsmen such as blacksmiths, tanners, harness -makers, boot and shoe -makers, carpenters and brick and stone masons to meet the immediate needs of the agriculturist inhabitants. Little of the products of those craftsmen were destined for customers outside of the towns. Agricultural produce, chiefly grains and cattle, constituted the major revenue producers beyond subsistence needs. But the abundant supply of timber on the hills surroundi ng the Piscataquis River constituted an important export commodity, with the river providing the power to operate sawmills at places where an adequate head could be created by damming. It is interesting to note that the town of Foxcroft, when first laid o ut, was to be centered at the intersection of a projected East -West road connecting Guilford and Milo with a North -South road from the river bank to the shores of Sebec Lake. This intersection, some two and a half miles north of the river, thus emphasized the agricultural intent of the early proprietors. Dover, on the other hand, appears from the beginning to have been designed to capitalize on the economic benefit of the river, hence one of its focuses was on the southern (right) bank of the Piscataquis wh ere the river ran through rapids, with other centers at another rapids site on Black Stream (Dover South Mills) and a rapids lower down the river (East Dover). Furthermore, with Dover designated the shire town of newly -formed Piscataquis County in 1838, bu siness interests were attracted to that side of the river. Hence the population and commercial/ industrial center of gravity tended towards Dover with Foxcroft initially acting as a kind of an agrarian raw materials source and a \"bedroom\" for workers emplo yed on the Dover side of the common boundary. Thus, until the merger of the two towns in 1922, Dover seems always to have been the dominant neighbor. Early manufacturing in the two towns devolved around the use of waterpower for the production of lumber a nd woolen cloth, with iron and leather goods production as ancillaries to those two enterprises. However, the cost of land transportation militated against large -scale industrial development. The Piscataquis River experiences extremes of water flow and hen ce was not a dependable means of moving goods, save for logs, to a wider market. Instead, overland transport in the form of oxcarts constituted the main means of bringing raw wool into and the finished textiles and wood products out of the towns. It was no t until railroads were extended to the towns in 1869 and 1884 that the economic \"boom\" of Dover and Foxcroft came. In the former year, a rail line linked Foxcroft to the seaport of Bangor on the Penobscot River. The latter year saw the towns linked to the Maine Central Railroad, the chief Maine rail arterial via Newport. With these rail lines completed, the stage was set for major industrial development. In the meantime, Dover and Foxcroft had become significant way stations for vacationers and business tr avelers into the deeper interior of the State. Henry David Thoreau's account of his adventures in the Maine woods whetted the appetite of city -dwellers for the great outdoors experience. The development of other communities in the region brought hundreds o f commercial \"drummers\" through the towns yearly. Thus, in their heyday, the twin towns boasted three large hotels that served as stop - over posts for travelers to Greenville and upper Piscataquis County from points South and East. The addition of rail con nections and the development of recreational resources in and around the towns turned them into places to stay as well as waypoints. Sebec Lake drew \"summer people\" and regular steamboat traffic facilitated the needs of vacationing \"rusticators\" who stayed at the several \"camps\" along the lake shore, while a large racetrack brought many day visitors during the racing season. 38 Source: By John F. Battick, Ph.D., Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan, 2005 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 86 Textiles became the more important industry in the towns with an abundant supply of raw wool provided by area sheep farmers. The init ial investment in textile mills appears to have come from other Maine towns. Capitalists brought their money and incentives to the Piscataquis Valley, built the mills and settled down. In the 19th century, some woolen mills passed from generation to genera tion within families, with mergers and buy - outs occasionally occurring. The abundant supply of good hardwood timber also encouraged other lines of manufacture. When the textile mills turned to the production of yarns and thread a large spool mill came into being. The raw material for millions of wooden spools was cut and sawed locally and hauled by cart to the spool mill in Foxcroft. At the same time, a small factory went up to build decorated hardwood piano and organ cases around actions and pipe boards br ought in from away. Eventually the instruments were built totally in Foxcroft and shipped all over the world. For a period in the late 19th century and into the 20th, seasonal work was found at a cannery from whence locally grown vegetables, principally co rn, were shipped to the rest of the country. Evidence of the importance of agriculture to the communities at that time is the existence of photographs that show miles of open fields stretching over the hills surrounding the towns. The occasional failure o f the streams and rivers to provide the necessary power for the mills saw a shift to coal as fuel for steam -driven machinery while demand for local produce provided return cargoes for train -loads of coal. Mills, which theretofore could operate successfully at some distance from the rail lines, began to close down. Only overgrown dam abutments and penstocks indicate the centers of once flourishing villages away from the center of the towns. Many tons of apples, as well as vast quantities of bolt wood for pap er mills passed through the towns via the railroads. So frequent and dependable was rail traffic that many citizens of employment as far away as Bangor, taking the morning train \"down\" and the evening train \"home.\" Through the First World War, life in Dov er and Foxcroft was busy, lively and pleasant for their inhabitants. Outside events - economic \"panics,\" international crises, wars - affected the towns only slightly, buffered as they were by distance and seemingly insatiable demands of a growing American nation for all sorts of goods and produce. But the picture changed after the Great War. Locally owned mills were bought up by large corporations which initially integrated them into their broad regional and national operations. Then, when the economic pinch came in the Great Depression, these branches of the great corporations were shut down or were sold off to new and not always successful enterprises. With those shut -downs went employment opportunities as well as regular traffic on the railroads as local demand for coal declined and the market for locally produced goods and produce shrank. Regular passenger traffic by rail ended in 1932 and only freight trains thereafter carried produce, mainly lumber and bolt wood out of the towns. As farming declined, t he trees moved back in, clothing the once open hills with second growth timber, now the major \"agricultural\" resource of the area. The advent of the private auto and the marketing practices of other areas saw vacationers seek other places of recreation. Th e great wooden hotels closed and were razed and even the through traffic to the Greenville area stops in Dover - Foxcroft only for supplies, food and gas. The lakeshore \"camps\" are gone, replaced by a marvelous state park. Furniture manufacture and leather tanning moved into the major mill sites and, for a while, a clothing company with a worldwide market brought jobs and prosperity once again after the Second World War. But a dramatic rise in energy costs in the 1970s, meaning that truck transportation over the highways became too expensive for plants far from distribution and sale points, the shift of manufacturing to the cheaper labor markets of the South and then abroad, saw economic opportunity in manufacturing shrink. Laid -off workers had either to comm ute long distances to work or relocate closer to those cities where employment was available. At present, there exist two traditional industries in the town, one in lumber and another in non -traditional manufacturing, electrical technology. Several small companies specializing in handicrafts, in wood and ceramics, and dozens of small home -based craftspersons provide goods for the tourist market and elsewhere. The greatest growth in the immediate past and present is in the service sector: retail sales and s ocial services, including health care.

The Commission has identified three types of historic and archaeological resources to be considered in comprehensive planning: (1) Historic Buildings/Structures/Objects (buildings and other above ground structures and ob jects ); (2) Historic Archaeological (mo stly European -American after written historic records, 1600 A.D.); and (3) Prehistoric Archaeological (Native American resources, before European arrival). Historic Buildings, Structures, and Objects The MHPC maintains an inventory of important sites including buildings or sites on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The following locations are currently listed in the National Register for Dover -Foxcroft as of October 2014: James Sullivan Wiley House (148 E. Main Street) Chandler -Parsons Blacksmith Shop (105 Dawes Road) Walter and Eva Burgess Farm (283 Shaw Road) (Burnt to ground in 2014) Observer Building (117 East Main Street) American Woolen Company Foxcroft Mill (East Main Street)39 Based on preliminary survey data, MHPC has identified the following properties that may also be eligible for listing in the National Register: Piscataquis County Courthouse Former Maine Central Railroad Trestle, over Piscataquis River Farmstead (849 Range Road) U.S. Post Office (corner of North and Summer streets) West Main Street Historic District ( See Map 4 in the Volume I Appendices ) The 2005 Comprehensive Plan also identified Center Theater and former Newberry's Block as eligible for listing. MHPC recommends that a comprehensive survey of Dove r-Foxcroft's historic above -ground resources needs to be conducted in order to identify other properties which may be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. 39 Riverfront Redevelopment project, Arnold Development, former Moosehead Manufacturing. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 88 The 2005 Comprehensive Plan list ed many other sites that contribute to the history and character of the town . These include the following: West Main Street from the Congregational Church to the Hospital Kimball's Store and Home (206 E Main Street) Lincoln Street Foxcroft Academy (845 West Main Street) Central Hall (East Main Street) Blethen House (Since been demolished) The Old Bank Building (118 E Maine Street) Brown's Mill (109 Vaughn Road) Dr. Forbes' Office (8 Monument Sq .) - (Dr. Clark's Dental Office) Bob's Hardware (15 Lincoln St)/Hayes Law Office (5 Lincoln Street) Soldiers' Monument (Monument Square) Thompson Free Library (186 East Main Street) Philip Weatherbee's House (1 Davis Street) Old Engine House and Turntable on Summer Street (demolished) Barbara Goodwin's House (14 Park Str eet) Foodmill Building, old potato barn (Bear's Den) Evans House (corner of Court and Pleasant Streets) Old Livery Stable behind Prouty's Elmer Glover House (37 Spring Street) Hopkins Block (Old Brick Building in Front of Light at South Street) Edes house (2 Edes Avenue) Congregational Church (824 West Main Street) Gilman Farm (Anderson Road) Baptist Church (146 E Main Street) Seth Spaulding House (320 Pine Street) Methodist Church (156 E Main Street) Samuel Chamberlain Home (157 Dawes R oad) Universalist Church (21 Pleasant Street) Lee House (826 East Main Street) Merrick Sq .

Lougee House (252 E Main Street) Lodge at Greeley's Landing (9 60 Greeley's Landing Road) Charles Woodbury House (410 Essex Street) Houses near Public Access on Branns Mill Pond Archaeological Resources Archaeological resources are those found underground, and are locations where there has been prior ex istence of human beings including structures, artifacts, terrain features, graphics, or remains of plants and animals associated with human habitation. There are two types: Historic Archeological resources and Prehistoric Archaeological resources. Historic Archaeol ogical Sites Historic archaeological resources are those associ ated with the earliest European settlers, and sites may include cellar holes from houses, foundations for farm buildings, mills, wharves and boat yards, as well as shipwrecks. The MHPC has no t documented any historic archaeological sites within Dover -Foxcroft as of October 2014. MHPC indicated that no professional surveys for historic archaeological sites have been conducted in Dover - Foxcroft, and suggested that future work should focus on the identification of potentially significant resources associated with the town's agricultural, residential, and industrial heritage, particularly those associated with the earliest Euro -American settlement of the town in the 18th and 19th centuries. Prehist oric Archaeological Sites Prehistoric archaeological resources are those associated with Native Americans, and generally date prior to 1600s. They include camp or village locations, rock quarries and workshops, and petroglyphs or rock carvings. Except for the sites of Maine's earliest known inhabitants (Paleoindians - at the end of the last ice age), most archaeological sites are found along water bodies. There are four known prehistoric archaeological sites located within Dover -Foxcroft as of September 2 014, according to the MHPC. Two of the sites are located on the north bank of the Piscataquis River downstream from the urban area of Dover -Foxcroft. The other two sites are located on the shores of Sebec Lake. MHPC indicates that professional archaeologic al surveys in Dover -Foxcroft have been very limited, so there are probably many more sites in river alluvium. In particular, the Piscataquis River valley, and various lake Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 89 shorelines, should be surveyed. The shore of Black Stream and Alder Stream may also contain significant prehistoric archaeological resources. MHPC has mapped \"archaeologically sensitive areas\" for prehistoric sites. Prehistoric archaeological site sensitivity maps are based on the current understanding of Native American settlement patterns. Most commonly, prehistoric archaeological sites are located within 50 meters of canoe -navigable water, on relatively well-drained, level landforms. Some of the most ancient sites (>10,000 years old) are located on sandy soils within 200 meters of small (non canoe -navigable) streams. Where professional archaeological survey is not complete, archaeological sensitivity maps are based on water shoreline, surficial geology, and landform. The Historic and Archaeological Resources Map displays the genera l location of the four sites identified above and areas identified as sensitive for Native American archaeology. Cemeteries Cemeteries are also a cultural resource providing insight into the history of the community. An inventory of Dover -Foxcroft cemeter ies are listed below. The Town has a reasonably comprehensive computerized index of names of most of the people in the cemeteries. South Dover Cemetery (Bangor Road) Lee Yard (Lee Cemetery Road) Dover Cemetery (Vaughn Road) Parson's Landing Cemetery (Pa rsons Landing Road) Rural Grove Cemetery (West Main Street) Foxcroft Center/ Steadmans Landing Cemetery (Steadman's Landing Road) Gray Yard (West Main Street) Boss Yard (Anderson Road) Pine Grove Cemetery (French Road) McAllister Cemetery (Dexter Road) East Dover Cemetery (East Dover Road) Section 5.3 Dover -Foxcroft Historical Society The Dover -Foxcroft Historical Society was founded in October 1963, incorporated in 1995 and designated a non - profit organization in 1996. It maintains two museums, The Blacksmith Shop Museum and the Observer Building Museum. Both museums are on the Nationa l Register of Historic Places. The Observer Building on Union Square was constructed in 1854 as a tenement. It was converted to mixed residential and business uses later and given to the Society in 1998. It is a unique \"flat -iron\" timber frame structure w ith an unusual peaked roof. It is structurally sound and necessary repairs are done as funding is obtained. The building lacks proper climate control, but a secure room has been designated the archives room and will be made archives -friendly upon recommend ation of a consultant and the receipt of funding for that purpose. The Museum is open in the summer for about twelve hours per week and for special occasions. When open, hosts are in attendance and are prepared to conduct tours of the building and provide background information to visitors. Permanent exhibits include a complete barber shop, a dentist's operating room, and a physician's office, all associated with local practitioners and artifacts associated with the Piscataquis Observer newspaper and publi shing activities. Display cases contain exhibits which area changed on an annual basis to attract return visits. The walls display many photographs of school groups, manufacturing plants, significant events and individual townspersons. The staff of this mu seum is made up of all volunteers and members of the Historical Society, who give their time freely to maintain and interpret this valuable depository of local history and culture. The collections consist of over an estimated ten -thousand pages of paper d ocuments alone, some two hundred books, thousands of photographs, numerous textiles, and mechanical artifacts, including two large jobbing presses left behind by the previous owners, The Observer Publishing Company, as well as articles of furniture and oth er memorabilia. The paper documents include very early town, school board, and church records, files of tax receipts, a few volumes of county commissioners' records, the records of many social and fraternal organizations, printed annual school reports and high school yearbooks, copies of very early newspapers, Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 90 personal diaries, and letters, business accounts, mixed media scrapbooks, typed and holograph manuscripts of town and church histories, several typescripts of articles by historian John Francis Spragu e (a notable townsman), and a great number of miscellaneous ephemera. These items were acquired through donations by local residents and custodial depository by town and county institutions. The town, school and county records have been transferred to the Historical Society from the Thompson Memorial Library because the Library at the time did not wish to have the responsibility to keep and preserve all of these old documents. The society has formally agreed with the town to act as depository and to serve as consultant to the town in matters of local history and has been so stated within this comprehensive plan. The local postmaster has also given to the museum original copies of the records of the construction and decoration of the post office building, a 1930s WPS project, together with records of early rural free delivery postal routes. While the museum is ordinarily open to the public on a limited basis, anyone seeking access to official records can apply to the curators or the president of the society t o gain admittance by appointment. The photographic collection consists of thousands of portraits, town views, and records of local events taken by resident professional photographers as well as snapshots by citizens. Prize photos in the collection are fou r original Matthew Brady portraits of local citizens in their Civil War uniforms. When the Society acquired the building, most of the archived photographs of the Piscataquis Observer weekly newspaper from the 1940's onward were left and constitute another class of records. The collection thus constitutes a major archive for the town's history and is so recognized by town government. By the nature of many of the documents in the collection, genealogists might find valuable information for their research. Up on completion of cataloging and proper storage, the society will make the collections fully open to researchers. It is planned to have some of the more significant series microfilmed. The catalog will be placed on CD's as finding aids via an up -to-date des ktop computer recently donated to the society. The Blacksmith Shop Museum (the former Chandler -Parsons Blacksmith Shop) is located on the Dawes Road, a little less than two miles from the center of the town. The structure was built in 1863 and was acquire d by the Historical Society in 1964. The restoration of the structure was its first major undertaking. It houses a collection of blacksmithing, farming, and general tools and conveyances, for example a so -called \"Kick -sled\" manufactured in the area. The or iginal forge is in the building. The museum is open almost daily in the summer for unescorted visitation. The building is maintained by a curator whose home is adjacent to the property. As repairs are needed the historical society seeks and administers fun ding from the public and from organizations specializing in such matters. The Dover -Foxcroft Historical Society is totally self -supporting and receives no direct aid from the town. Its operation expenses are paid by income derived solely from membership d ues, contributions, as well as generous support from local businesses and visitors. The Historical Society is currently working with the Congregational Church and Foxcroft Academy to preserve, catalog, index, and display (some on the internet) their recor ds. The Historical Society would like to do the same with other churches and organizations in the community. The Historical Society is also coordinating with the Thompson Free Library to microfilm and to put up on the Internet all of the past issues of the Piscataquis Observer (1838 to present). A major project for the Historical Society is the preservation and reuse of Central Hall. The project began in 2010 when the building was no longer being used as the town office building. The Society is working in p artnership with the Town of Dover -Foxcroft, the Maine Highlands Senior Center, Charlotte White, Eastern Area Agency on Aging and a host of other local organizations on this project. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 91 Section 5.4 Protection for Significant Historic and Archaeological Resourc es The most significant threat to historic and archaeological sites is that they will be altered in ways that destroy their integrity and value. Historic structures may be demolished or renovated in ways that destroy important architectural features. Arch aeological sites may be destroyed by excavation or construction prior to any investigation into their significance and archaeological value. In some instances increased flooding due to climate change may be a threat to resources located near or on floodpla ins. There are a number of regulatory and non -regulatory approaches communities can use to enhance protection for significant historic and archaeological resources. Dover -Foxcroft has utilized a number of these approaches. Regulatory Protection for Signifi cant Historic and Archaeological Resources Dover -Foxcroft has adopted regulations that provide consideration for historic and archaeological resources. The Town's Land Use Ordinance encourages protection for historic structures if they are located within the designated Historic District, which inclu des much of the in -town areas (see text box and Map 4 in the Volume I Appendices ). The T own's Shoreland Zoning, Floodplain and Subdivision regulations also provide consideration for important historic and archaeological resources, particularly if the site or structure is eligible to be listed, or listed on the National Register of Historic Places.40 There are regulatory gaps where important historic and archaeological resources may not be considered, such as when the proposed activity does not fall under o ne of the town's regulations. Also, the regulations allow considerable latitude in how the regulations are interpreted by the permitting authority through use of language such as the Subdivision Ordinance \"Will not have an undue adverse effect on the sceni c or natural beauty of the area, aesthetics, historic sites, ...\"; and the Shoreland Zoning text \"In determining that no greater adverse impact will occur, the Planning Board shall require written documentation from the applicant, regarding the probable effe cts on ..., archaeological and historic resources, and ....\" MHPC recommends that towns establish a mechanism for review of all construction or other ground disturbing activity within archaeologically \"sensitive\" areas (mapped) or adjacent to or including know n archaeological sites. This mechanism might include contacting MHPC for an opinion, and/or review of the construction area by an MHPC -approved archaeologist. Ordinances might contain language, such as: \"If there are archaeological sites within or adjacent to the proposed development which are either listed in or eligible to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, or the proposed development is within or adjacent to an area designated as archaeologically sensitive or potentially containing su ch sites, as determined by the town or the MHPC, an appropriate archaeological survey shall be conducted.\" MHPC also suggests the following wording: \"If one or more National Register eligible or listed archaeological sites will suffer adverse impact, appro priate mitigation measures shall be proposed in the subdivision plan, and submitted for comment to the MHPC at least 20 days prior to action being scheduled by the Planning Board.\" 40 Maine's subdivisions statute (30 -A MR SA 4401 -4407) recommends review of impact on \"historic sites\" (Section 4404(8)), which includes both National Register listed and eligible buildings and archaeological sites. Maine's Shoreland Zoning statute (38 MRSA 435 -449) includes, as one of its purpos es, \"protect archaeological and historic resources\" (Section 435). Land Use Ordinance, Section 4.3 Review Criteria for developments includes the following: B. Preservation of Historic Structures: For any applications located within the Historic District, the Planning Board sh all consider comments received from the Historical Review Committee prior to rendering a decision on the application and shall require that historic resources be protected to the maximum extent possible in accordance with the Committees recommendations. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 92 Education, Incentives and Advocacy for Protection of Historic and Archaeolo gical Resources41 Considerable protection for historic and archaeological resources can occur though the Historical Society's educational and promotional efforts. The establishment of the Historic District enhances appreciation for historic resources including of the value of these features for quality of life and prosperity purposes. Another mechanism is continuing efforts to encourage owners of significant historic and archaeological sites to seek National Register of Historic Places listing. A numbe r of potentially eligible properties, including a farmstead, several public buildings, the former Maine Central Railroad Trestle, and a West Maine Street Historic District have been identified by the MHPC. Some of the benefits to owners of \"certified\" hist oric structures or districts include access to technical assistance and grants for preservation activities, and access to federal historic preservation investment tax credits for income -producing properties. The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program encourages private sector investment in the rehabilitation and re -use of historic buildings. A 20% income tax credit is available for the rehabilitation of historic, income -producing buildings that are \"certified historic structures.\" This tax cre dit was utilized in the riverfront redevelopment project (Mayo Mill). A 10% tax credit is available for the rehabilitation of non -historic buildings placed in service before 1936. The building must be rehabilitated for non -residential use, and rehabilitati on must meet specific preservation criteria. There are also tax benefits for historic preservation easements, which consists of a voluntary legal agreement, typically in the form of a deed that permanently protects an historic property. Through the easeme nt, a property owner places restrictions on the development of or changes to the historic property, then transfers these restrictions to a preservation or conservation organization. A historic property owner who donates an easement may be eligible for tax benefits, such as a Federal income tax deduction. 41 More information on grants, tax incentives and other programs can be found at the Maine Historic Preservation Commission's web site: http://www. maine.gov/mhpc Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 93 Chapter 6 - Water Resources Section 6.1 Groundwater Resources and Drinking Water Supplies Dover -Foxcroft's drinking water supplies include the public water supply system through the Dover -Foxcroft Water District, several small non -community public water supplies, and individual dug or drilled wells. The water source for the Dover -Foxcroft Water District is Salmon Pond in Guildford. Groundwater resources are either bedrock aquifers or sand and gravel aquif ers. A bedrock aquifer is generally adequate for small yields. A sand and gravel aquifer is a deposit of coarse -grained surface materials that, in all probability, can supply large volumes of groundwater. The Maine Geological Survey (MGS) has mapped signif icant sand and gravel aquifers in Dover -Foxcroft. Significant sand and gravel aquifers have yields that might be suitable for public water supplies or for uses that require significant quantities of water. MGS has identified a band of significant aquifers in the south western part of the Town that extend along portions of Black Stream, including in Sangerville, southward to and including Branns Mill Pond and extending into Garland (See Map 5 Water Resources in the Volume I Appendices ). These aquifers have p redicted yields between 10 and 50 gallons per minute. The mapped areas represent the principal groundwater recharge sites. Recharge is the process of precipitation filtering through the soil to replenish the groundwater. The recharge area in reality probab ly extends beyond the mapped area of each aquifer. While the State has not mapped bedrock aquifers in Dover -Foxcroft, it is likely that most homes with wells rely on bedrock aquifers. It has been roughly estimated that 70% of homes with private wells in Ma ine are served by bedrock aquifers. Public Drinking Water Systems A public water system is defined by state and federal statute as one that serves 25 or more people for 60 or more days per year. There are three types: Community water systems that serve peo ple in their place of residence. The Dover -Foxcroft Water District is a community water system. Non -transient non -community water systems that serve schools, office buildings, etc. Transient non -community water systems that serve a constantly changing, tr ansient population, such as those associated with motels, restaurants and campgrounds. Dover -Foxcroft's community water system is owned and operated by the Dover -Foxcroft Water District and serves the urban area of Dover -Foxcroft. The water source for the system is Salmon Pond located in Gilford. There is considerable protection for the community water supply: the Water District owns most of the land around Salmon Pond; motorized vehicles, swimming and fishing are prohibited on the pond; and there are limitations on timber harvesting on the land around the pond. (See Chapter 8 on Community Facilities and Services for more information about the Dover -Foxcroft Water District) Maine's Drinking Water Program lists the following non -community public water suppl ies: Charlotte White Center (non -transient, non -community system) Foxcroft Golf Club (transient system) Maine Department of Conservation Peaks Kenny State Park (two sites - transient)*42 Town of Dover -Foxcroft well at the beach (transient) 42 The Maine Drinking Water Program lists both wells as being located within Dover -Foxcroft, however, their mapped information shows that only one is in Dover -Foxcroft. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 94 Maine's Drinkin g Water Program (DWP) is responsible for completing an assessment for each public water supply source and publishing the results for the benefit of the operators of each system and their customers. The responsibility for protecting public water supply sour ces from contamination falls largely to public water suppliers. However, land use decisions are made by municipal officials, not water suppliers. This means that protection of public water supplies requires a partnership between water suppliers, state and federal regulators, local land owners, and municipalities. Table 6-1 summarizes the Drinking Water Program's evaluation of the risks of contamination to non -community public water supplies. The risk of chronic contamination is only evaluated for non -trans ient systems, such as the Charlotte White Center. The Drinking Water Program lists the Foxcroft Golf Club as a transient public water supply, but does not have any data on that system.

Potential source of pathogens or nitrates, lea ch fields, manure pile s/spreading, barnyards , livestock. ** Chronic Contamination - contaminant can pose a health risk if consumed (even at very low doses) over many years. Potential source of chemical contaminants (i.e., leaking fuel storage tanks, landfi lls, industrial waste disposal) Source: Maine Drinking Water Program, 2014 Protection for Public Water Supplies and Groundwater Resources Federal and state (Public Law 761) regulations require that owners of these public water supplies take steps to prot ect them. In general, the source protection area around non -community supplies is 300 feet. There are several state laws, including the state plumbing code, that address the location of potential threats to these water supplies. Further, public water suppl iers must be notified of certain activities occurring on nearby properties. These activities include automobile graveyards, recycling businesses, junkyards, septic system expansions or replacements, activities requiring a Maine Natural Resource Pro tection Act Permit or a State Stormwater Permit, subdivisions, and other land use projects. In general, in any situation where a permit is required, any nearby public water suppliers should be notified of the project. The Town's land use regulations should requir e this type of notification. Almost all groundwater contamination in Maine originates from non -point source pollution, rather than point source pollution. Most important non -point contamination sources include: agriculture, hazardous waste spills, landfill s, petroleum products and leaking underground storage tanks, road -salt storage and application, septic Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 95 systems, shallow well injection, and waste lagoons. In addition to these major sources, things as diverse as golf courses, cemeteries, dry cleaners, burn ed buildings, and automobile service stations are also potential threats to groundwater. It is important to protect groundwater from pollution and depletion. Once groundwater is contaminated, it is difficult, if not impossible, to clean. Contamination can eventually spread from groundwater to surface water and vice versa. Thus, it is important to take measures to prevent contamination before it occurs. Locally administered regulations that provide protection for groundwater resources include the Maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules and plumbing code, and the Town's other land use regulations including shoreland zoning, subdivision regulation and the land use ordinance. The state -mandated shoreland zoning and subdivision standards include review crite ria that clearly require protection for groundwater resources and water supplies. Similar criteria could be added to the land use ordinance to provide more complete protection of these resources. Section 6.2 Surface Water Resources Dover -Foxcroft has an abundance of surface water resources, and in general, water quality is very good because of the community's rural nature and significant amount of forested land cove. Undisturbed forest is about the least polluting form of land cover in terms of nutrients and sediments lost to surface waters. Sediment is usually the single greatest pollutant by volume in most watersheds. Roadside runoff, gravel pit runoff and stream bank erosion are major contributors of sediment to surface waters. Roa d crossings (bridges and culverts) can also contribute significant amounts of polluted runoff to streams. Other threats to water quality include nutrients and pathogens from improperly maintained septic systems; pathogens, nu trients, sediment and toxic substances, such as heavy metals from storm water runoff from developments; landfills; salt storage sites; underground storage tanks; hazardous materials spills; and litter. Timber harvesting and agricultural activities can also impact water quality. Timb er harvesting activities, such as the layout of roads and skid trails, location of landings and stream crossings, can contribute to water quality problems, particularly when these activities are conducted on steep slopes. Most non -point source pollu tion from agricultural activities (barnyard runoff, eroding farmland, fertilizers, etc.) occurs during the fall, winter and spring when the ground is frozen. Watersheds A watershed is defined as a geographic region within which water drains into a particular r iver, stream or body of water. Including hills, lowlands, and the body of water into which the land drains. Approximately 50% of the land area in Maine is located in a lake watershed. An understanding of the Town's watersheds is important when considering surface water quality, particu larly the water quality of lakes, which can be negatively impacted by activities within the wa tershed. Surface waters and t heir watersheds are displayed on Map 5 Water Resources in the Volume I Appendices . Dover -Foxcroft li es within the Penobscot River Basin. There are two watersheds within the Town: the Piscataquis River watershed and the Sebec River watershed. The Sebec River Watershed includes Sebec Lake, Cotton Brook, Bog Brook and several other small tributaries. The Piscataquis River Watershed includes Snow's Pond, Thompson Pond, Dunham Pond, Garland Pond, Branns Mill Pond, Merrill Brook , Dunham Brook , Black Stream , Hanson Brook , Alder Stream , Hall Brook and several other smal l streams. Water Quality Classification Maine has four water quality classes of rivers and streams: AA, A, B, and C (38 MRSA \u00a7 465). Each classification assigns designated uses and water quality criteria, and may place specific restrictions on certain acti vities such that the goal conditions of each class may be attained. There is actually not much difference between the uses Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 96 or the qualities of the various classes because all attain the minimum fishable -swimmable standards of the federal Clean Water Act. M ost sup port the same set of designated uses with modest variations. The classification system is really a hierarchy of risk, more than one of use or quality, the risk being the possibility of a breakdown of the ecosystem and loss of use due to either natu ral or human -caused events. Ecosystems that are more natural can be expected to be more resilient to a new stress and to show more rapid recovery. Classes AA (rivers and streams) and GPA (lakes and ponds) involve less risk since activities, such as waste discharges and impoundments are prohibited. Class A waters allow impound ments and very restricted discharges, so the risk of degradation, while small, does increase since there is some human intervention. Class B rivers and streams have fewer restrictions on activities but still attempt to maintain high water quality criteria. Class C has the least restrictions on use and the lowest (but not low) water quality criteria. Class C waters are still good quality, but the margin for error before significant degr adation might occur in the event of an additional stress being introduced (such as a spill or a drought) is the least. See Table 6-2. Table 6-2 Maine's Water Quality Classification System for Rivers and Streams Class Designated Uses Dissolved Oxygen Bacteria ( E. coli ) Habitat Aquatic Life (Biological) Narrative Criteria** Class AA Aquatic life; drinking water; fishing; recreation As naturally occurs As naturally occurs Free flowing and natural No direct discharge of pollutants; as naturally occurs ** Class A Aquatic life; drinking 75% saturation As naturally occurs Natural As naturally occurs ** Class B Aquatic life; drinking water; or 236/100 ml (inst. *) Unimpaired Discharges shall not cause adverse impact to aquatic life - receiving wate rs shall be of sufficient quality to support all indigenous aquatic species without detrimental changes to the resident biological community. ** Class C Aquatic life; drinking water; ml (g.m. *) or 236/100 ml (inst. *) Habitat for fish and other aquatic life Discharges may cause some changes to aquatic life, provided the receiving waters shall be of sufficient quality to support all indigenous fish species, and maintain the structure and function of the resident biological community.** * \"g.m.\" means geometric mean and \"inst.\" means instantaneous level **Numeric biocriteria in Maine Rule Chapter 579, Classification Attainment Evaluation Using Biological Criteria for Rivers and Streams Source: Maine Department of Environmental Protection Maine statute (38 MRSA \u00a7 465 -A) has designated one standard (GPA) for the classification of great ponds (at least 1 0 acres in size), and natural lakes less than 10 acres in size. Specifically, Class GPA waters shall be suitable for the designated uses of drinking water after disinfection, recreation in and on the water, fishing, industrial process and cooling water sup ply, hydroelectric power generation and navigation and as habitat for fish and other aquatic life. The habitat shall be characterized as natural. Class GPA waters shall meet specific water quality standards and shall be free of culturally induced algal blo oms which impair their use and enjoyment. The number of Escherichia coli bacteria of human origin in these waters may not exceed minimal levels. There may be no new direct discharge of pollutants into Class GPA waters, other than those that are legally exe mpt. The statute further states that no activities or land uses may take place on the banks of the water body or in the watershed that might degrade the water quality below the attainment level of the classification. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 97 Map 5 Water Resources displays the wat er quality classifications for surface water resources in Dover -Foxcroft. Sebec Lake, Branns Mill Pond and the Town's other ponds are class GPA. Tributaries to Sebec Lake in Dover - Foxcroft are Class A streams. Other Class A streams are Black Brook and Alde r Stream and its tributaries. The Piscataquis River is Class B, and most other streams are C lass B. All these water bodies meet their water quality classification. Rivers, Streams, and Brooks According to Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA), a river, stream, or brook is a channel that has defined banks (including a floodway and associated flood plain wetlands) created by the action of the surface water. Dover -Foxcroft's rivers, streams and brooks, are displayed on Map 5 Water Resources. The P iscataquis River The Piscataquis River is one of Dover -Foxcroft's most significance and visible natural resources, particularly as it flows through the urban area and along two major gateways to the community: the Guilford Road/ West Main Street and the Pleasant Street (Ba ngor Road). In addition to the river's scenic attributes, the river is used for hydroelectric power and recreation, and serves as important plant and wildlife habitat. There are two hydroelectric dams on the river: one owned by the Town and associated wit h the Riverfront Redevelopment Project and the other a privately -owned dam downstream at the former Brown s Mill site.43 The water quality of the Piscataquis River has improved dramatically over the decades. It is a Class B waterbody. Currently, the Maine D epartment of Environmental Protection (MDEP) lists the river as an impaired waterbody because the water quality has not been shown to consistently attain the Class B standards ; apparently more testing is necessary to determine that it is meeting the classi fication . According to the MDEP's 2012 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report44 the river is listed as impaired for the following two reasons: A portion of the river below Dover -Foxcroft is impaired for recreational use (contact, swimmin g) due to occasional discharges from combined sewer overflows, typically associated with heavy rainfall events. A segment of the River below Dover -Foxcroft is impaired for fish and other aquatic life uses due to periods of low dissolved oxygen. The Direc tor of the Dover -Foxcroft Wastewater Department indicated that wastewater and stormwater have been fully separated, and there have not been any combined sewer overflows (CSO) in several years. According to MDEP, the 2014 update to the Integrated Water Qual ity Monitoring and Assessment Report will acknowledge that there have not been any CSOs since 2005.45 MDEP also indicated that water quality testing over a period of several years will be necessary to show that the river is meeting its Class B designation a nd to remove the \"impaired\" listing for the River. The two licensed wastewater outfalls on the Piscataquis River (see Map 5 Water Resources ) are: Dover -Foxcroft Water District Water Treatment Facility (MEPDES Permit # ME0102229), located at 70 Fletcher R oad on the north side of the river. The District is licensed for a monthly average discharge of 0.15 million gallons per day of filter cleaning backwash wastewaters to the river. 43 There are several other dams in town that were installed in the 70's to mitigate the ef fects of seasonal flooding. These earthen dams require annual inspections and some routine maintenance. 44http://www.maine.gov/dep/water/monitoring/305b/index.htm (Appendix, page 41) (Appendix, page 79) 45 Susanne Standards Coordinato r, MDEP 1/9/2015 ) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 98 Dover -Foxcroft Wastewater Treatment Facility (MEPDES Permit # ME0100501), loc ated off Vaughn Road on the north side of the river. The facility is licensed to discharge up to a monthly average flow of 0.80 million gallons per day of secondary treated sanitary waste waters to the river. In an effort to further protect the river, the Town completed a major Brownfields cleanup project at the former \"Maine Leathers Tannery\" site on Vaughn Road. The completion of this project included moving and capping the hazardous materials to a location on site, but out of the flood zone. Wetlands, Shorelands, and Floodplains Wetlands are defined as \"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support prevalence of vege tation typically adapted for life in saturated soils.\" Wetlands can serve many functions: they protect water quality; control flood ing and erosion; provide a natural habitat for waterfowl, wildlife and unique plant life; encourage nu trient recycling; and serve as fish sanctuaries and nursery grounds. Wetlands are vit al to preserving water quality and the quantity of surface and groundwater resources. The National Wetlands Inventory provides the most accurate wetlands mapping. (See Map 5 Water Resources) Shorelands are environmentally important because of their relatio nship to water quality, value as critical wildlife habitat and function as floodplains. Development or the removal of vegetation on shorelands can increase runoff and sedimentation, as well as the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the water, which can lead to algae blooms. Vegetation tends to slow runoff of rainfall, allowing more time for infiltration into the soil. Steep slopes with highly erodible soils are particularly susceptible to erosion and sedimentation and should remain vegetated. Develo pment and the removal of vegetation also disturb many wildlife species that use shoreland areas as habitat and travel corridors. Floodplains are defined as areas adjacent to a river, stream, lake, or pond, which can reasonably be expected to be covered at some time by floodwater. The primary function of floodplains is to accommodate large volumes of water from nearby overflowing channels and dissipate the force of flow by reducing the rate of flow through a widening of the channel. A floodplain may also ab sorb and store a large amount of water, later becoming a source of aquifer recharge. Floodplains also serve as wildlife habitats, open space and outdoor recreational areas, and as farmland without interfering with their emergency overflow capacity. Intens ive development on floodplains can increase the severity of floods and cause flooding of previously unaffected areas. The major consequence of intensive development in floodplains is widespread property damage and loss of life, which results from severe fl ooding. Other significant consequences include the public costs associated with cleanup and rebuilding, increased insurance costs, and water contamination from toxic and hazardous materials. Lakes and Ponds46 Among Dover -Foxcroft's most significant surface water resources are Sebec Lake and the four ponds inventoried in this chapter. These water bodies provide many benefits, including areas for recreation, beautiful scenery, and as habitat for fisheries and wildlife. Lakes and ponds support a complex web o f life from tiny zooplankton and algae, to plants, invertebrates, fish and birds. The shorelands of lakes and ponds are particularly important in providing shade and as buffers in protecting water quality. Shoreland areas also provide critical habitat for many species of wildlife. 46 Information on Lakes can be found at http://www. lakesofmaine.org which is a collaboration of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the University of Maine, the Maine Volunteer Lakes Monitoring Program and the Knowledgebase for the Gulf of Maine and its watersheds. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 99 The amount of development within lake watersheds and around the shores of lakes and ponds can impact water quality. Dover -Foxcroft's lakes and ponds are located in very rural areas with a limited amount of development. Most of the shorelands along Sebec Lake in Dover -Foxcroft have small house and camp lots. However, most of the lake's shorelands are located in other towns, where there are clusters of developed lots as well as large expanses of undeveloped wetland and forested areas . Branns Mill Pond also has some camps and house lots, but a considerable amount of the shoreland remains undeveloped. The Town's other ponds also have a very limited amount of development along their shores.

The monitoring does not normally include bacteri a, mercury, or nutrients other than phosphorus. Water quality monitoring does not appear to be performed on the Town's other ponds. Sebec Lake Water Quality MDEP lists two volunteer water quality monitors for Sebec Lake. There are two sampling sites (Sampl e Station # 1, Northeast of South Cove point, and Sample Station # 2 Northeast of Greeley's Landing). The conclusions are similar for both sites. Water quality monitoring for Sample Station # 1 has been conducted since 1981, and for Sample Station # 2 wate r quality monitoring has been conducted since 1984. Based on the data, water quality is considered above average and the potential for nuisance algal blooms is low. Recent dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles show no DO depletion in deep areas of the lake. The p otential for phosphorus to leave the bottom sediments and become available to algae in the water column (internal loading) is low. Oxygen levels below 5 parts per million stresses certain cold water fish, and a persistent loss of oxygen may eliminate or re duce habitat for sensitive cold water species. Inland Fisheries and Wildlife manages this pond as both a warm water and cold water fishery.

Recent DO profiles show high DO depleti on in deep areas of the lake. The potential for phosphorus to leave the bottom sediments and become available to algae in the water column (internal loading) is high. Oxygen levels below 5 parts per million stresses certain cold water fish and a persistent loss of oxygen may eliminate or reduce habitat for sensitive cold water species. (Source: Filename: GARL4132.doc, Revised: 3/02, By: lb) Invasive Aquatic Species The introduction of non -native invasive plant and animal species to the U.S. has been escalating with widespread destructive consequences. Maine has four invasive aquatic plants of concern - variable -leaf milfoil, hydrilla, curly -leaved pondweed, and Eurasian milfoil. Significant habitat disruption, loss of native plant and animal communiti es, loss of property values, reduced fishing and water recreation opportunities, and large public and private expenditures have accompanied invasive plant introductions in many states. In Maine it is illegal to sell, propagate or introduce eleven invasive aquatic plants. These plants are aggressive growers that can become serious nuisances. Maine als o requires a Lake and River Protection Sticker on all seaplanes, which can also carry invasive plants into water bodies. Currently, invasive plants have not bee n identified in any of Dover -Foxcroft's water bodies. However, variable milfoil and hydrilla infestations have been identified in water bodies in central Maine. Lake associations in some areas have established invasive plant monitoring and education progra ms with boat inspections and eradication efforts. The Sebec Lake Association monitors for invasive plants in Sebec Lake. Section 6.3 Protection for Water Resources State and Federal Protection There are a number of state and federal laws that protect water resources. However, enforce ment of these laws by state agencies can be sporadic due to agency staffing levels relative to the vast areas to be monitored. In practice, compliance with most state and federal environmental regula tions is left to individual landowners. In many communities there is greater monitoring and enforcement of state and federal regulations through the local code enforcement officer. Some of the most significant state laws affecting water resources include: Maine's Natural Resource Pr otection Act (NRPA) regulates activities in, on, over or adjacent to natural resources, such as lakes, wetlands, streams, rivers, fragile mountain areas, high and moderate value waterfowl and wading bird habitats, high and moderate value deer wintering areas, and significant vernal pools . Standards focus on possible impacts to the resources and to existing uses. Maine's Erosion and Sedimentation Control Law requires basic controls and stabilization when a project involves filling, displacing, or exposing ea rthen material. No permit is required, but the law sets minimum across -the-board standards that help prevent harm to surface waters. Maine's Storm Water Management Law regulates activities creating impervious or disturbed areas (of size and location) bec ause of their potential impacts to water quality. In effect, this law ex tends storm water standards to smaller -than Site Location of Development Law -sized projects (see below). It requires quantity standards for storm water to be met in some areas, and bo th quantity and quality standards to be met in others. Maine's Site Location of Development Law regulates developments that may have a substantial impact on the environment (i.e., large subdivisions and/or structures, 20 -acre -plus develop ments, and metall ic mineral mining). Standards address a range of environmental impacts. Maine's Minimum Lot Size Law regulates subsurface waste disposal through requirements for minimum lot size and minimum frontage on a water body. The minimum lot size requirement for a single -family residence is 20,000 square feet; the shoreland frontage requirement is 100 feet. The requirements for Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 101 multi -family and other uses are based on the amount of sewage gen erated. The local code enforcement officer/plumbing inspector is responsib le for administering this law. Maine's Forest Practices Act requires that landowners notify the Maine Bureau of Forestry of any commercial timber harvesting activities, and that commercial harvest activities meet specific standards for harvesting adjacent to water bodies, clearcutting and forest regeneration following the harvest. Local Regulations Dover -Foxcroft's land use ordinances provide protection to both surface and groundwater resources. The Land Use Ordinance applies town -wide and provides conside rable protection to water resources. As examples, the ordinance requires the following: Identification of water resources on site plans A storm water plan to assure that surface water drainage does not pollute water bodies Evidence of adequate water supp ly for developments Adequate provision for storage of toxic materials Adequate subsurface wastewater disposal Preservation of the landscape including vegetation Environmental controls during construction Appropriate handling of manure on farms Dover -Foxcroft's Shoreland Zoning Ordinance provides substantial protection to natural resources located within shoreland areas, as mandated by state law. Shoreland zoning applies to the following: Areas within 250 feet of the Piscataquis River and great ponds ( Sebec Lake, Garland Pond, Branns Mill Pond and Snow's Pond) Areas within 250 feet of unforested wetlands 10 acres or larger in size and wetlands associated with great ponds and rivers Areas within 75 feet of streams flowing from great ponds, or streams below the confluence of two perennial streams (second order streams, such as Black Stream and Alder Stream) (See Map 18 Shoreland Zoning in the Volume I Appendices ) Dover -Foxcroft's Subdivision Regulations are designed to comply with the State subdivision statute. A subdivi - sion is generally defined as the division of a parcel into 3 or more lots (or units) within any 5 -year period. State statute requires that subdivisions be designed to address many environmental concerns including water quality, sewage d isposal, erosion and sedimentation, aesthetics, groundwater, wetlands, rivers, streams, great ponds and timber harvesting. Special Protection for Great Ponds Lakes and ponds are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of pollution. The most serio us threat is phosphorus pollution which is associated with non -point sources of pollution (storm water runoff). Development in the form of roads, buildings, lawns, farms, timber harvesting and other human activities that eliminates vegetation and natu ral depressions, allows rainwater to flow more quickly and directly into ponds. Increased runoff can carry excessive amounts of phosphorus into ponds (up to 10 times as much as normal), particularly when it carries fertilizers, detergents and other phosphorus laden chemicals. The negative impacts from excessive phosphorus can be loss of fisheries, cloudy green waters with unpleasant odors that lose their appeal for swimming and boating, and a resultant reduction in property values. Restoration of polluted ponds is extremely expensive, and some ponds may never recover. Generally speaking, the more developed a pond's watershed is, the higher the phosphorus concentration in storm water runoff. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 102 There are two requirements for keeping phosphorus low and water quality high for ponds in watersheds. First, existing sources of phosphorus need to be minimized, particularly from soil erosion in the watershed and from inadequate shoreline septic systems on sandy or shallow soils. The second requirement is that new additions o f phosphorus to the pond result ing from residential and commercial growth in the watershed must be minimized. All inland natural ponds that are ten acres or larger in size are classified as great ponds. Additionally, any body of water artificially formed or increased in size which has a surface area in excess of 30 acres is also a great pond. Great ponds receive special regulatory con sideration under Maine statutes, such as through the shoreland zoning and subdivision statutes, and the Natural Resources P rotection Act. The State subdivision statute (30 -A MRSA \u00a74404) lists consideration of phosphorus contribution to great ponds as a review criteria (#18) that must be addressed before a subdivision permit is issued. The MDEP has developed a methodology that can be used to determine acceptable phosphorus exports to a lake, and any appropriate control measures, such as buffers, infiltration systems, wet ponds, and other designs to limit storm water runoff. Some towns incorporate this standard into ordinances, while others sim ply use it as advisory information. The MDEP methodology, described in Phosphorus Control in Lake Watersheds: A Technical Guide for Evaluating New Development,48 is designed to evaluate whether or not a proposed development will add a disproportionate amount of new phosphorus to a pond. It provides a standard that limits the amount of phosphorus a proposed new development can add to a pond, and a means by which the development can be designed and evaluated to insure it meets the standard f or that pond. The MDEP provides the estimated phosphorus allocations49 for the ponds in Dover -Foxcroft ( Table 6 -4). The next to the last column of the table is the most important. It indicates an estimated per acre phosphorus allocation in pounds of phospho rus per acre per year (lb/acre/yr) for each pond watershed, which can serve as a standard for evaluating new development proposals. It is applied to the area of the parcel of land being developed to determine how much the development should be allowed to i ncrease phosphorus loading to the pond. 48 http://www. maine.gov/dep/land/stormwater/stormwaterbmps/index.html 49 \"Phosphorus allocation\" is the maximum amount of phosphorus/per acre that can be safely added to the lake. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 103 Sources of Assistance to Protect Water Resources Assistance in protecting water resources is available from federal, state and county agencies, and a number of non-profit organizations. Assistance can include educational materials, technical assistance and grants funding. The following is a listing of so me of those programs and resources. United State Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service : offers help to individuals, groups, towns and other units of government to protect, develop and wisely use soil, water and other natural resources. Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District : Purpose is to solve local natural resource conservation problems (both urban, agricultural and forestry) as determined by local stakeholders. Not only do districts work with their partners to identify natural resource problems at the local level and develop solutions, they also assist in getting those measures applied to the land.

(www.maine.gov/dep/assistance/grants -loans ) Small Community Grants Program (SCG) provides gra nts to help replace malfunctioning septic systems that are polluting a water body or causing a public nuisance. Grants can fund from 25% to 100% of the design and construction costs, depending upon the income of the property owner and the property's use. A n actual pollution problem must be documented to qualify for funding. Grant applications must be submitted by the town in which the property owner resides. Individual families may qualify for a grant if their income is $40,000 or less. Commercial establish ments may qualify if their gross profit is $100,000 or less. The Watershed Protection Grant Program provides funding (up to $1,000) and classroom support for service learning projects designed to protect the water quality of a lake or stream and to educate the public about the relationship between land use and water quality. Invasive Aquatic Plants Cost Share Grants are for local programs designed to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic plants. This cost share program is administered by the Lakes Environ mental Association (LEA) under an agreement with the MDEP. Eligible projects include boat inspection programs and education efforts to prevent the spread of invasive aquatic species. Grants up to $2,000 are available to municipal and county governments, quasi-municipal organizations and nonprofit organizations. Nonpoint Source Water Pollution Control Grants (\"319\" or NPS grants): The primary objective of NPS projects is to prevent or reduce nonpoint source pollutant loadings entering water resources so that beneficial uses of the water resources are maintained or restored. Maine public organizations, such as state agencies, soil and water conservation districts, regional planning agencies, watershed districts, municipalities, and nonprofit organizations are eligible to receive NPS grants. Activities include: surve ys, management plans and implementation of \"best management practices\" by land owners. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 105 Chapter 7 - Critical a nd Important Natural Resources50 Section 7.1 Overview of Wildlife and Plant Habitat The Maine Natural Areas Program (MNAP) and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) in collaboration with other organizations have developed the Beginning with Habitat Program (BwH),51 which is a habitat -based landscape approach to asse ssing wildlife and plant conservation needs and opportunities. BwH suggests maintaining a rich compliment of plant and wildlife habitat by interweaving important wetland and shoreland areas, high value habitats and large blocks of undevelo ped habitat to identify those areas most critical to protect or conserve. Mechanisms to protect important habitats can in clude both regulatory and non - regulatory approaches. The program recommends utilizing shoreland zoning to protect shoreland habitats around water bodies. Conservation of undeveloped areas can focus on large blocks of agricultural and forested habitat that include high value plant and animal habitats. Large blocks of undeveloped land usu ally have more wildlife diversity than smaller area s and are important to certain wildlife species that require large unfragmented habitat (undeveloped and generally road less areas). The program has also identified wildlife corridors and impediments to critical movement of wildlife and fisheries, such as highways and culverts across streams. Wetland and Riparian (Shoreland) Habitats The habitats most critical to maintaining wildlife populations, including fisheries, are wetlands and shoreland areas. Wetlands are highly productive areas that provide importa nt habitat for many types of wildlife, including waterfowl and wading birds, frogs, turtles, snakes, fish, shellfish, aquatic furbearers, and even large mammals, such as moose. Development in and near wetlands degrades their value to wildlife, and can be p articularly threatening to wildlife species that move between small wetlands to meet their habitat needs. Shoreland habitats are transitional zones between open water and wetland habitats, and dry or upland habitats. They include the banks and shores of s treams, rivers, and ponds, and the upland edges of wetlands. These are perhaps one of the most important habitats because up to 80% of terrestrial vertebrate animals use these areas for part of their life cycle. Protection of shorelands is recommended as t he backbone of managing wildlife and fisheries habi tat. Existing shoreland zoning controls land uses and placement of structures to minimize development impacts to areas adjacent to water bodies. Dover -Foxcrofts's shoreland zoning ordinance regulates are as within 250 feet of Sebec Lake, Branns Mill Pond, and the Town's other ponds larger than 10 acres, as well as certain unforested wetlands 10 acres and larger. Shoreland zoning also regulates areas within 250 feet of the Piscataquis River, and 75 feet of Black Stream, Alder Stream and a few other streams and brooks. Shoreland zoning does not include areas along very small streams (upstream from the confluence of two perennial streams), many forested 50 Other chapters also discuss natural resources: Chapter 6 Water Resources, Chapter 9 Parks, Recreation, and Open Space, and Chapter 13 Agriculture and Forestry Resources. Chapter 12 Existing Land Use c examines soil suitability for development and developm ent constraints. 51 Beginning with Habitat Program includes Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Maine Natural Areas Program, Maine Audubon, Maine Land Use Team , U. S. Fish and Wildlife, Maine Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit, Southern Maine Regional Plan ning, Nature Conservancy and Wells National Estuarine Research Preserve . Maps are available at http://www. beginningwithhabitat.org The goal of the Beginning with Habitat Program (BwH) is to maintain sufficient habitat to support all native plant and animal species currently breeding in Maine by providing information depicting and describing various habitats of statewide and national significance. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 106 wetlands, vernal pools and wetlands less than 10 acres in size. Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act and Forests Practices Act provide some protection to these areas if they are deemed significant. Large Undeveloped Habitat Blocks and Habitat Connections Large habitat blocks are defined as contiguous, undeve loped areas of 500 acres or more as mapped by BwH. These are relatively unbroken areas of habitat that can include forests, grass land, agricultural land, and wetlands. Unbroken means the habitat is crossed by few roads, and has relatively little developme nt and human habitation. These blocks are especially important to species that require large blocks of habitat, such as moose, bear, lynx, fisher, oven bird, and scarlet tanager. Larger blocks of habitat are also likely to serve a wider diversity of specie s than smaller blocks. Only in such blocks will many species find the home ranges they need to reproduce, travel and protect themselves. Dover -Foxcroft and the surrounding areas provide an extensive amount of this kind of wildlife habitat. Habitat connect ions are those areas that link large habitat blocks based on a prioritized habitat analysis prepared by BwH.52 Wildlife may need to move to different places for different purposes - they may feed in one place, raise young in another, and winter in a third, and some species may travel many miles to do this. Roads can create impassable barriers for terrestrial animals because of road width and altered habitat alongside roads. Roads constructed through wetlands and across streams can fragment habitat for aquati c animals. Culverts can restrict connections between habitat for fish and other aquatic animals. Noise, lights, and vehicle movements and emissions can restrict wildlife movement, particularly at high traffic volumes. BwH has mapped large habitat blocks an d habitat connections for Dover -Foxcroft, which can be used to identify those areas most important for habitat and connectivity. BwH recommendations include: Encourage growth in areas efficiently served by existing infrastructure and emergency services to save money and reduce miles driven. Maintain rural areas where large habitat blocks remain connected across the landscape, which can also reduce wildlife -vehicle conflicts, better protect water quality, and support agriculture and forestry. Encourage proj ects that reduce habitat fragmentation from new roads and incorporate conservation of high -value shoreland areas, habitat blocks, and connectors early in the permitting process. Conserve critical habitat connections on both sides of a road through purchase , easements, current use tax programs or landowner incentives. Design culverts, drainage pipes, fencing, and underpasses to help fish and wildlife move safely across the landscape. Design culverts to help fish and wildlife move up and down stream, which ca n also help reduce damage and costs from flooding. Section 7.2 Significant Wildlife Habitats53 Significant Wildlife Habitat is protected under Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA). To be protected through the NRPA, significant wildlife habitat must be identified and mapped as valuable habitat by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries an d Wildlife (MDIFW). Permits from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP) are required for regulated activities in significant wildlife habitats, including but not limited to dredging, bulldozing, draining, filling, and construction or alter ations of permanent structures. The permit 52 Conserving Maine Wildlife Habitat Connections Maine's Beginning with Habitat Program (BwH) shows the most important connect ions between high -value wildlife habitats on Map 3 - Undeveloped Habitat Blocks and Habitat Connections. See BwH Toolbox at http://www. beginningwithhabitat .org for specific suggestions on how to build habitat conservation into local land -use policies. See also BwH Conserving Wildlife On and Around Maine's Roads. 53 Information is from Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife fact sheets which contain additional information, 2015 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 107 review process is designed to ensure that activities are done at a time or in a way that minimizes harm to significant wildlife and their habitats. Three types of significant wildlife habitat have been identified in Dover - Foxcroft: waterfowl and wading bird habitat (wetlands), vernal pool habitat, and deer wintering areas. These habitats are described below. Inland Waterfowl and Wading Bird Habitats MDIFW has identified significant inland habitats for ducks, geese, herons, and similar species of waterfowl and wading birds, rating them as having high to moderate value. A moderate to high value habitat is a complex of freshwater wetland and open water areas plus a 250 -foot wide area surrounding the complex itself wher e inland species of waterfowl and wading birds nest. The quality of a wetland complex is determined by the dominant wetland type, the diversity of wetland types in the complex, the size of the wetland(s), the interspersion of the different types, and the r elative amount of open water. A number of these habitats have been identified in Dover -Foxcroft (See Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas in the Volume I Appendices ). Significant Vernal Pools MDIFW recognizes the importance of vernal pools to pool -breeding amphibians, invertebrates, and other game and nongame wildlife, including several rare and endangered species. Vernal pools are shallow depressions that usually contain water for only part of the year, and are often associated with forested wetland s. Vernal pools serve as essential breeding habitat for certain species of wildlife, including salamanders and frogs. Species that must have access to vernal pools in order to survive and reproduce include wood frogs, spotted and blue - spotted salamanders, and fairy shrimp. Juvenile and adult amphibians associated with vernal pools provide an important food source for small carnivores as well as large game species. Avoiding impacts to significant vernal pools and their surrounding habitat is important becaus e many amphibians are pool specific: they must return to the pond in which they were born to breed. The loss of vernal pools and the critical terrestrial habitat around them leads to local loss of amphibian species, a decrease in biodiversity, and a declin e in food available for many other animals in these areas. In general, a vernal pool habitat is significant if it has a high habitat value, either because a state -listed threatened or endangered species uses it, or there is a notable abundance of specific wildlife, such as blue spotted salamander, wood frog, or fairy shrimp. Significant vernal pool habitat includes the vernal pool and the area within a 250 foot radius of the spring or fall high -water mark of the pool. One significant vernal pool has been identified in Dover -Foxcroft (See Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas in the Volume I Appendices ). Deer Wintering Areas (DWA) Many approximate deer wintering areas have been identified in Dover -Foxcroft by the MDIFW (See Map). While approximate DWAs have been mapped, their value has not been determined, which means they are not protected as significant wildlife habitat by the NRPA. NRPA also protects valuable deer travel corridors, but these have not been identified or mapped. White -tailed deer in Ma ine are at the northern limits of their geographic range, and in northern Maine their numbers appear to be on the decline. During winter, deer are exposed to cold temperatures and deep snow that makes it hard to find food and keep warm. Deer adapt to winte r by congregating in DWA where the snow is not as deep and there is protection from the wind and ample food. A DWA is defined as a forested area used by deer when snow depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds 12 inches, deer -sinking depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds inches, and mean daily temperatures are below 32 degrees. DWA are crucial to winter survival of deer. Even though the location and extent of DWAs may vary depending on the winter, use of a DWA is typically ongoing from one year to the next, and spe cific sites may receive annual use by many generations of deer. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 108 A DWA is ideally composed of over 50% conifers, with a conifer canopy of over 50%, with most trees over 35 feet in height. Approximately half of a DWA should be in mature conifers at any one time, while the remainder is made up of several age classes of regenerating forest that are interspersed throughout the DWA. Proper management of the DWA involves timber harvesting to ensure perpetual softwood cover and a mix of available browse. Over -harvesting as part of a logging operation or for building is the primary threat to DWA. MDIFW encourages landowners to develop a management plan for their DWAs to provide optimal winter and summer habitat for deer. Several of the Town's DWAs are located with in conservation lands, such as the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area. Several other DWAs are located around moderate and high value wetlands that are protected as significant wildlife habitat through the NRPA. In some cases these areas may receive some protection through the town's shoreland zoning. Rare, Threatened and Endangered Species Essential wildlife habitat is defined under the Maine Endangered Species Act as a habitat currently or historically providing physical or biological features essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species in Maine, and which may require special management considerations. The Act requires that all projects or activities permitted, licensed, funded, or otherwise carried out by the State or towns withi n an area designated as essential wildlife habitat must be reviewed by the MDIFW. Often projects can be modified to protect the habitat.

Special concern species are established by State policy, not by regulation, and are used for planning and informational purposes; they do not have the legal weight of enda ngered and threatened species. MDIFW tracks the status, life history, conservation needs and occurrences for species that are endangered, threatened, or otherwise rare. These species are of concern because of their rarity in the U.S. and Maine. Conservati on of some of these species is particularly important because Maine may have some of the largest remaining populations. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 109 Rare, Threatened and Endangered Animals54 Animal species identified for Dover -Foxcroft are the Tidewater Mucket, a threatened species, a nd three species of special concern: the Bald Eagle, Canada Lynx, and Wood Turtle. Information on these species is displayed in the following table and text, and generalized locations are displayed on Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas in the Volume I Appendices. It is important to note that there are other locations within Dover -Foxcroft with habitats that might support these species. Tidewater Mucket55 The tidewater mucket is a medium -sized (usually less than 3 inches in size) freshwater muss el listed as threatened in Maine. Freshwater mussels are one of the most endangered groups of animals in North America, and Maine may have some of the largest remaining populations of tidewater muckets in the East. The decline in mussels in North America i s due to loss of habitat from a century of industrialization and development of waterways, decline in water quality and introduction of the zebra mussel, an exotic species. Zebra mussels have not been documented in Maine, but are spreading across the U.S. Freshwater mussels are especially vulnerable and sensitive to changes and toxins in their environment, and are at high risk for extirpation when habitat is altered because of their inherent life history traits (i.e. sedentary, filter -feeders, long -lived, s low to mature, low reproductive success, host species -dependent (fish), and habitat specialists). Tidewater mussels prefer ponds and slow -moving portions of rivers and will tolerate impoundments. MDIFW identified a portion of the shore of Sebec Lake as tid ewater mucket habitat. Protection of clean, unaltered, forested watersheds and associated forested shoreland areas is essential for the long -term conservation of the tidewater mucket. MDIFW recommendations include: Consult MDIFW prior to development or for est harvesting near habitat. Shoreland zoning should be resource protection or very low residential density. Voluntary landowner agreements, conservation easements, or acquisition to protect habitat. Utilize best management practices for forestry, developm ent and water body alterations. Avoid use of pesticides within \u00bc mile of the waterway. Prohibit and guard against introduction of invasive species. Bald Eagle56 Bald eagle restoration has been one of the great success stories of the Endangered Species Act and the banning of pesticide DDT. As a result of the recovery of bald eagle populations, both federal and state governments have removed them from their lists of endangered and threatened species. Bald eagles continue to be a species of special concern in order to ensure their continued recovery. A bald eagle nest site has been identified on an island in Sebec Lake in Dover -Foxcroft. Nesting eagles need mature trees and wooded buffers along shorelands - a niche that will always be at risk to land developmen t and recreational pressures. The continued use of nests year after year makes site -specific management efforts very effective, which is why it has been the cornerstone strategy of Maine's eagle management program since 1972, and will continue to be a key strategy for ensuring the lasting recovery of eagles well into the future. MDIFW recommendations are as follows: Consult MDIFW prior to development or forest harvesting near nest sites. 54 The information below is summarized from MDIFW Fact Sheets. The Fact Sheets contain additional information and are available from the MDIFW. 55 See http://www. maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/endangered/pdfs/tidewatermucket_90_91.pdf , Maine IFW, 2014 56 Fact Sheet: Bald Eagle, USFWS, 2007 (provided by Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, 2014) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 110 Maintain areas within 330 feet of nests as sanctuaries; avoid major disturbances within 330 feet to 1,320 feet of the nest during sensitive nesting season (February 1 to August 31). Maintain foraging perches, roosts, potential nest trees, and flight corridors. Recreationists (boaters, hikers, etc.) remain a safe distance a way - 660 feet to 1,320 feet or more. Avoid aerial application of pesticides around nesting sites. Shoreland zoning should be resource protection or very low residential density. Voluntary landowner agreements, conservation easements, or acquisition to pro tect nest sites. Canada Lynx57 Maine lists the Canada Lynx as a species of special concern, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists the lynx as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The lynx is a secretive, forest -dwelling cat common throughout the boreal forest of Alaska and Canada, but historically rare at the southern edge of their range, as in Maine. In Maine, lynx are most common in the spruce/fir flats of Aroostook and Piscataquis counties and northern Penobscot, Somerset, F ranklin and Oxford Counties, where snow depths are often the highest in the state. Good habitat consists of large areas of young, dense stands of balsam fir and northern hardwoods which provide the highest densities of snowshoe hares, the primary food for lynx, and suitable areas for denning. Maine's lynx population reached a record high as of 2006 as a result of widespread dense regenerating spruce/fir habitat due to clearcutting in the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, there is concern that with re -growth ther e will not be enough suitable habitats for snowshoe hares (primary food for lynx) and lynx. The USFWS, University of Maine, and MDIFW are working to determine what types and amount of habitat are needed to support lynx and to guide future forest management activities. MDIFW recommends the following: Report all lynx sightings to MDIFW as soon as possible. Manage northern forests in landscapes (at the township level) with areas having a high proportion of regenerating balsam fir/northern hardwood stands (les s than 30 years old) that support high densities of snowshoe hares. Ensure large blocks of suitable regenerating habitat are distributed widely over the landscape. Avoid incidental take of lynx from trapping and snaring. Conserve large blocks of unfragm ented forestland. Avoid construction of new high -volume/high -speed highways in currently undeveloped areas. Wood Turtle58 The wood turtle, one of the state's rarest turtles, is a medium sized turtle (5 inches to 8 inches) with a distinct sculpted shell an d orange coloration on the neck and legs. No other Maine turtle species makes such extensive use of both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For much of the year, wood turtles are found in slow -moving clear - water streams with a predominantly sand or gravel s ubstrate. During late spring and summer they utilize the surrounding upland areas. From late fall to early spring, wood turtles hibernate underwater in sheltered areas of rivers, including pool bottoms, under riverbanks, or under woody debris. Females typi cally travel farthest from streams during the early summer seeking nesting sites in sunny places with bare soil, sand, gravel, gravel pits, agricultural fields, and forest clearings. Wood turtles have experienced declines throughout their range in eastern North America. The principal threats are direct mortality by vehicles on roads, encounters with motorized equipment in agricultural and forestry operations, as well as collection as pets. These problems are exacerbated when combined with widespread 57 http://www. maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/pdfs/Canada_Lynx_2011.pdf , Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, 2014 58 Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife: Forest Management Recommendations for the Wood Turtle, 2014 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 111 fragmen tation, and loss of their upland habitat associated with development. Wood turtles are long -lived and slow to mature, making them particularly vulnerable to adult mortality. It can take years to replace adult turtles when they are killed and even a small n umber of annual deaths can be devastating to a population. To thrive, wood turtles require an intact matrix of riverine and upland habitat free of intensive human activity. Forest management can be a compatible land use for wood turtles if precautions are taken. MDIFW recommends maintaining a forested shoreland zone within 300 feet of the banks of streams hosting wood turtles, for 2 miles upstream and 2 miles downstream, and within that area: Refrain from active cutting and motorized vehicle access between April 15th and October 15th. Avoid motorized activity within 50 feet of the high water shoreline. Manage with single -tree or small group -selection cuts that maintain 60 -70% canopy cover within 100' and a forested condition within 300 feet of the stream ban k. Harvest only during dry or frozen ground conditions. Avoid or minimize construction of permanent roads or openings. Build temporary bridges across all perennial streams prior to any motorized equipment crossing. The wood turtle habitat identified in Do ver-Foxcroft is located along the Bangor Road in an area that receives some protection as a wetland, and as waterfowl and wading bird habitat through the NRPA, and through the Town's shoreland zoning ordinance. Section 7.3 Rare and Unique Botanical Features Rare and unique botanical features include the habitat of rare, threatened, or endangered plant species and unique or exemplary natural communities. Several rare plant habitats have been identified in Dover -Foxcroft. The Maine Natural Areas Progr am lists three threatened plants, and four plants of special concern as displayed in Table 7-2. Each plant is assigned a rarity rank of 1 (rare) through 5 (common) both within Maine (state rank) and globally (global rank). There is very limited protectio n for these plant habitats, other what might be afforded through the NRPA and the Town's shoreland zoning. The Town should consult with the Maine Natural Areas program when development is proposed for an area identified in this plan as potential habitat fo r one of these species, or encourage current landowners to protect these rare plants.

These and many rare species are characteristic of forests with relatively nutrient rich soils. There are many known mature occurrences of Maple - Basswood - Ash Forests in the state, most with a history of harvesting. Market pressures for hardwoods have led to heavy cutting o f several sites in the state. Typical sites where this community occurs are naturally small and should be buffered from surrounding forest uses. Source: Maine Natural Areas Program, January 2015 *See notes in prior table. Protection of these natural com munities and ecosystems varies. The Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area receives considerable protection as a state -owned area; portions of the Foxcroft/Sangerville Bog receives some protection as a wetland; and the Enriched Northern Hardwoods Forest is not protected other than very limited protection through the Maine Forests Practices Act. Alder Stream Focus Area of Statewide Ecological Significance The Alder Stream Focus Area extends along the Town's boundaries with Atkinson and Garland. Most of the focus area is located in Atkinson (See Important Habitats and Natural Areas Map). The portion of the Focus Area within Dover -Foxcroft includes wetlands, wetland habitats for waterfowl and wading bird, deer wintering areas, salmon habitat in the Pis cataquis River, and conservation land. There is also an outstanding raised level bog ecosystem, which is a flat sphagnum peatland with mostly closed drainage. The Alder Stream Focus Area (Dover -Foxcroft and beyond) provides habitat for several rare and no table plant and animal species, including wood turtle, bald eagle, creeper (a freshwater mussel), wild leek, and American chestnut. There are also good examples of floodplain forests, large, open peatlands (bogs and fens), and vernal pools. In addition, ov er 1,700 acres of deer wintering area, almost 2,800 acres of inland waterfowl and wading bird habitat, and miles of brook trout streams contribute to the ecological value of the area. Approximately 44% of the Focus Area has been conserved (through fee owne rship and easement), and there is good public access via the Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area and several land trust projects. 59 Descrip tions of all the community types are available at http://www. maine.gov/doc/nr imc/mnap/features/commsheets Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 114 Bud Leavitt Wildlife Management Area: The Bud Leavitt WMA, managed by the MDIFW, is a total of 6,385 acres within the towns of Dover -Foxcroft, Atkinson, Garland and Charleston. About 908 acres are located in the southeastern corner of Dover -Foxcroft. The area consists primarily of upland forests and forested wetlands, where canoeing, trapping, hunting, fishing and wildlife watching are allowed. Land Trust Project: Greater Alder Stream/ Piscataquis River Project60 The Alder Stream Focus area receives considerable protection through the Greater Alder Stream/ Piscataquis River Project. The entire project straddles both Piscataquis and Penobscot counties and consists of a roughly 20,000 -acre complex of protected lands. The Northeast Wilderness Trust is working with other conservation groups and local partners t o expand and further connect the network of protected lands, which includes areas devoted to wilderness, sustainable forestry, and organic farming. A portion of this project is located in the southeastern corner of Dover -Foxcroft (about 137 acres owned by the Northeast Wilderness Trust). The Greater Alder Stream/Piscataquis River project borders Alder Stream and the Piscataquis River, and contains mature American chestnut trees, expansive wetlands, and Atlantic salmon habitat. The protected area contains one of the largest, most varied, and intact freshwater wetland systems in Maine. Recognized as vital at multiple scales, it is embedded within: (1) a Species -at-risk Focus Area identified in Maine's Comprehensive Wildlife Action Plan; (2) a larger 88,000 -acre area identified by The Nature Conservancy as a high priority Tier 1 Matrix Forest Block due to its unfragmented, high quality forest and wetland characteristics; and (3) the Piscataquis - Penobscot Rivers Focus Area of the North American Waterfowl Manageme nt Plan. Section 7.5 Significant Fisheries Habitat Significant freshwater fisheries habitat is defined as any freshwater river, stream, brook, lake, or pond identified by MDIFW as brook trout habitat, or rare, native fish habitat; or waterbodies identifie d by the Maine Department of Marine Resources (MDMR) as diadromous61 fisheries habitat. Dover -Foxcroft has a number of significant freshwater fisheries. The MDIFW is charged with managing the state's freshwater fisheries and MDMR manages diadromous fisherie s. Those species found in Dover -Foxcroft include Atlantic salmon and American eel, both diadromous species, and brook trout, a freshwater species. While the following discussion highlights these most significant fisheries, it is importan t to note that the re are other fisheries important to sport fishing in the Town. Wild Atlantic Salmon and American Eel Habitat: Piscataquis River62 The Piscataquis River provides habitat for wild Atlantic salmon and American eel: both diadromous fish species that spend port ions of their life cycles partially in fresh water and partially in salt water. Wild Atlantic salmon are listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The American Eel is a threatened species that may be listed in the future as endang ered. Today, in spite of significant progress in reducing water pollution, improving fish passage, managing fisheries, and reintroducing salmon, wild salmon runs only remain in a handful of Maine rivers. The Penobscot River watershed, including the Piscata quis River, is one of these rivers. Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas (Volume I Appendices) displays spawning and 60 The Northeast Wilderness Trust , based in Montpelier Vermont, works to conserve forever -wild landscapes for nature and people. The Trusts uses variou s land conservation tools and often works with conservation partne rs including other land trusts to protect wild places in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, eastern New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. See more at a general category describing fish that spend portions of their life cycles partially in fresh water and partially in salt water. 62 USFWS, MDMR, 2014/2015 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 115 rearing habitat for Atlantic salmon in the portion of the Piscataquis River in Dover -Foxcroft. The river also provides habitat for Am erican eel, but this is not mapped. MDMR working with the USFWS, nonprofit organizations, industry representatives and other stakeholders, is working to identify critical habitats and potential threats to salmon survival, and providing technical assistance to assess and restore natural river channels. The goal is to revive native fisheries and the social, cultural and economic traditions associated with a free -flowing river to the river watershed, while maintaining energy production. The effort has entailed the removal of several dams and improved fish passage at other dams on the Penobscot River. Efforts are currently underway to provide a bypass of the Howland dam on the Penobscot River, which will provide free passage to the Piscataquis River. The Town -owned Moosehead Mill dam on the Piscataquis River in Dover -Foxcroft is next on the list for consideration, and may require upgrades to provide adequate fish passage. The Brown's Mill, privately owned by KEI Power Management Inc., has adequate upstream and do wnstream fish passage and meets Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requirements. The t own is currently working with the MDMR, USFWS, FERC and others to renew energy production at the Moosehead Mill dam while meeting the requirements for fish passa ge. Atlantic salmon spawning habitat is characterized by coarse gravel or rubble bottom with suitable well - oxygenated, clean water with appropriate velocity and depth. The eggs are buried in gravel nests and hatch in March and April. The young salmon spen d 2-3 years in this habitat before migrating to the North Atlantic near Greenland and Labrador. They spend about 1 -3 years at sea before returning to spawn in the same area that they were spawned. MDMR currently stocks salmon at the upper headwaters of the Piscataquis River. While American eel populations are not at sustainable levels, stocking does not appear to be a reasonable approach, and scientists are working to find viable options for their restoration. Recommendations for protecting habitat include : Protect the waterway and adjacent land (250 feet from high water mark) through shoreland zoning - resour ce protectio n is best to limit most development, or at least low density residential. Consult with MDIFW and MDMR prior to shoreland development or fo rest harvesting to determine what management tools would best protect the habitat. Utilize Maine Forest Service and Maine Department of Environmental Protection best management practices for forestry and land use activities within 250 feet of the waterway. Encourage landowner use of voluntary agreements, conservation easements, etc. to protect shorelands. Avoid road or pipeline crossings, use of heavy equipment or stream alterations in the waterway. Avoid use of broad spectrum pesticides within \u00bc mile of th e stream habitat. Educate anglers to promptly return the Atlantic salmon unharmed if caught accidentally. Discourage the introduction of non -native fish species, which is illegal. Wild Brook Trout Habitat: Sebec Lake, Piscataquis River, Black Stream, Other Small Streams63 Wild book trout habitat is found in Sebec Lake and its tributaries, the Piscataquis River, Black Stream and a few other small streams in Dover -Foxcroft (See Map 6). Brook trout are not afforded any special state or federal regulatory protec tion, but are native to Maine, and are the most preferred sport fish sought by Maine anglers. Further, Maine is the last stronghold for brook trout in the eastern U.S., and the only state with extensive intact lake and pond dwelling populations. MDIFW stoc ks brook trout in tributaries to Sebec Lake, Branns Mill Pond, Garland Pond, Snow's Pond and the Piscataquis River. The stocking is a \"put and take\" fishery meaning it is primarily for fishing opportunities, and few stocked fish are expected to survive fro m year to year. 63 MIFW Forest Management Recommend ations for Brook Trout Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 116 Brook trout require clean, cool, well oxygenated water and are very sensitive to changes in habitat and water quality. Rivers and streams typically provide spawning and nursery habitat. Stream habitat suitability is maintained by the presen ce of intact, stable, mature wooded riparian corridors that conserve forest soils, provide shade to reduce stream warming, protect stream water quality, provide cover for fish, provide a source of woody debris and leaf litter from mature trees that maintai n critical in -stream habitat for fish and the aquatic insects they feed upon. Floodplain and fringe wetlands associated with streams are a significant source of springs and groundwater discharge that maintain stream flows and cool temperatures during warm low flow summer periods. Maine brook trout fisheries are unique and highly valuable, but vulnerable to habitat alteration that may be caused by development and activities associated with timber harvesting. Well planned forestry operations can actually protect habitat and help ensure that forests remain as forest, which is the most beneficial land use for brook trout and many other fish and wildlife species. MDIFW recommends following best management practices during all road and trail building activitie s, as well as timber harvesting.64 Potential harmful impacts to fish and wildlife may be further minimized by designating low - impact riparian protection areas adjacent to streams and stream -associated fringe and floodplain wetlands in forest management and harvest plans. Smaller streams may be greatly influenced by land management practices; these systems benefit the most from well managed and intact riparian corridors. Landlocked Salmon and Lake Trout: Sebec Lake Sebec Lake is an excellent cold water fisher y with the primary fish species consisting of native landlocked salmon, small mouth bass, white perch and lake trout. The lake is one of the few lakes that support an outstanding native landlocked salmon population. MDIFW stocks the lake with lake trout. Threats to Fisheries Land use activities, particularly those that remove tree s and vegetation from shorelands of brooks, streams and ponds, can result in increased water temperatures and degradation of water quality. Maintenance of vegetative buffers to pr ovide shade, particularly for cold -water species (trout and salmon), and to protect water quality is important to maintaining healthy fisheries. Destabilization of banks and activities that increase erosion and sedimentation diminish water quality. Maine's NRPA and local shoreland zoning provide considerable protection for fisheries, through required structure setbacks and vegetative buffers, and restrictions on certain activities. Highway and road construction and maintenance activities can also have a si gnificant impact on fisheries. On streams and rivers the biggest threat to aquatic habitats is fish passage, particularly for those species that require upstream habitats for spawning and other habitat needs. Improperly designed culverts can prevent fish passage. Maintenance and continuance of the natural stream bottom surface material without major changes in elevation is important to maintaining fish passage. Additionally, ditching and drainage designs should direct runoff into vegetated areas or sediment ponds to allow for the filtering out of sediments before runoff is released into water bodies. 64 BMPs are detailed in the booklet entitled \"Best Management Practices for Forestry ,\" which offers guidance on managing and protecting water quality, installing road -stream crossings, and providing fish passage.

Along with the courts, the Piscataquis County Jail, Registrar of Deeds, the Sheriff's Department , and Piscataquis County Emergency Management agency are also locate d in Dover -Foxcroft. Section 8.2 Municipal Government Dover -Foxcroft operates with a Selectmen/Town Manager/Town Meeting form of government . The Town Manager handles daily operations. The seven -member Board o f Select men serves staggered three -year terms and typically meets the second and fourth Monday of each month, or as needed. The Board also serves as assessors and overseers of the poor. The Town's fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30 and approval of the budge t is achieved through town meeting warrant articles. The annual town meeting is held in June. The Town Charter was adopted on June 12, 2007 to establish overall policies and procedures for operation of Town government. The charter calls for a comprehensive review every ten years. Elected officials include: the Board of Selectmen, Clerk, Treasurer, Regional School Unit #68 Board of Directors, Hospital Administrative District #4 Board of Directors, Dover -Foxcroft Water District Board of Trustees, and the Exec utive Committee of the Thompson Free Library. Board of Selectmen appointments include: the Town Manager; Registrar of Voters and Deputy; Budget Advisory Committee; Planning Board; Board of Appeals; Fire Chief; Police Chief; Fire Chief and Deputy; Sealer o f Weights and Measures; Code Enforcement Officer; Plumbing Inspector; Building Inspector; Emergency Management Services Director; Tree Warden; Forest Fire Warden; Animal Control Officer and Deputy; Constables; Airport Advisory Committee ; and Pine Crest Dev elopment Corporation Board of Directors. Dover -Foxcroft Town Office and Administration The Town Office complex is located at 48 Morton Avenue Suite A and houses the administrative offices. Town Office hours are: Monday , Thurs day, Friday 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.; Tues day, c losed ; and Wednesday 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The Town Administration has an annual operating budget o f approximately $1,070,000, which includes both administrative office expenses and the cost of all employee benefits, social security, health insurance, and the property and liability insurance for all Town departments. Administration has a full -time town manager/tax collector/general assistance administrator, a full -time office manager/clerk, treasurer, a part -time assistant general assistance administrator/assistant tax bookkeeper, full full-time collector/ deputy clerk/deputy treasurer, full -time deputy clerk/assistant fish and wildlife agent, -time full -time motor vehicle agent , and part-time office janitor. Staffing levels will be adequate for the foreseeable future . There may be ways the Town administrative staff could be helpful to other municipal or quasi -municipal agencies in coordinating staffing. One of the most significant improvements to Town administration has been increased product ivity through information technology including: cost savings with the V oIP phone system; improved data storage and retrieval; expedited transactions - better customer service; faster communications (email) and document transmittal; information sharing betw een towns, mapping capability, etc. The Town also has a website at www.dover -foxcroft.org which greatly increases customer service and communications. There are links to online Maine.gov services, such as on -line motor vehicle registrations through the Mai ne Department of Motor Vehicles, and on -line sporting license registration through the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 118 Wildlife. Maintaining up -to-date technology (equipment, software, and internet capacity) will become increasingly important to p roviding efficient, effective government services. The Town would like improve it internet capacity for high speeds, but at an affordable cost. The Town Office was moved from Central Hall to its current location (the former Morton Avenue School) in 2008. T his change followed the School District's decision to consolidate the primary and middle school grades into an expanded SedoMoCha Primary and Middle School. The Town also accepted the former High Street School Administrative Building when the School Distri ct moved its administrative offices to the SeDoMoCha facility. The Town sold the High Street School Administrative Building to Mayo Hospital and used the funds to make improvements to Town Office now located at Morton Avenue. The 27,000 square foot structu re consists of the main building constructed in 1957 and an addition (two classrooms) constructed in the mid 1980s. In addition to office space, the facility includes a gym and a kitchen. The facili ty also has a large parking lot and a playground and recre ation area. The building is in generally good condition, and of more than adequate size to serve Town Office functions well into the future. A number of capital improvements have been identified, such as upgrades to the roof and heating and mechanical systems, improved record s storage , and parking lot improvements . At the Town Office complex, the Town leases office space to the D over -Foxcroft Water District, the Cavalry Church, the Senior Network, and the Children's Learning Center. The Town would like to lease additional space at this facility to increase revenues from the facility. Section 8.3 Public Works65 The Public Works Department staff consists of seven full -time employees and four part-time employees. Full - time employees include the foreman, three truck drivers/laborers, two heavy equipment operators and a mechanic. Part -time employees consist of two truck drivers/laborers and an individual who mows roadsides . The Department operates on an annual budget of about $750,000. The Public Works Garage is located at 1081 South Street, with sand storage on a gravel pad across the street. Road salt is stored in a wood frame steel -sheeted building on a concrete/macadam pad. The Town's gravel pit is located on the Dexter Road, where there is at least 100 years of gravel available. The facility is open Monday through Friday from 7:00 am to 3: 30 pm. The Public Works Garage has seven -bays and an office. The building was refurbished in 2005 and consists of a concrete block building (150' x 50') and a metal -sided addition (60' x 50'). The building has in -floor radiant heat in some areas. An energ y audit was conducted that includes recommendations for additional improvements to improve energy efficiency. The Maine Department of Transportation is responsible for plow ing all state roads outside the urban area of the Town, while providing state -aid funding for the Town to plow state roads within the urbanized area.

The Department is also responsible for maintaining sidewalks, Town parking a reas, road signage, Town -owned bridges and culverts, and the stormwater system. The Wastewater Department assists in management of the stormwater system in the urban area. The Town contracts for road -side tree and brush cutting. Overall, Public Works faci lities, planned equipment replacements, and staffing should be adequate for the foreseeable future. Section 8.4 Tree Program The Town established its community forestry project in the mid -2000s. A volunteer tree committee, assisted by the Town 's Tree Warden and Town Manager, is responsible for administering the program. The Tree Warden makes recommendations with respect to the care of important trees and shrubs, and also makes recommendations for fu ture plantings. When needed, Public Works assi sts. On Arbor Day 2013 Dover -Foxcroft officially became a Tree City USA Community. One of the first steps in the establishment of the program was a tree inventory that identified notable trees. This was accomplished in 2007 with funding through a $4,000 Ma ine Forest Service Project Canopy grant .66 Two additional Project Canopy grants ($7,940 and $8,000) were used to replace trees lost to natural causes and to plant new trees. One area of focus has been the downtown, where trees have been planted and planters have been purchased for some of the plantings. The Project Canopy -funded projects have been part of the Town's overall tree planting and beautification effort. The Town has used funding from multiple sources , such as the Communities for Maine's Future Pro gram, for the Riverfront Redevelopment project, which is an ongoing effort to create a park -like setting for people to enjoy the beauty of the river. When completed, t he project will include a river -walk, signage for notable species, and other amenities to improve the area as a public recreational space that enhances downtown Dover -Foxcroft . Dover -Foxcroft's tree planting program, which continues in urban areas, is now being extended into rural areas. Ongoing funding comes through the Public Works budget. Section 8.5 Regional Solid Waste and Recycling67 The Dover -Foxcroft Regional Solid Waste and Recycling Facility (transfer station) is located on the Landfill Road. This facility is located at the site of the Town 's landfill which was closed in 1995. The regi onal facility is also utilized by the communities of Atkinson, Barnard, Bowerbank, Sebec and Sangerville on a contractual basis with each community paying a percentage of the annual costs based on population. Each town also pays its share of the tipping fe es charged by the Penobscot Energy Recovery Company's (PERC) . Dover -Foxcroft's sha re is about 69% of total tipping fees. Dover -Foxcroft's total annual budget for solid waste disposal and recycling is about $470,000. 66 Project Canopy funded by the U.S. Forest Service and administe red by the Maine Forest Service provides grants to develop and maintain long -term comm unity forestry programs. Grants are available in two categories: planning and education, and tree planting and maintenance. 67 Joe Sands; Solid Waste/Transfer Station Director; Phone: 564 -7940 ; recycling.center@myfairpoint.net Public Works Equipment Grader 2011, Volvo Trackless Plow 2001 Bucket Load er (1995) John Deere Bulldozer (91) John Deere Bucket Load er (2006) Case Gravel Scr een (95) 1998 Wheeler Volvo 06 Explorer with Plow 1995 Wheeler Volvo Service Truck (2000) Ford 1995 Sweeper Service Truck (2001) Ford 1989 Sweeper Headgear 2006 Wheeler/s Internat ional Sander Body / Wheeler 2002 Wheeler Internat ional Pick-Up (2004) Chevy 2004 Wheeler/s Internat ional Trailer 20 ton Excavator 2012 Kobelko 140 Trailer (utility) 99 6 -yd Sander s Internat ional (2) Gator 2000 wheeler Volvo Radios Blanchette Snowblower 1989 Storage Box es (3) Blanchette Snowblower 1992 Trailer (homemade) Trackless Plow s 95 (2) Van (2001) Ford Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 120 The transfer station is open on Monday , Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Individuals either transport materials to the facility themselves , or contract with a private hauler for curb -side pick -up. Residential users do not have to pay for disposal or recycling, except there is a fee for some mater ials, such as tires, furniture, TVs and computers. Commercial users, including private haulers, must pay a fee to disposal of materials. Solid waste and recycling facility staffing includes one full -time director and five part -time employees . One employee works at the transfer station and four employees work at the recycling center. The Solid Waste and Recycling Committee oversees the program. The facility includes the transfer station (2 wood frame buildings with trash compacters) and outside storage area s; the recycling center (one wood frame building, metal roof and siding, with storage, several bailers, bucket loader and forklift), and a demolition landfill. The facility is in good shape - the recycling center buildings were constructed in 2007 and the transfer station buildings have been well -maintained. Recycled materials include: metal, paper, cardboard, and plastics . Glass is currently buried because there is no market for it. Tires are shipped for reuse. Waste oil is used as fuel to heat some of t he Town's facilities. White goods are accepted , and the Town has a machine to remove the Freon. Paper products accepted include newsprint, magazines, office paper, catalogs, corrug ated and paper board. Numbers 1 through 7 plastics , except plastic bags and styrofoam, are also accepted. In 2005, the Town began recycling universal waste (waste that may contain hazardous material s such as mercury, lead and other heavy metals ) and household hazardous waste (e.g., paint, old gasoline, pesticides, alkaloids, acids , aerosols, tars, oil/coolants and ammonia products). Most of th e universal waste consists of TV's and computer monitors, assorted fluorescent lamps, and mixed electronics. There is a charge for disposal of universal waste and household hazardous waste. T he T own landfills demolition at the facility, which includes bulky waste (furniture, shingles, bathroom fixtures, and large plastic items). Construction demolition wood and brush are shipped out . Table 8-3 displays materials handled through the regional tr ansfer station and recycling facility. The recycling rate was around 50% in 2010, but since then has remained at around 40%. Dover -Foxcroft has a charter waste disposal agreement that extends until March 31, 2018 with the Penobscot Energy Recovery Company's (PERC) facility in Orrington where solid waste that is not otherwise recycled, reused or shipped elsewhere, is incinerated. This agreement provides for a cash distribution back to the Town, based on Table 8-3 Materials Accepted at Dover -Foxcroft Solid Waste and Recycling Facility (All Six 304.94 tons Plastics #1 -#7* 14 tons 12.5 tons 15 tons 10.39 tons Aluminum/Steel Cans* 13.5 tons 22.5 tons 15 tons 15.84 tons Universal Waste* 18 tons & 2,126 fluorescent lamps 2,727 lamps 20.78 tons & 5,308 linear ft. of fluorescent lamps Bulky Waste Landfilled On -Site 300 tons 300 tons 250 tons 200 tons Sheetrock, Plaster, Wallboard 50 tons 52 tons 51 tons 46.83 tons Residential Wood Ash, Demolition Wood & Brush* (Shipped Out) 700 tons 800 tons 926 tons 918 tons Tires (Oversized & Tires with Rims)* 8 tons 3 tons 4 tons 1.5 tons Light Iron* 910 tons** 219 tons 115 tons 215 tons Household Hazardous Waste (Paint, Old Gasoline, Pesticides, Etc) 32 drums liquids; 5 drums solids 17 drums liquids; (incl. in drums in 2013/14) 43 drums liquids; 21 drums solids Solid Waste Shipped to PERC 3,400 tons 3,300 tons 3,100 tons 3,435 tons * Material recycled and/or reused; **Includes materials accepted at the Dover -Foxcroft facility as well as materials delivered by individuals directly to a Bangor scrap metal facility.

Perfor mance standards, including the T own's guaranteed annual tonnage, were established based on the Town 's historical trash tonnage and anticipated growth. The Town must address solid waste disposal in anticipation of the March 31, 2018 contract termination with the Penobscot Energy Recovery Company. Currently, the Municipal Review Committee, consi sting of 187 communities including Dover -Foxcroft, are researching future options for solid waste disposal and recycling. Overall, t he Dover -Foxcroft Solid Waste and Recycling facility should be adequate for serving the needs of the community and the regio n for the foreseeable future . Anticipated capital needs include equipment replacements and upgrades to the demolition wood storage area. The Town would like to increase recycling because the sale of recyclable increases revenue and decreases the amount of solid waste to be disposed of, thereby decreasing disposal costs. Efforts are underway to increase publicity and find incentives to encourage more recycling. The Town has discussed a \"pay -as-you-through\" system, but is uncertain about public support for t his type of system. An increase in commercial haulers fees would provide a monetary incentive, since recycling is free. Section 8.6 Water District68 The Dover -Foxcroft Water District is a quasi -municipal corporation established by the Maine Legislature to serve the Town with water for domestic and fire protection purposes. The District operates with a charter, which was updated on March 24, 2004. A fiv e-member Board of Trustees elected by the citizens of Dover -Foxcroft oversees the District's operations. Staff includes a full -time superintendent, 3 full -time employees and 1 seasonal/part - time employee. Funding comes largely from revenues collected by th e District as usage fees. Grants and bonds are sought when needed to pay for capital improvements. The annual budget is about $744,000. The District serves approximately 3,000 people within the urban area ( See Map 11 Water and Sewer Systems in the Volume I Appendices ). There are 917 active services (customers), with the following breakdown of services by type of user: residential 733; commercial 146; industrial 4; and governmental 34. There are 148 public fire hydrants and water capacity for firefighting is adequate. The District's capacity is about 670,000 gallons per day. Excess capacity is about 61% of total capacity at about 410,000 gallons per day. Estimated average daily water use is 230,000 gallons per day with a peak use of about 260,000 gallons per day. The Water District office is located at the Town Office complex at 48 Morton Avenue, Suite B. The District's water treatment plant is located at 70 Fletcher Road. The treatment plant was constructed in 1988 and currently operates at about 39% of its total capacity. Water treatment consists of filtration and chlorination. The design capacity of the treatment system is 800,000 gallons per day, with approximately 17% or 130,000 gallons per day dedicated to the clarifier and filter backwashing requiremen ts. The population's consumption has been steady for the last several years at roughly 230,000 gallons per day with peaks up to about 260,000. The District's water source is Salmon Pond in Guilford. The pond has a source watershed of 920 acres, a surface area of about 70 acres, a maximum depth of about 14 feet, and an estimated water volume in storage of 22.8 million gallons (top foot of pond depth). 68 Matthew Demers, Superinten dent Dover and Foxcroft Water Distr ict: 207 -564-2310 Solid Waste and Recycling Facility Equipment Bucket Loader 2005 Waste Oil Furnace 2006 Excel Horizontal Baler 2006 Container s open top (2) Truck 2001 Arco Roto Phase Nissan Forklift 2006 Roto Phase Ramjet Compactor s 2006 (2) Floor Scale 3400HD Vertical Baler 2006 Storage Trailer s (2) 3400HD Vertical B aler 2007 Air Compressor Dump truck (solid waste) Waste Oil Pump 2007 Container s 1995 (2) Freon Evacuator Container s 2003 (2) Space Heater Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 122 There are two standing water tanks, one located at the treatment plant and the other near the Town 's airpor t on Reservoir Avenue. The tank located at the treatment plant is approximately 214,000 gallons. The Reservoir Avenue standpipe has the capacity of 800,000 gallons and controls the system's pumping and production based upon the standpipe level. When the standpipe level reaches a predetermined level, a variable speed drive pump located at the treatment plant will begin moving water from the treatment plant standpipe into the distribution system. Water being pumped in excess of the system demand, backs up i nto the Reservoir Avenue standpipe until it reaches a predetermined level. At the full level, the variable frequency drive pump at the plant shuts down. The District works on an ongoing basis to maintain and upgrade the water treatment plant and storage an d transmission system. Work completed over the past several years has included: capital improvements and upgrades to the treatment plant, maintenance on water towers, upgrades and replacements of mains and services, replacem ents and addition of hydrants, and installation of meters and an automatic meter reading system. The District also replaced its F -150 truck and tractor loader/backhoe. Funding for these projects comes from grants, loans and/or the District user fees (capital account) depending on the pro ject. The District is developing a 15 -year plan for future upgrades. To date, the plan includes the following: continued replacement and upgrade of mains; upgrade and addition of hydrants; purchase of a GIS system (software and equipment); ongoing maintena nce, repairs and upgrades to the treatment plant; purchase a new computer (recording data and controls); upgrade of the alarm system; maintenance and upgrades on sludge handling (lagoons and settling tank); computerization of job/work order and inventory p rogram; creation of a District web site with customer service interaction capability; set -up for debit and credit card payments; computer replacements; and replacement of lawn tractor, dump truck, utility truck and \u00bd ton truck on a regular replacement sched ule. Costs for this work have not yet been calculated, but funding will likely come from state and federal loan programs (United State Department of Agriculture Rural Development and State Drinking Water Revolving Loan Program), and user fees. None of the improvements above entail line extensions or an expansion of the service area. The District does not participate in line extensions, but the District may opt to take over the line if meets District specification and is in the best interest of the District . The District also does not have a policy that requires hook -up if a water line runs past or nearby a particular location. Section 8.7 Wastewater Department69 Dover -Foxcroft 's Wastewater Department is responsible for managing the Town 's centralized was tewa ter collection and treatment system. The Department has a full -time director and two full -time employees and one part-time employee . The annual budget is about $721,285 (ope rating, m aintenance plus debt). The office and wastewater treatment facility are lo cated at 478 Vaughn Road. The facility went on -line in 1991. The wastewater facility's service area includes all of the urban area (See Map 11 Water and Sewer Systems in the Volume I Appendices) . There are about 956 users of the system, including 766 resi dential, 159 commercial, 29 gov ernmental and 2 industrial users . About 90% of households in the urban area are served . The system has considerable capacity to serve additional wastewater, including from new users, and is generally in excellent condition. T he Town adopted a sewer ordinance in 2010 that requires the owner of any habitable building situated within the service area and within 200 feet of an existing public sewer main to connect to the public sewer. 69 William Littlefield, Director, Wastewater Department; Phone 564 -3905; w_littlefield@hotmail.com Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 123 The wastewater treatment plant is a three -stage secondary wastewater treatment facility with a design flow of 800,000 gallons per day with an average actual flow of 400,000 gallons per day. Treated wastewater is discharged into the Piscataquis River. The treatment plant includes a pretreatment operati on to screen and remove grit, which is followed by three aerated lagoons operated in series, chlorination, and dechlorination. Recent improvements to the system have included: two sludge drying reed beds in 2006, a new screenings system put on line in 2007 and an upgrade to lagoon #1 from surface aeration to fine bubble diffusers in 2012. Accumulated sludge has been removed from each of the lagoons over the past several years. According to the director the wastewater treatment facility is running as designe d although the equipment and buildings are starting to show some wear. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 21.3 miles (112,418 linear feet) of gravity sewer mains and force mains, three wastewater pump stations and over 550 sewer man holes. To date, all of the Town - owned collection system has been upgraded to new PVC pipe, which means the Town should not need to address any major upgrades for at least 75 years. In addition to the public collection system, the Department oversees 15.1 m iles (79,582 linear feet) of sewer service lines. Some of these service lines are substandard resulting in problems such as sewer blockages and surcharge -induced flooding. The Department encourages owners of these substandard lines to upgrade them to elimi nate problems and prevent costly and inconvenient service calls. All pubic storm drains are disconnected from the sanitary sewer system. Constructed emergency bypass points were installed in the collection system to minimize damage from surcharge -induced flooding in . While no surcharge -induced flooding has occurred in recent years, excess infiltration and inflow can still impact the operating efficiency of the system. Recent improvements to the collection system have included the Central Street tie -in, West Main Street area (mainly sewer service road crossings); a new sewer system for the Moosehead Manufacturing redevelopment project; and replacement of sewer line in th e Lincoln Street/Davis Street area. The Bear Hill and West Main Street Pump stations were also upgraded, which has reduced power consumption and maintenance. Other improvements have included the Main Pump Station Upgrade Project and clean up at Bear Hill a nd West Main Pump Stations. Septic tank waste is disposed by p rivate contract septic haulers. The wastewater facility is not licensed to receive septic tank waste, but there is some discussion about becoming licensed to do so in the future. The following i s a list of p ossible future extensions of the sewer mains , if future development makes these extensions cost -effective: Route 15, south of Bear Hill Road Bear Hill Road Route 7, South of Pine Crest Business Park (pump station required) Pine Street, west o f Bea Street Intersection (pump station needed) Route 15, west of Plaza (pump station needed) North Street, north of Whittier Street (pump station needed) Summer Street, east of Sco oter's (pump station needed) Vaughn Road, east of the t reatment plant (pump station needed) Essex Street, east of Oak Street (pump station needed) Park Street, west of Pleasant Meadows Grove Street, f rom Sandy Lane to South Street Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 124 The Department has identified the following capital needs for the next decade: upgrade of lagoon s #2 & #3 aeration system s for electricity conservation ; upgrade/ replacement of the s torage building heating system; and paving driveway and parking area . Areas designated for future growth and development should consider those areas must easily served by t he sewer system. The capacity of the system to serve additional development should be used as an incentive for development. Section 8.8 Storm Water Management System Dover -Foxcroft's storm water system consists primarily of roadside ditches, and catch bas ins and drainage pipes along state roads and most Town roads in the urban area. The Maine Department of Transportation is responsible for the storm drain system within the right -of-way of state roads including: East Main Street from its intersection with Bear Hill Road to the bridge (by Mayo Mill); West Main Street from the bridge to the Foxcroft Plaza; South Street from its intersection with Main Street to the driveway of Pine Crest Industrial Park; North Street from its intersection with Main Street to its intersection with Whittier Street; and Summer Street from its intersection with North Street to the Scooter s Service Center . The Town's storm drain system include s, but is not limited to , sections o f Pleasant Street, Bear Hill Road, Essex Street, Court and Lawrence Streets, Lincoln Street, Spring Street, P ark Street, Winter Street, Morton Avenue, and Harrison Street. Private systems include , but are not limited to , Foxcroft Plaza, Foxcroft Academy, and the Mayo Regional Hospital. The Public Works Depart ment collaborates with the Wastewater Treatment Department in maintaining the Town -owned stormwater system in the urban area. Most of the T own's storm water system in the urban area is comprised of the old abandoned sewer system. The time of risk for flood ing occurs between the months of December and April, when there is a chance of heavy rains coupled with frozen ground conditions or a rapid and large melting of snow. Generally , this only happens once a year . The Town works to address issues as they arise. With current use patterns fairly stable, the existing system generally works satisfactorily . However, t he system is old, dating back to the 1920s, and if a new significant user of the system were to be operating during the time of risk (Dec ember through April) there would be concern for the system's capacity . Climatic trends with more violent storm events can also increase the threat of emergency situations. The Town should conduct a study of the Town -owned urban area storm water system to prioritize future upgrades . Section 8.9 Emergency Services: Planning, Management, Ambulance, Police and Fire Protection Emergency 9 -1-1 System (E 911), Dispatch and Response Times Dover -Foxcroft has a complete E -911 Addressing and Management System including an add ressing ordinance, address ing agent and reporting system.

PCRCC is located within the secure perimeter of the County Jail located at 52 Court Street in Dover -Foxcroft. Emergency Planning and Hazard Mitigation Emergency planning and hazard mitigation in Piscataquis County is most likely to involve natural disaster s such as winter storms, extreme cold, flooding, wildfires, and severe thunderstorms. Examples of man -made emergencies include threats to school security, structure and grass fires, hazardous materials spills, and flu pandemics. Flooding can be a problem in Dover -Foxcroft during major flood events. The Town is currently working on a flood emergency action plan that includes addressing issues associated with three dams on tributaries to the Piscataquis River. Dover -Foxcroft participates in the Federal Emerg ency Management Agency Flood Insurance Program, which is designed to assure appropriate use of floodplains to reduce the risk of property loss. As a participating town, residents are eligible to purchase subsidized flood insurance, which is often required when applying for a loan or mortgage for property located on a floodplain. Piscataquis County Emergency Management Agency (PCEMA)70 In general, emergency management responsibilities are shared by all levels of government. The state Emergency Management Age ncy does not replace local police, fire, ambulance, Red Cross, or other emergency response groups, but serves to coordinate response and recovery in declared disasters when more than one agency is responding to a threat. PCEMA, based in Dover -Foxcroft, coo rdinates emergency response when a disaster extends beyond the mutual aid boundaries of a town, or when several towns are involved. PCEMA also serves as the link between towns and the state during a disaster. The county director also provides guidance, pla nning models, home study courses, and workshops on emergency management to local communities and their emergency management staff. State law requires that towns and other political subdivisions use all their available resources to the maximum extent possi ble to minimize loss of life and damages to public and private property in an emergency. When the resources of local government, the private sector, and volunteer agencies are inadequate, or it is evident they will be exhausted, a request for assistance is made through the community's normal mutual aid avenues. When these resources are also exhausted, the county emergency management agency director is notified and requests additional aid from the state. Dover -Foxcroft's Emergency Management System71 The Dove r-Foxcroft Police Chief serves as the Town's Emergency Management (EMA) Director who oversees the emergency management system and is the local representative to the PCEMA. Piscataquis County is currently working on a County Emergency Operations Plan which will include Dover -Foxcroft. Dover -Foxcroft's EMA Director represents the Town in collaborating with other agencies in emergency management and during emergencies. These agencies include: Dover -Foxcroft Police, Fire and Public Works Departments; Mayo Hospi tal and Ambulance; the Piscataquis County Sherriff's Department, the Red Cross, and state agencies (Maine Warden's Service, Maine State Police, Maine Forest Service, Maine Emergency Management Association). Designation of emergency shelters and warming ce nters is an important part of emergency management. Locations in Dover -Foxcroft available as emergency shelters and/ or warming centers include the Dover -Foxcroft 70 http://www.piscataquis.us/Pages/ema Dover II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 126 Fire Station and the Dover -Foxcroft Town Office Complex. The Dover -Foxcroft Police Department and Foxcroft Academy are other locations that could be utilized for emergencies. All of these facilities except the Town Office Complex have generators to provide power during outages. Emergency agencies statewide continually work to improve emergency se rvices through the use of technology. One recent endeavor has been use of specialized software (Stillman Program) to streamline and improve data - sharing. Penobscot and Piscataquis counties have been working together to implement the system, which may take several years to achieve the desired results. Adequate communications systems are critical to emergency s ervices. There are a number of dead spots where there is no radio coverage in very rural areas of Piscataquis County. One of these areas is at Sebec L ake in Dover - Foxcroft and neighboring Sebec. Additional communicati ons towers and other equipment are needed. Dover -Foxcroft Police Protection Police protection for Dover -Foxcroft is provided by the Dover -Foxcroft Police Department, in coordination with the Piscataquis County Sheriffs' Department (also located in Dover -Foxcroft), and the Maine State Police. The Dover -Foxcroft Police Department al so has mutual aid agreements with Brownville, Milo and Greenville. Dispatch for the Town's police service is handled cooperatively between the Piscataquis County Regional Communications Center and the Dover -Foxcroft Police Department. Dover -Foxcroft Polic e Department dispatch is utilized f rom 8:00 a.m. to noon weekdays. The Pis cataquis County Regional Commun ications Center handles dispatch the rest of the time - from noon to 8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 -hours per day on weekends. The Police Department prov ides twenty -four hour police coverage. The Department consists of a full -time Police Chief, a full -time Lieutenant, a full -time Sergeant and two full -time Patrolmen. Each of the officers in the full - time positions has received at least the state -mandated t raining, which is a 16 -week course at the Maine Criminal Justice Academy. There are also 15 part -time officers who have each received the state -mandated minimum of one hundred hours of instruction at the state police academy. The part -time officers are emp loyed on an ad hoc basis in case of emergency or for coverage of special events. The positions of office administrator/ patrolman and animal control officer are both part -time permanent. This current level of staffing should be adequate for the foreseeable future given projected slow population and economic growth for the next decade. The Department has been successful in getting a number of grant s, most notable are the followin g: OUI enforcement (funding for staffing) , enforcement of underage drinking (fu nding for staffing), video camera system; and a new K -9 Unit. Some of the Department's special programs include: programs in schools ; specialized training for businesses with liquor licenses , specialized training for crisis intervention teams , and c ollabo ration in the Piscataquis County prescription drug take -back program . The Police Department is located in a renovated historic home on 182 East Main Street. The Town purchased the building in 2002 and then renovated it to accommodate the Police Department. Office space not utilized by the Department is rented to the local probation department and the apartment is rented to local residents. The house was built 1821 and is a 2 -story, 1,752 square foot building with a 1 story addition of 624 square feet. A hard-wired generator was recently added to the facility. Future needs for the building include : replacement windows ; floors ; and a roof for the generator. The Department would also like to have a garage to house its cruisers. A utility trailer was purchased recently for storage of on -the-road equipment. The Department presently has four vehicles: two marked cruisers and two unmarked. These vehicles are the standard types for police operations, with rugged transmissions, heavy -duty brakes and tires, etc. New units are obtained, when funding is made availab le through the state -purchasing agency that obtains discounts through Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 127 mass purchasing. The vehicles are equipped with standard police gear, such as radios, lights, and a lapt op computer. The Town's purchasing program involves replacing two of the cruisers every three years (these cruisers are used for daily operations). The other two cruisers (1980s) were purchased with grant funding, and will be replaced using grant funds, when needed. The Department is funded through the annual Town budget which i s typically around $450,000. Supplementary funding for specific projects is received from the federal government for limited time periods. Once federal funding ends, the projects must either be discontinued or made good by addition to the Town budget. Fede ral funding does impose additional administrative overhead for which not all costs are provided. As funds become available, new computers and software are purchased. The Department actively seeks grants to fulfill its equipment needs. The largest single ca pital need is replacement of cruisers . The Department will seek grants for two of the cruisers. Overall maintenance of equipment and keeping up with technology are other capital expenses. The number of police calls per year has fluctuated over the years as displayed in the Table 8-7. Overall, the Department seeks to provide community police services with an emphasis on prevention. The issues that continue to be of greatest concern are domestic abuse and drug abuse, and related c rimes such as thefts and burglaries. Dover -Foxcroft Fire Department72 The Dover -Foxcroft Fire Department is a division of municip al government. Fire suppression and prevention, and rescue service are the primary functions of the Department. Fire protection and rescue service is provided on a twenty -four hour basis. The Department operates on an annual budget of around $143,000. The Department is an all -volunteer body consisting of a Chief, a Deputy Chief, an Assistant Chief, two Captains, two Lieutenants and 36 regular firefighters. There are four reserve and three cadet firefighters as well as a safety officer. All regular members of the Department are trained to state standards and undergo two hours of additional training each month. Firefighters are paid f or calls and training. All personnel meet on the first Monday of the month at the fire station. Fire dispatch is handled by the Piscataquis County Regional Communications Center. The D epartment has written mutual aid agreements with all towns in Piscataqui s County and with some towns just across line in Penobscot County. As many of these small towns continue to lose population it becomes more and more difficult for them to maintain their own firefighting capabilities . As a result the Dover -Foxcroft Departme nt has had to provide basic response capability for more communities . The situation also means the Department may not be able to depend on neighboring towns for assistance in the future. In general, recruiting new volunteer firefighters is challenging bec ause volunteers must balance participation with jobs, family and other commitments; the travel distances associated with jobs and response to calls; and the mandated training requirements. Fortunately, the Dover -Foxcroft Department has been able to maintai n its 72 Fire Chief, Joseph Guyotte Police Department Equipment Unmarked Cruisers (2) Radio - Office Marked Cruisers (2) Radios (2) - Cruiser BulletProof Vests (17) Radio - Repeater Extender Cruiser Video Cams (2) Tasers (3) Office Telephone Video Camera Computers Digital Cameras Copier Roll Bar Cage (2) Office Furniture Handgun, Rifle Office Work Stations Radios Chief, Lieut.

At the moment, the entire department is made up of volunteers, with members at their jobs spread over a wide area and response capabilities changing throughout the day. As previously stated in the 2005 Comprehensive Plan, there is a growing need for a full -time Fire Chief to handle the administrative workload, including attending seminars and responding to government mandates, and the need for a firefighter/driver at the station at all times to respond to calls more quickly. This full-time coverage would not only improve fire response times, but also decrease insurance costs for homes and business . The Fire Department maintains a station at 105 East Main Street in downtown Dover -Foxcroft. The Fire Station is a 5,880 square foot, 2 story brick building with an 896 square foot addition for offices in the back . The main building was constructed in 1927, and the addition was added in 1955. There are five bays. In 2000 the T own purchased the adjoining property and building to allow for increased parking space i n and around the downtown area. Over the years a number of improvements have been made to the building, including the recent installation of a sprinkler system. The Department plans a number upgrades to fire station, such as a fire alarm system, air exhaust system, and a washer -dryer. Additional space for equipment was also identified as a need. Teaching fire prevention in the schools is a top priority for the De partment . Fire Department personnel visit with about 400 students in grades K -4 at SeDoMoCha each year to teach students about smoke detectors, a safe exit out of their homes and getting them out alive. This effort appears to have paid off, with an overall decreasing number of structure fires per year. Water supply for firefighting is generally adequate . A new dry hydrant was installed near Moosehead Apartments. The Water District has an ongoing program to replace and add fire hydrants. The Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating system is a tool the insurance industry uses to measure quantitatively the adequacy of three major elements of a municipality's fire suppression system : the fire department, the emergency dispatch system, and the public water supply. The rating consists of a rela tive scale from 1 to 10, with 1 representing the best possible fire suppression system and 10 representing less than minimum recognized protection. A higher rating generally translates to a lower cost for fire insurance for the community's residents, businesses, and others. Dover -Foxcroft's ISO rating is 5. The 956 1985 GMC Utility Rescue Van contains 8 air packs, extra tanks, the portable cascade air system, the Jaws of Life and other extraction equipment. In 2003, the Department received a Federal Fire Grant to replace its 20 year old set of the \"Jaws of Life\" plus support air bags. This grant also allowed for the upgrade and replacement of the Department's air packs. Eight new sets of air bags, as well as fifteen new s ets of turnout gear with coat, pants, boots and helmets were purchased. The Department also has a snowmobile, rescue sled, and a 16 -foot boat and trailer.

The Fire Chief noted the following trends: The Department is responding to more mutual aid calls due to manpower shortages in other communities. There is an increase in medical calls and motor vehicle calls. The number of structure fires is down, probably due to preventative efforts. Section 8. 10 Thompson Free Library73 The Thompson Free Library, located at 186 East Main Street, was established in 1897 by Dr. Elbridge A. Thompson . Thompson also established a trust fund for the purchase of books and reading materials. The Library deed was presented to the Town in 1898. The Library has continued to grow over the past 100 years including major addition s completed in 1972 and 2006 . The L ibrary is an independent entity with close links to Town government. It is governed by a group of 25 volunteers who serve as members of the Library Association. A seven -member Executive Committee, with six members elected by the Association and one member elected by the Town of Dover -Foxcroft, meet regularly and act as the administrative body of the Library. The L ibrary has two full -time and three part time employees, and a number of volu nteers. On an annual basis the T own raises about $160,000 for the library. Other funding comes from the Thompson trust fund and grants, donations and fund raising. The Library is free to Dover -Foxcroft residents and requires a modest yearly membership fee for non -residents (currently $20 per year) . Library hours are: Tuesday and Thursday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Wednesday and Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Saturday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Library collection has over 35,000 books, 700 audio books, 2,500 movies, and 45 subscriptions to magazines and newspapers. Almost any book can be borrowed using interlibrary loan through the Bangor Public Library. The Library is also a member of the Maine Infonet Download library, which provides patrons with access to over 5,300 e -books and 2,200 audio books. The library's 4,200 patrons borrowed over 45,000 items locally, 900 e -books, 400 downloadable audio books and almost 500 books thr ough interlibrary loan (2011/12 Town Report). The Maine Room has a large collection of Maine and town histories and is home to an extensive genealogy collection that includes many local family histories. Patrons can search the Piscataquis Observer on micro film from 1838 through 2012. The Maine School and Library Network provides the library with free high -speed internet and wireless capabilities. There are three public access desktops and 6 laptops at the library. Library patrons have access to many databas es, including Ancestry.com for Libraries using Maine MARVEL. Learning Express has many on -line tutorials. 73http://www.thompson.lib.me.us ; and Thompson Free Library Report, Dover -Foxcroft Town Report (2010/12) Helen Fogler Table 8-9 Fire Department Calls (Number of Calls by 2011/12 FY 2012/13 FY 2013/14 Public Service (power lines, trees down, floods, basements, etc.) 23 - - 30 Vehicle Accidents 20 21 21 6 Mutual Aid Calls 17 10 18 16 Emergency Alarm Activation 14 23 13 30 Medical Assists 13 17 8 25 Structure Fires 9 8 20 7 Chimney Fires 9 4 5 4 Hazardous Materials Response 4 1 1 4 Appliance/Furnace Malfunction 3 2 2 1 Grass/ Brush/Woods Fires 3 7 8 6 Vehicle Fires 3 - - 12 Rescues 2 7 1 3 Tree on Wires - 13 23 11 Bomb Threats 0 0 24 0 Total 120 113 120 155 Source: Town Reports, Chief Joseph Guyotte, Dover -Foxcroft Fire Department, 2015 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 130 Library programs include: 1) Story Hour is every Thursday morning at 10:30 a.m. ; 2) LEGOS Group meets the 2nd and 3rd Tuesday of the month from 3:30 - 4:30 p.m. ; 3) Reading Group meets the 2nd Thursday of every month at 6:00 p.m. ; and 4) James Brown lecture series presents lectures on topics related to history, literature and cultur e, areas of the humanities.

Section 8. 11 Cemeterie s74 Dover -Foxcroft maintains eleven cemeteries (Table 8-10). The inventory indicates there is adequate burial space for the next several decades. There are 1,600 burial spaces available for purchase at this time, and an additional 5.5 acres of unsurveyed land in existing cemeteries. The unsurveyed land could accommodate an estimated 6,050 casket burials or up to 18,150 cremation burials (1 casket burial space can be used for 3 cremation burials). There is also burial space available in purchased lots.

Looking ahead long -term, the Town may want to consider purchase of land for a cremation -only cemetery. The Cemetery Department is responsible for cemetery maintenance. The Department has one full -time Maintenance Forman , seven part -time seasonal/mowing maintenance crew members and two permanent part -time seasonal/mowing maintenance crew members. Section 8.12 Electrical Service Electrical Service is provided to approximately 2,900 customers within Dover - Foxcroft by Centra l Maine Power (CMP). CMP maintains one substation within community and services over 115 miles of line. Three phase power is available in many of the urban areas , and extends out into rural areas along the following roads: Vaughn Road; Milo Sebec Lake; and Guildford Road (Routes 6/15/16) to Fletcher Road. Section 8.13 Communications Internet Service Expansion of high -speed internet service in Maine is evolving rapidly, because it is crucial to the economic prospe rity of the state and, in particular, to rural communities like Dover -Foxcroft. The backbone of this service is the recently completed Three Ring Binder project, which provides a 1,100 mile high -speed fiber -optic network in three loops extending from south ern Maine, westward to Rumford and Farmington, eastward to Calais, and northward to Fort Kent and Van Buren. A portion of the network extends from Newport, through Dover -Foxcroft to Millinocket. The goal is to provide 1 gigabyte per second of internet conn ectivity for both downloading from and uploading to the internet. This compares to common DSL Internet speeds of 3 to 6 megabits per second, which would make the new service more than a hundred times faster. Currently, the issue for Dover -Foxcroft and many other communities along the network, is connecting to the high -speed network, and then providing access to companies and residents town -wide.

The following is a preliminary list of scenic resources: Piscataquis River - views from the downtown, bridges, parks, roads and streets Sebec Lake - views from public roads, Peaks Kenney State Park, the town beech, etc. Other Ponds - views from public accesses and public roads Views of Mount Katahdin from public roads Views of smaller mountains and rolling rural topography from public roads Views of farms, farmland and forestland from public roads Views of the historic downtown and buildings from public spaces Gateway views from roads coming into the urban areas, and at town lines This preliminary list of scenic resources can be expanded to include those scenic resources that are most highly - valued by residents and area businesses, particularly those that reply on tourism and recreation . The following criteria can be used to prioritize scenic resources: Accessibility - must be visible to the general public from a public way, public recreation area or other publicly accessible location Uniqueness - unique or rare features can be particularly important Distance of view or viewshed - relates to size of view, view of only a few feet is less importa nt than a view of several miles 90 Scenic areas are considered \"criti cal rural areas\" under Maine's Growth Management Act. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 143 Enhancing and Protecting Important Scenic Resources The Town could complete an inventory of its high -value scenic resources to include photographs, descriptions, and locations on a map. Inventory information can be used to obta in grants, such as gateway grants, for permitting to provide guidance on how development can be loca ted to preserve high -value resources to the greatest extent practicable. Other consideration s could include locating ridgeline development so it is not visi ble from a distance, or utilizing vegetative screening and setbacks along road corridors. Lighting c an be designed to prevent glare, protect adjacent properties, and preserve the night sky. In locations with very high scenic value landowners can be encoura ged to use conservation easements. There is some consideration for scenic resources in the state mandated subdivision and shoreland zoning laws. Proposed subdivisions cannot have an undue adverse impact on scenic or natural beauty of the area. Development in shoreland zones must conserve shore cover, and visual as well as actual points of access to inland waters and conserve natural beauty and open space. These provisions provide general guidance on what is to be considered in reviewing proposed projects, b ut do not identify or more specifically describe, the scenic areas or views to be protected. Scenic resources would receive greater protection if they were identified and described. Section 9.10 Recreational Grants Available Through Governement Agencies The Maine Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Conservation administers state and federal grants to provide services, resources and personnel to nonprofit groups, municipalities and other agencies. Priorities for funding found on the Statewide Recreation Program (SCORP). See: http://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/publications .

Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 144 Chapter 10 - Transportation The function and condition of highways and other public roads affect economic productivity, property values, and the overall safety and convenience of citizens and businesses, which depend on a well-maintained transportation system. Ownership and maintenance responsibilities of public roads are shared between the State and Town. (See Maps 12 and 13 Transportation in the Appendices of Volume I ) Section 10.1 State Highway s State Highways form a system of inter connected routes throughout the state that primarily serve intrastate and interstate traffic . These roads are usually classified as arterials , which are typically h igh-volume roadways that link major cities and towns an d developed areas . The arterials in Dover -Foxcroft are minor arterials (see Table 10-1). The rural portions of these roads are expected to provide relatively high overall traffic speeds with minimum interference to through traffic. Maintaining arterial tra ffic flow through urban areas and downtowns often means balancing conflicting uses of the highway. The rural portions of three of Dover -Foxcroft's arterials are classified as mobility corridors. Mobility corridors connect service centers, have posted speed s of at least 40 mph, and carry a considerable amount of traffic. To maintain the carrying capacity of these important corridors, MaineDOT regulates driveway and entrance access to these roads that is more stringent on other state highways. Dover -Foxcroft 's mobility corridors include Route 15 (Bangor Road and Guilford Road) and Route7 (Dexter Road). Table 10 -1 State Highways and State Aid Highways in Dover -Foxcroft Highway Name (State Route) Jurisdiction Federal Functional Classification Total Length (Miles) State Routes 6/15/16 (West Maine Street and Guilford Road) State Hwy Minor Arterial 2.40 State Route 7 (South Street, Dexter Road) State Hwy Minor Arterial 6.72 State Route 15 (East Main Street, Bangor Road) State Hwy Minor Arterial 8.39 State Route 6 North Street, Summer Street, Milo Road State Hwy Minor Arterial 3.88 State Highway Total Mileage 21.39 Pine Street/ Sangerville Road State Aid Major Collector 1.31 Greeley Landing Road and North Street (State Route 153) State Aid Major Collector 4.6 State Park Road State Aid Minor Collector 0.77 Essex Street State Aid Minor Collector 0.14 Vaughn Road State Aid Minor Collector 2.54 East Dover Road State Aid Minor Collector 0.71 Range Road State Aid Minor Collector 1.52 State -Aid Highways Total Mileage 11.59 Source: Maine Department of Transportation, April 2015 ( loralyn.l.clark@maine.gov ) MaineDOT is responsible for year -round maintenance o n the 21.39 miles of State Highways in Dover -Foxcroft. State Highways include State Routes 6, 7, 15 and 16. The exception in year -round maintenance responsibility is in the Town's urban area, where the Town is responsible for winter maintenance of 3.98 miles of State Highways located in the urban compact area, which are: State Route 6 - West Main Street, from a point 0.77 mile s west of Sanford S treet to a point on Summer Street 0.13 miles north of Free St reet, a distance of 2.43 miles. State Route 7 (South St reet) from State Route 15 (East Main Street) to Grove St reet, a distance of 0.65 miles . Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 145 State Route 15 (East Main St reet) from State Route 6 (West Main Street) east to Bear Hill Road, a distance of 0.90 miles. State Aid Highways connect local roads to the State Highway System and generally serve intra -county traffic. There are 11.59 miles of State Aid Highways in Dover -Foxcroft (See Table 10-1). State Aid Highways were designated to be maintained by the State in the summer and the by the Town in the winter. However, recent reductions in the share of state funding for state -aid highways have shifted increasingly more of the summer maintenance responsibility to the towns. Highway Capacity and Levels of Service Level of Service (LOS) data provided by the MaineDOT provide a measure of the capacity of roads to handle current levels of traffic. LOS data characterize traffic conditions based on travel speeds, travel times, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and the perceptions of motorists and passengers. There are six levels of service, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F the worst. LOS E is defined as the maximum flow or capacity of a system. For most purposes, however, a level of C or D is usually used as the maximum acceptable volume. As displayed on Maps 12 and 13 Transportation (See Appendices for Volume I ), most of Dover -Foxcroft 's highways and roads function at LOS A or LOS B . The exceptions where there is a LOS C include: mos t of West Main Street; North Street between its intersection with Summer Street and its intersection with West Main Street; and West Maine Street across the Main Street Bridge to the South Street intersection. There a two LOS D locations: a sort segment of West Main Street where it approaches its intersection with North Street and a short segment of South Street at its intersection with East Main Street. Reconfiguration of the intersection of South Street and East Main Street to accommodate large trucks wou ld vastly improve the level of service in the downtown. The levels of service in the downtown are also affected by clear signage and design, including curbing, lane designations, parking, pedestrian crossings, loading/unlading areas for businesses, etc. Traffic Volumes: Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Annual average daily traffic (AADT) is a measure of traffic volume determined by placing an automatic traffic re - corder at a specific location for 24 or 48 hours; 24 -hour totals are then adjusted for seas onal variations. The most heavily traveled highways in Dover -Foxcroft (2012 counts) are as follows: Guilford Road/ ( 5,000 to 8,900 AADT), Bangor Road/ East 100 to AADT ) Dexter Road/South Street (2,500 to Road (3,100 to 6,800 AADT) North Street/Greeley Landing Road (600 to 4,400 AADT Winter Street (2,310 to 2,350 5118 ( 2,170 AADT) Tables at the end of this chapter contain the most current traffic volume data available. Major Traffic Generators Traffic in Dover -Foxcroft is generally heaviest during daytime commuter and business hours. Major traffic generators include the downtown, the Dover -Foxcroft Plaza, the Mayo Hospital complex, and the Piscataquis County offices. Both Foxcroft Academy and the SoDoMoCha School create a lot of traffic when students and staff are arriving and leaving school, and for special events. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 146 Truck traffic through Dover -Foxcroft is significant, particularly on state highways. Much of this traffic is associated with the forest products industry. Pleasant River Lumber generates a lot of traffic, including commuter traffic and truck traffic. Traffic control devices have been installed to manage the plant entrance along t he Milo Road (Rte 6/16). The CMP Bucksport LLC (IP) wood consolidation facility generates considerable truck traffic, as well. Major events create sporadic increases in traffic, such as Center Theater events, the Piscataquis Valley Fair, Kiwanis Canoe Race , Piscataquis Heritage Hot Air Balloon Festival , Whoopie Pie , Kiwanis Auction at the Fairgrounds , Homecoming/Parade/Fireworks , and Hometown Holidays and Parade . Traffic and Safety Issues MaineDOT has identified several \"high crash locations\" for the time period 2011 through 2013 . High crash locations are defined by MaineDOT as road locations where eight or more crashes occurred within a 3 -year period, where they would not otherwise be expected. These locations are displayed on the Transportation Maps, and include the following: Two section of West Main Street, one in the vicinity of the Mayo Hospital entrance and the other in the vicinity of the Foxcroft Plaza entrance. A section of the Milo Road (Route 6/16) at/near its intersection with the Hewett Road - lack of adequate visibility appears to be the problem . A segment of the Dexter Road (Route 7), between Board Eddy Road and Merrill's Mills Road intersections. Also, displayed on Map 12 are several high crash locations just beyond the Dover -Foxcroft town lines along Route 7 in Garland and Route 15 in Garland/Charleston. In addition to the MaineDOT high crash locations, the Town is also concerned about safety in several other locations including the following: Intersection of South Street and W est Main Street in the downtown, which is not adequate for truck turning movements. Corner of No rth and Summer Streets (by the Post O ffice) (identified in 2005 Comprehensive Plan) . Corner of High and South Streets (identified in 2005 Comprehensive Plan) . Intersection of Shamrock and Bangor Roads (identified in 2005 Comprehensive Plan) . Traffic Control Devices There are two traffic lights located with in downtown Dover -Foxcroft. The first is located at the intersection of South and East Main Streets, which is the junction of State Route s 7 and 15. The second is located at the corner of East Main and West Main Streets , at the junction of State Routes 15 and 6/16. State Programming of Highway Projects MaineDOT prioritizes highways and roads into six categories to be used in determining prio rities for capital improvements. The prioritization for Dover -Foxcroft roads is displayed in Table 10-2. Of note, is that the Dexter Road (Route 7) should be of equal importance as the Bangor Road, given that the Dexter Road provides the more southerly connection to the Interstate at Newport. MaineDOT's Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan (STIP) is a four year, federally required transportation capital improvement program that is required for Maine to receive Federal Hig hway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding. All projects included in the STIP have been represented in a MaineDOT Work Plan and/or have received federal approval through inclusion in a prior STIP or as an amendment to a pri or STIP. The Work Plan contains: the process for the selection of projects, a description Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 147 regarding MaineDOT's public involvement process in transportation programming, and a more detailed discussion of state and federal transportation funding than the STI P document. Table 10-2 MaineDOT Priorities for Highways and Roads Priority Description Dover -Foxcroft Highway 1 Includes Maine Turnpike, the interstate system and key principal arterials (Route 1 in Aroostook County, Airline (Route 9), Route 2 west of Newport, Route 302). The 1,400 miles of Priority 1 roads represent only 7% of total miles, but carry fully 40% of al l vehicle miles traveled in Maine. None 2 Includes non -interstate, high value arterials that represent about 4% of the total miles of road but carry 11% of overall traffic. Bangor Rd. (Rt. 15) Guilford Rd. (Rt. 6/15/16 3 Generally includes the remainin g arterials and most significant major collectors. These 2,050 miles represent only 9% of miles, but carry 19% of the traffic. Dexter Rd. (Rt. 7) Milo Rd. (Rt. 6/16) 4 Generally includes the remainder of major collectors, often part of the state aid syst em where road responsibilities are shared between the state and towns. These 1,900 miles represent about 8% of total miles, and carry 10% of the traffic. Greeley's Landing Rd. (Rt. 153) Pine Street 5 Includes 2,500 miles of minor collectors, almost all o n state aid system. They represent 11% of miles, but carry only 7% of traffic. Vaughn Rd., then East Dover Rd to Range Rd., and east on Range Rd. 6 Includes 14,300 miles of local roads and streets that are year -round responsibility of towns. They carry 13% of the statewide traffic and make up 61% of total miles. All other public roads Source: MaineDOT at http://www.maine.gov/mdot/about/assets/glossary/ Table 10-3 contains the work plan for calendar years 2014 through 2017.

This should include: o Upgrade of East Maine Street and the Dexter Road (Route 7) from the traffic signal downtown to the Pine Crest Business Park to include road reconstruction and related downtown improvements, such as moving overhead utilities to improve aesthetics, sidewalk and other pedestrian amenities, and other improvements identified in downtown economic development plans. o Upgrade of Route 7 (Dexter Road) between Board Eddy Road and Merrills Mills Road, the low -lying section of the road with wetlands on both sides; sect ion is also identified as a high crash location. Reconfiguration of the downtown intersection of South Street and Main Street to more safely accommodate truck traffic. Scenic Byway s91 There are no actively maintained scenic byways running through Dover -Foxcroft. The remnants of a \"Katahdin Trail\" are several signs along Route 7 in Dover -Foxcroft. The two scenic byways in the Highlands Region listed on the MaineDOT website: Moosehead Lake Scenic Byway (formerly Seboomook) - Route 15 - Greenville to Jackman. Moosehead Katahdin Woods & Waters (formerly Grindstone) - Baxter State Park (boundary near Togue Pond) to Millinocket where it joi ns Route 11 to East Millinocket/ Medway; then north on Route 11 to Stacyville /Sherman; then north to Patten; then following Ro ute 159 through Mount Chase/ Village of Shin Pond to the northern boundary of Baxter State Park at Matagamon. The scenic byway designation has several advantages, including access to funding for improvements such as scenic overlooks, picnic and rest areas, and inform ation and directional signage, and as a tourist attraction. Connecting Dover -Foxcroft and other nearby communities to one or both of these scenic byways could be a long -term goal to promote economic development. The Importance of Dover -Foxcroft Arterials : \"Strategic Investment Plan for Corridors of Regional and Economic Significance, MaineDOT Region 4 Transportation Corridors\" (March 19, 2007)92 This study was prepared by Eastern Maine Development Corporation and several other regional councils as a part of the MaineDOT's long -range planning process. The goal was to identify land use, transportation and economic needs along Maine's most significant corridors dominated by arterial highways, but also including rail, water, air and trail connections. The recommended long -term investments were prioritized based on economic vitality, safety and security, community and environmental preservation and enhancements, and transportation system sustainability. The following are the recommendations for the Sebas tacook Valley Corridor: Improve Mobility and Safety on State Routes 7/11/15/23 from Newport to Dover -Foxcroft and Greenville: This project is to improve the efficiency and safety of the corridor. The corridor currently accommodates a mix of commuter vehic les, tourists, and heavy truck traffic. Improvements may include conducting a safety audit of the corridor and implementing access management techniques to preserve and enhance mobility and safety. This project is to address safety and mobility concerns re sulting from existing traffic levels and anticipated increases resulting from anticipated residential and commercial developed in northern Piscataquis and Penobscot Counties. 91 http://www.exploremaine.org/byways/highlands 92 http://www.hcpcme.org/transportation/needs/sipcres/SipCres031907.pdf Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 149 Tourism Infrastructure Improvements: This project is to improve tourism related t ransportation infrastructure in Piscataquis and northern Penobscot Counties such as directional, sight identification, and interpretive signage as recommended by the Piscataquis County Tourism Taskforce. Tourism has been identified as a priority strategy f or economic development in Piscataquis County. While no specific projects were recommended for Dover -Foxcroft in this report, it is an indication of the overall corridor needs and issues that still need to be addressed. Future planning for the Sebastacook Valley Corridor will entail communities working together to advocate for desired improvements on these highways. East -West Highway (Utilities and Communications) Corridor Proposals The concept of an east -west highway passing through northern New England has been around since before the 1960s. The original intent of an east -west highway was to link more remote northern communities in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont with markets in the Canadian Maritimes , Quebec , and upstate New York . The most recent proposal is for a combined highway, utilities and communications corridor. The following is a brief time -line of efforts since 1990:93 1990 - Leaders at the New England Governors -Eastern Canadian Premiers' conference in Hartford, Connecticut, recommend the creation of an east -west highway through Maine to link the Canad ian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. 1999 - A study prepared for the Maine DOT concludes the benefits of a 4-lane divided highway across Maine don't justify the costs, recommending instead that Maine work to improve existing roads. 2005 - President G eorge W. Bush signs a federal transportation bill allocating $1.1 billion to the state over the next six years, including $28 million for the east -west highway. 2007 - President and CEO of Cianbro Corp oration Peter Vigue unveiled a proposal for a toll high way from Calais to Coburn Gore, a privately -funded venture that he said was the only solution to the pressing need for a better way to cross the state. It's cost: $2.1 billion. 2012 - Governor Paul LePage signed into law a bill setting aside $300,000 to st udy the feasibility of Vigue's proposal. 2013 - Vigue supports the decision of the Maine Legislature's Transportation Committee to repeal a feasibility study for the proposed highway . He says the project could go forward anyway and a study \"is something t hat can be done and be done by a third party.\" The Transportation Committee votes unanimously to recommend repealing the $300,000 feasibility study for the proposed $2.1 billion private east -west highway. In response to the proposal the Town of Dover -Foxc roft adopted a moratorium ordinance regarding private distribution corridors to include paved highways, pipelines and high tension transmission lines on December 14, 2014. The moratorium ordinance cited the need to develop local regulations to address pote ntial threats to public health, safety, and welfare, and to protect the local economy, natural resources and ecosystems, and the overall quality of life in the community. As of this date, the east -west highway pro ponents continue to maintain a website with the proposal to create a long -term transportation, utility and communications corridor, including a privately financed toll road. The mission for the East -West Corridor Coalition is stated as follows: to make Maine the Northeast Trade Gateway ; to provide economic opportunity and vitality to Maine, the Maritimes and Quebec ; to develop a lon g-term 93 http://bangordailynews.com/2014/12/30/news/state/maine -east -west-highway -timeline Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 150 transportation, utility and communications corridor ; to improve connections to U .S. and Canadian Heartland and Atlantic Ports ; and to develop demonstration pr e-clearance border crossings .94 According to a Wikipedia citation - \"Current backers of the highway propose an east -west axis through northern and central Maine - One portion of the new highway would run from Interstate 395 in Brewer, Maine , to the Canada -United States border near Calais , with a direct link to New Brunswick Route 1 \u2014a major transportation corridor serving the Maritimes . A second would travel northwest from Interstate 95 near Waterville, Maine , to the Canada -United States border at Coburn Gor e, with a connection to a proposed extension of Quebec Autoroute 10 toward Montreal . A third would travel due west from Interstate 95 near Waterville, following the U.S. Route 2 corridor through Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and upper New York state. \" 95 While the proponents of the project appear to be stalled, and possibly considering corridors that do not pass through Dover -Foxcroft, the Town still needs to be prepared for a possible corridor proposal by developing regulations to address the Town's intere sts, including protection of the local economy, natural resources, scenic resources and other critical concerns. Section 10.2 Local Roads and Streets All public roads and streets not classified as arterials or collectors have a local classification. Local roads and streets are characterized by many points of direct access to adjacent properties and have a relatively minor role in accommodating regional and state -wide mobility. Speeds and traffic volumes are usually lower than on state and state -aid hi ghways and streets. The Town is responsible for maintenance on all Town roads and streets. There are a total of about 70.71 miles of local roads in Dover -Foxcroft. Another 3.68 miles are seasonal roads. (See Maps 12 and 13 Transportation in the Volume I Appendices ) The Town maintains an inventory of T own roads that is used to program maintenance and capital improvements. In 2010 a town -wide assessment of the Town's paved roads was completed that determined that over $2.8 million would be needed to address p aved roads in their entirety. To date, the townspeople have chosen to only invest State Local Road Assistance to upgrade town roads, which falls far short of what is needed. Table 10-4 contains the T own's inventory of its local roads. Section 10.3 Private Road and Public Easement Polices Private Roads Private roads include driveways and some subdivision roads . For purposes of the Emergency 911 system, a private road will have a name if it accesses more than one reside nce. Any private road or subdivision r oad must meet Town road standards if it is proposed to become a town road. The Town has not generally accepted any private roads as town ways due to funding constraints. The Town also has a policy that all new lots have road frontage on a road built to Tow n standards even if it is to remain a private road. Public Easement Acceptance Policy The Public Easement Acceptance Policy , administered by the Board of Selectmen, is designed to provide public access across private roads, as requested by an applicant . The policy contains qualifying density requirements such as the number of residences, and other provisions such as deed conveyance and easement requirements, and road design and constructions standards.

Seven of these bridges are the sole responsibility of the Town ; the other fourteen are MaineDOT's responsibility. Most bridges were determined to be in satisfactory to good condition as of July 2013. The Town has recen tly made repairs to its Lincoln Street Bridge, and is waiting for MaineDOT to evaluate the bridge's condition to determine if additional work is needed.

Sidewalks are designed to provide access to commercial and residential areas , recreational opportunities, and are an important safety feature along heavily used roadway s. In addition to sidewalks, crosswalks are importan t in maintaining safety for pedestrians . Crosswalks are distributed evenly across heavily used roadways at major intersections and frequent crossing areas. The importance of adequate sidewalks and pedestrian amenities was emphasized in two studies completed for Dover -Foxcroft: the Downtown Revitalization Plan and the Maine Downtown Center Report. Both studies provi de suggestions for how sidewalks and pedestrian amenities can be enhanced to improve economic viability in the downtown. In 2012 the Town applied for funding to the MaineDOT for a safe routes project involving sidewalks and curbing to increase safety for p edestrians including senior citizens, citizens with handicaps and children walking to the K - 8 school and installing warning lights on either side of the entrance to Foxcroft Academy. Specifically, the sidewa lks that need to be refurbished, reconstructed, a nd/or constructed are used by pedestrians to access the downtown business district and children going to the SeDoMoCha K -8 school. The main artery of East and West Main streets provide critical pedestrian access to the Mayo Hospital complex, numerous healt h professional services, a grocery store and numerous retail shops. Specific sidewalk needs include:96 Route 15 (Bangor Road) between Bear Hill Road and Pearl and Essex Streets - sidewalk and curb Pleasant Street between High Street and East Main Street - sidewalk and curb Route 153 (North Street between the stream and East Main Street - sidewalk and curb Autumn Avenue between North Street and the stream - sidewalk and curb Pleasant Street between Bangor Road and School Street - sidewalk Morton Avenue betw een trailer court and Summer Street - sidewalk and curb Lincoln Street at intersection with Davis Street - sidewalk Essex street between Vaughn and Maple Street - sidewalk Also - two solar powers automatic school zone warning signs on Routes 15, 16 and 6 ( West Main Street) 100 feet from the entrance to Foxcroft Academy Section 10.6 Public Parking Public parking in Dover -Foxcroft includes street -side parking in the urban area, Town -owned parking lots, and several other parking areas used by the public, but not owned by the Town. Parking lots are displayed on Map 14 in the Appendices of Volume I . An inventory of public parking in Dover -Foxcroft includes: Street -side public parking - downtown and urban areas Town -owned/ leased off -street public parking lots o Town Office Complex o Public lot adjacent to Fire Station o Public lot at Chamber of Commerce o Parking lot at Monument Square (next to Congregational Church) 96 MaineDOT Quality Community Program Transportation Enhancement and Safe Routes 2012 grant Application Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 154 o Parking lot north side of River Street Parking (a portion of this is leased) Parking associated with the Library and recreational facilities (Brown's Mill Park) Piscataquis County parking lots Other Public Agency parking lots More conveniently located public parking is needed in the downtown. This is particularly noticeable when there are special events in the downtown, such as at Center Theater. The shortage of parking will increase as activity in the downtown increases. The Town's 2003 Downtown Revitalization Plan made a number of recommendations to improve parking in the downtown, such as parking areas with paving, curbing, lighting, landscaping, signage, and improved pedestrian ways. Section 10.7 Public Transportation Intercity Bus Service There are no inter city bus services providing regular service to and from Dover -Foxcroft. The closest bus terminals are in Bangor, where Concord Trailways, Vermont Transit, and SMT/Acadian Lines offer bus service to point in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Eastern C anada. Cyr Bus Lines offers service betw een Bangor and Aroostook County and West Transportation connects Bangor and Calais. Taxi Service An internet search for taxi services in Dover -Foxcroft identified the Bragdon Taxi Service that provides services in the Bangor and Dover Foxcroft areas. Bragdon's website97 states that they provide airport (Bangor International) pick-ups and drop -offs, as well as long -distance transportation within Maine to all points in the Northeast. They also provide services for events , such as weddings and conferences. Penquis Public Transportation and Specialized Services Penquis , a social service and transportation agency based in Bangor, provides d emand response and deviated fixed -route transportation services by van and light duty bus, and through private volunteer drivers in Penobscot and Piscataquis counties. Penquis' LYNX buses and vans provide public transportation and social service tran sportation to Dover -Foxcroft. MaineCare -covered and other social service transportation is also offered in private vehicles with volunteer drivers. While open to the general public, the primary users of the service are seniors, individuals with disabilities or special needs, and those with low -incomes. LYNX scheduled stops (usually one round -trip per day) in Dover -Foxcroft are as follows:98 Dover -Foxcroft - Bangor: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday Dover -Foxcroft - Dexter: Tuesday Abbott - Dover -Foxcroft: Tuesday Brownville - Dover -Foxcroft: Friday Guilford - Wednesday - ft: Monson 97 http://bragdontaxiservice.com 98 http://www.penquis.org Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 155 Improving Transportation Options : \"Linking the Rural Regions of Four Counties in Maine to Enhance Transportation Opportunities and Improve Quality of Life Regional Public Transportat ion Initiative\" February 2014)99 This study completed by the Eastern Maine Development Corporation examined public transportation needs in Piscataquis, Penobscot, Hancock and Waldo counties. The recommendations seek to assist people in rural communities by enhancing existing transportation options and developing new ones, thereby increasing access to the greater -Bangor metropolitan area. In addition to evaluating transportation needs, the study identified existing public transportation systems and new option s for enhancing transportation options for rural areas. Some of the recommendations appear relevant, such as expansion of existing programs (Penquis), and new opportunities through programs that support ride -sharing, volunteer drivers, community ride board s, neighborhood cell -phone networks, and official/unofficial park and ride lots. To implement the recommendations the study suggests the formation of a \"Transportation Management Association .\" Dover - Foxcroft could initiate some of these programs by encoura ging local agencies, private businesses (taxis, park and ride lots) to establish programs (or continue them, if already in place), and have representation on the Association. Section 10.8 Airports and Railroads The Bangor International Airport, located about 36 minutes from Dover -Foxcroft, is the closest full -service airport. The Airport provides national and international commercial passenger and cargo service as well as civil defense operations. The airport has an 11,441 -foot main runway. Car rental services are available. The Charles A. Chase Jr. Memorial Field Airport (Location I.D.44B)100 is a public airport owned and operated by the Town of Dover -Foxcroft. The airport was activated in 1958. There are two turf runways, approximately 2,926 feet by 75 feet. The turf is in good condition. The airport is unattended, but there is a wind indicator and parking with tie downs . Aircraft operations for 12 -month period end August 2014 were: 80% transient general aviation; 13% local general aviation; and 7% military. There are no active railroad lines passing through Dover -Foxcroft. The rail road line that once existed in T own was abandoned a number of years ago. A portion of this line is owned by the State and utilized as a multi -use recreational trail. Section 10.9 Transportation Policies and Land Use Regulation Land use and transportation policies go hand -in-hand to guide future land use patterns and the costs associated with those patterns of development. Sprawling patte rns of development result in increased costs for maintaining roads and road capacity to handle traffic. Unregulated access to major roads can result in increased conflicts with driveways and decreased road capacity to handle traffic efficiently. More compa ct development allows for the more efficient use and cost -effective maintenance of the transportation system. In general, Dover -Foxcroft's policies recognize the importance of coordinating land use and transportation systems. The Land Use Ordinance in comb ination with the provision of a higher level of services in the urban area enhances many aspects of the transportation system. Urban area zoning standards that allow higher densities support infill and a continuation of a more compact area. The subdivision regulations limit direct lot access to public roads. Town infrastructure, including parking, sidewalks, and the location of public facilities in the built -up area also support more compact development. 99 http://www.emdc.org/image_upload/Final%20EMDC%20TIGER2%20corrected%208%2027%2014.pdf 100 http://www.airnav.com/airport/44B Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 156 Access Management Access management is the planned location and design of driveways and entrances to public roads to provide for safe and efficient traffic movement. The unregulated addition of driveways and access points on a highway can greatly reduce traffic speeds, traf fic safety and roadway efficiency. Access management is particularly important on the State's arterial highways where maintaining traffic flow and speed help s people and products move faster to enhance productivi ty, reduce congestion - related delays and to lessen environmental degradation. Maine's access management law is applicable to all rural state highways and state -aid highways in Dover - Foxcroft. The rules set standards (sight lines, vertical alignment, driveway width, etc.) for the construc tion of driveway entrances within MaineDOT's right -of-way, and require permits for new driveways and en trances on state roads. State permits are also required for changes in existing driveways and entrances, including changes of use, to state roads. The Town is re quired by law to inform landown ers and potential buyers of land requiring access to state roads of this permit requirement. State arterial highways and mobility corridors are subject to more stringent standards than other state highways because of their economic importance and the need to maintain the critical highway capacity of these roads. State Routes 7 and 15 (Guilford Road, Dexter Road, Bangor Road) through Dover -Foxcroft are classified by MaineDOT as a Mobility Corridors. Other state highways in Do ver-Foxcroft subject to less stringent access management regulations include the Milo Road (Route 6/16), Greeley's Landing Road (Rote 153), Pine Street, and Vaughn Road and the state -owned portions of the East Dover Road and Range Road. Many towns adopt ac cess management standards for town roads to assure that intersections have adequate sight distances, and are designed to provide for safe access to and from public roads. Access management is particularly important for major traffic generators, such as lar ge subdivisions or major commercial and industrial developments. Existing Ordinance Requirements101 The Town's Land Use Ordinance and Subdivision Ordinance contain the following provisio ns regarding the transportation. Land Use Ordinance: Traffic Access, Circulation and Parking: o All uses must be designed to promote traffic safety. o Uses subject to Site Plan Review must meet the following additional requirements: Entrance and exit driveways shall be located to afford maxim um safety to traffic. Entrance/exit design shall facilitate maximum possible sight distances. Parking and circulation, vehicle and pedestrian, shall be safe and convenient. Public and private ways shall be constructed to Subdivision Standards. Other - adequate emergency vehicle access, lighting and stormwater control facilities. Standards Applicable to Subdivisions: o Statutory criteria: will not cause unreasonable highway or public roads congestion or unsafe conditions with respect to use of highways or pu blic roads existing or proposed. o Detailed road design standards, including required sight distances for access to public ways. o No subdivision may have direct vehicular access to a state highway. o Subdivisions generating more than 200 trips per day must have two accesses to public ways . o Traffic impact analysis required for subdivisions generating more than 500 trips/day. o The only limitation on the length of dead -end streets is 1,000 feet for commercial or industrial streets. 101 See Chapter 12 Existing Land Use for more detailed discussion on land use issues. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 157 The following should be considere d to improve th ese ordinances: Assure consistency with MaineDOT regulations. Require evidence of approved MaineDOT permits with applications for town permits. Review and update road and street standards to assure adequate sizing and design while not being overbuilt. Consider provisions for pedestrians and bicycles, particularly for urban areas. Review list of uses to determine if transportation standards should be applicable to uses such as day care centers, churches, and service clubs (uses not currently s ubject to Site Plan Review). Add guidance/standards to support more interconnected development designs to limit direct access to public roads, such as along West Main Street. Add more specific guidance/standards for off -street parking and standards for loa ding and unloading areas, without discouraging development in the urban area. Update language to cover current practices, such as the frontage requirement along a driveway built to Town standards for new development on backlots. Address transportation impa cts from major projects, such as an east -west highway, to include consideration for the traffic impacts on Dover -Foxcroft.

An ongoing increase in property valuation is crucial to the fiscal health of the community. The State assessed valuation is used to measure valuation trends over time because it is annually adjusted to reflect the economy and market trends. The primary purpose of the state valuation is to provide an \"equalized\" valuation to fairly calculate state revenue sharing, state aid for educa tion, and the county tax for each town. The State valuation lags actual market values and municipal assessments by nearly two years by the time it is final and certified. In other words, the 2015 state valuation represents the full equalized value of all taxable property as of April 1, 2013. Figure 11-1 displays the State's valuations for Dover -Foxcroft for 2004 th rough 2014 (State certified for 2006 through 2016). The Town's total 2014 valuation was about $ 300.4 million according to the State . The valuati on increased by $78.2 million between 2004 and 201 5, which was an increase of 35.2 %. The valuation peaked at $318 million in 2009, and then decreased to $292.4 million for 2012. This decrease in valuation since 2009 reflects the most recent economic recess ion, with less new construction to add to the valuation. Since 2012 the Town's valuation appears to be growing again, but has still not reached the 2009 level according to the data below. Figure 11-1, Represents State V aluations from 2006 through 2016 . Source: Maine Revenue Serv ices Property Tax Division, 2016 The following analysis demonstrates why it is important that the Town's property valuation increases in th e future if it is to affordably fund government services. Basically, as the valuation decreases, the tax rate must increase just to continue to fund the existing level of services. Just keeping up with inflation alone, requires an increasing valuation.

As a result of the increa se in the amount necessary to fund government, the Town had to increase the tax rate from 13.66 to 17.65 mils. Usually, the more diverse the tax base the better able a town is able to weather fluctuations in the economy. Dover -Foxcroft has a fairly diverse tax base with a mix of residential, commercial and some industrial properties. There are also a number of tax exempt properties, which increase the tax burden on other property owners, but provide necessary services and contribute to the economy overall . Several of the Town's non -profits contribute a fee in lieu of taxes which helps support the services these organizations require from the Town. In general, new or expanded commercial and industrial development would be most beneficial to increasing the va luation. Another issue for Dover -Foxcroft is that its tax rate is higher than most surrounding communities . As displayed in Table 11 -2 Dover -Foxcroft's equalized tax rate for 2013 (17.65) was higher than tax rates for most of Dexter (15.40). Of the neighboring towns, only Atkinson had a higher tax rate (19.0). Service centers typically have higher property taxes than smaller communities because they provide more services, including services utilized by people living outside the town. Service centers are also often hosts for government agencies and other non -profits that do not pay property taxes. The result is that people may ch oose to live or develop a business in a smaller community located near a service center rather than in the service center because the taxes are less.

Source: Dover -Foxcroft Auditor's Reports In the future, property taxes will continue to provide most of the revenues needed to support Town services, which is why a growing property valuation is so important . Since increases in other sources of funding, particularly intergovernmental funding (education, revenue sharing, local road assistance, etc.) may not increase significantly, or may actua lly decrease in the future, the Town will want to continue to explore other sources of funding, new financing mechanisms, and work to expand the tax base . $0 $1,000 $2,000 $3,000 $4,000 $5,000 $6,000 2014 2015 Thousands Year Figure 11 -4 General Fund Revenues Source: Auditor's Reports Property Taxes Excise/Misc.

Section 11.3 Funding Capital Expenditures Dover -Foxcroft has a formal budgeting and six -year capital planning process. The goal is to anticipate major capital outlays, and to prioritize and schedule funding for projects in a fiscally sound manner that minimizes drastic changes in tax levels and cost -effectively manages interest payments on borrowed money. The process also allows the Town to consider a variety of funding approaches. Dover -Foxcroft strives to maintain a balanced financial approach that utilizes short -term capital outlays through current year revenues and contributions to reserve accounts and longer -term financing for large projects, such as the following: Bonding: such as through the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, USDA Rural Development, Camden National Bank, etc. (long -term debt - see Table 5) Capital equipment leases: a photocopier at $14,146 and a fire truck at $257,000 In-house loan: 2018 excavator loan to Wastewater Department , with an annual payment of $18,788 , to expire in 2018. Grants: such as through the US Housing and Urban Development (CDBG), USDA Rural Development, US Department of Homeland Security, and the US Department of Justice Special trust funds: such as for the Thompson Free Library Trust Fund Tax Increment Financing: Moosehead Redevelopment Project and P leasant River Lumber State Road Assistance Refinancing to improve interest rates $0 $500 $1,000 $1,500 $2,000 $2,500 $3,000 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thousands Year Figure 11 -6 General Fund Expenditures Source: Auditor's Reports Expenditures Education General Government Public Works & Cemeteries Public Safety Solid Waste County Tax Library/Culture/Recreation Debt Service Capital Outlay Tax Increment Financing Contingency/Abatements Welfare Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 166 Long Term De bt The Town had approximately $ 6.5 million in long term debt (principal and interest) as of the June 30, 2014 .

The total debt for RSU 68 is $7,018,375 which is for the construction of the new elementary school completed in 2007. All of this debt is paid for by the state. Borrowing Capacity Dover -Foxcroft appears to have additional borrowing capacity based on the f ollowing analysis. The total combined long -term debt for the purpose of examining borrowing capacity is $6.5 million. There are several \"rules of thumb\" that can be used to evaluate a town's borrowing capacity. Meeting or failing to meet any one measure do es not necessarily mean a community is not credit worthy, but rather together these measures provide a general picture of the town's capacity to borrow. Growing Property Valuation: The Town's total 2015 valuation was $299.5 million which amounted to a 4.4% decrease in the valuation since 2010. This can be attributed to the economic recession, slow population growth and the lagging economic recovery. Ratio of Per Capita Debt to Per Capita Income: This ratio should be less than 5%, except that when a communi ty's tax base includes considerable commercial, industrial, or second -home development, which relieves year -round homeowners of a significant share of the long -term debt, the per capita debt can justifiably be higher. This figure for Dover -Foxcroft is 6.7% [Calculated: per capita debt = $6,900,000/4,145 (2013 population) =$1,665; then $1,665/$24,665 (2013 per capita income) = 6.7%] Long Term Debt to State Valuation: According to Maine statute, a town's total debt cannot exceed 15% of the most current state valuation. This is similar to the way banks limit the amount an individual may borrow to a standard debt ratio that compares the borrower's total indebtedness with their net worth. The statutory debt limit of 15% of state taxable valuation is considered b y most investment counselors to be too high. The general \"rule of thumb\" is this figure should be less than 5%. The 2015 state valuation for Dover -Foxcroft was $294.9 million which would mean a statutory limit of $ 44 million. Dover -Foxcroft's debt as of Ju ne 2014 was about $6.5 million which is about 2.2% of the state valuation, well below the statutory limit and the 5% \"rule of thumb\". Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 167 Fund Balance (Undesignated Surplus): The fund balance (undesignated surplus) is money available for unforeseen circumstanc es and should generally be enough to pay the Town 's bills for a period of two months (at least 8.3% of total expenditures). Dover -Foxcroft's general fund fund -balance as of June 30, 2014 was $754,771, or 10% of total Town expenditures ($7,233,687 ). The Wastewater Department's fund balance as of June 2014 was $806,665, which gives the department the financial capacity to address significant operational issues that may arise in a timely manner. Section 11.4 LD1 Limits LD 1, An Act to Increase the State Sha re of Education Costs, Reduce Property Taxes and Reduce Government Spending at All Levels, was enacted in January 2005. The purpose of the LD 1 spending limit is to restrict the amount of property tax dollars schools, counties and municipalities raise for services before needing special permission from the local legislative body to exceed the calculated limits. The key to the LD 1 tax burden reduction is to keep the percentage growth in the tax commitment at or below the percentage increase in the aggregate of the growth in new value within the community and the 10 year average growth in personal income statewide. For Dover -Foxcroft, this formula has resulted in a growth rate of less than 2% for several years with some years being below 1%. Dover -Foxcroft residents have voted against raising the LD 1 limit for the past several years. The result of these decisions is most evident in the condition of the Town's roads, where while the cost of road maintenance has increased dramatically and state funding for r oads has decreased, local funding has not been adequate to maintain the status quo. As a result, the Town is falling further and further behind with roads continuing to deteriorate.

Its geographic coordinates are: 45\u00b01110N 69\u00b01313W . Dover -Foxcroft is geographically a large town because it was originally two separate towns ; Dover and Foxcroft with the Piscataquis River serving as th e common boundary for the two . Today, Dover -Foxcroft is bordered on the north by Bowerbank , south by Garl and, east by Sebec and Atkinson , and west by Guilford and Sangerville. Land Cover Dover -Foxcroft is about 45,500 acres, of which 71% (32,242 acres) is covered with forests (not including wetland forests). About 1.7% of the T own (772 acres) is developed land, which consists of constructed materials (buildings, roads, sidewalks, etc. and associated vegetation). Cultivated crops, and pasture and hay land account for about 4,800 acres or about 10.4% of the town. (See Table 12-1 and the Map 15 Land Cover in the Volume I Appendices ) Existing Land Use Pattern Dover -Foxcroft's urban area is centrally located along both sides of the Piscataquis River and at the intersections of State Routes 6, 7, 15, 16 and 153. The urban area consists of a central downtown with adjacent mixed use and residential areas. A highway commercial area occupies an area along West Main Street just west of the central urban area. The Pine Crest Business Park is located just south of the urban area off the Dexter Road. The downtown area is composed primarily of public, semi -public, and comm ercial uses with a few residential dwellings. Most of the downtown contains small lots with minimal building setbacks. Immediately adjacent to the downtown, on all sides, mixed uses exist including single and multi -unit residential, home occupations, comme rcial, light industrial, public services, and public facilities. On th e northern boundary of the Town development (mostly residential, public and a commercial use) exists along the shore s of Sebec Lake. Shorefront lots are very small and governed by Shorel and Zoning. Peaks Kenny State Park occupies a significant amount of acreage in the northwestern corner of the Town along the shores of Sebec Lake. With the exception of a concentration of residences in East Dover, most of the rest of the Town is rural, wit h wetlands, ponds, forests, farmland , and single family homes, a few churches and some commercial and industrial uses scattered along rural highways and roads . Portions of the southeastern corner of Town are occupied by the Bud Levitt Wildlife Management A rea and Northeast Wilderness Land Trust conservation land.

Clusters of single -family homes are also found in East Dover. Other single -family homes and individual mobile homes are scattered along rural roads. Seasonal homes and camps are most prevalent near Sebec Lake. Multifamily housing complexes include: Thayer Parkway (56 units); Country Meadows (24 units); and Riverview Apartments (32 units). Additional multifamily housing to be completed in the near future includes the Riverfront Redevelopment Project (22 loft apartm ents) and the Summer Street Senior Housing development (25 units). All multifamily housing complexes are located in the urban area. Dover -Foxc roft has five mobile home parks. Four are located in the urban area on public sewer and water, and include: Goodwi n's (17 lots); Patterson's (6 lots); Alan Rush (4 lots); and Robert and Carla Bragan (4 lots). The fifth park, Foxcroft Estates (12 lots), is located just north of the urban area and is not on public sewer or water. Residential Land Use Trends The growth in new housing has generally been slow with about 22 units added per year since 2000 (Table 12-2). All new multifamily units listed are located in the urban area. Residential Subdivision Activity A review of approved subdivision s (generally defined as the division of land or a building into three or more lots or units within a five year period) provides additional information on residential growth in Dover -Foxcroft . Subdivision activity in Dover -Foxcroft was very modest b etween 2000 and 2015 (Table 12-3). During this time period there were 27 subdivisions/divisions according to Planning Board r ecords. It appears that 8 of these (about 55 lots/units) were in the urban area and the remaining 19 (about 110 new lot/units) were in the rural area. The smallest subdivisions/divisions consisted of the addition of a third mobile home or housing unit, and the largest were a new 24 -unit multifamily development and two 14 -lot subdivisions in the rural area. 102 Chapter 4 Housing contains information about types of housing, housing conditions and affordability.

However, with the overall aging of the population there may be more dwelling units created within the urban area nearer to services. Multifamily housing developments and large homes with apartments may become more common. 103 Section 12.3 Commercial and Industrial Uses104 Commercial uses are most prevalent and concentrated within the urban area, particularly in the downtown along East Main Street, North Street and South Street. The Foxcroft Plaza and a number of other commercial uses are located along West Main Street. The Pine Crest Business Park is located just outside the urban area off the Dexter Road. Some commercial uses are located along rural roads, such as the Merrill's at Sebec Lake, and the Foxcroft Golf Course off the Foxcroft Center Road. Industrial uses include Pleasant River Lumber which is located off the Milo Road several miles from the urban area and the CMP Bucksport LLC (IP - Verso ) wood yard off the Landfill Road just outside of the urban area. 103 See Chapter 4 Housing 104 See Chapter 3 Economy and Chapter 13 Agriculture and Forestry Table 12-3 Residential Subdivisions / Divisions 2000 to 2015 (Approved Permits) Urban Area Residential Subdivisions/Divisions Gary Larson: conversion o f two apartment building to 3 apartment building, 97 West Main St. (M37/L45) Dexter and Pat Voter: 3rd mobile home, Grove Street (M41/L38A) Brian Westman, Bears Den: 6 cabins, North Street (M/L105A) Nathan Blockler: 3rd mobile home, Dwelley Avenue (M 37/L9A) Neil and Patricia Mallett: 8 lots, Bear Hill Road (M41/L24) Neil and Patsy Mallet: Woodbury Hill Estates: 8 lots, Bear Hill Road (M41/L24) Foxcroft Academy: 48 bed dormitory with 6 faculty apartments, West Main Street (M10/L14) Northview Apart ments: 24 housing units, 185 Summer Street (M11/L51) Rural Area Residential Subdivisions/Divisions Jon Pequignot: 2 lots, Atkinson Road (M6/L11A) James and Victoria Rattigan, Hillside Acres: 3 lots, Atkinson Road (M6/L11) Doug Smith, South Dover Villag e Estates: 14 lots, Road lo ts off Burough Road (M7/L22) Lisa and Gary Niles, Walter Quinn Jr. Family Trust Subdivision: 2 lots, Burrough Road (M7/L23A) Regina Foster: 7 lots, Dawes and Holmes Road Foxcroft Estates: 18 additional mobile homes, Foxcroft Center Road (M14/L59) International Timber, Garland Pond Road Subdivision: 6 lots, Parson's Landing Road (M15/L25) Soderquist Partners: 7 lots, Parson's Landing Road (M18L/37) Joseph Sprecher, Sprecher Cottage: 11 lots, Greeley's Landing Road (M14/L31) Jennifer Perkins, Vi llage at Stony Brook: Range Road, 14 lots (M9/L73) Jim Thiel: 3rd mobile home, River Road Ed Trapanier, Mountain View Estates: 5 lots, Shamrock Road (M3/L14) Robert Berg and Malcolm French, Shaw Road Subdivision: 7 lots, Shaw Road (M1/L24) Brian Willia ms, Triangle Estates: 4 lots, Shaw Road (M1/L16) James and Victoria Rattigan, Acres: 3 lots (M2/L16) Source: Dover -Foxcroft Planning Board Records, January 2015 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 171 Table 12-4 displays Site Plan Review permits approved by the P lanning Board between 2009 and 2015.

Many businesses are located in people's homes or on the same property as their residence. Home occupations will likely persist as people continue to seek sources of income clos e to home and with limited overhead. Commercial and Industrial Land Uses in the Future Overall, there has not been a lot of new commercial development in Dover -Foxcroft over the past five to six years, which at least in part, reflects the lack of population growth in the community and region over the past decade. Without major initiatives on the part of the Town to support a stable population size, and bring high - speed internet to the community, it is unlikely the amount of commercial and industria l development will increase dramatically in the future. However, the Town's ongoing downtown revitalization activities, including the Moosehead Redevelopment project, and efforts to obtain affordable, high -speed internet should encourage new commercial and industrial activity in the future. Section 12.4 Public and Semi -Public Uses As the county seat and primary service center for Piscataquis County, Dover -Foxcroft has many public and semi - public uses including government facilities, utilities, the hospital, service organizations, churches , parsonages, and other non -profit s.

The purposes are: to maintain safe and healthful conditions; to prevent and control water pollution; to protect fish sp awning grounds, aquatic life, bird and other wildlife habitat; to protect archaeological and historic resources; to protect freshwater wetlands; to control building sites, placement of structures and land uses; to conserve shore cover, and visual as well a s actual points of access to waters; to conserve natural beauty and open space; and to anticipate and respond to the impacts of development in shoreland areas. The ordinance includes the following types of shoreland districts: Limited Residential; Limited Commercial; General Development; Stream Protection; and Resource Protection. (See Map 18 Shoreland Zoning) Subdivision Ordinance106 - a state -mandat ed law that is administered by T owns for the review of subdivisions (generally defined as the division of 3 lo ts/units or more within a 5 year period). Subdivisions must be designed to address the following: water supply; protection of water resources; traffic conditions; sewage and solid waste disposal; aesthetic, cultural and natural values; farmland; financial and technical capacity; floodplain management; impacts on adjoining towns; liquidation harvesting; and pollution. The ordinance sets forth the procedures for review, and elaborates on how the development must meet the review criteria. The Town's road stand ards are in this ordinance. There are also provisions for conservation subdivisions with density bonuses to encourage preservation of important open spaces. Floodplain Management Ordinance107- a federally -required ordinance for municipal participation in t he federal flood insurance program. The ordinance allows landowners in 100 -year floodplains to obtain federal flood insurance. A permit is required for any construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured homes, within the designa ted flood area. Certain development standards must be followed, such as designs that prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of structures; the use of materials resistant to flood damage; the design and placement of sewage systems to minimize infiltration of floodwaters and discharge of sewage into the floodwaters; and special rules for mobile homes. Maine Uniform Building and Energy Code (MUBEC)108 - a state -mandated regulation administered by the local code enforcement officer that consists of the f ollowing combined codes: 2009 International Residential Code (IRC); 2009 International Building Code (IBC); 2009 International Existing Building Code (IEBC); and 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Under MUBEC, permits and inspections are r equired to construct, erect, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish or to change the occupancy of a building or structure. Property owners must hire a 3rd party inspector to provide a report indicating the project meets MUBEC specifications. The Town issue s a certificate of occupancy once the work is completed and an inspection report is submitted. Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules /Minimum Lot Size Law/ State Plumbing Code 109 - state - mandated laws and regulations administered by the local plumbing inspector to assure adequate lot sizes, soils, and installation of septic systems and plumbing fixtures. 105 Mandatory Shoreland Zoning Act (38 MRSA Sec . 435 et seq.) 106 Subdivisions (30 -A MRSA Sec et -health/plumb/rules Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 174 Sewer Ordinance - a Town ordinance designed to promote health and general welfare, to prevent disease, and to provide for safety by regulating the use of public and private sewers and drains, private sewage disposal, the installation and connection of building sewers and the discharge of waters and wastes into the public sewer system, and to provide for penalties for violations thereof. Other local ordinances that regulate aspects of land use include: Electronic Sign Regulations Special Amusement Ordinance Yard Sale Ordinance Fire Department Ordinance Peddling Ordinance Contract Zoning Fireworks Ordinance Moratorium Ordinance, Re: Private Distribution Corridors to Include Paved Highways, Pipelines, and High Tension Transmission Lines Dover -Foxcroft's Land Use Ordinance The Land Use Ordinance is the backbone of the Town's growth management program. While it is not a state - mandated ordinanc e, state law does require that the ordinance be consistent with an up-to-date comprehensive plan prepared in accordanc e with the Growth Management Act.110 The overall goal of the Act is to encourage orderly growth and development in appropriate areas of each community and region while protecting rural character, making efficient use of public services and preventing development sprawl . Dover -Foxcroft's 2005 Comprehensive Plan was deemed consistent with Maine's Growth Management Act. The Town's 2005 Comprehens ive Plan states that \"the ultimate goal of growth management is to regulate land use development to the extent necessary to protect natural resources, property values, and public safety. The imposed regulations should not make the Town's residents feel that they have lost their freedom as landowners and, therefore, over -regulation must be avoided. In particular, land use regulations should not be so restrictive that they have negative impacts on existing land use practices.\" Further, the 2005 Comprehensive Plan identified several specific needs and concerns to be addressed in the land use ordinance: \"The land use ordinance will: 1) create a user -friendly application and permitting proce ss; 2) assign more responsibility to code enforceme nt for review and appr oval; and 3) develop clear and consistent guidelines for obtaining approval.\" The Town's Land Use Ordinance contains the Maine Growth Management Act definitions: Growth area: An area that is designated in a municipality's or multi -municipal region's comprehensive plan as suitable for orderly residential, commercial or industrial development, or any combination of those types of development, and into which most development projected over 10 years is directed. Rural area: A geographic area that is ident ified and designated in a municipality's or multi - municipal region's comprehensive plan as an area that is deserving of some level of regulatory protection from unrestricted development for purposes that may include, but are not limited to, supporting agr iculture, forestry, mining, open space, wildlife habitat, fisheries habitat and scenic lands, and away from which most development projected over 10 years is diverted. The Town's Land Use Ordinance includes as its purposes : to implement the provisions of the Town's Comprehensive Plan; 110 Grow th Management Act (30 -A MRSA Sec 4312 et seq.) http://legislature.maine.g ov/statutes/30 -a/title30 -A Dover Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 175 to encourage growth in the identified growth areas of the community, and to limit growth in the rural areas; to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community; to encourage the most appropri ate use of land throughout the community; to promote traffic safety; to provide safety from fire and other elements; to provide an allotment of land area in new developments sufficient for adequate enjoyment of community life; to conserve natural resources , natural beauty, and open space . Growth Areas in the Land Use Ordinance Growth areas consist of six districts: Village (V); Downtown Commercial (COM1), Commercial (COM2); Industrial (IN1); Historical (H) and Residential (R). These districts are displayed on Maps 16 and 17 Land Use in the Volume I Appendices . Tables 12 -5 and 12 -6 summarize the provisions of each land use district. Village District (V) The Village District surrounds the Downtown Commercial District and is designed to provide an area for futu re growth to include expansion of limited commercial uses and areas for high -density residential development. All allowed uses require a permit. Single -family and two -family dwellings, churches, day care facilities and service clubs require a permit from t he Code Enforcement Officer (CEO). Other allowed uses, such as multi -family dwellings, home occupations, retail and service businesses, professional offices, financial institutions, and restaurants require a site plan review permit from the Planning Board. Site plan review is designed to address noise, lighting, parking and other concerns necessary to ensure compatibility with existing neighborhoods. Prohibited uses are incompatible with village uses, such as animal breeding and care, extractive industries, wood processing, auto sales and services, wholesale businesses, boat building and repair, golf courses, kennels, outdoor storage businesses, self storage facilities, and a number of industrial uses. Uses served by sewer require a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet, and uses not served by sewer require a minimum lot size of 20,000 square feet. The maximum lot coverage is 80%, and dimensional standards are designed to allow for compact development. While many lots in this district are around this size, th ere are also some larger lots which could be available for infill development, if desired by the property owners. (See Table 12-5) Downtown Commercial District (COM1) COM1 encompasses the downtown which serves the heart of business and civic activity. Publ ic sewer and water are available . The district contains existing commercial development and is designed to encourage expansion of downtown commercial uses . Single and two -family dwellings, day -care centers and service clubs require a permit from the CEO. Nearly all other allowed uses must obtain a site plan review permit from the Planning Board to assure they meet the required performance standards. Prohibited uses include agriculture , mobile home parks, extractive industries, campgrounds, cemeteries, anim al hospitals, auto sales and repair, kennels, outdoor storage businesses, self storage businesses, wholesale business, and most industrial uses with the exception of manufacturing, newspaper facilities, and public transportation facilities. COM1 encourages compact development similar to the Village District. The minimum lot size is 5,000 square feet for areas with public sewer and 20,000 square feet for areas without public sewer. There is no maximum lot coverage. While this area consists of many small lots , there are a number of vacant storefronts and areas where there could be infill development. (See Table 12 -5) Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 176 Commercial District (COM2) COM2 is located along both sides of West Main Street (State Routes 6/15/16) adjacent to and west of the Village District, and consists primarily of highway commercial uses. The district encourages commercial uses in an area with access to public water and sewer. Most commercial uses are allowed, such as commercial complexes, professional offices, restaurants, retail and service businesses, day care centers, automobile sales and repair, commercial greenhouses, financial institutions, indoo r recreation and entertainment , and motels. Allowed industrial uses include manufacturing, newspaper facilities, public transportation facilities and warehouses. Prohibited uses include agriculture, extractive industries, campgrounds, new residential uses (other than accessory apartments), churches, service clubs, medi cal clinics, public buildings, outdoor storage businesses, sel f storage facilities, and junkyards . The minimum lot size is 15,000 square feet for areas with public sewer and 20,000 square feet for areas without public sewer. Almost all allowed land uses require a permit from the Planning Board to assure that site plan review performance standards are met . While much of the buildable road frontage is currently occupied, there may be additional land available for uses that don't require a lot of road frontage and/or that could located set back from the highway . Some have sugges ted that the district may need to be expanded further west along the main highway. (See Table 12 -5) Historic District (H) This district is an overlay district designed to encourage long -term preservation of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Any proposed land use activity involving structural development within this district must be submitted to the Historical Review Committee for their comment s. The CEO or Planning Board must consider these comments and must require that these historic properties be protected to the maximum extent possible in accordance with the Committee 's recommendations. See discussion in Chapter 5 Historic and Archaeological Resources and Map 4 Historic District Inset in the Appendice s of Volume I . Industrial District (IN1) IN1 encompasses the Town's Pine Crest Business Park, which is situated off Route 7 (Dexter Road). The district provides a conveniently -located business park, complete with services (sewer, water, roads, etc.) and wi th other conditions favorable to the development of additional business es. Three of the lots are currently occupied and nine lots are available for new occupants. Permitted uses include a range of uses, such as convention centers, government facilities, me dical clinics, commercial schools, fitness facilities, hotels, professional offices, repair services, light industry, manufactur ing, saw mills, and wholesale establishments. Prohibited uses include all residential uses, agricultural uses, campgrounds, nurs ing homes, automobile sales and service, retail businesses, and junkyards. The minimum lot size is 2 acres with a minimum lot width of 200 feet. Nearly all uses require a Planning Board permit. (See Table 12-5) Residential District (RES) RES extends from the Village District eastward between Essex Street and Vaughn Road to and including the area known as East Dover. The district encompass es areas of existing residential development while maintaining the rural character, and providing opportunities fo r medium -density residential development between the higher density Village District and the lower density rural districts. The minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet, and minimum land area per dwelling unit is 15,000 square feet. Single -family and two -family dwellings require a CEO permit. Planning Board site plan review permits are required for nearly all other uses allowed in the district, including home occupations, agriculture , animal breeding and care, equestrian facilities, community services, churc hes, and public buildings. There are many Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 177 prohibited uses , such as campgrounds, extractive industries, wood processing operations, earth materials storage, animal hospitals, government facilities and grounds, hospitals, nursing homes, amusement facilities and commercial recreation, auto services and repair, service stations, commercial greenhouses and nurseries, and many other commercial uses, and all industrial land uses. From a land use perspective, this is one of the most restrictive districts in Town (e xcluding shoreland zoning districts). This district has a considerable amount of active farmland. (See Table 12 -6) Rural Areas There are two rural area districts: Rural Residential 1 (RR1) and Rural Residential 2 (RR2). These districts are displayed on Map s 16 and 17 Land Use in the appendices of Volume I . Rural Residential 1 District (RR1) RR1 nearly surrounds growth and urban area districts and consists of some smaller lots and many medium -sized and large lots. The district is designed to encompass areas of existing residential uses while maintaining rural character, protectin g agricultural and forestry uses, providing open spaces, providing for residential growth , and encouraging medium -density de velopment. The minimum lot size is 2 acres and minim um area per individual dwelling is 1 acre . The minimum lot width allowed is 200 feet to maintain rural character . A density bonus and relaxation of dimensional standards is allowed for conservation subdivisions that preserve open space and critical natural resources. Single -family and two -family homes and home occupations require a permit from the CEO. More intensive uses, such as mobile home parks, multifamily dwellings, and allowed commercial, industrial and semi -public uses, require site plan review perm it from the Planning Board. Extractive industries, commercial complexes, and pulp mills are prohibited. (See Table 12 -6) Rural Residential 2 District (RR2) RR2 encompasses most of the Town's rural land area. The district is designed to maintain rural chara cter, protect agricultural and forestry uses, provide open spaces , and provide for single -family residential dwellings with larger lot sizes . The minimum lot size is 2 acres and minimum area per dwelling is 2 acres. Lot widths must be at least 200 feet to maintain the rural character. A density bonus and relaxation of dimensional standards is allowed for conservation subdivisions that preserve open space and critical natural resources. Single -family and two-family homes and home occupations require a permit from the CEO. More intensive uses, such as multifamily dwellings, and allowed commercial, industrial and semi -public uses, require a site plan review permit from the Planning Board. This is the only district where extractive industries are allowed. Mobile home parks, commercial complexes, pulp mills, demolition and waste disposal are prohibited.

In some cases the shoreland zones are an overlay to the town -wide zoning, and in other cases the shoreland zones are base districts. These distinctions are displayed on Map 18 Shoreland Zoning. The Town's shoreland zoning was discussed previously. Land Use Ordinance Performance Standards The Land Use Ordinance contains two levels of permit review: Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) permit review and Planning Board site plan perm it review. Allowed uses that require a CEO permit are those that are most compatible with other uses within the district, such as single -family homes in most districts. Planning Board site plan review permits are required for more intensive uses that must meet certain performance standards so that Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 180 they will not harm the environment and will be compatible with other uses in the district. As is noted in the descriptions of the districts above, some uses are allowed without a permit, but still must meet standa rds, and other uses are prohibited. All uses must meet the dimensional standards (minimum lot size, minimum lot width, etc.) of the ordinance, unless they a grandfathered, or are otherwise exempt from these requirements. Site Plan Review/Planning Board Per mits The following is a summary of the review criteria and standards utilized by the Planning Board in reviewing applications for Site Plan Review. These standards provide a guide for the applicant in the development of site and building plans as well as a method of review for the Planning Board. These standards are not inflexible requirements intended to discourage creativity, invention, and innovation. Review Criteria: Preservation of Landscape in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing t ree and soil removal, retaining existing vegetation where desirable, and keeping any grade changes in character with the general appearance of neighboring areas; preservation of natural scenic character; consideration of significant archaeological sites. Preservation of Historic Structures within the Historic District through consultation with the Historical Review Committee. Relation of Proposed Buildings to the Environment, which shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing buildings in th e vicinity. Consideration for the scale of proposed building(s), massing of the structure(s), and natural features such as slope, orientation, soil type, and drainage courses. Parking and Circulation - layout and design for vehicles and pedestrians to be s afe, convenient, and harmonious with proposed buildings and neighboring properties. Access management, such that entrances and exits provide for safe and convenient ingress and egress to and from the site and minimize conflicts with the flow of traffic on public ways; adequate sight distances for oncoming traffic; acceleration/deceleration lanes, where necessary. Surface Water Drainage shall not adversely affect neighboring properties, down -stream conditions, or the public storm drainage system; mitigation required to protect water quality. Utilities - provisions for adequate water supply and wastewater disposal. Special Features - setbacks and screening for storage areas, machinery installations, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings, etc. t o prevent negative impacts to the environment and surrounding properties. Exterior Lighting to encourage energy efficiency, to ensure safe movement of people and vehicles, and to minimize adverse impacts on neighboring properties and public ways. Emergency Vehicle Access to be convenient and safe to all buildings and structures. Landscaping to define, soften, or screen the appearance of off -street parking and to enhance the physical design of the building(s) and site. Road Standards for public or private wa ys (reference to Subdivision Ordinance). Site Conditions during construction to be safe and sanitary, provisions for oil and grease disposal, dust control. Performance Standards: Roads standards with dimensional and design requirements; specifications for materials, etc. Buffers standards to minimize the negative impacts of inconsistent development and to protect water resources. Waste disposal to address Town's Sewer Ordinance and state laws. Air-pollution and noise controls . Accessibility standards for public accommodations and places of employment. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 181 Water recreation and water storage facility safety standards (swimming pools, commercial fishing ponds, fish hatcheries, reservoirs, sewage lagoons, farm ponds). Signs standards for placement of signs, sign size, and sign type. Home occupation standards to minimizing their impact on existing neighborhoods. Agriculture standards to minimize environmental impacts and impacts on adjacent uses; allows farm stands exclusive for sales of agricultural products. Keep ing of domestic chickens (Residential and Village Zones) to minimize impacts on adjacent uses. Manufactured housing standards to ensure the safety, health and welfare of mobile home occupants. Mobile home parks standards regarding the placement and design of mobile home parks. Addressing standards necessary for emergency services needs. Section 12.6 Future Growth and Development An analysis of the amount of land area needed for future growth and development is necessary to determine if exist ing land use r egulations and growth area s are large enough and have the capacity to serve anticipated and desired growth and development. The goal is to encourage most types of development in growth and urban areas where there are services, such as public water and sewe r, with rural areas providing the land base for agriculture, forestry and other typical rural uses. For planning purposes residential growth is anticipated to consist of between 250 and 350 new housing units over the next decade. New housing units will inc lude single -family homes, multifamily housing , mobile homes , camps , second homes , and new units in existing structures, such as the Town's many large older homes. With the aging of the population, it is anticipated there will be a demand for more multifami ly housing and apartments close to services: Evidence of this is the 42 new units recently constructed in the urban area . Both the Village District and the Downtown have the capacity to handle a considerable amount of the anticipated residential development, particularly given the current minimum lot sizes (i.e., 5,000 square feet on sewer in both districts) . Both districts have vacant and/or obsolete structures where redevelopment is desirable and will be encouraged. There is also some vacant lan d in the Village District for new construction or mobile homes. Second homes and camps will likely continue to be constructed on back lots near Sebec Lake and Branns Mill Pond, and there will continue to be some new homes built in rural areas possible on t he many vacant subdivision lots in existence today. The Town may want to consider new districting that accommodates and encourages some of this outlying development in clustered neighborhoods, such as East Dover and South Dover. Commercial and other non -residential growth is anticipated to proceed as it has in the past, with mos t of it occurring in the growth and urban area commercial districts, and in the Pine Crest Business Park, which is zoned Industrial. The Downtown C ommercial District and the mixed -use Village District allow compact development (i.e., minimum lot size 5,000 square feet on sewer) and the Commercial 2 District accommodates development on minimum lot sizes of 15,000 square feet with sewer. These districts appear to have the capacity to handle a lot of the anticipated development, with the exception of the Commercial 2 District along West Main Street, where an extension of that district might be desirable . The lack of areas designated specifically for industrial uses is a concern. Three a reas have been identified as having the potential capacity to handle these types of uses, and some commercial uses, as well: the Pleasant River area, the Verso log yard and Town transfer station area, and the Pine Crest Business Park and airport area. Two of these areas could have access to sewer and water, and the Pleasant River area has access to just public water. The analysis above was also based on the location of services (e.g., public sewer and water, transportation system, etc.) and land suitability . These topics are discussed on the following pages. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 182 If in the future, the Town determines that more land area is necessary to accommodate urban area growth, the following areas could be considered for expansions, because they could be served by the pub lic sewer system (See Map 11 Water and Sewer in the Appendices of Volume I ): West Main St. (Route 15), west of Plaza, will need a pump station. Park St., northwest past Pleasant Meadows - can be served by gravity for a few hundred feet. North St., north o f Whittier St. - will need a pump station and a brook crossing. Summer St., east of Scooter's, will need a pump station. Essex St., east of Oak St. - will need a pump station. Vaughn Rd., east of treatment plant - could be gravity but long run to available services, pending depth of sewer line wanted, pump station more likely. Bangor Hill, Rt. 15 south, gravity on hill section up to Range Rd., after that more likely need pump station Bear Hill Rd., gravity on hill section, after that - pump station South St., south of Pine Crest driveway, due to valley could have an inverted siphon but preferably a pump station. Grove St., from bridge to South St., Brook crossing, possible pump station due to brook, may not have enough depth of cover at brook. Pine St., we st of Bea St., will need a pump station. Land Suitability Planning for future growth also involves identification of land areas suitable, or conversely, not suitable, for various types of development. Areas with steep slopes, wetlands, poor soils, or floo d hazard areas are generally not suitable for most types of development. Other areas that may be considered not suitable for development, or where certain precautions should be taken, include important natural resource areas, such as significant aquifers, land areas around public water supplies, and significant wildlife, plant and fisheries habitats that are particularly sensitive to development. Development may also not be desired in areas highly valued for forestry and agriculture. Additionally, caution s hould also be used when considering the type and intensity of development in sensitive lake watersheds. Maps that provide information important to determining land suitability include: Map 4 Historic and Archeological Resources Map 5 Water Resources - significant aquifers, public water supply wells, and lake/pond watersheds Map 6 Important Habitats and Natural Areas - sensitive wildlife and fisheries habitats, significant natural areas, rare plants Map 7 Farmland and Forest Land Map 20 Development Constrai nts - steep slopes, wetlands, hydric soils, floodplain soils Map 21 Soils Potential for Low Density Development - areas most suitable for development with subsurface wastewater disposal systems Land suitability analysis and soils information prepared by t he U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Resource Conservation Service in the Soil Survey for Piscataquis County is helpful for land use planning. The Soil S urvey is an inventory, description, and evaluation of soils . Soils are classified based on characteristics, including texture (percentage of sand, silt, and clay) , permeability, slope, wetness, depth to bedrock, etc. Slopes and soils influence the economic and physical feasibility of land development, both in terms of the actual place ment of buildings and roads, and in the functioning of septic systems and other site alterations. Flat, gently Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 183 sloping and moderately sloping areas are usually well suited for development. However, flat lands can be difficult to drain, and are often wetlan ds, floodplains or otherwise marginal soils. Slopes greater than 15% are of concern. Development becomes in creasingly problematic as the slope gradient increases. Roads on steep slopes are more costly to construct and maintain, and can be more dangerous t o travel on, particularly for emergency vehicles and school buses during winter. Steep slopes can make buildings and subsurface disposal systems more expensive to construct and maintain. The Maine Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Law prohibits new subsurface waste disposal systems on slopes greater than 20%. Additionally, steep areas are more susceptible to erosion problems and water quality degradation. Soil characteristics, such as depth to bedrock, erosion potential, soil wetness and flooding potential ca n present constraints to development. Sometimes these areas can be modified for development through filling, excavating and blasting; however, this work requires additional expense and can increase future mainte nance costs. In general, there is also great er risk of environment degradation associated with development of these areas. The Soils Potential for Low Density Development Map displays the suitability of areas for a 3-bedroom single - family residence with a basement and comparable buildings covering 2 ,000 sq uare feet and subsurface wastewater disposal system, with or without on -site source of water. Paved roads in development are also included. In general, the map suggests there are quite a few areas suitable for low density development in Dover -Foxcro ft, including within and adjacent to the urban area. However, these areas are often prime farmland soils and farmland soils of statewide importance. Floodplains are defined as areas adjacent to a river, stream, lake, or pond, which can reasonably be expec ted to be covered at some time by floodwater. The primary function of floodplains is to accommodate large volumes of water from nearby overflowing channels and dissipate the force of flow by reducing the rate of flow through a widening of the channel. A fl oodplain may also absorb and store a large amount of water, later becoming a source of aquifer recharge. Floodplains also serve as wildlife habitats, as open space and for outdoor recreation, and for agriculture without interfering with their emergency ove rflow capacity. Floodplains serve to accommodate high water levels of water bodies often associated with late winter and spring snow melt and storm water runoff. Flooding can cause serious destruction to structures and prop erty. Activities that increase paved or impervious surfaces, such as buildings and roads, which do not allow water to soak into the ground or that change the watercourse on flood plains, increases the quantity and rate of runoff that can intensify flooding impacts downstream. The Federa l Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who administers the Federal Flood Insurance Pro gram has mapped 100 -year floodplain levels in Dover -Foxcroft. The 100 -year floodplain level is where there is a 1% chance in any given year that flooding at this level or above this level will occur. One hundred year floodplains are associated with the Piscataquis River, and many of the ponds, streams, brooks and wetlands in Dover -Foxcroft. Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 184 Chapter 13 - Forestry and Agriculture Section 13.1 Forestry111 Maine's forests are vitally important - economically, culturally and biologically. Maine has the largest and most diverse forest products industrial cluster in New England, consisting of paper companies, sawmills and secondary wood products manufacturers, forestland owners and managers, loggers, equipment manufacturers and distributors, biomass energy firms and other power facilities, financial institutions, forest -based recreation businesses, transportation firms and many others. The forest products indust ry is a fundamental part of the Maine economy. The health of the forest products industry, and consequent maintenance of large tracts of undeveloped land, and the public access policies of many large landowners have provided an environment for non -timber, forest - based activities, such as outdoor recreation and nature -based tourism. Biologically, the forests provide genetic and ecosystem diversity, natural systems for counteracting air and water pollution, animal and plant habitats, and many other values. The past three decades have seen increasing diversity in the use of Maine's forest resources, including construction of biomass plants, uses of land for purposes other than timber production, such as wind power, water extraction, residential and resort dev elopment, new forms of recreation, and a growing interest in forest biodiversity and carbon sequestration. More than 50% of the land in Dover -Foxcroft is covered by forests consisting primarily mixed stands of evergreens and northern hardwoods (See Map 15 Land Cover in the Volume I Appendices ). The Town's forests are mostly owned by small woodlot owners including a few company -owned woodlands, rather than any large industrial or timberland investment company landowners. Landowners may use their forestland for a variety of purposes including home sites, timber harvesting for personal use, for sale to others, for its scenic value, for privacy or buffering from adjacent uses, for wildlife habitat, or for recreation. One of the larger forestland owners is Penobscot Forests LLC , which owns approximately 880 acres enrolled in Tree Growth in Dover -Foxcroft. Penobscot Forests LLC owns a considerable amount of land outside Dover - Foxcroft and is managing its land for forestry; however, this company has also been a landowner involved in the proposed Passadumkeag Windpark and the Mari times and Northeast Pipeline LLC. There are a number of markets for the Town's timber, including the paper mills, sawmills, and biomass plants located in the region and beyond, including Canada. Two major purchasers of forest products located in Dover - Foxcroft inclu de the Pleasant River Lumber mill and CMP Bucksport LLC. Pleasant River Lumber, with its headquarters in Dover -Foxcroft, is a family -owned business with four generations of experience in the forest products industry. With five locations the company's mill s produce over 200 million board feet of spruce dimensional lumber and eastern white pine annually, for customers throughout the East Coast region. CMP Bucksport LLC operates a wood concentration yard in Dover -Foxcroft which serves to collect forest produc ts, primarily pulp, which is then shipped to the Verso paper mill in Jay. Commercial Timber Harvests Landowners are required to notify the Maine Forest Service (MFS) before timber is cut or removed when the primary purpose of the harvest is to sell or use the timber for forest products. The notifications allow the MFS to 111 Statewide and regional perspective source: Comprehensive Land Use Plan, Land Use Planning Commission, 2010 Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 185 monitor compliance with the Maine Forest Practices Act, which limits the size of clear cuts and requires best management practices. The data should be used with caution, because loggers may not be clear on the definitions and distinctions in the type of timber harvesting, and/or the notifications may not entirely reflect what the harvest actually ends up being. According to the MFS there have been 1,289 timber harvest notifications since 1991 (Table 13-1). The annually reported data since 1991 indicates that, on average, there have been 56 harvests per year and about 1,289 acres harvested per year. Of the total acres harvested from 1991 through 2013, 88% were selection harvests, 10% were shelterwood harvests and only 2% were clearcut harvests. About 1% of the total acres harvested were for a change of us e, such as for a house, which is about 15 acres per year.

Shelterwood harvests remove trees in 2 or more stages; the initial harvest removes most ma ture trees, leaving en ough trees to serve as seed sources and to provide the right amount of shade to produce a new generation of trees. Clearcut harvests remove most or all the trees in one harvest; regeneration occurs through natural seeding by nearby trees, from stumps, plan ting seedlings, or from seedlings already growing in the understory. Change of Use is usually removal and sale of trees prior to land clearing for a home or other development. Note: Due to confidentiality , data is reported only where three or more landowner reports reported harvesting in the town.

The law specifies there must be at least 10 acres of forestland used for commercial harvesting, and that a Forest Management and Harvest Plan is prepared at least every ten years. If the forestland no longer meets the criteria for eligibility, or the landowner opts to withdraw from the Tree Growth classification, then a penalty is applied to recover some of the back property taxes. As of 2015 th ere were about 13,870 acres of forestland in enrolled in the Tree Growth Program. About 48% was mixed wood, 21% was softwood, 21% was hardwood, and 10% was other land. The amount of land enrolled in Tree Growth increased by about 2,600 acres over the past decade. Section 13.2 Agriculture Commercial agriculture is increasing both in Maine, Piscataquis County and Dover -Foxcroft. The local foods and buy-local movement is the driving force behind this growth. Not only is farming increasing overall, but the dive rsity of farming is increasing, as well. Some predict that the growth of agriculture in rural Maine will likely continue over the next decade due to the ongoing loss of farmland in more developed areas of the country. Impacts from climate change, such as w ater shortages, and its effects on agricultural areas may also increase the importance of maintaining agricultural land. It is also predicted that the expansion of agriculture in Maine will continue to include year -round crop production with greenhouses in cluding the use of hydroponics. Piscataquis County Agricultural Trends The growth in commercial agriculture is evident in Census data for Piscataquis County (Table 13-3). In Piscataquis County between 2007 and 2012 the number of farms increased by 7%, the land in farms increased by 37%, and the average size of farms increased by 28%. The 2012 Census also found that over 90% of farms in the county were between 50 to 180 acres in size, and on -average land in the farm by land use was: 53% woodland, 27% cropla nd, and 21% other uses. This high proportion of woodland is very typical of farms in Maine. These woodlands often serve as an important source of income to the agricultural operation . An Inventory of Farms The inventory of commercial farms shows the diversity of farm operations in Dover -Foxcroft (Table 13-4) including the production of maple syrup, Christmas trees, vegetables, fruits, poultry, eggs, beef, pork, lamb, dairy, flowers, honey, oats, forage hay, straw, and many value -added products. There are also several equestrian facilities. Some farm operations have probably been missed in this inventory, since farm operations are often part-time, and farm families often rely on off -farm sources of income.

It has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce a sustained high yield of crops while using acceptable farming methods. Prime farmland produces the highest yields and requires minimal amounts of energy and economic resources, and farming it results in the least damage to the environment. State or local important farmland soils are those that fail to meet one or more of the requirements of prime farmland, but are important for the production of food, feed, fiber or forage crops. They include those soils that are nearly prime farmland and that economically produce high yields of crops when treated or managed according to acceptable farming methods. Some may produce as high a yield as prime farmlands if conditions are favorable. It is also impo rtant to note that p rime and important farmland is also often suitable for low-density residential development. Map 7 Farmland and Forest in the Volume I Appendices displays land cover data for \"cultivated crops, pasture and hay land\" (combined) and forests, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture farmland soils (prime farmland soils and farmland of statewide importance). Dover -Foxcroft Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis Comprehensive Plan: Volume II Inventory and Analysis , May 2016 Draft for State Revie w Page 188 Farmland Enrolled in the Farmland Property Tax Program The Maine Farmland Property Tax Program is similar to the Tree Growth Program in that property taxes are assessed based on current use rather than market value if the land remains in agricultural use. In the Farmland Program the property owner is required to have at least 5 contiguous acres. The land must be used for farming, agriculture, or horticulture, and can include woodland and wasteland. The farmland must contribute at least $2,000 in annual gross income in 1 of 2, or 3 of 5 years preceding the appl ication. The annual income may also include the value of commodities produced for co nsumption by the farm household. If the property no longer qualifies as farmland, then a penalty is assessed. Over the past decade the number of parcels and amount of land enrolled in the program has increased very significantly (Table 13-5). Section 13.3 Protection for Farmland and Forestland The most significant threat to agriculture and forestry is the conversion of productive land to other uses, such as sites for homes and camps. This conversion can happen for a number of reasons, such as the marginal viability of the land for agricultural and forestry uses (income that can be derived from timber or agricultural products), and the differential between the agricultural product market and the residential market. Other threats can be loss of land for major projects that not only remove land from pr oductive farm and forestry uses, but also can create barriers for farm and forestry operations. Conflicts between uses, such as residential development adjacent to farm or forestry operations, which may create noise or odors that, may be objectionable. Ano ther type of threat is the degradation of the land through soil loss due to poor management practices. Land Use Regulations and Policies The Town's Land Use Ordinance is designed to encourage most residential, commercial and industrial development in urba n areas where minimum lot sizes and other dimensional requirements are designed for more compact development. Many of these \"growth\" areas also have access to public sewer and water, which allows for the smaller lots sizes. By encouraging and support ing gr owth in urban areas, the T own is essentially providing fewer incentives for growth in rural areas. Further, the stated goals of the two rural districts (RR1 and RR2) include protecting agricultural and forestry uses and maintaining rural character, while providing for some residential growth. Agriculture, animal breeding and care, and boarding and riding stables must comply with the land use standards, but a permit is not required. While the ordinance does not mention forestry, it is assumed that no permit is required, but that activities must comply with the standards. Most other uses allowed in these rural districts require a permit. The state -mandated shoreland zoning and subdivision laws, which are administered by the T own, both contain provisions to address forestry and agriculture. The primary focus of shoreland zoning is to protect water quality. The subdivision law has several provisions related to forestry and agriculture. Farmland, which means a parcel consisting of 5 or more acres of land that is classified as prime farmland, unique farmland or farmland of statewide or local importance by the U .S. Natural Resources Conservation Service , is to be identified o n maps submitted as part of a subdivision application. This provision allows the Planning Board to consider how this land is affected by the subdivision development . Another provision in the subdivision statute is designed to discourage liquidation harvesting. Liquidation harvesting means the purchase of timberland followed by a harvest that r emoves most or all commercial value in standing timber, without regard for long -term forest management principles, and the subsequent sale or attempted resale of the harvested land within 5 years.

State Laws Maine Forest Practices Act (12 MRSA \u00a78867 -A to \u00a78888 & MFS Rules Chapter 20). Administered by the Maine Forest Service, this law encourages the long -term continuance of wood harvesting on a sustainable basis through regulatory limits on the practice of clearcutting, annual reporting requirements for timber harvesting activities and follow -up assessments, requireme nts for use of best management practices, and technical assistance to landowners and municipalities. Maine Agricultural Protection Act (Title 7 MRSA, Chapter 6). Among other things, Maine's \"Right -to-Farm Law\" protects farmers from neighbors' complaints ab out noise, odor or other aspects of their legitimate and properly -conducted agricultural operations. Registration of Farmland (Title 7 MRSA, Chapter 2 -B). Development activities that are incompatible with agricultural practices are prohibited within 50 fe et of farmland that has been registered in accordance with this law. Voluntary Municipal Farm Support Program (Title 7 MRSA, Chapter 2 -C). This law enables municipalities to preserve farmland by purchasing and holding agricultural easements from willing l andowners. Conservation Easement Law (Title 33 MRSA, Sec. 476). Through the gift or sale of restrictive easements to a government or land trust, Maine's conservation easement law allows property owners to assure the future availability of their land for a griculture and/or forestry. Agencies and Organizations Providing Support for Agriculture and Forestry There are a number of agencies and organization s, some located in Dover -Foxcroft, that provide support for agriculture and forestry, including the follow ing: Dover Cover Farmers Market (founded April 2, 2012) - operates at 1041 South Street adjacent to the Chamber of Commerce, Dover -Foxcroft The Piscataquis County Fairgrounds - traditional agricultural fair held in the fall; also site for oth er events, located at 77 Fairview Avenue, Dover -Foxcroft Piscataquis County Soil and Water Conservation District and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service, Farm Services Agency, 42 Engdahl Drive , Dover -Foxcroft University of Maine D iagnostic/Animal Health Laboratory University of Maine Cooperative Extension office 165 E Main St, Dover -Foxcroft Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry www.maine.gov/dacf Maine Small Woodlot Owners Association www.swoam.org Maine F armland Trust www.mainefarmlandtrust.org Maine Farm Bureau www.mainefarmbureau.com Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association www.mofga.org Farm organizations, such as the Maine Grass Farmers Network, Maine Sheep Breeders, Maine Poultry Growers, etc. Appendix Report on Voters' Survey "}
