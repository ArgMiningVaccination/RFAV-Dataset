Modern medicine has replaced most of the traditional herbs and such, some people still prefer herbal remedies to modern pills. Although plants and herbalism are the basis for most modern medicines, there are quite a few ancient cures that seem more based in belief rather than actual cures. The author of Book of Shadows documents a few common illnesses and injuries with fanciful cures that were used long ago. One of these is a cure for a cough containing lemon and honey (Cunningham). Another remedy listed in the chapter containing cures is a love potion. This definitely is more close to fantasy than fact. It's either hit or miss with most of these ancient Taking prescription drugs to get high can be just as dangerous and addictive as taking illegal street drugs because prescription drugs are extremely powerful. Connor Jackson Integrative Medicine 8 May 2017 Final Paper This class has been vital in providing me with a new perspective on different types of alternative medicine and practices. Although there were some lectures which came across to me as a bit hard to believe, such as Scott Roos's Ayurveda lecture, in the end all of these different methods of healing and self-betterment gave me a new understanding of the importance of alternative types of medicine. And even with the rather far-fetch topics, if they ultimately have worked for people, even without scientific backing, then who are we to judge what is the right or wrong way. For the most part, my knowledge of medicine was backed mainly by the western medicine I was exposed to growing up, An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. It is astonishing to me how plants from the ground can help with certain illnesses and viruses. I plan on becoming a medical doctor, and when I reach my goal of becoming one, I want to incorporate the study of Herbalism in my practices. The idea of Herbalism is what makes becoming a medical doctor more interesting for me. I am seeking a profession in medicine because I want to provide great health care service to individuals around the world, but I want to do so by implementing natural remedies.

Out of the 12 answers two were devoid of any type of connotation, such as; herbal and from the land. These two were the outliers to the rest of the answers, which were on opposite sides of a spectrum, one positive the other negative. Five answers held the theme that \"natural medicine\" is a more thorough medicine two examples being; holistic and wellness. The other five words given held more negative tones, such as; placebo and dated. The two themes that were present in the negatively associated In this regard, medicinal and aromatic plants are being employed, and they can be said to belong to the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) category under the biologically-based treatments subcategory (Mohsen et al. 785). Mohsen et al. point out that the industrial utilizations of MAPs include herbal teas, galenicals, health, pharmaceutical/industrial auxiliary, traditional medicines, new drugs, and intermediates for the manufacture of drugs (786). As Mohsen et al. further observe, MAPs serve to provide the raw materials required in the pharmaceutical industry where drugs are extracted through the isolation of active chemicals, which is succeeded by decocting them to medication (787). Further, the scholars fittingly observe that over 85% of the general population in the U.S., Africa, and developing countries make use of the complimentary medicines and nonconventional practices adjunctive to typical medical care (Mohsen et al In the United States the combined use of natural alternatives along with conventional medicine has only been around for about one hundred years, gaining in practice and recognition over the last twenty five. According to the National Center for Research on Complimentary and Integrative Health, \"thirty percent of adults and twelve percent of children use health care approaches developed outside of mainstream Western, or conventional, medicine\". (NCCIH, What's in a While some of us do realize the dangers and general ineffectiveness of synthetic drugs and supplements, the vast majority of people don't understand that even natural methods of treatment, such as herbal remedies and nutrients can still be a roll of the dice in regards to effectiveness, even though there are usually far less severe side effects. One of the best examples of herbal remedy use in Western Medicine would be the use of Opium in pain treatment. Opium is made by drying the \"tears,\" or latex from a opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) bulb before becoming mature. By cutting the bulb, the latex seeps out, therefore producing a solution containing various substances, most notoriously, the 12% by volume of alkaloid morphine, which is used as a method of chronic pain treatment, as well as the production of heroine. It was originally used in the 16th century to induce sleep and relieve pain, and was introduced to western medicine by a man of the name Paracelsus. It was only after reading the Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius book, a collection of herbs names and diseases, that he managed to Back pain is one of the most common conditions known to man. Decreased mobility, poor posture, increased life expectancy and other aspects of modern daily life all contribute to growing numbers of back pain sufferers. Fortunately, there are many different remedies for back pain that you can try to see if Reflexology Today, people are very interested in natural ways to take care of their bodies and get rid of symptoms. Instead of taking medications, many are looking for alternative methods to helping their body and improving their health. The usage of drugs is a very common practice in our society nowadays. The usage of drugs can vary from medical purposes to recreational purposes. What is drugs? 'A drug is any chemical you take that affects the way your body works.'

So this does not mean that drugs can only be in the form of pill, tablet, oral solution, and injection drugs can also in the form of tobacco that contains nicotine, or drinkable substance such as coffee and tea that contains caffeine and beer that contains alcohol. (Crocq, 2003) For some people nowadays recreational drugs already become a way of life. II. Herbal medicine has been used for many, many years and is a great natural alternative to modern medicine.
