We believe that the concept of healthism may be key to lessen the polarization of discourses around vaccination, offering a broad understanding of parents' decision to not vaccinate their children. This article aims to deepen the knowledge on the relation between healthism and vaccine hesitancy, using Portugal as a case study. A qualitative research approach was adopted, and therefore, in-depth interviews were conducted with 31 vaccine-hesitant parents. The findings showed that vaccine-hesitant parents usually adopt several strategies based on natural living to prevent and tackle their children's potential health issues. There appears to be a common approach towards health and life (i.e., healthism) among vaccine-hesitant parents. Drawing upon the healthism ideology, vaccine-hesitant parents make choices to ensure the good health of their child. These choices nevertheless represent a privileged position as the pursuit of healthfulness is constrained by sociodemographic aspects. Using vaccine hesitancy as the starting point, our findings show that healthism and its focus on personal accountability under the umbrella of neoliberalism may jeopardize global public health. Healthcare professionals should pay particular attention to healthism when addressing vaccine hesitancy in Portugal and elsewhere. Research evidence advocates the need to be sensitive to the broad spectrum of vaccine hesitancy as this encompasses multiple views on the subject.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-05", "cleaned_text": "from Parents Who Either Delay or Refuse Children's Vaccination in Portugal [https://doi.org/10.3390/soc13080184](https://doi.org/10.3390/soc13080184) [Healthy Lifestyle: The As a way of gaining a deeper understanding of this complex and context-specific phenomenon [ [2](#B2-societies-13-00184)], social scientists have analyzed \"how health decisions are formulated within social worlds\" [ [3](#B3-societies-13-00184)]. Nevertheless, very few studies to date have acknowledged the relation between healthism and vaccine hesitancy [ [4](#B4-societies-13-00184)]. We argue that the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy should be deeply examined in the light of the new health consciousness and movements as described by Crawford [ [5](#B5-societies-13-00184)]. \"Healthism is a well-recognized socio-cultural phenomenon in the western (and westernized) middle classes, characterized by high health awareness and expectations, information-seeking, self-reflection, high expectations, distrust of doctors and scientists, healthy and often 'alternative' lifestyle choices, and a tendency to explain illness in terms of folk models of invisible germ-like agents and malevolent science.\" [ [6](#B6-societies-13-00184)]. Healthism draws from neoliberal discourse that highlights personal responsibility and the need for self-management. Within neoliberal society, individuals are held to be accountable for their own health behaviors and to manage health risks [ [7](#B7-societies-13-00184)], meaning that they are responsible for their actions and decisions regarding their own health [ [8](#B8-societies-13-00184)]. Following this train of thought, good health is only achievable through commitment and personal investment, requiring self-restraint and constant vigilance [ [9](#B9-societies-13-00184)]. Healthism is deeply interwoven with individualism and accountability, which is at the heart of neoliberal thinking [ [10](#B10-societies-13-00184)]. We argue that vaccine hesitancy (e.g., the delay or refusal of vaccination) is explained by parents under the umbrella of healthism, in the sense that they believe that the maintenance of the good health of their children is a process that requires constant vigilance and is achievable through their personal investment and commitment. This article intends to increase the knowledge on the relation between healthism and vaccine hesitancy, using Portugal as a case study. The Context [11](#B11-societies-13-00184)]. Although Portuguese parents have been found to be the most confident in vaccines in comparison to parents from other European countries [ [12](#B12-societies-13-00184)], two measles outbreaks occurred in the country in 2017 [ [13](#B13-societies-13-00184)]. This shows that vaccine resistance clusters open space for disease susceptibility [ [14](#B14-societies-13-00184)]. In a similar way to other Southern European countries, Portugal has been subjected in the last decades to a radical neoliberalization of health care because of two major international financial crises [ [15](#B15-societies-13-00184)]. The neoliberalization of health care has been described in the literature vis-\u00e0-vis healthism. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been developed in Portugal on the relation between vaccine hesitancy and healthism to date. We intend to address this gap by employing a qualitative approach and thereby to contribute to Larson and colleagues' [ [16](#B16-societies-13-00184)] statement that the development of qualitative studies will help to enhance the understanding of vaccine hesitancy. 2. Background [2](#B2-societies-13-00184)]. In addition to delay and refusal, vaccine hesitancy also refers to doubt and reluctance even by individuals who agree on vaccination regardless of their concerns. Indeed, vaccine hesitancy may occur within a broad spectrum of behaviors or beliefs [ [4](#B4-societies-13-00184)], \"from full and partial to no vaccination\" [ [17](#B17-societies-13-00184)]. There is a common understanding that the lack of trust either in healthcare professionals, governments or the pharmaceutical industry is deeply interwoven with parents' decision not to immunize their children [ [18](#B18-societies-13-00184), [19](#B19-societies-13-00184), [20](#B20-societies-13-00184), [21](#B21-societies-13-00184)]. The distrust on the mainstream biomedical model appears to go hand in hand with ideals of natural intensive parenting for explaining vaccine hesitancy [ [22](#B22-societies-13-00184), [23](#B23-societies-13-00184), [24](#B24-societies-13-00184)]. [25](#B25-societies-13-00184)]. In this regard, Ward and colleagues [ [26](#B26-societies-13-00184)] proposed the term of \"salutogenic parenting\", referring to parents' engagement in practices they believed to naturally boost their children's immune system, thus denying the need for vaccination. Vaccine-hesitant parents usually seek more individualized and natural approaches for their children's care through healthcare practices focused on home births, extended breastfeeding, and organic and homemade food to reduce preservatives and chemicals consumption [ [27](#B27-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, other studies have found that vaccine-hesitant parents were concerned with the adjuvants and preservatives which vaccines may contain [ [28](#B28-societies-13-00184)], which might contaminate children's pure bodies [ [29](#B29-societies-13-00184)] and tend to express the desire for a \"life free from chemicals and toxic ingredients\" [ [30](#B30-societies-13-00184)]. According to these authors, the view of vaccines as something artificial and dangerous was intrinsically linked to parents' fears of their potential side effects, encompassing long-term as well as life-threatening conditions, such as mental damage, disabilities, autism, deafness, coma, cancer and even death. The child's immune system is seen as not developed, and vaccines' components are perceived to be artificial and toxic, being harmful to children's fragile bodies [ [31](#B31-societies-13-00184)]. The framing of natural healthcare practices as safer, healthier, and less risky contributed to the deep-rooted belief that \"nature offers the best way of doing things\", promoting parents' commitment to natural living [ [32](#B32-societies-13-00184)]. In addition, a shared belief that long-term immunity is better acquired through infectious diseases rather than vaccines has been found in the available literature [ [29](#B29-societies-13-00184)]. Considering these views on childhood immunity, vaccines were framed as interfering with the natural immunity acquired from exposure to disease [ [30](#B30-societies-13-00184)]. These parents tend to adopt an individualistic approach considering their children's singularity and, thus, reframing health as \"integrated and personalized\" [ [33](#B33-societies-13-00184)]. [27](#B27-societies-13-00184)] pointed out, \"vaccination is only one aspect of parenting, and contemporary parents are subject to strong societal expectations\". Within contemporary parenting culture, parents are expected to become experts in all aspects of childhood [ [34](#B34-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, Hays [ [34](#B34-societies-13-00184)] describes a \"model that advises mothers (and parents) to expend a tremendous amount of time, energy and money in raising their children\". The salutogenic parenting practices described above appeared to be deeply interwoven with a broader social identity [ [27](#B27-societies-13-00184)]. 3. Methods [1](#fn001-societies-13-00184). For this article, the focus will only be on data collected in Portugal. A qualitative research approach was adopted as it offered an in-depth understanding of the experience of vaccine hesitancy, and therefore, in-depth interviews were conducted with 31 vaccine-hesitant parents between November 2021 and May 2022. These parents were recruited through snowballing (by parents or by researchers who have worked on natural intensive parenting). In addition, parents were invited to participate through an invitation via their Facebook profile (e.g., being a doula or belonging to certain Facebook communities such as those linked with \"alternative\" lifestyles). The boards of \"alternative\" schools such as Waldorf were invited to participate in the study by disseminating the project. Having a child aged 6 or under and having delayed or refused at least one recommended vaccine were the main inclusion criteria for participation. Nevertheless, our sample criteria were open to recruit parents with children above 6 years of age who have in the past refused or delayed the vaccination. We expected that this age gap would not have an impact on parents' answers regarding their children's vaccination. In fact, during the interview, all parents were very clear about the reasons for having delayed, refused, or having doubts concerning the vaccination of their children. Participants' critical reflection on vaccination began mostly during pregnancy and after their children's birth and was triggered by personal experiences such as postvaccine reactions in their children or other children and academic immunization training. Nevertheless, some parents interviewed had children over the age of 6. Prior to participation, an email was sent to parents with information about the VAX-TRUST project, and they were invited to sign an informed consent form. All interviews were conducted online via Zoom and lasted between 39 min and 1 h and 58 min. Thirty-one parents were interviewed, namely, 28 women and 3 men aged between 30 and 54 years. The majority had a university degree (n = 28) and, from these, four had a PhD and one was a PhD student. Most participants had a professional role in the field of health, namely, as a doula (n = 13), nurse (n = 3) and chiropractor (n = 3). A detailed description of the interviewed parents is provided in [Table 1](#societies-13-00184-t001). [33](#B33-societies-13-00184)]. After an open-coding procedure, first-order themes were reduced into more restricted themes. Then, after a deep reading, these restricted themes were reduced to core themes. Thereby, six themes were identified: (i) natural birth; (ii) extended breastfeeding; (iii) adoption of a vegetarian/macrobiotic diet; (iv) preference for alternative educational models; (v) \"natural medicine\"; (vi) distrust in science. These themes will be discussed in the next section. Illustrative quotations translated to English will be presented. 4. Results 4.1. Natural Birth \"[The clinic] is known for providing the most natural birth possible (...) It was highly recommended for those who wanted to have a non-medicated birth. So, basically, I went to the clinic a little bit against my will because at the time, I was trying to have a home birth. What happened was that, at the time, we were living in a rented house, and it did not have the conditions that my husband thought were ideal for the baby to be born at home.\"Magda (41, one child) \"I think 90, over 95% of pregnancies, the obstetrician is just there to see the thing, right? The woman can do the job, she just needs the support but there is that 5% that makes the difference. So, I think the obstetrician's role is really 'ok, I am here just in case' (laughs) is it not? And if anything happens, they are there to intervene and intervene well.\"N\u00e1dia (41, one child) 4.2. Extended Breastfeeding \"We had already thought we had the intention of breastfeeding (...) It was mobilising resources so that I would have support regarding this aspect, right? Looking for people who could support me to achieve our goal as a family.\"Marlene (40, one child) 4.3. Adoption of a Vegetarian/Macrobiotic Diet \"With Camila we look at her needs, and with Aurora we look at Aurora's needs. It is by looking at the needs they have... And the stage of development they are in, that we adjust the diet. And that is why I say once again that it is a functional diet.\"Mafalda (43, two children) \"As soon as we started introducing food, we had a nutritionist who accompanied us until he was 12 months old (...) With a child it is necessary to take a different kind of care and we wanted to know if we were doing things carefully and supplying all his nutritional needs ...\"Neuza (33, one child) \"... given the nutrient deficient foods we eat, lack of contact with pure environments, excessive pollution, overpopulated places where there is more disease contagion, the only way such a society, with the existing level of world population can function, is with vaccination.\"M\u00e1rcia (40, one child) 4.4. Preference for Alternative Educational Models \"The respect for the individual, the respect for nature and the integration of nature into the routines of Anselmo's living. This is a methodology of much observation of the child, of... Many rituals. These are things that I also value, as a person, for me.\"Marlene (40, one child) \"... the school is also more in the countryside and it is a school with a fairly large outdoor space (...) One of the main characteristics of that school is that children are very involved in the garden, they have a greenhouse and produce many things and help with the organic fertilizer, and go weeding and sowing and then the school also produces food hampers.\"Madalena (36, one child) \"... it is a farm. My children love animals, bushland, farms, horses, they are very used to the outdoors and the school is a college, but outside is a huge farm, it is not a space between walls [...] He has contact with animals: cow, chicken, dog, peacock. That was the key deciding factor.\"Nicole (31, two children) \"(...) [public schools] have a pedagogical method and it is that pedagogical method for everyone. This is completely wrong. Teaching should be adapted to each child because each child is unique and special. And they are often very intelligent children, but they cannot adapt to that teacher's methodology. And they are labelled as stupid (...) because they cannot understand the way the teacher is teaching them something.\"Neide (37, three children) \"She went to home-schooling which is, like vaccination, a freedom of choice that we have in Portugal. It is not often recognised as, nowadays, it is almost false (...) So the law provides that parents have the right to choose the type of education they want to give to their children. At this stage, if we were to put our child in home-schooling, we would have to give in a legitimate document stating that this kind of teaching exists, together with a whole lot of other things, it\u00b4s rather a megalomaniac process.\"Mafalda (43, two children) 4.5. Natural Medicine \"We are aware and we have confidence in the paediatrician that when we have tried everything and nothing is working, if the antibiotic is needed, the antibiotic is needed\"(Nazar\u00e9, 33, one child) \"We always do prevention (...) it is a planning (...). Planning at a nutritional level, so we do supplementation, in order to prevent exactly that. There are periods of the year when we invest, like this one, in the immune system. And we do supplementation, vitamin C, vitamin D, zincs, all minerals, all that type.\"Mafalda (43, two children) \"Using the natural method, watching for three days and seeing if it improves. (...) I did not give her antibiotics. (...) Then I went on to do a rosemary bath, citrine salt which is anti-sceptic...\".Nicole (31, two children) 4.6. Distrust in Science \"Why am I already going to interfere with this kid's immune system when he is one or two days old to protect him from a disease that his mum might not even have, what is the likelihood of him getting it?\"(N\u00e1dia, 41, one child) \"And then the hepatitis B [vaccine]... Which will be their choice when they get older, when they start having sex with other people. Then we have to rethink this vaccine. I feel that they will already be able to participate in the decision and to make their choice.\"(Nat\u00e1lia, 38, two children) \"I think that measles is a disease that anyone with a good, a strong immune system can cope with, I don't know if there is a need for all the hysteria about measles.\"(M\u00e1rcia, 40, 1 child) \"[The polio vaccine] it is compulsory and the disease is totally eradicated. In other words, there has been no case of polio in Portugal or in other countries for some years now. Therefore, it is assumed that it is eradicated. (...) it doesn't make much sense to have a vaccine now.\"(Leonor, 46, 1 child) \"The conversation arises from why was this not done, do you have any idea, do you realise how dangerous this is ... and how are we going to do it now? Are you not going to do it? The question is always this. Are you not going to do it? You are not going to vaccinate, is that it? And I never experienced the other side which is...let's talk about it.\"(Maria, 33, one child) 5. Discussion [35](#B35-societies-13-00184)], who found that vaccine-hesitant parents often believe that natural lifestyle choices are key to control vaccine-preventable diseases. Indeed, when reasoning about their choices regarding their children's health, the arguments of the hesitant parents interviewed for the current study relied on the dichotomy of natural and artificial [ [14](#B14-societies-13-00184)], favoring the first. Their focus on natural living made them prioritize a natural birth with little to no medication, highlighting woman's autonomy and their bodies' natural ability to perform labor without any kind of intervention. Alternatively, they resorted to natural supplements as they believed that this would boost their children's immunity in a prophylactic way, aiming to minimize the impact of an eventual illness. In the same vein, when children got sick, hesitant parents relied on home remedies, which implied close parental supervision. For these parents, the choice of natural products goes hand in hand with the idea of being less risky [ [36](#B36-societies-13-00184)]. [32](#B32-societies-13-00184)]. The deep-rooted belief about the relevance of breastfeeding triggered mothers' commitment and sense of responsibility to this cause, making them feel accountable for their children's natural immunity. Hesitant parents continued to manage their children's nutritional intake throughout childhood by feeding them organic homegrown food and prioritizing a vegetarian or macrobiotic diet [ [37](#B37-societies-13-00184)]. Moreover, they preferred cooking from scratch rather than using processed foods containing additives and preservatives, even if that implied increased parental effort. [38](#B38-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, hesitant parents were highly critical of conventional public schools which \"place children between four walls\" while applying a single pedagogical method without accounting for children's individual characteristics. The connection between vaccine hesitancy and preference for alternative pedagogical models, rather than a massified education, had already been found in previous studies conducted in the U.S. [ [38](#B38-societies-13-00184)] and in Australia [ [26](#B26-societies-13-00184)]. To date, however, this relation has not been sufficiently described in the European literature. Moreover, in some cases, hesitant parents mentioned postponing their children's enrolment in kindergarten as a strategy to protect them against infection during their first years of life. Parents' control of their children's social networks by extending the period they stayed at home was also found in a study with American mothers [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)]. Previous research on vaccine hesitancy suggested that practices around vaccination are deeply interwoven with parents' experiences regarding a child's health and institutions [ [40](#B40-societies-13-00184)]. [26](#B26-societies-13-00184)]. The interplay of the caregiving practices described above was believed to ensure children's health in a natural way and making vaccines needless or, at least, less necessary [ [27](#B27-societies-13-00184)]. This view embodied the concept of healthism as shedding light on the individual responsibility and control for health management [ [14](#B14-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, parents understood themselves as \"active and capable agents\" who have the skills and the knowledge to make the best decisions for their children [ [26](#B26-societies-13-00184)]. Hesitancy towards vaccination may be understood as a result of the focus of health promotion and individual agency [ [41](#B41-societies-13-00184)]. Vaccine-hesitant parents recognize themselves as the main \"experts\" on their children's health, relying more on their own judgment to weigh the pros and cons of vaccination rather than on healthcare providers' recommendations [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)]. Parents understood themselves as guardians of children's pure bodies, which need to be protected from contamination by outside sources [ [42](#B42-societies-13-00184), [43](#B43-societies-13-00184)]. Healthist attitudes are illustrated throughout the criticism of these parents towards \"unnatural substances\" such as vaccines, favoring the natural immunization of their children. [44](#B44-societies-13-00184)] were similarly experienced by mothers and fathers interviewed for our study. Nevertheless, our sample was mainly composed of mothers. Previous research by Reich (2014) found that mothers recognize themselves as the main \"experts\" on their children's health, relying more on their own judgment to weigh the pros and cons of vaccination rather than on healthcare providers' recommendations [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)]. There is evidence that healthcare decisions are mostly taken by mothers [ [45](#B45-societies-13-00184)] and, accordingly, vaccine hesitancy may be considered as a gendered process, given women's central role in assessing the benefits and risks of the vaccination for their own children [ [46](#B46-societies-13-00184)]. Nevertheless, in our findings we did not find gender differences, as both mothers and fathers expressed concerns about vaccinating their children. What clearly became evident was that the parents interviewed for our study assume responsibility for the health of their children and manage their health risks through the adoption of healthist attitudes which are aligned with the neoliberalism ideology. [47](#B47-societies-13-00184)]. This commitment to healthism and its association with vaccine hesitancy has been found to be very much present in educated middle classes [ [48](#B48-societies-13-00184), [49](#B49-societies-13-00184)]. [49](#B49-societies-13-00184)]. The commitment with children's health implied ongoing parental supervision requiring additional time and money: extended breastfeeding, exhaustive searching for information about home/natural births (e.g., identification of healthcare professionals with similar ideals), tailoring diets to each child's nutritional needs, home remedies which usually implied more time to recover from illness, and preference for private schools with alternative educational models which are both more expensive and, in some cases, farthest from home. These practices were very much related with the fact that the parents in our sample were generally middle class; in particular, they were highly educated and had a good financial position. This resonates with the findings of Ward and colleagues [ [26](#B26-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, as outlined by Reich [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)], the decision of delaying or refusing the vaccination of their children may be middle-class privileged. Vaccine hesitancy may to a certain extent reflect social inequality, as those who are more well educated and have certain financial resources are more able to choose [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184), [50](#B50-societies-13-00184), [51](#B51-societies-13-00184)]. Unlike previous studies that found a broad spectrum [ [27](#B27-societies-13-00184)], and even though most of the participants in our study were not connected with one other, we noted a common approach among vaccine-hesitant parents. [2](#fn002-societies-13-00184)[ [52](#B52-societies-13-00184)]. Although we did not measure participants' health literacy level in the present study, we would expect it to be high given that most of them had tertiary education, and the literature shows that there is a positive correlation between health literacy and educational attainment [ [53](#B53-societies-13-00184)]. There are mixed findings in the literature regarding the relation between health literacy and vaccine hesitancy. In a recent systematic review, Lorini and colleagues [ [54](#B54-societies-13-00184)] found this relation to be influenced by factors such as risk perception and the likelihood of contracting the disease and its short-term consequences. On one hand, when these probabilities were perceived as high, health literacy positively predicted vaccination uptake; on the other hand, when these were low, a negative relation between health literacy and vaccination uptake was found. These conclusions may possibly shed light on the findings of the current study, as hesitant parents estimated a very low chance of their children contracting certain vaccine-preventable diseases. Based on our findings, we suggest that future studies should further explore the influence of both health literacy and communication between parents and healthcare professionals on parental decisions on children's immunization. 6. Conclusions [8](#B8-societies-13-00184)]. However, using vaccine hesitancy as the starting point, our findings show that healthism and its focus on personal accountability under the umbrella of neoliberalism may jeopardize global public health. While vaccine-hesitant parents in our sample focused on the needs of their own children, they may have put the health of others at risk by not following mainstream public health policies regarding vaccination [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)]. To address the distrust in science and medicine evident in the discourse of vaccine-hesitant parents, healthcare professionals should spend more time discussing parental vaccination concerns. We propose that the presumptive or paternalistic model of communication, which has proved ineffective in cases of vaccine hesitancy as information is usually perceived as biased [ [55](#B55-societies-13-00184)], should be replaced by a patient-centered approach, which takes individual/family characteristics and preferences as a starting point. Indeed, the findings of this study recall that healthcare professionals should pay particular attention to healthism when addressing vaccine hesitancy. Research evidence advocates the need to be sensitive to the broad spectrum of vaccine hesitancy, as this encompasses multiple views on the subject [ [56](#B56-societies-13-00184), [57](#B57-societies-13-00184)]. Indeed, the labeling of \"anti-vaxxers\" has been found to increase the polarization of discourses on vaccination, having a backfire effect in vaccine acceptance [ [58](#B58-societies-13-00184), [59](#B59-societies-13-00184)]. Therefore, instead of being critical of vaccine-hesitant parents, a more comprehensive approach on the reasons underlying vaccine hesitancy should be developed [ [59](#B59-societies-13-00184)]. 7. Study Limitations [60](#B60-societies-13-00184)]. The parents interviewed for this study were middle-class, confirming previous findings from other work [ [39](#B39-societies-13-00184)]. Therefore, other studies should include parents from other social positions. In addition, other sociodemographic aspects such as the age of the parents and the child should also be explored. Further research should examine gender differences in detail among parents regarding vaccine hesitancy, because although most studies have focused on mothers, fathers may also have a word to say concerning the vaccination of their children. The small sample of parents (n = 31) means that generalizability cannot be made to vaccine-hesitant parents in Portugal or elsewhere.
