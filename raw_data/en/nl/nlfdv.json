They do this by collecting strains of the flu virus from about 100 centers worldwide and then they analyze them in a laboratory. They take this information and use it to decide on the arrangement of the vaccines that are being offered for the following flu season. Also, there are two types of vaccines one that is injected and another that is a nasal-spray vaccine both that are made with live, attenuated virus. Flu vaccines specifically are recommended each year as this article mentions simply because \"New flu vaccines are released every year to keep up with rapidly adapting flu viruses\" (Mayo). This makes since because flu viruses change so quickly therefore last year's vaccine may not protect someone from the viruses of the upcoming years. Also after vaccination, one's immune system does produce antibodies that will protect them from the vaccine viruses. Overall the fact that antibody levels start to decrease over time that makes it another reason to get a flu shot every The main purpose of Bioshield was to protect the U.S. from future threats of bioterrorism and biological attacks. The origins of Bioshield came from President George W. Bush 2003 State of the Union address that announced the creation of Project Bioshield because of the anthrax envelope attack after 9/11. Congress passed legislation to establish Project Bioshield the following year and created a special $5.6 Billion fund for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS runs Bioshield. Bioshield's main objective was to produce and stockpile huge quantities of the next-generation anthrax vaccine and other vaccines or drugs to protect against other possible biological attacks. The major problem is that Bioshield doesn't have enough funding to achieve their objective, the average cost of drug development is about $800 million to 1 billion\u2014and this is before a single pill or vaccine is purchase. In addition, the HHS has had problems with the DOD and FDA on vaccines. The DOD has a different agenda than the HHS to use the vaccines and the vaccines that are being created is having difficulty meeting FDA standards. In the end \"What you're left is a great idea that was terribly flawed and unfortunately didn't the big splash it wanted,\" says Robert Kadlec, a career U.S. Air Force officer who worked on biodefense for the George W. Bush White As employees and health care works of well known organizations, we have an ethical and moral obligation to make decisions and choices that reflect the best interest of the health of our patients. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2010), mandatory programs should be enforced for health professionals justifying the need for employees to receive the influenza vaccine. The Joint Commission believes that an estimated 80% or higher of influenza immunization rates are crucial for providing the necessary immunity needed to protect and reduce influenza infections or health-related illnesses (The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). Voluntary programs consist of having the vaccine readily available for employees for no cost, providing staff with education on influenza prevention, and having Issue Proposal on the Efficacy of Flu Shots In recent years encouragement to get flu shots has become a yearly mantra. Elderly, children six months to two years, health care workers and immune-deficient people are urged in the strongest terms to go to their doctors or clinics and get a flu shot. This group encompasses about 98 million people. In the fall of 2004 this was in the forefront of American and to some extent the Western World media with the shortage of this flu seasons vaccine. Current medical wisdom states that flu shots are safe, effective and prevent mortality. A recent study published by The Journal of the American Medicine Association (JAMA) has brought the current wisdom into question. On February 14, 2005 JAMA Influenza viruses are divided into three classes. These are A, B, and C. Influenza A and B are blamed for the increases in hospitalization and deaths each year. The aim of receiving an annual vaccine is to prevent spreading infections. Since flu outbreaks vary, it is recommended that individuals receive a vaccination for the flu Will You Take the Flu Vaccine? Do you really know what's going into your body when you go to the local pharmacy and get your yearly flu vaccine? An analysis of the flu vaccine process reveals multiple worries concerning the terminology used by doctors to describe vaccines and their symptoms; however, can these disadvantages keep you from getting the flu vaccine, which will increase your risk of becoming infected with influenza. American citizens are worried about getting their flu vaccines this year due to the studies they have read on side effects and long term illnesses the vaccine can cause. These issues arise because of misinterpretations of studies and statistics provided by medical professionals. The response to these studies cause Americans to fear the flu vaccine and not go protect themselves against influenza. Key phrases such as \"inactivated virus or a weakened virus to mimic infection and spur a controlled immune response\" (Bradford) can cause havoc in our society due to gobbledygook. Gobbledygook is a doublespeak which overwhelms the audience with technical and unfamiliar words. Inactivated or weakened virus used by scientific group can often lead to a lack of understanding of what is actually at stake for the American people. The best strategy for preventing the spread of influenza continues to be yearly vaccination. However, despite this information, people However, in 2014, news reports emerged of the CDC accidentally sending live samples of Ebola to a lower level facility and discovering forgotten vials of smallpox in a cardboard box in a facility owned by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Young and Penzenstadler, \"Inside America's secretive biolabs\"). The CDC is reknowned for successfully eradicating diseases like smallpox and polio, but these incidents damage the reputation of the agency because workers did not follow biosafety protocol. Violations of biosafety, or precautions taken to reduce the risk of infecting laboratory workers and In summary, the influenza vaccine is a strong agreement between the controls of the effective measure to reduce the spread of influenza, which is caused disease among research experts. It is a represents a few severe side effects. Experts acknowledge that there may be effective in increasing vaccination rates to be identified barriers to vaccination and immunization programs Ben Williams said, \"During the course of experiment, Dr. Szmuness voiced his concern about possible vaccine contamination. He even suspected that one vaccine batch made by the National Institutes of Health was contaminated.\" The experiments carried on. Summary For many years, flu vaccines were made with cells from chicken eggs, but now, a new method from a company called CSL may change that in the future. CSL is currently working on a vaccine using dog cells, which can be stored form a much longer period the its chicken egg cell counterparts. This could be a solution to problems that may arise in the future, such as another flu pandemic, because stores of the vaccine could be made in advance. The cost of dogs cell compared to chicken-egg cells is also significantly cheaper, which could bring the vaccines into countries that previously could not afford them, \"as little as half the $3.50 cost to make a dose of flu vaccine via egg, estimates UBS analyst Andrew Goodsall. That would make flu shots affordable enough for such countries as Mexico and Brazil, he says...\" As stated in the previous paragraph, potentially any food item could possibly be contaminated, and lots of people could suffer as a result of it. Another thing that must be examined is the availability of medicine According to historyofvaccines.org, U.S. agencies conducted a simulation of a biological attack using smallpox as the weapon, in which serious weaknesses were exploited, one of them being that there would be a shortage of vaccines(\"Biological Weapons\"), which is only part of the problem surrounding medicine against bioterrorism. According to the article, \"One challenge to licensing vaccines for response to bioweapon threats is the absence of some of these disease agents in the natural world. Vaccine efficacy is more difficult to establish when natural exposure to a pathogen is impossible,\"(\"Biological Weapons\"). Despite us not having data to combat against unnatural diseases, we fortunately. have programs from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) such as the The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which has a group known as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which purchases the treatments(vaccines/drugs) and tools required for public health medical emergencies(\"Biological Weapons\"). From this, we can see that actions must be taken to ensure that we have the proper medicine to combat against The Center for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices determined risk of infection, risks of serious illness, and risk of spreading the infection as the overriding reasons or identifying candidates for vaccination. As an asthma patient, Alison falls under the group of serious illness; therefore, she should be considered for the flu vaccine even though she doesn't meet the criteria set forth by the Santa Clara County. As a health care manager, my goal will be set at vaccinating the greatest number of people with the limited resources, so, the first come, first serve approach invoked by the local clinic Alison attended undermined the policy proposed by the CDC. The very sick, children and elderly will not benefit from Enthusiasm for food safety has developed as food supply chains the world over have endured one type of food scare or the other (Kaferstein et al., 1997, M\u00f8rkbak et al. 2010). Despite the fact that, the Food Standard Agency (FSA) UK, reported a 19.2% decrease in food borne ailments somewhere around 2000 and 2006, there were still more than 53,000 research facility reported instances of food borne pathogens in the UK in 2005 (FSA, 2007). In 2006, the Agency directed 1,342 examinations of food related occurrences including prominent cases like the salmonella flare-up connected with chocolate, benzene in sodas and the unapproved genetically adjusted living being (GMO) contamination of U.S. rice (FSA, 2007). This evidence of diversionary propaganda embroils Times owners, and GM mosquito vaccine enterprise investors in Oxitec. The consumer fraud in selling and concealing risky biotechnologies is a commercial crime. The deadly experiment gone awry now threatens billions of families that may birth millions of brain damaged children. The social and financial burdens from this growing pandemic are overwhelming. "}
