Here's everything you need to know about how to build and benefit from an Ayurvedic Morning Routine. Explore more Ayurveda on the [Saumya Blog](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/blog), selected top Ayurveda blogs and websites to watch. According to Ayurveda, dinacharya - or daily routine - is integral to our physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. Making space for meaningful rituals helps us ride the waves of energetic shifts throughout the day. An Ayurvedic morning routine lays the foundation for a grounded, focused day. Here's how to tune into the rhythm of the universe from the moment you open your eyes. Why build an Ayurvedic morning routine? Our lives are a reflection of the small choices we make each day - how we treat ourselves, spend our time, and direct our energy. Unfortunately, in our busy modern world, it's easy to feel spread thin or swamped with endless obligations. When we're stressed and overwhelmed, we don't always make the best decisions for our physical and mental health. This trends our bodies towards illness and imbalance over time. As a result, we may develop \"lifestyle diseases\" like diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. We might just also feel blah, disconnected, and uninspired. An Ayurvedic morning routine sets the tone for a healthy, centered day. It doesn't need to be complicated. By creating a few rituals that work for you, you can harness the energetic rhythm of the day for greater overall wellbeing. Doshic Energy and Your Ayurvedic Morning Routine An Ayurvedic morning routine aligns us with the changing doshic energies in our environments. In Ayurveda, the three doshas - Pitta, Kapha, and Vata - dominate different hours of the day. Small daily rituals, done at an intentional hour, help us flow with these bio-energetic forces - rather than struggle against them. Vata: 2 a.m. - 6 a.m. (and 2 p.m. - 6 p.m.) Airy Vata rules the wee hours of the morning. Waking up at peak Vata hour helps us rise with greater vigor. These early hours are a great time to eliminate and detoxify, as well as perform grounding practices like meditation and breathwork. Kapha: 6 a.m. - 10 a.m. (and 6 p.m. - 10 p.m.) Try to start your day before heavy Kapha rolls around. Otherwise, it can be a bit like waking in molasses, and you may feel off and dull throughout the day. Kapha energy is best harnessed for knocking mundane items off your to-do list - or getting the heart pumping with a bit of light exercise. \"Waking before Kapha kicks in, we catch the natural movement of Vata and our minds are clearer and our energy is increased.\" - Veena, Saumya Ayurveda Pitta: 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. (and 10 p.m. - 2 a.m) Vigorous Pitta energy is ruled by fire and water. Make the most of Pitta by using these hours for focused productivity. For instance, if accounting is challenging, do it between 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. when Pitta's sharp mental qualities are at their strongest. Ayurvedic Morning Routine: 6 Rituals to Start Your Day The most important part of an Ayurvedic morning routine? Do what feels best for you. It's about finding a few key rituals that provide you the most support - not following a set of rules. You can think of your Ayurvedic morning routine as six simple rituals: Wake at a supportive hour Cleanse and clear Ground and breathe Eat a dosha-balancing breakfast Get moving! Take your herbs 1. Wake at a Supportive Hour The hour at which you rise is one of the most important principles of an Ayurvedic morning routine. When we wake at the most supportive time, we catch a wave of energy versus struggling and swimming upstream. The ideal wake-up schedule varies by dosha and with the seasons. But, in general: Vata-dominant types should wake up by 6:00 a.m. Pitta-dominant types should wake up by 5:30 a.m. Kapha-dominant types should wake up by 4:30 am If you start your day before sunrise, you can harness the light, expansive quality of Vata hour. Vata rules movement and helps get us going. Even spending just a few moments in this energy can spark a powerful shift in your day. After waking, take a few deep breaths and welcome your body, mind, and spirit into another day. Connect with your breath with gentle diaphragmatic breathing - which nostril is more open? You may also take a moment to self-reflect, express gratitude, or journal. 2. Cleanse and Clear Just as we sweep the entryway to our home, it's important to cleanse our bodies and minds. The following rituals help clear gunk - or ama - in our system. These practices are best done just after sunrise, when Kapha's grounding energy aids purification and self-care. Normal morning activities become cleansing rituals when we infuse them with intention. As you brush your teeth, wash your face, bathe, or drink a glass of warm water - consider how they purify and rejuvenate your energetic life force. Tongue Scraping Have you ever stuck your tongue out in the mirror and noticed a filmy white coating? This is a buildup of ama, or toxins. Daily tongue scraping helps remove bacteria, improves bad breath, and keeps our body from reabsorbing this harmful oral gunk. It also provides a gentle - yet stimulating - massage of the internal organs. Saumya Ayurveda's [guide to tongue scraping](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/each-dosha-benefits-from-using-an-ayurvedic-tongue-scraper?utm_campaign=db5d57f8-30f1-47e6-abb4-f4bf9dfd5519&utm_source=so&utm_medium=mail&cid=147c70e8-4bac-48b0-9e0c-f86e1b947571) shares a simple how-to for this powerful practice - and dives deeper into the benefits. Oil Pulling Another way to cleanse oral ama is by oil pulling. You can think of oil pulling as an Ayurvedic mouthwash that supports a clear mind and healthy sinuses. The process is simple: Put one tablespoon of sesame oil or coconut oil in your mouth Begin swishing the oil through your teeth and gums as you would any mouthwash Continue swishing for 15 - 20 minutes (you can start with five minutes and work up) If your oil quickly changes color and consistency, spit it out and start again the next day. Otherwise, you'll be swishing with - and recirculating - ama gunk. After swishing, spit the oil in the trash or toilet (spitting in the sink can clog your drain) Take care not to swallow to avoid re-ingesting the toxins and bacteria Garshana/Dry Brushing Dry brushing, known as garshana, is a traditional Ayurvedic treatment one can do at home. Dry brushing promotes movement of lymph which is a passive system. According to the [Cleveland Clinic,](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system) the lymphatic system is part of the immune system responsible for fluid balance, defending the body against infection, and removing cellular waste. Skin being our largest organ of digestion, it is also the largest detoxifying organ we have. This is why garshana, dry brushing, is such an important Ayurvedic treatment. Follow dry brushing with Abhyanga massage. To learn more about dry brushing and how to performs this detoxifying and invigorating Ayurveda treatment at home, click here.

Nasya Oil Nasya oil treatment is a form of inner-cleansing that involves applying herbalized oils to our nasal passages. Nasya oil is infused with herbs that support the sinus, nose, throat, and head, and balance all doshas, particularly Vata. A regular Nasya treatment supports our overall well-being. Anointing our nose lubricates the nasal passages and provides subtle moisture to our breath. It can also help with allergies and sinus conditions, and boost focus and mental clarity. This blog unpacks [how to use Nasya oil](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/nasya-oil) for better focus, reduced stress, improved breathing, and greater health. \"Your nasya oil really had a strong, positive effect on my life.

Your nasya oil really calmed the mind.\" - Anonymous, New Mexico 3. Move, Breathe, and Reflect Yog-asana/Movement Yog-asana refers to the physical postures of yogic practice.

All dosha types can benefit from two basic pranayama part of your Ayurvedic morning routine, start with regular diaphragmatic breathing.

What and how you eat doesn't just nourish your body. It can shape your entire life. \"When you eat, just eat. Sit down. Quiet yourself by observing your breath for a few inhalations and exhalations. Feel your feet on the ground. Be grateful for your food, and how it will support your health physically, mentally, and spiritually. Chew your food mindfully (rather than gulping it down). Taste it. Enjoy it. Savor the entire experience: both the flavor of the food and the act of eating as a whole.\" --Veena, Saumya Ayurveda For all dosha types, foods are best when cooked, eaten warm, spiced, and freshly made. Beyond this, we benefit from morning meals attuned to our doshic composition. Vata Breakfast - Dense and Moist Stir fried root vegetables (ex: sweet potato; carrots; beet) with ghee-fried egg Oatmeal in plant-based milk; with a pinch of cinnamon and/or cumin, and a touch of maple syrup and/or nut butter Stewed fruits (ex: pears or apples) with cinnamon and nutmeg Pitta Breakfast - Cooling and Dry Basmati rice or oatmeal with plant-based milk; topped with sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Whole-grain toast with avocado or fresh fruit preserves Chia pudding with plant-based milk and a dash of maple syrup (or other natural sweetener) Kapha Breakfast - Light and Dry Bitter greens (ex: kale; arugula; chard) lightly sauteed in ghee Warm cereals with a drizzle of honey or maple syrup Fresh seasonal fruit - stewed, juiced, or blended into a smoothie 5.

I had gotten to the point that I thought a lot of what I was experiencing was just a normal part of the aging process\u2014things changed over time, and I just got used to them. It's been great knowing that I can experience better health and increased vitality with some relatively small changes. Veena is great about understanding what I could easily accommodate in my daily routine. There was no \"forcing\" solutions, but rather incorporating what I could to work with my lifestyle. I have experienced amazing results!\" -Kate K., Stillwater, Minnesota \"I have suffered from chronic headaches and migraines for as long as I can remember. I had talked to multiple PCPs and specialists about these issues, had been prescribed a variety of medications that never really fixed the issue. Veena promptly put together a plan of action. Right away I noticed a significant decrease in the number of headaches I was getting, and when I did get them, they were much less severe than they had been in the past. This is certainly the headache treatment plan that I have seen the biggest benefit from, and I plan to continue my new regimen moving forward. I am very thankful for Veena's knowledge and advice and would not hesitate to recommend her services to friends and family alike.\" -Adrienne Sobering, Albuquerque, New Mexico \"Saumya Ayurveda has helped me to become reborn.
