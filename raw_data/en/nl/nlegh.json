Samana vata is located in the lower stomach and small intestine and plays a major role in igniting our agni. From the moment we take in food it is responsible for secreting the digestive enzymes that breakdown food and separating the nutrients from the waste materials. Foods that are light and easy to digest along with herbs like ginger, black pepper, cumin, ajwain and hingvastak help the power of Samana Vata. When Samana Vata is in a balanced state, we experience regular medium to strong appetite as well a feeling of satisfaction with no digestive symptoms after eating. Samana vata works by sending a signal to Prana vata that promotes the feeling of hunger. When we first start to eat, Samana vata sends another signal that stimulates digestive enzymes to break down and absorb the nutrients into the small intestine. The entire process of extracting nutrients from food and nourishing our cells is governed by Samana vata. When Samana vata is aggravated and out of balance the person will have low or no appetite, with post digestive gas, bloating and possible pain. When vata is aggravated, digestion will be irregular, meaning sometimes it's working and other times it's poor. Poor quality digestion leads to problems with absorption and nutrient deficiencies. Over time if Samana vata is not corrected, malabsorption will cause other digestive disorders. Ayurveda recommends a vata pacifying diet and lifestyle, along with herbs that improve digestion.
