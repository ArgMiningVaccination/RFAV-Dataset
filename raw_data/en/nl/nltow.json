The Principles in Homoeopathy is based on the Theory of 'Vital force' by which Dr Samual Hanhemann says the Vital Force is the integral Spiritual energy which presents in every human organism which has the capacity to control, growth, heal and other functions in the body, Disturbance to the Vital Force due to ceratin other dynamic forces which are from external or internal origin are the causes the disease. Here in aphorism number 9 of Organon of Medicine(6th Edition) \"In the healthy condition of man, the spiritual vital force (autocracy), the dynamic that animates the material body (organism), rules with unbounded sway, and retains all the parts of the organism in admirable, harmonious, vital operation, as regards both sensations and functions, so that our indwelling, reason-gifted mind can freely employ this living, healthy instrument for the higher purpose of our existence.\" Theory of Miasm Hahnemann- The Experimenter who for the many years struggling to find the causes of the chronic diseases and he found the Syphilis,Sycotic and later the Psora are the causes of the chronic diseases. Theory of Potentisation of Medicine The Potentisation of Medicine means to Flare the power-up of the medicine dynamically by the methods of Trichuration for the solids drug substances and the succussion for the liquid drug substances here the quantity of the original drug substance will be decreased with consideration of the increase in the potencies with the higher dilutions with water. Commentary Due to Dynamic nature of Homoeopathic Medicines, the material quantity of original drug substance will be incalculable at a certain point like after 24x, the number which covers the Avagadro's number so you can not shows the original drug substance. So, here the materialistic minded peoples laugh to the homoeopath, but they cant have even an idea of spirituality they are stuck with the gross visible things are the only truth and the only those substances which given in materially has the power of the alter the state of the normal cell. here is probable Explanation, When we diluting the drug substance with water the properties of that drug substance will remain with the molecules of water and the with the process of trituration and succussion the kinetic energy which is liberated and the power of penetration increases with ever higher and higher potencies. Prof. Dr Rustum Roy which explained about the three-dimensional structure of water and the molecules drug substances which remains with the water without changing the molecular property. Structural Energy heals. Homoeopathic Materia Medica is based on the proving of the medicines on the healthy human beings of both sexes and of different ages and at different circumstances. The Individual reaction of each individual is noted and Materia Medica is formed in this way. Study of Dynamics From all the above, we are dealing with dynamic science and healing of the patient on the sphere of dynamic, The correction of the dynamic derangement in the body due to certain causes and with the dynamic medicines, the homoeopath will correct the disturbances that happening with the vital force. Essentially it is very important to study dynamic by the Homoeopath from all sphere of life, It is going to the biggest world of the Ideas and Hypothesis, with using intellect and logic if you are studying the concepts of dynamics you can ultimately come to the point Spiritual Healing. How can we treat the patient with the methods used by our ancient healers along with the homoeopathy. Mind and Therapeutics The Holistic healing which should cover the Mind and If we know the answers of the following Questions you are a true healer. Where is the Mind? How does the mind work? Does mind is responsible for the Disease? Does the power of the mind will cure the disease? The mind just not present in the brain. The mind is Consciousness, The Consciousness which is present in each cell of our body whatever you call the Nucleus of each cell is the brain of these particular cells likewise the existence of mind or consciousness is present in each cell. The mind has the flow of energies the Awareness is responsible for the diversion of energy, there are different tracks on the energy flows for e.g. love, Anger, Jealousy are the tracks, and Awareness is responsible to take the diversion on a specific track in the mind. All we watch the Cinema, you pay money to the movie director for that awareness, here you are giving the remote control of your awareness to the movie director and the scenes in the movies are just changing the tracks from one track to different track of mind. Now we come to the next point, Does mind is responsible for the Disease? Definitely Yes! we have the concept of the psycho-somatic diseases I think The Thoughts in the mind are more responsible for the disease likewise the 'Five Thieves' (Lust, Wrath, Greed, Attachment, Ego or excessive Pride) according to Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gita. excess of these Thieves is the 'Diseased Mind' The uncontrolled senses are later produces the disharmony the excess enjoy by the organs later gives agony. Origin of Auto-Immune Diseases are in the Thoughts and in the Mind, Behind every emotion, there are the formation of certain molecules in the brain which are responsible for the physiological changes in the cell and body. e.g. In the feeling of Love, the formation of Oxytocin so-called the bonding hormone these are the molecules. The hatred feeling towards others makes the molecules in the brain which are responsible for the destruct your body, hating others ultimately applied to you also. So there are certain Emotions which are responsible for the formation of Molecules which is having the destructive forces like Anger, Jealousy The Book of Dr. Joseph Murphy, \"The power of Your Subconscious Mind\" has changed my prospectives, using the inbuilt power of the subconscious mind with the intelligent way we can treat any disease and get the things that we want. Indian Philosophy and Health Indian Philosophy is much useful in understanding the Patient and treating the patient. To treat the disease first know the what disease is, and to treat the human being first be a good-willed human being. The knowledge of spirituality will help to not just at the physical sphere but at the various dimensions of the health. The oldest system of medicine Ayurveda, which says about healthy habits and a healthy sorrow, extreme fear, exhaustion, wrong foods, sedentary living, too much salt and spices lead to most major killer diseases. So, the solution is very simple in moderation and that which pleases the mind. Do not cheat or tell lies. Work very hard. Forgive others even if they hurt you. Treat all as your own kith and kin. Health would be yours always Their a lot of diseases originate from the wrong diet and regimens and just correcting those factors from the daily routine makes a complete recovery, Diabetes Mellitus type 2 is originating from that unhealthy diet and regimen just correcting with a healthy diet and proper regimen sufficient to the recovery of the patient. Use the least amount of the drugs and medicines to cure, there is a system called Immune System which has the capacity to overcome the disease, give the immune system to chance to work, we takes the antibiotics for the trifle causes and suppressing our immunity. The Father of Medicine Hippocrates who says- Cure rarely; Comfort mostly; Console always. Preventing the disease is more profitable than treating the disease. Indian Spiritual Philosophy We know, the importance of the mind in creating and curing the disease, the diseased mind creates the disease on the physical plane also, with the imbibing the good thoughts in mind we can enjoy better health. The Indian Vedantic Philosophy is all about the mind and even deep study of human psychology. In the Kathopanishad It likewise has given Human body is the chariot The individual self is the owner of the chariot Intelligence (Buddhi) is the charioteer The mind is the reins The five senses are the horses The world experienced by the senses are the tracks on which the horses tread. The Individual self associated with the senses and the mind is the enjoyer. Indian Philosophy is all about the Chitta Shuddhi, About the detoxification of impure thoughts, Mental Illnesses There are lots of mental illness for which the patient gets admitted in the hospitals often they get the sleeping tablets by the doctors of modern medicines and conditions of that patient gets worse day by day, Who can better treat their minds? Another Goodmind! a good psychiatrist a good counseller, treatment of unhealthy minds by a healthy mind. As above What Hippocrates says Cure rarely; Comfort mostly; Console always. so, the part of consolation and showing compassion towards that patients will recover faster than than the toxic feeding of the allopathic medicines. The Homoeopathy having a great scope in treating Mental Illnesses like - mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder) anxiety disorders. personality disorders. psychotic disorders (such as schizophrenia) eating disorders. trauma-related disorders (such as post-traumatic stress disorder) substance abuse disorders. Homoeopathic Medicines having the action on the Manomaya Kosh of the Mental Body. It will correct the constitutional defects through constitutional medicines. Most of the medicines in the homoeopathy medicines like Anacardium, Alumina, Lachesis, etc having direct shows the features of the schizophrenic symptoms. many medicines show the degeneration of the brain cells it helps in the gentle cure. The Holistic Healing Using the gentle and principle-based tools for the treatment of any disease with the least use of medicines. Spiritual healing which consists of the treatment of the disease from all corners like the mental as well as the physical sphere, Homoepathy is the system based on the spiritual, dynamics principles and the natures law of cure, so the patient is getting cure naturally with the natural inbuild immunity with minimum doses which just stimulates the patients immune system.
