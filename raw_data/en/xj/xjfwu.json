This natural and vitalistic approach allows for profound healing of the body and return of health and balance, without the invasiveness and potential side effects of drug therapy and surgery. It also allows for the prevention of chronic disease through the application of good nutrition, exercise and other health regimens. Over and above the tools that naturopathic doctors use, what really sets naturopathic medicine apart is its philosophy. Naturopathic medicine seeks to find the underlying cause of disease, not seeking to simply mask symptoms. Herbs and other \"natural\" remedies can also be used to suppress or mask symptoms just as well as drugs (and often are to give relief while underlying issues are addressed), but this is not in keeping with the naturopathic philosophy, which will unceasingly try to find the root cause and address that, so that symptoms naturally resolve on their own. Naturopathic medicine is founded on the healing power of nature, which means that the body will correct itself, rebalance itself - in medical terms, return to homeostasis - if the obstacles to healing are removed. So often the role of the naturopathic doctor is to identify and remove those obstacles. Naturopathic doctors also engage the patients as partners in their own care, and adopt a team approach. They will educate their patients in their health concerns and encourage them to take responsibility for their healing path. Naturopathic medicine recognizes that illness results from a complex interaction of physical, spiritual, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. The naturopathic doctor treats the whole person by taking all of these factors into account, not seeing them as simply related to a single organ or body part. All parts are interrelated and must be seen as such for true healing to be possible. The beauty of naturopathic medicine is that naturopathic doctors have comprehensive training in medical sciences, including western medicine and pharmacology. In many states, naturopathic doctors are allowed to prescribe hormones and medications and may do so when the case warrants it. An example of this is Dr. Nicola's approach to Lyme disease, where she combines antibiotic therapy with naturopathic supportive remedies. Hence naturopathic medicine combines the latest in medical science with age-old traditions of healing, giving every patient the best success in restoration of health and further prevention of illness.
