Specifically, in your desire to lead a healthier life, you may wonder if there are vitamins you can take to help with [opioid withdrawal](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/withdrawal-detox/). Article at a Glance: - Some people try alternative remedies to help with opiate withdrawal symptoms. - There are no vitamins or supplements approved by the FDA for opiate detox or withdrawal. - Vitamins to consider trying however, include multivitamins, passionflower, vitamin C, and ginseng. - You can also help yourself through opiate withdrawal by eating high-protein and high-fiber foods. - Drinking water, sticking to scheduled mealtimes, and avoiding starchy/sugary foods can help too. It is important to note that no vitamins, herbs or supplements have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in opiate detox or withdrawal. However, some vitamins were studied by researchers and other experts. Doctors know that if you struggle with opiate use, you may also have [challenges with](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002149.htm) poor diet and eating patterns. Therefore, in some cases, it is possible that using vitamins, herbs or supplements may help. When choosing vitamins to use during withdrawal, the package labeling on the vitamins may not be able to help you. Because some supplements are not approved by the FDA, companies are not allowed to market their vitamins, herbs or supplements with claims that they help with [opioid addiction treatment](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/treatment-rehab/). It is important to talk to your doctor before starting new vitamins, herbs or supplements. Some products may have an interaction with medicines you are currently taking.

Your doctor may conduct blood tests to find out if you have any deficiencies. Different deficiencies have different symptoms, and treating them will make you healthier and stronger during recovery. - Passionflower: Passionflower is an herb that [was studied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11679027/)alongside clonidine, a drug that is sometimes used for opiate withdrawal. In the study, people who took passionflower with clonidine had less [opioid withdrawal symptoms](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/opiate-addiction/withdrawal-detox/)than the people who took clonidine alone. The physical symptoms, as well as the mental symptoms like [anxiety](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental-health/anxiety/), of the withdrawal process improved with passion flower use. Researchers think that the herb works because of its effect on multiple chemicals in the brain. Side effects of passionflower [include](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/passionflower)dizziness and sleepiness. - Vitamin C: Vitamin C is a chemical that plays an important role in the body. Vitamin C was [studied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10836211/)in patients suffering from [heroin withdrawal](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/heroin-addiction/withdrawal-detox/)and it improved major withdrawal symptoms when used in high doses. Luckily, vitamin C, even at high doses, is [nontoxic](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#en3). The [main side effects](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/#en3)at high doses are nausea and diarrhea. - Ginseng: Ginseng is a traditional Chinese herb. Several studies have been conducted on ginseng in both humans and animals. Studies have shown that ginseng [may improve mood symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22031036/)like anxiety during opiate withdrawal. There are multiple kinds of ginseng available, so it is important to know what kind you are buying. Most studies looked at Asian ginseng, also known as red ginseng. It is also important to talk to your doctor before using ginseng if you have a history of cancer, because ginseng [may impact some cancers](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ginseng-asian#references-24). Side effects of ginseng [include](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/ginseng-asian#references-24)dry mouth, fast heartbeat, and diarrhea. - Acetyl-L-carnitine: This dietary supplement is derived from carnitine and L-carnitine. Carnitine is an important chemical building block for the body. Acetyl-L-carnitine was [studied](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18978503/)and shown to improve muscle symptoms and sleep problems from opiate withdrawal. Side effects from the supplement are very rare and usually limited to an upset stomach. However, you should talk to your doctor before using the supplement if you are on chemotherapy drugs for cancer, because the supplement may [increase your risk](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/carnitine)of nerve damage. Natural Vitamins for Opiate Withdrawal Some of the best vitamins for opiate withdrawal come directly from the food you eat. Diet is especially important for people who struggle with opiates because they often have [severe nutrient deficiencies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411899/). People using opiates are likely to eat [very few](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411899/) fruits and vegetables. Instead, opiate users are likely to eat foods with little nutritional value. Additionally, [setbacks are more common](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002149.htm) if poor nutrition habits continue. One reason for this is that a person recovering from substance use [may mistake hunger](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002149.htm) for a drug craving. This factor increases the risk of experiencing a setback. Opiate users should, therefore: - Eat foods high in [protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411899/), such as fish and chicken - Consume less starchy and sugary foods, and [instead](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411899/), have more vegetables and whole grains - Eat a [high-fiber](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002149.htm)diet - Schedule mealtimes and stick to them - Drink fluids with meals and between meals If you or a loved one live with opiate addiction, [contact The Recovery Village](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/contact/) today.
