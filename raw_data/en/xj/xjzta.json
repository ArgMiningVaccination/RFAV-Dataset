Water Pesky aphids \"rarely climb back on\" to plants once they've been knocked off, reports [Better Homes & Gardens](https://www.bhg.com/gardening/pests/insects-diseases-weeds/stop-aphids/). So the first thing to try is the safest thing you can think of: Put a spray nozzle on the end of your hose and blast them off leaves (without damaging the plant, of course); repeat this two or three times a week till the bugs are gone. Oil spray Are aphids and mites munching on your tender new sprouts?

Add 2 teaspoons of this mixture to 1 quart of water in a spray bottle, shake well, and douse the pests. Rubbing alcohol \"Alcohol affects many types of insects, apparently by causing them to dry out and die,\" advises the [Brooklyn Botanic Garden](https://www.bbg.org/gardening/article/natural_pesticides). It also cautions that some plants may wither if treated with this common antiseptic\u2014so test a leaf or two on your plant before committing to the full treatment.

Neem oil Derived from the tropical neem tree, this oil is a powerful weapon against not only a variety of insects such as caterpillars and beetles, but their eggs and larvae as well\u2014all while remaining non-toxic to birds, bees, and other wildlife. The [basic neem recipe](https://www.treehugger.com/lawn-garden/8-natural-homemade-insecticides-save-your-garden-without-killing-earth.html): mix 2 teaspoons of [neem oil](https://www.rd.com/article/neem-oil-for-plants/) with 1 teaspoon of gentle liquid soap and 1 quart of water, shake, and spray. Neem can also be used as a fungicide. Mulch One of the first tools every sustainable gardener should know about is mulching\u2014that is, laying wood chips or hay on the soil around your plants. This not only keeps the surrounding soil moist, cutting back the need to water, [says the New York Botanical Garden](https://www.nybg.org/about/sustainability/alternative-treatments/organic-gardening/); it also suppresses any weeds that might try and poke their pesky heads through it.

Boiling water That's right\u2014 [water can be a solution to weeds](https://www.gardenweb.com/discussions/2766799/organic-weed-control-methods--boiling-water) as well as bugs. Only, to be effective as an herbicide, it has to be boiled first. Take your full, heated kettle out to the lawn or garden and pour its contents out on whatever uninvited plants you'd like to be rid of. Take care not to let it seep over onto any plants you'd like to keep around, though; boiling water is an equal opportunity plant killer. Corn gluten Got a patch of soil that's prone to weeds? Sprinkle on some of this mealy substance that's a byproduct of the corn milling process, reports [Small Footprint Family.](https://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/10-organic-ways-to-control-weeds) While it won't kill off any weeds that have already sprouted up, it will suppress new ones.

White vinegar For especially noxious weeds, try using this common household liquid. Its 5 percent acid content is strong enough to shrivel up any number of leafy interlopers without poisoning the soil, according to [TreeHugger](https://www.treehugger.com/lawn-garden/homemade-herbicide-kill-weeds-without-killing-earth.html), though you should keep it away from your desirable plants, which will also succumb to its powers. You can maximize its potential by adding a squirt of dish soap. Diatomaceous earth Easily found in garden or aquarium centers, this natural compound is made up of the sharp remains of fossilized plants. Sprinkle your garden with it\u2014it absorbs oils and fats from insect exoskeletons, drying them out and killing them. The abrasive nature or the earth speeds this process.

Let sit for ten to 15 days. Strain, then dilute, using the formula of one part compost tea to 10 parts water (although you can go down to four parts water for serious fungal infections). Spray on your infected plants\u2014especially roses plagued by black spot and tomatoes besieged by early blight. Goose the strength of your tea by adding 2 tablespoons of molasses per 1 gallon of diluted tea, or a squirt of citrus oil.

Painted daisy petals This one takes a bit of advance planning, says [gardeningknowhow.com](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/info/homemade-fungicide.htm), but it's an effective enough treatment that it's used in some commercial fungicides.

To use the herbicide, strain the mixture, dilute in 4 gallons of water, and spray. "}
