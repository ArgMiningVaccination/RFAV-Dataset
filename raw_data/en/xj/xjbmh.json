In this paper, we examined the implicit prescription patterns behind the Chinese medicinal formulae, so as to explore the Chinese medicinal compatibility patterns or rules in the treatment or control of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. Methods: This study was based on the herbs recorded in Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China, and the literature sources from Chinese Journal Net and China Master Dissertations Full-text Database (1990 -2010) to analyze the compatibility rule of the prescription. Each Chinese herb was listed according to the selected medicinal formulae and the added information was organized to establish a database. The frequency and the association rules of the prescription patterns were analyzed using the SPSS Clenmentine Data Mining System. An initialstatistical analysis was carried out to categorize the herbs according to their medicinal types and dosage, natures,flavors, channel tropism, and functions. Based on the categorization, the frequencies of occurrence were computed. Results: The main prescriptive features from the selected formulae of the mining data are: (1) warm or cold herbs in the Five Properties category; sweet or bitter herbs in the Five Flavors category and with affinity to the liver meridian are the most frequently prescribed in the 96 medicinal formulae; (2) herbs with tonifying and detoxicating, and blood-activating with stasis-resolvingfunctions that are interrelated and prescribed in combination with qi-tonifying herbs. Conclusions: The results indicate that there is a close relationship between recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer with liver dysfunctions. These prescriptions focus on the herbs for nourishing the yin-blood, and emolliating and regulating the liver which seems to be the key element in the treatment process. Meanwhile, the use of qi-tonifying and spleen-strengthening herbs also forms the basis of prescription patterns. * Correspondence: jpjpchen@yahoo.com 1School of Chinese Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR Full list of author information is available at the end of the articleHeet al .Journal of Translational Medicine 2012, 10(Suppl 1):S12 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/10/S1/S12 \u00a9 2012 He et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Every year, among the 1.2 million women diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, 500 thousand cases die of the disease.Along with a sharp increase in life expectancy, expansionof urbanization and adaptation of western lifestyle, theincrease in incidence rates is even more obvious in devel-oping countries [2-5]. In China, the number of casesincreased by 38.5% from 2000 to 2005. Compared with theearly surveys in the 1990s, breast cancer accounted for the largest increase in mortality rates in 2005 [6]. Today, the standard therapies for breast cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormonal therapy. However, even though patients receive systemictreatment, there is still 10% to 30% chance of recurrenceand metastasis. Among the patients with local recurrence,75% to 93% will eventually develop distant metastasis 5-year survival rate [7,8]. Visceral metas- tasis is the main reason for treatment failure and cause of death. Lung, bone, liver and brain are the most commonsites of distant spread of breast cancer [9,10]. Since metas-tasis is the main reason for cancer treatment failure, man-agement of metastasis is the key factor for determining theprognosis of the patients [11]. Recently, the use of natural Chinese herbal medicine with anti-tumor effects is receiving more and more atten- tion from the public [12]. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the treatment and pre vention of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis is a holistic approach throughmulti-level, multi-target and multi-channel control. CTMdiffers from Western medicine, which adopts ways toblock a single transfer in a particular process. In compari-son, Chinese medicine adopts an overall therapeuticapproach to treat and prevent recurrence and metastasis, to improve the immune system of patients, and to strengthen the body 's susceptibility to diseases. Mean- while, Chinese medicine also aims at reducing the sideeffects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, reversing drugresistance and improving quality of life and survival forpatients. Therefore, these unique advantages have gradu-ally made the Chinese medicinal approach in combatingbreast cancer recurrence and metastasis the research focus of both the local and overseas scholars [13,14]. In Chinese medicinal therapy, experienced Chinese medical practitioners presc ribe a medicinal formula \u2014a combination of various single herbs \u2014for the treatment of ailments. According to TCM theories, pharmacological and pharmacodynamic relatio nship exists among herbs, which is deemed as Chinese medicinal compatibility. Thecompatibility of Chinese her bal medicine has particular rules and patterns. In Chinese medicinal database, there are over ten thousand medicinal formulae which enclosecomplicated information. However, a well-established and orderly system for organizing the information of Chinesemedicinal formulae does not exist. This implies that alarge amount of implicit prescription patterns behind theformulae have not been fully disclosed [15,16]. Association rules mining is one of the methods for discovering meaningful associations or correlationsbetween variables in large databases. It identifies fre-quent item sets from the data sets, and then uses thesefrequent item sets to form their association rules. Toselect meaningful rules from the set of all possible rules,minimum thresholds on support and confidence are thetwo important constraints. An association rule has theform LHSRHS,w h e r e LHS andRHS are sets of items, and the RHS set is likely to occur whenever the LHS setoccurs. One of the applications of association rulesmining is to mine association rules in medical recorddata [17,18]. Since association rules mining is a popularand well-researched method, it can be used to investi-gate the Chinese herbal medicine compatibility patterns,and to reflect the interdependence and relationshipbetween the variables. Therefore, it can provide scienti- fic evidence for clinical applications of Chinese medi- cine, and thereby offer an implication for the integrationof Chinese medicinal therapy with modern Westernmedical therapies to better t reatment or prevention of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis [19]. The sup-port supp(X) of an item set X is defined as the propor-tion of transactions in the data set containing the itemset. It is a function used for evaluation of the potential usefulness of the rules. The confidence of a rule is defined as conf(X => Y), which can be interpreted as anestimate of the probability P (Y|X) [20]. Methods Sources of literature This study was based on Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China[21] recorded to investigate the prescrip- tion patterns of using Chinese medicine for treatment and prevention of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. Thesources of literature included the Chinese Journal Net andthe China Master Dissertations Full-text Database (1990 - 2010) (Table 1). The name of each herb was used as a key-word to obtain the relevant literature, and only the litera-ture which focused on \"breast cancer \",\"advanced stage of breast cancer \"and/or \"post-operation of breast cancer \"was eligible for inclusion. According to the following inclusionand exclusion criteria, a total of 131 papers describing var-ious medicinal formulae for clinical applications were included (96 medicinal formulae with a total of 180 Chineseherbal medicines (herbs); the total cumulative occurrencesof 180 herbs appearing in 96 formulae were 1001 times).The terminologies used in this article refer to 'WHO Inter- national Standard Terminologies on Traditional MedicineHeet al .Journal of Translational Medicine 2012, 10(Suppl 1):S12 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/10/S1/S12Page 2 of 8in the Western Pacific Region ', which has documented the common technical terms used in traditional medicine. Inclusion criteria There were five types of literature included, including literature: (1) related to cli nical research on using Chi- nese medicine for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis; (2) related to clinical research on using Chinese medicine for thetreatment of advanced stage breast cancer; (3) related toclinical research on using Chinese medicine for the pre-vention of postoperative breast cancer recurrence andmetastasis (especially at stage III or later when metasta-sis had occurred); (4) with randomized controlled trialsas the study design; and (5) where the clinical study aims to prove the efficacy of experimental group with Chinese medicinal treatment over control group. Exclusion criteria Literature with the following criteria were excluded: (1)small-sample-sized studies with less than 20 cases; (2)studies which primarily aimed to treat complications ofoperations or to reduce the side effects of chemother- apy; (3) studies without inv estigation into the use of Chinese medicine for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis; (4) studieswhich provided only the names of formulae but withoutdescriptions of herbal ingredients; (5) duplicate publica-tions reporting the same group of participants; and (6)literature in which the clinical trial received a Jadadscore of less than 2. Statistical analysis Association rules mining is a popular and well-researched method for discove ring interesting relations between variables in large databases [22]. We used thefollowing definition for item s ets and association rules.An association rule has the form LHS RHS, where LHS and RHS are sets of items and the RHS set is likely tooccur whenever the LHS set occurs [23]. Two parameters (support factor and confidence factors) were essential in association rules mining. With regard tosupport and confidence in discovering the associationrules, the user shall set the minimum support (min-sup) and the minimum confidence (min-conf) as critical values providing the baselines for discovery. Only the combina-tions that satisfy the minimum thresholds on support andconfidence were considered to mine meaningful rules. Theselection of thresholds (support and confidence) wasalways an issue. If the minimum confidence is set toohigh, a lot of useful data will be missed. To find an effec-tive drug compatibility mode, we discovered central ten- d e n c yo fa s s o c i a t i o nr u l e st ob em o r eo b v i o u sa tt h e support of 0.1 and confidence of 0.6 in the two correlationanalysis of these herbs (used pairs of couplet herbs) andthe pairs of herbal functions. So the minimum support of0.1 and the minimum confidence of 0.6 were specified inthis study. Based on Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China, the ingredients of Chinese medicine were listed according to the selected medicinal formulae and were organized to establish a database. The computing soft-ware Microsoft ACCESS was used as a storage tool, andthen the SPSS Clenmentine Data Mining System wasused as a platform to analyze the frequency and the asso-ciation rules of the prescription patterns. An initial statis-tical analysis of the database was carried out tocategorize the herbs according to their medicinal types and dosage, natures, flavors, channel tropism, and func- tions. The frequencies of occurrence and use were thencomputed based on the categorization. In additiontheassociations between different functions of Chinese herbsfrom the formulae were also examined using the associa-tion rules mining.Table 1 Data source of the literature (1990-2010) Database Source Keyword(s) Number of literature Chinese Journal Net DatabaseThe herbs recorded in Chinese Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China (2005 Edition) Volume I\"breast cancer \"and/or \"advanced stage \"and/or \"post- operation \"\"clinical research treatment of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis \"and be eligible for selection criteria121 China Master Dissertations Full- text DatabaseThe herbs recorded in Chinese Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China (2005 Edition) Volume I\"breast cancer \"and/or \"advanced stage \"and/or \"post- operation \"\"clinical research treatment of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis \"and be eligible for selection criteria8 China PhD Dissertations Full- text DatabaseThe herbs recorded in Chinese Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia of the People 's Republic of China (2005 Edition) Volume I\"breast cancer \"and/or \"advanced stage \"and/or \"post- operation \"\"clinical research treatment of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis \"and be eligible for selection criteria2 Among the 131 papers searched from the databases, 96 medicinal formulae were included in the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria * According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 131 papers which described various Chinese medicinal formulae for clinical applications were included 96 medicinal formulae with a total of 180 herbs. Total cumulative occurrences of 180 herbs appearing in 96 formulae is 1001 times.Heet al .Journal of Translational Medicine 2012, 10(Suppl 1):S12 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/10/S1/S12Page 3 of 8Results Associations between Five Properties and Five Flavors from 180 herbs prescribed in 96 formulae The 180 herbs were categorized according to the Five Properties and Five Flavors (Table 2 & Table 3). Based on the Five properties and Five flavors theory ofTCM, herbs with a warm (67 herbs, 37.22%) or cold(60 herbs, 33.33%) nature were most frequently pre-scribed in terms of the occurrence frequency, whileherbs with a warm (appeared 90 times, 93.75%), cold(appeared 71 times, 73.96%) and neutral (appeared 82times, 85.42%) nature were the top three prescribed herbs in terms of the frequency of use. According to the Five Flavors (Table 3), herbs that were sweet (94herbs, appeared 93 times, 96.88%) or bitter (87 herbs,appeared 86 times, 89.58%) were the top two pre-scribed herbs in terms of both the frequencies ofoccurrence and use. Association between Channel tropism theory from 180 herbs prescribed in 96 formulae The results of the association analysis based on channel tropism theory among 180 herbs (Table 4) showed thatthe top two most frequently prescribed herbs have highaffinity to the liver and spleen. The herbs that have highaffinity to the liver channel were used most frequently(frequency of use = 44.79%). Frequency distribution of a single herb prescribed in Chinese medicinal formulae There are 96 medicinal formulae with a total of 180 herbs included in this stu dy. The total cumulative occurrence of 180 herbs appearing in 96 formulae was1001 times. The following 13 herbs were frequently pre-scribed (over 20 times): aPrincipal function in qi-tonifying, including : Huang Qi Zhu (Rhizoma function Fu Ling (Sclerotium Poriae Cocos),Yi Yi Ren (Semen Coicis),cPrincipal function in heat-clearing detoxicating, including : Shan Ci function (Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae) (Table 5). Frequency distribution of categorized herbs according to their functions Herbs with tonifying and replenishing and detoxicat-ing functions appeared to be most frequently prescribedfor the treatment and prevention of breast cancer recur-rence and metastasis (Table 6). The top three functions included herbs with qi-tonifying, heat clearing and detoxicating, and blooad-activiating and stasis-resolvingfunctions. Associations between pairs of herbs functions from the formulae Association rules mining was applied to investigate the associations between pairs of herb functions from the formulae, and to examine the Chinese medicinal com- patibility patterns (Tabl e 7). The minimum support of 0.1 and the minimum confidence of 0.6 were specified. The top three pairs of herbal functions with the high- e s tc o n f i d e n c ei n c l u d e dt h eb l o o d - t o n i f y i n gp a i r e dw i t hqi-tonifying functions (93.18%), the qi-regulating yin-tonify-ing paired with qi-tonifying functions (92.50%). Associations between pairs of couplet herbs from the formulae Couplet herbs are two herbs used in pair to increase the therapeutic effect or reduce the toxic effect.

The top three pairs of couplet herbswith the highest confidence included the Tai Zi Shenpaired with Bai Zhu (86.36%), the Bai Zhu paired with Huang Qi (84.44%), and the Bai Zhu paired with Fu ling (77.78%). Discussion From the herbal perspective, breast cancer is the localmanifestation of a whole-body disease, referred to as anintrinsically deficient but extrinsically excessive syn- drome. Based on TCM theories, deficiency of spleen qi, inadequate source of engendering transformation, defi- ciency of qi and blood, and excess of phlegm-dampnessare believed to be the main mechanism responsible fordevelopment of breast cancer [24,25]. Medicinal formulae often include herbs that are sweet or bitter The 180 herbs were classified according to the Five Fla- vors, and herbs that were sweet or bitter were the top two most frequently prescribed herbs in the formulae. InTCM theories, herbs that taste sweet can be used forsupplementation, moderation and harmonization,referred to as tonifying and replenishing herbs. Herbsthat taste bitter can be used for discharging and down-bearing, referred to as heat-clearing and detoxicatingherbs. However, sweet tasting herbs with spleen- strengthening functions were prescribed and used more frequently than herbs with a bitter taste for clearing heat. There is a close relationship between recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer and liver, and herbs fornourishing the yin-blood, emolliating and soothing theliver, and smoothing the meridians are the keys of breastcancer treatment Breast cancer is different from the other cancer types, as the onset of this disease usually peaks at menopausalTable 7 The pairs of herbal functions being used among the formulae Herb functions (LHS, X) Number of formulaeHerb Table 8 The commonly used pairs of couplet herbs in the formulae Herbs (LHS, X) Number of formulae Herb (RHS, Y) Number of formulae Support (X) (%) Confidence (X => Y) (%) Tai Zi Shen 22 \u00ae Bai Zhu 19 19.79 86.36 Bai Zhu 45 \u00ae Huang Qi 38 39.58 84.44 Bai Zhu 45 \u00ae Fu Ling 35 36.46 77.78 Bai Hua She She Cao 25 \u00ae Fu Ling 19 19.79 76.00 Bai Hua She She Cao 25 \u00ae Yi Yi Ren 17 17.71 68.00 Yi Yi Ren 25 \u00ae Fu Ling 17 17.71 68.00 E Zhu 20 \u00ae Shan Ci Gu 12 12.50 60.00Heet al .Journal of Translational Medicine 2012, 10(Suppl 1):S12 http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/10/S1/S12Page 6 of 8[26]. The pathological characteristic of this period is marked by exhaustion of heavenly tenth. During thisperiod, the body suffers from yin-blood deficiency, and liver-kidney depletion. Li ver is the organ for storing blood. Liver functions in free coursing, and its functionsare based on sufficiency of yin-blood. In other words, the free coursing relies on the sufficiency of yin-blood stored in the liver. Therefore, not only herbs for sooth-ing the liver and regulating qi are needed, but also theherbs for emolliating the liver blood are essential for thetreatment and prevention of breast cancer recurrenceand metastasis. From the asso ciation rule mining, the herbs, such as Shao Yao, Wu Wei Zi, Ji Xue Teng,Sheng Shu Di, Gou Qi Zi, Nu Zhen Zi, and Dang Gui, are used directly for blood-tonifying and liver-emolliat- ing in treatment of breast cancer. In general, herbs fornourishing the yin-blood, emolliating the liver, soothingthe liver and smoothing the meridians play a key role inbreast cancer treatment. Ample clinical research of Chinese formulae reinforces the spleen to regulate qi and soothe the liver to alleviatep a i n .T h u s ,t h e yd on o to n l yr e s i s tt u m o ra n d strengthen the body, but also have anti-cancer effects on metastatic breast cancer [27,28]. The use of herbs for reinforcement of healthy qi and elimination of pathogenic factors is a common Chinesemedicinal combination From the TCM perspective, the etiology of breast cancer is due to deficiency of the healthy qi, which is related to spleen qi deficiency, and liver-kidney depletion. This deficiency will result in malfunctioning of spleen, liverand kidney for transportation and transformation, andfree coursing. Without the proper functioning, stagna-tion and obstruction of the breast collaterals will ulti-mately be developed and transformed into breast cancer[29]. The use of qi-tonifying and spleen-fortifying herbs is the basis of prescription patterns for preventing breastcancer recurrence and metastasis Restoration of healthy qi is an effective way to treat dis- eases and to prevent further progression. The use of qi-tonifying and spleen-fortifying herbs is to replenish thesource of engendering transformation for and blood,and to qi-tonifying, blood-replenishing and har- mony of the five visceral functions. This is particularly essential for nourishing the liver and smoothing the qimovement. At the same time, spleen-strengthening andqi-replenishing herbs also have the functions for resol-ving dampness and dispelli n gp h l e g m .T h e r e f o r e ,t h e formulae prescribed herbs such as Huang Qi, Bai Zhu,and Fu Ling, among others.. From the association rulesmining, the results showed that the combination of theherbs should also focus on the functions for qi-tonifying.The use of couplet herbs involving Huang Qi and BaiZhu is to achieve the effects of spleen-strengthening andqi-replenishing, and dampness-drying and water-drain-ing; the use of couplet herbs involving Bai Zhu and TaiZi Shen is to achieve the effects of fluid-engendering and lung-moistening; the use of couplet herbs involving Bai Zhu and Fu Ling is to achieve the effects of damp-ness-resolving. The effectiv eness of these tonifying and replenishing herbs on tum or resistance and immunity enhancement has also been proven by clinical studies[30,31]. Conclusions The results showed that recurrence and metastasis ofbreast cancer is considered to have a close relationshipwith liver dysfunctions. These prescriptions focus on theherbs for nourishing the yin-blood, and emolliating andregulating the liver. Stren gthening of liver function seems to be the key to successful treatment. Meanwhile,the use of qi-tonifying and spleen-strengthening herbsalso forms the basis of prescription patterns. It is also noteworthy that liver function is promoted by strength- ening the spleen.
