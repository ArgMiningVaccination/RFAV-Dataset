Steve Fuller Responds to Norman Levitt's Review of Science v. Religion I confess that I am not entirely convinced that Norman Levitt has read Science v. Religion? What passes as a review of the book consists of a smattering of his own preoccupations that make passing contact with things I say, sandwiched between boilerplate versions of his now trademark fulminations. At no point does he state, let alone answer, the fundamental thesis of the book, namely, the centrality of intelligent design in motivating the scientific enterprise, in terms of which Darwin's theory of evolution is a historical aberration. (That much should be apparent from the book's subtitle: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution.) The book is not meant as a detailed defense of the versions of ID put forward by Dembski and Behe, but rather an attempt to show that there is much more to their ideas and instincts than the intellectually claustrophobic discussion to date would suggest. Consider his treatment of what I say about complexity, which indeed figures in a title of a chapter in my book, though at most five pages are of direct relevance to Levitt's concerns. First, I claim that it is impossible to design a true random number generator because it is ultimately possible to infer the algorithm. Levitt responds that in practice it's easy to design algorithms that generate data that people cannot determine if they are random. He then goes on to observe that the chance-based character of evolutionary processes can be mimicked on computers, with random elements simulated by introducing outcomes of unrelated processes. I know all this, and nothing in my discussion denies or displays ignorance of it. At most, I may be guilty of imprecise expression, for which I duly apologize. Where Levitt and I genuinely disagree is on the implications of all this for ID. As far as I can tell, all that Levitt demonstrates is how well intelligent design (in this case, by humans) can generate processes that do not seem to be intelligently designed. His examples only cut against versions of ID that involve a completely preprogrammed conception of design with no prospect for fundamental change once the program is run. This may have been Paley's version of ID. I am not sure who upholds it now, though I certainly don't. That the universe is intelligently designed need not imply that God micromanages it from moment to moment. The relevance of this point \u2014 the most substantial one in Levitt's entire review \u2014 to my overall thesis is that the very idea that we might successfully simulate significant aspects of how the universe works presupposes our ability to adopt the standpoint of someone who could have created the universe, the great cosmic programmer. This presupposition is far from self-evident. It historically depended on humans believing they were created in the image and likeness of God. Of course, this does not prove God's existence. But those who took the idea into science, including the original theorist of the computer, Charles Babbage, and his great Cambridge predecessor Isaac Newton, saw it very much as a vindication of ID. The challenge faced by those who would minimize the assumption of ID in nature is whether the scientific enterprise can be motivated solely by its sheer empirical success. Levitt says nothing about this. However, Levitt claims to say something about Newton \u2014 what exactly is unclear. On two points we are in agreement: Newton was a Biblical literalist who thought he could get into God's mind, and his theism contributed to inserting God into physics where it was not necessary. But Levitt also appears to think the latter counts against the former. If this passes for an argument against methodological supernaturalism, then Darwin's botched understanding of heredity should count against methodological naturalism (which Levitt misnames \"materialism\"). In both cases, a metaphysical commitment that served a scientist well for much of his research came up short when overstretched. This is only to be expected, given what William Whewell originally called the \"heuristic\" function of metaphysics as providing broad but fallible access to a domain under scientific investigation. There is nothing especially damning about Newton's failure to recognize his own fallibility. It happens all the time, which is why science only works as a collective enterprise. Levitt also mistakenly thinks that I am trying to mask what he calls Newton's \"dogmatism\" (a curious word given the semi-secrecy of Newton's religious views) by casting him as a Unitarian. Had Levitt read my book a bit more carefully, he would have noticed that the relevant feature of Newton's Unitarianism that motivated subsequent generations of scientists \u2014 I pay special attention to Joseph Priestley \u2014 is what is sometimes called \"perfectibilism\", the Christian heresy that humans through their own will and intellect might become God. This is the radical implication of deus absconditus that Levitt misses. In the 20th century, this orientation animated such pioneers of artificial intelligence as Warren Weaver, Norbert Wiener, and Herbert Simon. I count these people as ID theorists just as much as Dembski and Behe. Turning to evolution itself, Levitt claims I take the Neo-Darwinian synthesis to be \"delusional\" because I describe it as a rhetorical achievement. This simply shows that Levitt holds rhetoric in much lower esteem than I do. (A better word than \"delusional\" would be \"contingent\".) He also presumes falsely that rhetoric is to be contrasted with the hard graft of science, on the basis of which he then suggests that I deny the latter to evolutionists. No, I simply deny that there is a principled difference between rhetoric and science. They go hand in glove. It is here that I am perhaps most \"postmodern\". In Levitt's words, if I am \"hard-pressed to hide [my] scorn for actual scientists\", then that is because I have no scorn to hide. Levitt is the one who finds the rhetorical character of science unbearable \u2014 so much so that he quotes me on p. 123 as saying the exact opposite of what I wrote. As for my alleged failure to provide a \"serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself\", I despair that Levitt missed the point of my discussion, which is not to show that the Neo-Darwinian synthesis is empirically fraudulent or logically incoherent \u2014 in which case his charge would have some merit \u2014 but rather to show that the constitutive fields of biology can, and for the most part do, conduct their research activities without having to take a principled stance on evolution vs. ID. Other than denigrate the significance of the Nobel Prize (which I offered in support of this claim), Levitt says nothing of relevance here. Let me end by addressing Levitt's boilerplate remarks about the politics of all this. First, whether or not my views are correct, I fail to see how they count as \"antiscience\", unless one simply identifies \"science\" with orthodox scientific opinion. In fact, Levitt does this in his review but that, to my mind, is a step too far in the direction of relativism, if not authoritarianism. This raises the larger issue of how someone like Levitt \u2014 and he is far from alone \u2014 squares a commitment to liberalism, if not leftism, and relentless campaigns of vilification and demonization of those who would challenge the status quo in science. In my own case, Levitt's allegations about hidden right-wing theocratic alliances are, to borrow one of his favorite words, \"delusional\". As any student of the history of science knows, challenges to the status quo often originate in strange, sometimes even unsavory, quarters. After all, Darwin's own theory was kept afloat for its first half-century largely by an unholy alliance of capitalists, eugenicists, free-floating racists, and wishful theologians. The trick is for the challenger to expand from its initial base and secure the support of the broader scientific community. Darwin's theory has certainly done that; ID has not. My book was written to show that there are good historical reasons for believing that ID's scientific constituency could well extend beyond the offices of the Discovery Institute. Why Levitt should fear this prospect to such an extent that it compromises his critical judgment remains a mystery to me.

Announcing Michael's latest book The Mind of the Market How did we evolve from ancient hunter-gatherers to modern consumer-traders? Why are people so emotional and irrational when it comes to money and business decisions? Bestselling author Michael Shermer believes that evolution and evolutionary psychology provides an answer to both of these questions through the new science of evolutionary economics. Drawing on research from neuroeconomics, Shermer explores what brain scans reveal about bargaining, snap purchases, and how trust is established in business. Utilizing experiments in behavioral economics, Shermer shows why people hang on to losing stocks and failing companies, why business negotiations often disintegrate into emotional tit-for-tat disputes, and why money does not make us happy. Employing research from complexity theory, Shermer shows how evolution and economics are both examples of a larger and still somewhat mysterious phenomenon of emergence, where one plus one equals three. Along the way, Shermer answers such provocative questions as, Do our tribal roots mean that we will always be a sucker for brands? How is the biochemical joy of sex similar to the rewards of business cooperation? How can nations increase trust within their borders? Finally, Shermer considers the consequences of globalization and what will happen if nations allow free trade across their borders. Throughout this entertaining and surprising book Shermer considers the morality of markets in a discussion of what he calls virtue economics. Although we are selfish and altruistic, cooperative and competitive, peaceful and bellicose, in the main the balance is heavily on the side of good over evil. For every random act of violence that makes the evening news, there are 10,000 nonrandom acts of kindness that go unrecorded every day. Markets are moral and modern economies are founded on our virtuous nature. The Enron model of business is the exception and the Google motto of \"Don't Be Evil\" is the rule. The Mind of the Market will change the way we think about the economics of everyday life. Get it autographed! Michael is happy to personally autograph your copy of the book.

There are those who suggest that moral must be something about the power of love, but I suggest the moral is this: \"Never, ever go to Skull Island.\" Skull Island, the setting for the second act of King Kong, is an utterly nightmarish place. A steaming jungle packed with prehistoric beasts and crawling with unlikely monsters, it is a place where even the insects can drag you away for dinner. It's not surprising that this exotic, terrifying place awed Depression-era movie audiences. When Kong opened in 1933, no one had ever seen anything like it. The revolutionary special effects, the scope of imagination, the depth of immersion in another world \u2014 all these created a blockbuster experience that still echoes in the popular imagination today. My story begins on another, sleepier island last of 2007), Dr. Norman Levitt reviews Steve Fuller's book entitled [Science vs. Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745641229?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0745641229) (Polity Press, 2007, ISBN 0745641229). Dr. Norman Levitt is a professor of mathematics at Rutgers, New Brunswick, where his salary is a modest fraction of what the football coach is paid. He writes frequently for Skeptic and other publications on the relation of science to culture and politics. He is the author of Prometheus Bedeviled and Higher Superstition (the latter joint work with Paul R. Gross) and he is one of the editors of The Flight from Science and Reason. The Painful Elaboration of the Fatuous Norman Levitt Deconstructs Steve Fuller's Postmodernist Critique of Evolution book review by Dr. Norman Levitt The Intelligent Design movement begets intellectual monstrosities with doleful regularity, but Steve Fuller's new book, I think, occupies an especially odd place in this teratology. Fuller, be it remembered, is a professor of sociology of science at the University of Warwick (UK), whose career has been built on a lofty and careless disdain for science itself. That trajectory reached its apex (or, depending on how you look at it, its nadir) when he appeared as an \"expert\" witness for the defense (i.e., the crypto-creationists of the Dover, PA school board) in the celebrated \"Kitzmiller\" case. As we know, the upshot of this litigation was that a conservative and conventionally religious federal judge rendered a ruling that not only came down squarely against the pro-ID school board, but savagely excoriated the ID movement per se as without legitimate standing in science or science education. Fuller's testimony only helped to seal the school board's well-merited doom. The book under review is Fuller's subsequent effort to justify philosophically the position that failed so miserably to sway the Kitzmiller ruling in ID's favor. It is with frank satisfaction and not a little glee that I can report that it is a truly miserable piece of work, crammed with errors scientific, historical, and even theological, a book that will find approving readers only amongst hard-core ID enthusiasts hungry for agreement but indifferent to the quality of evidence offered in support of their position. Fuller really does make it up as he goes along, laying out arguments that hardly need serious thought to refute in that they are based on howlers and solecisms that collapse under the lightest scrutiny. In this review I also want to consider the defection of Fuller (who all his life has proclaimed himself a progressive and \"leftist\") to a cause demonstrably reactionary in all respects. Does this presage a wider convulsion in the academic left that will see a proliferation of equally peculiar misalliances? Academics are often very faddish creatures more terrified by the prospect of missing a bandwagon than by possible shortcomings in their own arguments. Has Fuller identified a true bandwagon with uncanny prescience or merely hopped on board a broke-down old manure wagon? Abusing Ideas: Randomness, Complexity & All That First, to the evaluation of Science vs. Religion itself. Merely out of mathematical whimsy, I want to consider Fuller's very extensive discussion of \"complexity\" and \"randomness.\" This, as mathematicians and computer scientists are well aware, is a subject that has been thoroughly studied and analyzed for decades, generating a slew of deep results and fertile conjectures. Fuller, however, shows no awareness of the actual mathematical literature (even though much of it is accessible, at the basic level, to anyone with minimal mathematical skill). Instead, he seems content to take ID-theorist William Dembski as his guide. He attributes to Dembski a maxim to the effect that it is \"impossible\" to design a true random-number generator because it is ultimately possible to \"infer\" the algorithm that lies behind it (p. 61). But this grossly misunderstands a basic principle of complexity theory, the insight that in general it is not possible to devise an effective method for distinguishing a random from a non-random stream of data. Indeed, it is easily possible for virtually anyone to devise a simple way of generating such a data stream (making it highly \"compressible\" or non-random), which will, for all practical purposes, defeat any human attempt to say whether it is or isn't random or how \"compressible\" it really is. For instance, just by way of mathematical doodling, let sn be defined as the integer between 0 and 9 that is specified by the formula: sn = [(pnth digit of the decimal expansion of sin(17/31) ) - 4] mod 10 where pn is the nth prime number. (Please note that this formula has no mathematical importance; it's purely off the top of my head.) It is very easy for anyone knowing a bit of first-year calculus plus a bit of computer programming to write a program to generate this sequence using a couple of dozen lines of code, at most. However, if I hand you, say, the first 3,000,000,000 terms of this sequence without giving you the generator as a program or purely in words, it will be impossible, for all practical purposes, for you to tell me whether this is a \"random\" sequence or a \"compressible\" one (it is, in fact, highly compressible), and still less possible for you to specify a generating algorithm. Such phenomena are not mere computer-laboratory curiosities. In celestial mechanics, for instance, a deterministic classical process may generate a string of parameters that is indistinguishable from random despite its deterministic genesis. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of \"chaos theory.\" But in the context of I.D. \"theory,\" the effect is to refute the na\u00efve notion that design by an intelligent agent is always discernible. Fuller, despite devoting a full chapter to \"complexity\" and expatiating therein on chaos theory as well, shows virtually no sign of any real familiarity with this mathematics. His exposition jumps from one topic to another, from one thinker to another, mathematical or otherwise, without any demonstration that they should be linked other than by some vague connection to \"complexity\" in some sense or another. This deliberately discards the precision and rigor that the introduction of mathematical discourse is meant to ensure in the first place. The whole point of this chapter, one gathers, is that the emphasis on \"complexity\" by Dembski and Co. underwrites, to Fuller's way of thinking, the legitimate scientific status of ID theory. To give just one example of the fatuity to which this leads, Fuller swallows whole the idea that computer simulation of \"lifelike\" complexity requires that the \"design\" of that phenomenon must already be embedded in the \"intelligent design\" of the hardware and software involved. This goes wildly astray, as mathematicians incomparably superior to Dembski (John Conway, inventor of the Game of Life, for instance) will gladly testify. The point of such models is that they emulate the posited key features of the standard evolutionary model, that is, the action of a simple selective process on randomly-generated variation. It has to be noted that the variation involved may indeed be as random as seems possible in the universe; it need not be created by a pseudo-random number generator built into the program, but can be taken from unconnected external phenomena, e.g., radioactive decay or the total take at a Las Vegas casino. What emerges in the end from this completely un-designed input is \"complexity\" that mirrors that of organic processes. The \"intelligent design\" involved merely involves mimicking the mindless mechanism postulated by Darwinian theory, not creating novelty in that aspect of things. This constitutes an in silico test of the fundamental Darwinian thesis. These computer experiments have enormously strengthened the hypotheses that in nature what we think of as organic complexity arises from an algorithmic mechanism simple to describe historically iterated time and again as it acts upon random variation. It is almost superfluous to add that Fuller has done little to come to terms with Dembski's most trenchant critics, actual experts in complexity and information theory, such as Mark Perakh and Jeffrey Shallit, the latter of whom has justifiably damned Dembski's work as \"pseudo-mathematics.\" Nor has Fuller been very accurate in describing Dembski's intended program, which is to demonstrate \"mathematically\" that the evolution of complex life via natural selection is literally impossible. But to acquaint himself with this now-voluminous literature would violate one of his favorite axioms, viz., that a \"social epistemologist\" needn't actually understand science in order to belittle it. Evolutionists as an Old Boys Club A similar farce plays out when Fuller tries to address the larger question of the supposedly contentious nature of evolutionary theory within the scientific community itself. In the World According to Fuller, evolutionary theory never really got past the stage of being a \"well evidenced ideology\" rather than a \"properly testable science\" (p. 123). What he is saying, in effect, is that the claims from all branches of biology and related science that they have contributed to a vast stream of convergent evidence verifying the essential precepts of evolution are in great measure delusional. He seems to think that biology, as a constellation of disciplines, is some kind of socially-constructed freemasonry in which assent to basic Darwinian principles constitutes a ritual formula necessary to make one part of the brotherhood rather than a cognitively-justified inference from hard evidence. More, he seems to think that evolutionary thought is mere ideological window-dressing, contributing nothing to the \"hard science\" behind molecular biology and the like. None of this is backed up by serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself. Fuller complacently views the ascendancy of evolutionary thought as a \"rhetorical\" rather than a \"scientific\" development. His principal evidence? The paucity of Nobel Prizes awarded for work on evolution! Of course, he never pauses to consider that under the idiosyncratic organization of the Nobel awards, there is no prize for biology as such. Biologists are smuggled in under the \"Medicine and Physiology\" category, which is just expansive enough to accommodate ethologists like Lorenz or Tinbergen, but not hard-core evolutionary theorists. In all of these pronouncements, Fuller is hard-pressed to hide his scorn for actual scientists who, it is obvious to him, know much less about what they think and how and why than a social theorist like himself who is enormously content to cite his own work endlessly. Newton, Biblical Literalism & the Misuse of Terminology Curiously, Fuller is even more careless and dogmatic when dealing with historical and religious matters than when talking about science. For instance, he blithely associates Newton's secretive Anti-Trinitarianism with the Unitarian doctrine that began to gain popularity late in the Enlightenment, the idea being, I suppose, that Newton's religiosity is really consonant with a tolerant and latitudinarian attitude toward doctrinal matters. But this flies in the face of the fact that Newton was a grim dogmatist in his religious beliefs, whose only link to \"Unitarians\" in the modern sense is that both deny the full divinity of Jesus of Nazareth. Newton, however, came to his views out of a strict biblical literalism deriving from the Puritan tradition that had driven England to civil war. From his point of view, the lack of direct biblical authority for the notion that Christ is an aspect of the deity condemned that dogma as a corrupt accretion inimical to true religion. Modern Unitarianism, on the other hand, arose from a skeptical attitude toward the literal truth of the Bible and severe doubts about supernaturalism and miracles in general. Newton would have been horrified by it. This topic may seem to be a mere diversion in any serious discussion of the proper ground-rules of scientific practice, but Fuller makes Newton into a totemic figure for his own rhetorical position. Fuller's major contention is that seeking to know the Mind of God, in a rather literal sense, trying to discern the root intelligence behind the accessible phenomenology of the universe, is just as good a way of doing valid science as \"methodological materialism.\" In this respect, Newton, whose religious motivations are beyond question, is the paragon to contrast with the metaphysical materialist Darwin (and, presumably, the vast majority of productive scientists who have lived and worked since Darwin's day). However, one may freely concede that strong, conventional religious feeling can motivate an individual to do the hard work of science without yielding an inch to the quite different premise that the supposed insights of religion may rightfully dictate the manifest content of scientific work. The latter principle infuses Intelligent Design Theory, as practiced by Dembski, Behe, Wells and the gang clustered around the Discovery Institute under the tutelage of Phillip Johnson. And, conveniently, Newton himself provides a telling example of the intellectual quicksand into which it can lead. Theistic Eschatology and Bad Physics: Newton's Greatest Blunder Newton's religious streak led him to take an intense interest in eschatology, that is, the final purpose and fate of the created universe. He devoted as much time to investigations into the divine timetable for the End of Days \u2014 the prophesied arrival of the Day of Judgment \u2014 as he did to his research in mathematics and physics. But he did so in a traditional manner, that is to say, relying on information supposedly encoded in the Bible, rather than on any novel cosmological insights arising from the revolution he himself had wrought in celestial mechanics. In this sense, at least, we have evidence of the enormous waste of scientific talent and intellectual energy that can be caused by an obsessive concern with religion. Yet Newton's religion at one point led him into an even more paradigmatic scientific solecism, one that perfectly illustrates the peril of allowing the content of one's scientific work to be dictated by one's religious fervor. Newton, no less than his frankly materialist or Deist successors, was well aware that the cosmological picture flowing from his own achievement left little room for an interventionist God \u2014 an activist, miracle-working being whose constant attention is necessary to the steady functioning of the universe. He sensed that his own brilliant ideas constituted an argument for the deus absconditus, a conceptual innovation that was soon to become a standard item of skeptical Enlightenment thought. But Newton's religious traditionalism, unconventional as it was in some respects, found this notion abhorrent because the impersonal God it cautiously endorsed was a far cry from the Biblical Ancient of Days embedded in his own theology. This led him to argue that his own system of the world must be incomplete and that it must indeed be modified to allow a role for an interventionist God whose intermittent action is necessary to keep planets and comets in their orbits. The key point is that this line of thought did not follow from the mathematics of Newton's mechanics, nor from any sound new physical insight. It was dictated, rather, by the psychological necessity of reconciling his scientific achievement with his pre-existing religious dogma. It was not only an uncharacteristically unsound idea, but constitutes Newton's greatest intellectual blunder. One would think that Fuller would at least try to come to terms with this curious history, given that he offers Newton as the paragon of scientific \"design theorists\". But he never seems to have heard of it, assuming he is not simply burying it as grossly discomfiting to his line of argument. In any event, given that Newton is the stick with which Fuller intends to beat Darwin, his lack of real knowledge of serious Newtoniana is emblematic of the shallowness of his book. Ignoring the Politically Obvious That obliviousness is even more evident in Fuller's utter failure to come to terms with the political nature of the Intelligent Design movement. He mentions the notorious \"wedge\" strategy once or twice, but only with an exculpatory purpose. As Fuller would have it, \"Just as the ACLU helped to drive a wedge between the teaching of science and theology, the Discovery Institute would now drive a wedge between the teaching of science and the anti-theology prejudice euphemistically called 'methodological naturalism.'\" Aside from the false symmetry of this characterization, this description simply will not wash. The \"wedge,\" as conceived by the hierophants of the Discovery Institute, means discrediting evolutionary theory as the initial step of a program to re-institute traditional religious precepts (fundamentalist Christian in particular) as the dominant code governing civil and legal affairs in this country. It is a patently reactionary political program, not a philosophical one. Naturally, this embarrassing fact is too much for someone who, like Fuller, thinks of himself as a left-populist, to admit directly. He tries to get himself off the hook by fulminating against the British National Party, a right-wing sect obsessed with maintaining ethnic and racial purity in the UK against immigrants and such, claiming that its repellent ideology is a direct corollary of Darwinian thought. This is more than a little silly if it is not actually disingenuous. I daresay that if I were given five bucks for every BNP recruit who was prompted to join that mob primarily by his enthusiasm for evolutionary theory, I couldn't even muster the price of a tank of gas. But this diversion serves Fuller as an excuse for ignoring the \"deep structure\" of, say, the Discovery Institute, whose board prominently includes the Christian Dominionist billionaire Howard Ahmanson, a prominent contributor to a legion of far right causes. Equally, it exonerates the very organization that called Fuller as a witness in the Kitzmiller Case, the Thomas More Legal Foundation, which provided pro bono counsel to the beleaguered Dover school board. This outfit, please recall, was founded and funded by pizza magnate Thomas Monaghan, an ultramontane right-wing Catholic who has also established the Ave Maria Law School, hoping to expand it to a full-fledged university dedicated to turning out neo-Crusaders by the thousand. Movement or Tantrum? Now I would like to consider the question of whether Fuller's ideological flight into the embrace of the theocratic right bespeaks a wider tendency within the postmodern academy to trade its vaunted left-radicalism for the honor of riding shotgun on behalf of the new breed of creationist theocrats. Certainly, Fuller is not the first \"science studies\" scholar to put forth a brief on behalf of creationism. A few other figures, some even more prominent than Fuller, have done so within the past decade. Still, they all seem to have pulled in their horns as soon as it became clear that creationism is not simply the cultural self-assertion of a repressed minority trying to defy the brute scientism of modern society, but rather the tool of a well-funded and deadly serious political movement able to call upon the near-majority instinctively sympathetic to creationist ideas. Fuller, so far as I know, is the only member of this academic clan to have unreservedly taken the plunge, irrevocably committing himself to the creationist cause. The wider lesson, if there be any, is that animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty. The compost that nurtured Steve Fuller and many of his associates in their development of \"social constructivist\" theory consisted principally of these doubts, resentments and antagonisms. This soil put forth a host of noxious weeds, quite varied, and sometimes taxonomically linked only by the common bitterness they exuded. Each in its own way \u2014 literary theory, cultural studies, cultural anthropology, women's studies, ethnic studies, and a long-standing Marxisant approach to sociology \u2014 joined the tacit alliance of antiscientific intellectuals whose imprecations grew all the louder even as their influence over the practice of science and public science policy shrank to imperceptibility. The anti-science of the contemporary academy is a late and petulant echo of Spiritualism, Anthroposophy, Theosophy, Forteanism, and a dozen other cults that once appealed to the culturally fashionable. But now they are bound up in the knotty and constipated jargon of journals and seminar rooms and lack the high spirits that made the original versions pleasantly whimsical. Anti-science in today's university whines and grumbles when it is not busy bedecking itself with the pseudo-virtue of today's eco-Puritanism: the Animal Rights Movement, fulminant opposition to genetic engineering, Deep Ecology, and so forth. It is easy to mock this development and hard not to scorn it. But perhaps a little sympathy is in order, providing it stops well short of indulgence. Basically, one is dealing here with a community of people who, by common standards, are quite intelligent and imaginative, and certainly diligent enough to carve out large areas of discourse for themselves wherein their assumptions and modes of analysis remain in the saddle for decades at a time. This is not a trivial achievement, think what we may of the fundamental soundness of the enterprise. We can't really speak of a Ship of Fools here, but rather a flotilla of somewhat unhinged idealists who still can put up a pretty good fight. Yet, ultimately, they are cruelly and fatally hemmed in by their inability to come to terms with the deepest and most penetrating ideas that our civilization, or any civilization, has yet been able to generate: the ideas of science and mathematics. Further, they must confront the practical significance of the barrier that separates them from first-hand knowledge of science, engineering, and economics. Fields like these are vital to the formulation and critique of public policy and interact with our political institutions to a vast extent. They are the conceptual fuel that drives modern society. The vagaries of literary theorists or cultural anthropologists, by contrast, hardly leave a trace on wider public concerns. They could easily fade away without anyone outside the faith taking much notice. Ultimately, then, we shouldn't be startled by the alienation of academic non-scientists from science and technology, nor by the churlishnish with which they address such issues. Steve Fuller is merely an extreme case, an outlier. He represents what a widespread attitude may become when infused with mega-oses egotism and self-regard, and when maximally saturated with the desire to belittle and condescend to the much-hated scientific community. Fuller has perpetrated a dreadful book, but as a tantrum, it is exemplary. He may draw some cautious admiration from his colleagues for the operatic brio of his histrionics. But it seems to me doubtful \u2014 and this is a very good thing \u2014 that any large segment of the science-studies community, nor of the larger \"academic left\" will join him in the attempt to find comrades-in-arms in such venues as the Discovery Institute or the wider Intelligent Design movement. Figures like Johnson, Dembski, and Behe, not to mention Ahmanson and Monaghan, burn all too visibly with a searing desire to inaugurate a Godly polity that will be as intolerable to the postmodern left as to conventional liberals or secularists. These guys are just too scary, even for those academics who have heretofore flaunted their disdain for orthodox science. Fuller, I'm afraid, will just have to go it alone. Shermer v.

Mr. Adelson had the good fortune to study with the late [Rabbi Sherwin Wine](http://www.shj.org/wine.htm). A controversial secular organizer, Rabbi Wine founded Humanistic Judaism, a secular movement which provides atheistic and agnostic Jews around the world with a means for organization, mobilization, and a sense of community. Speaking to Derek & Swoopy as a skeptic, Mr. Adelson shares insights from his lecture series, the \"Forum for New Thinking\" (inspired by Rabbi Wine). He also takes a critical look at music history, dispelling some false beliefs about artists \u2014 creative humans who are often painted with the brush of divine inspiration. Building on the musical theme, Swoopy talks to Canadian blue grass trio The Dirty Dishes about their new rendition of \"Lily The Pink\", an ode to the late 1800's \"queen\" of patent medicine Lydia Pinkham. In this week's eSkeptic feature, we're pleased to present a new article by Daniel Loxton, commenting on the history (and future) of patent medicine in light of 2007's status as the 100th anniversary of active Federal regulation of food and drugs. To mark the anniversary, and as a holiday treat, we also give away a brand new song recording in MP3 format, completely free \u2014 \"Lily the Pink,\" a century-old folk parody of the claims of the \"Queen of Patent Medicine,\" Lydia Pinkham. The Immortal Lily The Pink The 100th anniversary of the FDA marks a milestone in medicine before which cranks and charlatans ran amok by Daniel Loxton This year has represented a little-remarked-upon major milestone in American medicine: the 100th anniversary of active Federal regulation of food and drugs. The Pure Food and Drug Act came into effect on January 1st, 1907 \u2014 the first step toward the creation of the modern Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a step forward from the dangerous anarchy of the patent medicine era. For the first time, drug manufacturers were required by law to disclose the dosage and purity of their products (including, for the first time, disclosing whether they contained poison, alcohol, or narcotics such as heroin or cocaine). They were also required to refrain from deliberately lying about their products, and from fraudulently substituting a claimed ingredient for some other ingredient. Bizarrely, such laws were needed. To celebrate this anniversary, and in time for the holidays, we're pleased to share a brand new, [free MP3 recording](#free) of a song with roots extending back to the bad old days of unrestrained snake oil: \"Lily the Pink\" (performed here by the Canadian bluegrass trio Dirty Dishes). \"Lily the Pink\" (which evolved from \"The Ballad of Lydia Pinkham\") is a comic send-up of the woman called \"the queen of patent medicine.\" Starting in 1875, Lydia Pinkham built a business empire on the hype-driven sales of a herbal concoction marketed to women for relief of \"all those Painful Complaints and Weaknesses so common to our best female population.\" In specific, it was intended to address menstrual cramps, and was also \"particularly adapted to the Change of Life.\" True to the dizzy style of the unregulated patent medicine era, Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was promoted with a blizzard of unlikely claims. (As the lyrics of \"Lily the Pink\" mockingly put it, \"She invented a medicinal compound, efficacious in every case.\") Ad copy insisted that it cured everything from headaches to indigestion to farting, not to mention sleeplessness and depression. (Its primary ingredient was booze, so there was no doubt some evidence to support these latter claims.) Less believably, Pinkham's Compound was advertised to \"dissolve and expel tumors from the uterus at an early stage of development. The tendency to cancerous humors there is checked very speedily by its use.\" It was also, the ads said, remarkably effective: \"98 out of every 100 women who take the medicine for the ailments for which it is recommended are benefited by it. This is a most remarkable record of efficiency. We doubt if any other medicine in the world equals it.\" Remarkable indeed. It's clear that most of these boasts were made up whole cloth, but was any of it true? I asked quack medicine expert Dr. Harriet Hall, \"Was Pinkham's herbal cocktail at all useful for treating anything?\" \"The bottom line,\" Hall told me, \"is that we have no idea whether her product was effective or safe, since it has never been properly tested. We have no good evidence that any of the individual components are safe or effective, and we have no way of knowing what might happen when you mix them. Mixing remedies could do almost anything \u2014 they could cancel each other out, have additive effects, vastly increase the chance of side effects, who knows?\" Certainly the Lydia Pinkham Medicine Company had no idea whether its product was safe or effective. It was literally something Pinkham brewed up in her basement, without scientific testing of any kind. On the other hand, we do now have firm evidence regarding the efficacy of black cohosh, the herb modern alternative medicine proponents most often cite as the effective active component to Pinkham's Compound. Long considered promising as a treatment for the symptoms of menopause, black cohosh unfortunately bombed in a recent large trial designed by the National Institutes of Health to clarify the ambiguous existing literature and settle the question. The results of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were unequivocal: black cohosh is useless for the control of menopausal hot flashes and night sweats. As far as science can tell, Lydia's Compound was worthless in public health terms. By free market standards, however, it was a soaring success story. Pinkham's booming 19th century enterprise raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The secret, then as now, was marketing. Pinkham spread the message through national print ad campaigns, door-to-door sales, point of purchase postcard giveaways, and many books and pamphlets that alternated recipes or household tips with ads for her product. The company's aggressive marketing pioneered a formula for selling quack medicine that is still common today: - Market directly to women: At the mercy of a male-dominated medical establishment, women were eager to seize control of their own health. Offering them a way to sidestep the then-primitive medical mainstream through the consumption and word-of-mouth promotion of a herbal \"alternative\" was (and still is) an effective hook for a sales pitch. With its \"just us girls\" attitude and its \"Only a woman can understand a woman's ills\" tagline, the Lydia Pinkham Medicine Company turned shameful social inequality into a source of profit. - Sow fear of mainstream medicine: \"ANY HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE is painful as well as costly and frequently dangerous,\" warned Food and Health, a promotional book produced by Pinkham's company. \"Many women have avoided this experience by taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound in time...\" - Present your big business as warm, folksy and personal: With Lydia Pinkham's matronly portrait as its logo, the company was able to present itself as a homemade cottage enterprise. (Fans of the animated TV series Futurama may recognize \"MomCorp\" and its subsidiary \"Mom's Friendly Robot Company\" as comic descendants of the Pinkham advertising model.) Customers who wrote for advice even received personal responses from Lydia herself \u2014 for years after she died. In fact, a large, dedicated department within the company churned out replies by the thousands. Today, this time-tested advertising model \u2014 present your mainstream competitors as cold and mercenary, while presenting your own for-profit company's herbal products as warm, homemade, and natural \u2014 is still in wide use in the alternative medicine industry. Indeed, it's shocking how little has changed. Today, herbal concoctions and other supplements are cooked up and marketed with wild abandon, with all the unrestrained, unverified boasting of the patent medicine era still on display. We are told (coyly, skirting the few rules for labeling) that herbs and proprietary blends can cure more-or-less anything \u2014 just as we were assured by Lydia Pinkham. Have we really made so little progress against health fraud? In fact, we've come a long way. Today, most medicines are carefully regulated, and consumers can be reasonably assured of the basics: that effectiveness, side effects and interactions are known to some degree; that the bottle contains what the label says; that we are not unknowingly buying bottles of heroin, and so on. We all know that regulation comes with its own cost (drugs take a long time to get to market, for example) but we're much, much better off than drug consumers in Pinkham's day. Unfortunately, current regulations have a hole in them, a hole large enough to drive a truck through \u2014 or rather, truckload after truckload of untested, unregulated herbal \"supplements.\" The fault for this lies with a piece of legislation called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), which seized back control of patent medicines from the FDA. Driven by strenuous lobbying from supplement manufacturers, this legislation removed all herbs, vitamins, and minerals from FDA oversight \u2014 despite the fact that herbs are drugs, exhibiting a full range of effectiveness (or ineffectiveness), dangerous side effects, and interactions with other drugs. Not only are the producers of herbal drugs and other supplements no longer required to prove that their products work \u2014 or whether they are safe \u2014 but the burden of proof regarding safety is explicitly shifted to the FDA. That is, anyone can sell any old combination of herbs at any dosage, without any obligation to even try to find out if that product is safe or not. Only if a supplement kills enough people to get the FDA's attention, and if the staff of the FDA can find the time and budget, can the FDA then attempt to prove in court that the supplement is unsafe. This costly and lengthy close-the-barn-door-after-the-horses-have-escaped procedure is of course attempted only rarely, and in the most severe cases. The first such case was the banning of ephedra, a supplement suspected in hundreds of deaths. This ban was soon challenged in court (by a company which sells ephedra), and overturned \u2014 on the basis that the DSHEA forbids FDA action even in such an extreme case. Luckily, the ruling against the ephedra ban was itself overturned on appeal. After more than two years of legal battles, ephedra supplements are today illegal. Despite this eventual victory on this one substance, the DSHEA renders the FDA almost powerless over herbal drugs, even if they are known to be dangerous. (Certainly the FDA has no power at all over herbal drugs whose dangers are simply unknown.) This industry-driven legislation inexplicably shifts the cost of safety testing from the companies that profit from the sales of supplements to the taxpayer. More to the point, the risk is shifted from the R&D budgets of companies to the personal health of individual consumers \u2014 exactly where we began, in Lydia Pinkham's day. Thanks to the DSHEA, the supplement industry has exploded (by several hundred percent or more). It now rakes in tens of billions of dollars a year. Requiring no expensive safety testing or FDA approval, these products are produced with an enviable profit margin, which has of course drawn large pharmaceutical corporations enthusiastically into the supplement industry. (People buying \"alternative\" herbal products rarely appreciate the likelihood that they are feeding their dollars into the exact same Big Pharma system they are attempting to circumvent, with the only difference being that corporation has been excused from the responsibility or cost of ensuring the safety or effectiveness of one of its lines of drugs.) We've come a long way \u2014 but we've also, in some ways, come full circle. This is a shame, because the room for mischief we've granted to modern alternative medicine manufacturers is the exact same ground we won at such great cost and effort from the early 20th century patent medicine industry. Like today's Natural Cures infomercial star (and convicted con-man) Kevin Trudeau, the Pinkham company engaged in a series of running battles with Federal regulators regarding the dishonesty of its labeling and advertising. As is still the case, vagueness and coy insinuation became the best friends of quack medicine manufacturers. (Noting yet another label change in 1939, Time magazine quoted the American Medical Association's exasperated patent medicine czar: \"Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is 'Recommended as a Vegetable Tonic in Conditions for which this Preparation is Adapted.' This statement is about as informative as it would be to say that 'For Those Who Like This Sort of Thing, This is the Sort of Thing That Those People Like.'\") It's clear that we still have much work to do in this important public health arena: In 1875, one business empire was founded on the sale of Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, an untested medical potion for \"those painful Complaints and Weaknesses so common to our best female population.\" Today, after a century of wrestling with the patent medicine industry, another company markets an alternative medicine concoction promoted as \"beneficial in menstrual and menopausal distress.\" It is called Lydia Pinkham Herbal Compound. Free MP3: Lily the Pink We're thrilled to present this brand new version of the traditional folk song \"Lily the Pink,\" a satirical send up of early patent medicine mogul Lydia Pinkham.

[CONTINUE READING to Protect Ayaan Hirsi Ali Most of you will recall the brutal murder of Theo van Gogh (a descendent of the brother of the famous artist) in Amsterdam in 2004 at the hands of a Muslim thug who was offended by Van Gogh's film about violence against women in the Muslim world (yes, that's right, for accusing Muslims of being violent he was violently killed \u2014 shot eight times and nearly decapitated). The killer left a note proclaiming that the author of the script upon which the film was based, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, would be next. Since then, and especially since her book Infidel became a bestseller, Ali has lived in fear and under Dutch government security. The Dutch government has now removed its protection, leaving Ali to fend for herself, scrambling to find the means to hire private professional security. I thank my friend Sam Harris for calling my attention to a new fund recently established in her name to raise money to pay for her security. I believe that this is a great moral cause that skeptics, humanists, and believers in civil liberties and freedom of speech can and should rally behind. Normally we call for general assistance in combatting irrationality in its generic form so pervasive in our world; here is a golden opportunity to give to a very specific cause in which irrationality threatens the life of a courageous free thinker and champion of liberty.

Hales says \"you can prove a negative\" and that skeptics need not concede this point in debates. Steven Hales is Professor of Philosophy at Bloomsburg University, where he was the 2006 Outstanding Teacher of the Year. He received his Ph.D. from Brown University and specializes in metaphysics and epistemology. His recent books include Relativism and the Foundations of Philosophy (MIT Press, 2006) and Beer and Philosophy (Blackwell, 2007). You Can Prove a Negative by Steven D. Hales A principle of folk logic is that you can't prove a negative. Skeptics and scientists routinely concede the point in debates about the possible existence of everything from Big Foot and Loch Ness to aliens and even God. In a recent television interview on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, for example, Skeptic publisher Michael Shermer admitted as much when Stephen Colbert pressed him on the point when discussing Weapons of Mass Destruction, the comedian adding that once it is admitted that scientists cannot prove the nonexistence of a thing, then belief in anything is possible. Even Richard Dawkins writes in The God Delusion that \"you cannot prove God's non-existence is accepted and trivial, if only in the sense that we can never absolutely prove the non-existence of anything.\" There is one big problem with this. Among professional logicians, guess how many think that you can't prove a negative? That's right, zero. Yes, Virginia, you can prove a negative, and it's easy, too. For one thing, a real, actual law of logic is a negative, namely the law of non-contradiction. This law states that that a proposition cannot be both true and not true. Nothing is both true and false. Furthermore, you can prove this law. It can be formally derived from the empty set using provably valid rules of inference. (I'll spare you the boring details). One of the laws of logic is a provable negative. Wait ... this means we've just proven that it is not the case that one of the laws of logic is that you can't prove a negative. So we've proven yet another negative! In fact, \"you can't prove a negative\" is a negative \u2014 so if you could prove it true, it wouldn't be true! Uh-oh. Not only that, but any claim can be expressed as a negative, thanks to the rule of double negation. This rule states that any proposition P is logically equivalent to not-not-P. So pick anything you think you can prove. Think you can prove your own existence? At least to your own satisfaction? Then, using the exact same reasoning, plus the little step of double negation, you can prove that you are not nonexistent. Congratulations, you've just proven a negative. The beautiful part is that you can do this trick with absolutely any proposition whatsoever. Prove P is true and you can prove that P is not false. You can easily construct a valid deductive argument with all true premises that yields the conclusion that there are no unicorns. Here's one, using the valid inference procedure of modus tollens (Latin for \"mode that affirms by denying\"): - If unicorns had existed, then there is evidence in the fossil record. - There is no evidence of unicorns in the fossil record. - Therefore, unicorns never existed. Someone might object that that was a bit too fast \u2014 after all, I didn't prove that the two premises were true. I just asserted that they were true. Well, that's right. However, it would be a grievous mistake to insist that someone prove all the premises of any argument they might give. Here's why. The only way to prove, say, that there is no evidence of unicorns in the fossil record, is by giving an argument to that conclusion. Of course one would then have to prove the premises of that argument by giving further arguments, and then prove the premises of those further arguments, ad infinitum. Which premises we should take on credit and which need payment up front is a matter of long and involved debate among epistemologists. But one thing is certain: if proving things requires that an infinite number of premises get proved first, we're not going to prove much of anything at all, positive or negative. Maybe people mean that no inductive argument will conclusively, indubitably prove a negative proposition beyond all shadow of a doubt. For example, suppose someone argues that we've scoured the world for Bigfoot, found no credible evidence of Bigfoot's existence, and therefore there is no Bigfoot. This is a classic inductive argument. A Sasquatch defender can always rejoin that Bigfoot is reclusive, and might just be hiding in that next stand of trees. You can't prove he's not! (until the search of that tree stand comes up empty too). The problem here isn't that inductive arguments won't give us certainty about negative claims (like the nonexistence of Bigfoot), but that inductive arguments won't give us certainty about anything at all, positive or negative. All observed swans are white, therefore all swans are white looked like a pretty good inductive argument until black swans were discovered in Australia. The very nature of an inductive argument is to make a conclusion probable, but not certain, given the truth of the premises. That is just what an inductive argument is. We'd better not dismiss induction because we're not getting certainty out of it, though. Why do you think that the sun will rise tomorrow? Not because of observation (you can't observe the future!), but because that's what it has always done in the past. Why do you think that if you turn on the kitchen tap that water will come out instead of chocolate? Why do you think you'll find your house where you last left it? Again, because that's the way things have always been in the past. In other words, we use inferences \u2014 induction \u2014 from past experiences in every aspect of our lives. As Bertrand Russell once pointed out, the chicken who expects to be fed when he sees the farmer approaching, since that is what had always happened in the past, is in for a big surprise when instead of receiving dinner, he becomes dinner. But if the chicken had rejected inductive reasoning altogether, then every appearance of the farmer would be a surprise. So why is it that people insist that you can't prove a negative? I think it is the result of two things: (1) Disappointment that induction is not bulletproof, airtight, and infallible, and (2) A desperate desire to keep believing whatever one believes, even if all the evidence is against it. That's why people keep believing in alien abductions, even when flying saucers always turn out to be weather balloons, stealth jets, comets, or too much alcohol. You can't prove a negative! You can't prove that there are no alien abductions! Meaning: your argument against aliens is inductive, therefore not incontrovertible. Since I want to believe in aliens, I'm going to dismiss the argument no matter how overwhelming the evidence against aliens, and no matter how vanishingly small the chance of extraterrestrial abduction. If we're going to dismiss inductive arguments because they produce conclusions that are probable but not definite, then we are in deep manure. Despite its fallibility, induction is vital in every aspect of our lives, from the mundane to the most sophisticated science. Without induction we know basically nothing about the world apart from our own immediate perceptions. So we'd better keep induction, warts and all, and use it to form negative beliefs as well as positive ones. You can prove a negative \u2014 at least as much as you can prove anything at all.

In this week's eSkeptic, David Ludden reviews by Cordelia Fine's book entitled [A Mind of its Own: How Your Brain Distorts and Deceives ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393062139?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393062139) (W.W. Norton, 2006, ISBN 0393062139). David Ludden is an associate professor of psychology at Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, Kentucky, where he teaches courses in cognitive, physiological and evolutionary psychology. The Matrix of the Brain a book review by David Ludden In the 1999 science-fantasy film The Matrix, people have been plugged into a giant computer that creates a virtual reality that is both pleasing and plausible. A few renegade humans have unplugged themselves from the Matrix, only to wake up to a miserable underground existence below a war-scorched Earth. In a similar fashion, our brains generate a comforting version of reality that protects us from the desolation and despair of the real world. We implicitly trust the products of our brains \u2014 our perceptions, our memories, our judgments, our sense of self. We say, \"I know what I saw,\" and we ask, \"How could I forget?\" After all, if you cannot trust your own brain, who can you trust? But all is not as it seems. More than half a century of cognitive and social psychology research has shown that much of what we see, remember, and think is an illusion. In her new book A Mind of its Own, Cordelia Fine lays out in a highly entertaining fashion the myriad ways in which our vain, immoral, pig-headed brains are constantly deceiving us. Although we like to think of ourselves as rational beings, our brains covertly strive to create for us a view of the world and of ourselves that is self serving but not necessarily consistent with reality. Beliefs and opinions are formed quickly and become part of how we define ourselves, so the brain selectively perceives and recalls evidence that supports cherished beliefs while disregarding or forgetting evidence that contradicts our beliefs. Fine calls this \"motivated skepticism.\" We are naturally skeptical of anything that challenges our beliefs, but accepting of anything that bolsters our beliefs, and hence our egos. For example, it is for us easy to mock the tenets of other religions \u2014 \"How could they possibly believe that?\" \u2014 while swallowing whole the equally far-fetched teachings of our own church. Motivated skepticism can even lead to belief polarization, a process whereby counterevidence only strengthens the convictions of our beliefs. The counterevidence is strenuously scrutinized for any weakness, which is then used to diminish the validity of evidence for our opponent's point of view. Our selective perceptions are further bolstered by illusory correlations. These are caused largely by selective memory, in which we remember only supporting examples but not counterexamples. For instance, if you already believe the stereotype that all Asians are shy, you will only recall experiences that support this stereotype. When confronted with an assertive Asian, the reaction is likely to be: \"Yes, but she grew up in America.\" In such a fashion, counterexamples are simply dismissed as aberrations. Our brains also trick us into believing we have more control over situations than we really do. We blow on dice and perform other rituals to influence events. We also feel safer driving than flying because we think we are in control behind the steering wheel. This is especially true when things turn out in our favor. For instance, we take the credit for picking a winning lottery ticket, but blame a losing ticket on bad luck. It would seem that going through life deluded by our own brains would not be a good thing, but that is not necessarily the case. Some people have markedly more balanced self-perceptions than normal people \u2014 they know clearly what their limitations are and how little control they actually have over their lives. They are also clinically depressed, and seeing reality for what it is, they become overwhelmed and lose the desire to go on living. So it seems that our brains delude us to keep us happy, healthy and ready to face life's challenges. In fact, people who are generally optimistic tend to live longer. Emotional arousal also plays an important role in cognitive functions. Brain damage can create a mismatch between emotion and rational thought. People who cannot experience arousal during the decision making process, for example, become incapable of making decisions or consistently make poor choices. It seems that the gut feeling we get when faced with a choice is more important than any rational decision-making process. The experience of emotion is also integral to our sense of self. In a condition known as Capgras syndrome, patients no longer feel any sort of arousal in the presence of family members, and so they become convinced that their loved ones have been replaced by impostors. Others lose the ability to feel emotion altogether; they also feel detached from themselves and lose all interest in life. Even healthy individuals experience this depersonalization sometimes, particularly during traumatic experiences. Afterward, people report a feeling of detachment from the events around them and even from themselves. This seems to be a coping mechanism of the brain to keep it from becoming overwhelmed. By three quarters of the way through the book, the reader is yearning for a return to blissful ignorance, as there seems to be no escape from what Fine calls \"our innate lack of scientific rigor.\" But still there is hope. Fine advises that we \"[t]reat with the greatest suspicion the proof of [our] own eyes.\" In other words, we need to trust in the scientific method to lead us out of the tangle of deceptions our brains weave around us. As with any other behavior, modes of thinking can be practiced until they become automatic, and so Fine is hopeful that practice in critical thinking can help guard us from the extravagances of our own brains. One of the strongest points of this book is the way Fine deftly describes how research is done in psychology. She does not just tell what is known about how the brain deceives, she explains how we know it. In friendly terms, she presents hypotheses to test, clearly describes how experiments are set up, and shows us how reasonable conclusions are drawn from the data. Thus, she demonstrates how the scientific method can be used to overcome our false beliefs and misconceptions. Life is pleasant inside the virtual reality of our minds. So what if we think we are more intelligent or virtuous than others and believe we are more in control than we really are? Such minor self-deceptions are, for the most part, harmless, and they may help us to get through the day. But we are not necessarily prisoners of our minds. When the deceptions become harmful to ourselves and others, there is a way out. Science gives us a way to unplug ourselves from the Matrix of our brains. A Secret of the Universe Many Skeptic readers are all too aware of The Secret, a slick repackaging of the principles of New Thought and Unity Christianity. This week, Skepticality tackles an altogether different secret. Derek & Swoopy talk with author and podcaster Stephen L.

A far cry from most books that offer up a secret message, A Secret of the Universe is a work of dramatic allegory about how we come to form knowledge about the Big Questions: God, sexual ethics, morals, political ideology \u2014 and how those beliefs affect our actions, our lives, and the world around us.

With all the buzz this week about UFOs and the call for an investigation into what the government is hiding from us about extraterrestrial aliens, we thought we would ask a NASA official in charge of dealing with the public about such matters, and that is NASA scientist David Morrison. Read on for how Dr. Morrison handles such queries as \"where are you hiding the alien bodies?\" and other such matters. Dr. David Morrison is Senior Scientist of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. He is a recent recipient of the American Astronomical Society's Carl Sagan Medal honoring his efforts to explain science to the public. Answering Public Questions on UFOs and Aliens by David Morrison As Senior Scientist of the NASA Astrobiology Institute I receive many questions submitted to NASA's website [Ask an Astrobiologist](http://nai.arc.nasa.gov/astrobio/). A great many of these concern UFOs, especially the notion that there is a government cover-up. Interestingly, an increasing fraction of these are coming from India. Readers of Skeptic might be interested in how I answer these questions. A google search on \"UFO\" quickly reveals how pervasive such ideas are, with only a couple of skeptical entries listed in the first several pages. It is therefore not surprising that almost all my questioners seem to accept the reality of alien visitation. One recent writer asked: \"If NASA is not hiding anything, and there has been not one evidence of UFO or Alien, how can some evidence on TV or internet be explained? If they are all fake, why not NASA explain this, and why are they not stopped from telling lies? How do you explain all those people who have proof, including many scientists, doctors for example who found real alien object in someone who was kidnapped by alien. NASA or some officials should make documentary that explains all about these on TV. If not, anyone would think that they are hiding something from us.\" Here is my reply: First, these stories you have heard are not true, for instance about photos of UFOs from NASA spaceships, or doctors finding an alien object in someone. If any of these stories were true, or if there were any scientific evidence for aliens, you would see it all over reputable newspapers and TV news shows. There is a tremendous amount of misinformation out there, especially on the Internet. I know of no simple rule to separate the truth from the lies, except to learn which sources are trustworthy. Second, you raise the question why \"they are not stopped telling lies\" and why NASA is not making a documentary \"that explains all about this on TV\". The government is not in the business of making documentaries or broadcasting on television. NASA officials and other scientists have explained many times the difference between truth and fiction in this area. But we cannot \u2014 and would not want to \u2014 control what news and opinions are in the media. One of my first UFO questions stated that Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin had reported that he and his crew members saw a UFO on Apollo 11. \"Edwin Aldrin recently came out in a special on the Science Channel and stated that the astronauts aboard Apollo 11 all saw unidentified objects which seemed to have been following them. He also mentions that they were briefed not to talk about what they had seen. What does NASA have to say in response to this? What were those objects they all saw?\" To get a straight story, I called Buzz Aldrin, who was happy to explain what had happened. He said that the quotations were taken out of context and did not convey the intended meaning. After the Apollo 11 crew verified that the object they were seeing was not the SIVB upper stage, which was about 6000 miles away at that time, they concluded that they were probably seeing one of the panels from the separation of the spacecraft from the upper stage. These panels were not tracked from Earth and were likely much closer to the Apollo spacecraft. They chose not to discuss this on the open communications channel since they were concerned that their comments might be misinterpreted (as they are being now). All of this explanation about the panels was cut from the broadcast interview, thus giving the impression that the Apollo 11 crew had seen a UFO. Buzz said that he was angry about the deceptive editing and asked them to correct this reversal of what he had said, but they refused. With the popularity of Youtube, such claims are getting a new life. I recently received this: \"Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlkV1ybBnHI) on YouTube with Buzz Aldrin saying he saw a UFO on Apollo 11. Whose fibbing, NASA or the great American hero, Buzz Aldrin?\" My answer was that the fibbing was being done by the producers of the video, who cut the second half of the interview. How can we argue effectively against beliefs that we are being visited constantly by alien spaceships? The simple assertion from authority \u2014 that none of these claims are to be found in mainstream publications or television \u2014 is probably not very convincing. Instead, I point out that the evidence for UFOs and alien visitation is weak. It is easy to see how weak the evidence is when we compare with other phenomena that are increasingly well documented. For example: - The proliferation of home video cameras has resulted in excellent images of tornados that we now see often on television, something unheard of 25 years ago. Even with a scary tornado, someone manages to get a good video. There are also amateur videos of bright meteors (fireballs), good enough in the case of the Peekskill meteor of 1992 to allow a calculation of the orbit of the object before it reached Earth. But there has been no comparable flood of good videos of UFOs or aliens. - In the last few years, in the US and UK and many other countries, hundreds of thousands of automated video cameras have been installed for security systems. Many of these cameras are outdoors, and at night they sometimes record bright meteors \u2014 but never UFOs. - There are several hundred thousand amateur astronomers who look at the night sky, and they have a tremendous record of discovering comets and novas and anything that changes. One of the most remarkable recent examples is Comet Holmes, a normally inconspicuous Jupiter-family comet that is fainter than Pluto. On October 23-24, 2007, Comet Holmes went from magnitude 17 to magnitude 2.8 in just a few hours, brightening by almost a million-fold. This is equivalent to the planet Saturn suddenly becoming as bright as the full moon. This unexpected outburst was widely observed and photographed by amateur astronomers around the globe. Yet these same astronomers never report UFOs. One can never prove a negative. But to me, these examples provide compelling evidence against the reality of UFOs, unless you are so enamored of the idea of alien visits that you think these aliens are carefully avoiding amateur astronomers, people with video cameras, and security video systems.

The Future of Skepticism by Daniel Loxton, Editor, Junior Skeptic On October 16th, 2007, Skepticality released an episode featuring my audio op-ed essay on the future of skepticism (which you can [download here](http://media.libsyn.com/media/skepticality/063_skepticality.mp3) as a 47 MB MP3 file, or as a [text-only PDF](https://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhereDoWeGoFromHere.pdf)). It brought an immediate response from listeners. Between emails, Facebook messages, forum comments, and blog entries, the response has been (to my delighted surprise!) extremely high in both quantity and thoughtfulness \u2014 and very positive. Derek tells me, \"Dan, honestly, this was the most 'real' feedback we have had since our first shows ... This has been a great week for me, I love when people get excited.\" I hoped this might get people chatting a little bit, but it seems to have really struck a nerve. There definitely is a discernible current of opinion among these many comments, which is an illuminating bit of informal market research. For example, respondents generally agree that skepticism should be apolitical. They also agree that atheism is a separate issue, from which organized skepticism should keep its distance. I'm particularly encouraged by the groundswell of support for my central thesis: that skepticism should renew its focus on its traditional core concerns regarding the investigation and criticism of paranormal claims. Finally, another common theme quite caught me off guard. Many people wrote to say they felt moved to help, to contribute, to become skeptical activists! I'm tremendously grateful to these people for their inspiring enthusiasm. Many of them asked the natural next questions: What do we do from here? How do we do effective skeptical activism? How can individual skeptics help, exactly? Those are big questions, which we'll be addressing soon on an upcoming episode of Skepticality. In the meantime, we're pleased to share a selection from the responses in the writers' own words. Responses to Daniel Loxton's \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" Positive Feedback - \"Wow, what a fantastic episode! I don't know that I've ever heard Loxton before, but that was both a moving and well thought out essay and such a good post-essay interview that this comes across as one of your best episodes. I really like the fact that your podcast is tackling not just coverage of skeptical issues, but starting to encourage activism from what I'm sure are a large number of people who are new to organized skepticism (like me).\" - \"I was really inspired by this week's Skepticality Podcast, (specifically Daniel Loxton's call to re-arm) and I think it's time I threw my hat into the ring. I'm a mentalist and magician with a skeptical show ... Anyways, I've been toying with doing a skeptical blog for awhile now, Daniel's essay was just what I needed to get started for real ... Thank you so much, and keep slaying the dragons.\" - \"I really agreed with the point that the old-school skeptical topics still have a place. There's a whole new generation of people out there who've never heard the skeptical perspective. I used to work at a camp, and the hardest thing was teaching the summer staff that even though you've done archery 100 times this summer, it's probably the kid's first time doing it. I feel the same way about the skeptical message.\" - \"I loved that episode and what Daniel had to say \u2014 and I have ADHD!\" - \"I started formulating my forum post as soon as I heard the Buffy reference. When I successfully predicted the connected Angel reference, I shuddered. Daniel Loxton hit the nail on the head. It's all I can do not to quote him word for word and repeat everything he just said in a poor emulation of my own ... I cannot agree with him more, that to expand the role of skepticism to begin taking positions on politics, philosophy, and religion is to dilute it.\" - \"As an atheist and a libertarian I wholly support the notion to keep the skeptic movement away from religion and politics. If we try to direct efforts into these areas I believe it will only lead to divisive infighting, and we simply CANNOT afford this. As skeptics, we can have legitimate differences of opinion on these subjects (at least to some degree) and still be united in our \"skeptical battles\". The best thing we can do is to provide support for each other and encourage each other to also be active in the political and/or religious groups of our choosing and bring a skeptical voice of reason to them.\" - \"I am currently a stay-at-home mom, with a second grade girl and a kindergarten boy, and I have to deal regularly with how to raise the kids to be rational, logically-minded and skeptical ... I was inspired by Daniel's great essay and callout to propose some way to reach [these much] younger potential skeptics ...\" - \"Just wanted to let you know I listened to the show at work tonight. It is one of the best Skepticality podcasts. Fellow Canadian Daniel Loxton had an extremely interesting and well-written essay, and the follow up conversation went back to some of the early podcasts when the whole show had a more relaxed feel.\" - \"Well done indeed. I was impressed. I'll say for now that I do in fact slay dragons ... little dragons every time I perform for school kids. Some of those dragons will undoubtedly will come back to life, but some will never get the chance to grow.\" - \"Daniel Loxton's \"Where do we go from here?\" gives a lot of good points in terms of constantly attacking the paranormal. No matter how tiring it may become, skeptics cannot become complacent. Skeptics should slow the rise and speed the fall of blatant fallacies to help people avoid bad decisions.\" - \"I just listened to the podcast and really enjoyed it. It was very motivational. Identifying yourself as part of a skeptical movement is doing something positive for the community. I'll have to find some niche in the critical thinking community that I can be more proactive in. It was a great pep talk.\" - \"Thought provoking and moving indeed. Well worth the read, (or listen). I'm still digesting the article, and have a feeling I'll be thinking about it for a bit, I just wanted to say thank you for posting this.\" - \"Help me be one of those pesky kids. I'd like to be one of those who help along from here ... I've done the whole Christian thing from church and Sunday school to youth group to deacon to priest ... I'm one of the people I hear you and other skeptics say cannot be swayed ... As Daniel said, new faces are needed. Some don't know where or how to start, like me.\" Negative Feedback [One libertarian listener was generally supportive of my argument, but felt I should have left libertarianism out of it:] - \"I would like to comment on one relatively minor point you made ... where you railed against libertarianism. First, I thought it was odd to have this small political stumping sticking out in the middle of a piece about science ... I interpreted \u2014 possibly incorrectly \u2014 that your true intent (which was left well hidden between the lines) was to deride libertarianism as merely an excuse for those who do not go as far to the extreme left as you would like them to.\" [One atheist listener felt I was wrong to exclude god as a target for skeptics:] - \"The so-called skeptical movement targets \"the sharks\" ... we take the fight to the scammers, professing ignorance of the underlying cause. Oh sure; we talk the good game. Educate the masses; promote critical thinking skills; promote science literacy. But we draw the line at addressing the most blatant case of non-critical thinking here in the US and the world at large. Religion ... If you are looking for dragons to slay, that is the big one.\" [This is my favorite! One Buffy fan never even gave my essay a chance:] - \"Hey, I'm a skeptic, and I tried listening to the podcast. My word for it \u2014 yawn? How about double yawn, with a side of 'zzzzz.' If he had a point to make, I missed it, 'cause I gave up after about five minutes. Even when writing scholarly articles, please, get to the point. Don't bore the reader ... er, um, listener. Don't make me sleepy by citing a litany of scholarly references. Put those at the end, if you must have them at all. The catch was Buffy singing, but even that didn't make me want to keep listening until he wound his way around to whatever point he was snaking up to. As Dark Willow would say, our fall season... The Breathtaking Inanity of Flood Geology: Geology, Creationism & Evolution with Dr. Donald Prothero Sunday, November 11th, 2pm Baxter Lecture Hall, Caltech Have you ever had to deal with a Creationist who takes the Genesis accounts literally, and who insists that the biblical story of Noah's flood can account for all the geologic features of the earth, as well as all the creatures that survived on the ark?

With the recent death of Alex, the talking parrot, the debate about whether animals have language has once again moved into the public arena, so I thought it was time for Skeptic to revisit the subject in this article by Dr. Clive Wynne, a psychology professor at the University of Florida and the author of the authoritative textbook on the subject of animal cognition. Aping Language a skeptical analysis of the evidence for nonhuman primate language by Clive Wynne In August 1969 the pre-eminent journal Science published a paper which, in its own way, marked as giant a leap for mankind as the first moon landing a month earlier. [1](#note01) Allen and Beatrice Gardner of the University of Nevada reported that, for the first time in human history, they had conversed with a member of another species. Washoe, a female chimpanzee who had been reared in a trailer in the Gardner's backyard, had a vocabulary of over one hundred words that she used to effectively communicate with her caregivers. Centuries earlier, the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes observed that, \"it is very remarkable that there are none so depraved and stupid, without even excepting idiots, that they cannot arrange different words together, forming of them a statement by which they make known their thoughts; while, on the other hand, there is no other animal, however perfect and fortunately circumstanced it may be, which can do the same.\" [2](#note02) Descartes' opinion had survived three centuries unthreatened by possible contradiction. Until Washoe, every speaking beast had been shown to be just a circus trick. Parrots might be trained to repeat certain phrases, but they had no understanding of what they were saying. Dogs could respond to commands, but they had no grasp of grammar. But Washoe was the real McCoy. She didn't just respond to rote commands, she could correctly react to novel combinations of words. And she created her own little sentences like gimme sweet, come open, and listen dog. [3](#note03) Taken out on a lake, Washoe saw a swan for the first time and signed water bird for this unfamiliar creature. Many had tried to communicate with chimpanzees before \u2014 but none had got very far. Before the Gardners, the record for chimpanzee communication was just three words \u2014 Mama, Papa, and Cup \u2014 recorded in the early 1950s. [4](#note04) These attempts had attracted a lot of public attention and even inspired one of Ronald Reagan's better movies, Bedtime for Bonzo. (Reagan later joked \"I'm the one with the watch.\") But they had only reinforced Descartes' conclusions about nonhuman linguistic possibilities. The Gardners succeeded where so many before them had failed because they had the brilliant insight to teach Washoe to use her hands to communicate instead of her vocal chords. Many early observers of chimps had noted how much more facile they were with their hands and feet than with their voices, but none before the Gardners had thought to use this as a way to teach them language. The Gardners trained Washoe in the sign language used by the deaf in North America: ASL. ASL is a complete human language. Though a few signs are fairly clear pantomimes of the actions they imply, most are as incomprehensible to the uninitiated as the sounds in an unfamiliar spoken language. ASL also has its own grammar and syntax. Washoe inspired legions of imitators. By the early 1970s there were about two dozen apes in language training: one even made it onto The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. [5](#note05) Francine (Penny) Patterson, at the time a graduate student at Stanford University, became the first to train a gorilla in sign language. Duane Rumbaugh at Emory University developed a communication system in which the apes had to press keys with patterns on them to express themselves. Their human companions could either press keys back at them, or just talk in plain English. The most significant of Washoe's imitators was probably a chimpanzee cheekily named Nim Chimpsky by Herbert Terrace of Columbia University. The joke was that linguist Noam Chomsky was the most vocal defender of Descartes' belief that language was uniquely human. Terrace held a quite different view. He told an interviewer in early 1975, \"I'm not the only one trying to teach a chimp a sign language. There are others ... but I hope to be the one who is going to do it right.\" [6](#note06) He would, \"nail to the wall proof that a subhuman primate can acquire a syntactical competence that at least overlaps with that of man ...the age-old distinctions concerning man's uniqueness would no longer hold.\" At first Nim's progress matched Washoe's closely. By September 1977 Nim had acquired 125 signs \u2014 not too dissimilar from Washoe's rate of vocabulary acquisition. He also started stringing signs together in little sentences. Terrace and his colleagues collected over 20,000 instances where Nim put words together in potentially grammatical sequences. For example, if Nim wanted more of something he was more likely to say more something (where something could be anything he knew the name of) than to say it backwards (something more). Similarly, when Nim put a verb and a noun together, he was much more likely to do it that way (eat grape for example), than the reverse (grape eat). Patterns like this had convinced the Gardners that Washoe understood grammar, but Terrace realized that in themselves these word order patterns were not enough to prove that an animal understood grammar. To see why word order alone is not enough to prove the comprehension of grammar consider one of Nim's most frequent two word phrases. In line with stereotypes about chimpanzees, Nim was very fond of bananas and would frequently sign: banana me. And he signed it that way about three times more often than he would sign me banana. Does this show us that Nim understood the rules of English grammar and is correctly saying \"Give a banana to me\" in the abbreviated form quite common to young children just beginning to learn their native language? Terrace understood that just recording the ape's use of signs alone could never tell us the answer. We could never be sure that Nim was really trying to say, \"Give a banana to me\" and not, for example, \"My Banana\" (given that the language he was taught did not distinguish \"me\" from \"my\"). If Nim was really trying to say \"My Banana\" then he was actually usually in error and was only occasionally getting the grammatical structure right. Everything depends on Nim's intention. We simply cannot know whether a particular utterance is grammatical or not just by looking at the words used. We have to see the context. Terrace and his team had collected videotapes of Nim with his trainers and proceeded to analyze these frame by frame, looking not just at what signs Nim used, but at the exact context \u2014 everything that was going on before and after Nim's utterances. Terrace released his results in November 1979. Dava Sobel in the New York Times summarized Terrace's new position thus: \"Herbert S. Terrace ... now asserts that the success of his own and related efforts can be explained as mere prompting on the part of the experimenters and mistakes in reporting the data. 'Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill,' he said. 'Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.'\" Incredible! And a complete reversal of what he set out to find. Terrace now argued that Nim's use of ASL signs was quite unlike how children learn language. Nim failed to initiate conversations, he seldom introduced new vocabulary and just imitated what the humans around him said. Nim's sentences failed to grow in length. In human children there is a close relationship between the number of words known and the number of words used in a sentence. Not so in Nim. Throughout his time in the language project he stuck to using one or two words at a time. And his longer utterances were without any regard for grammatical structure. Nim's longest recorded \"sentence\" was give orange me give eat orange me eat orange give me eat orange give me you. Not hard to understand \u2014 but not very grammatical either. The others who had apes in training were furious with Terrace. Science reported that the \"mutual criticisms among ape language researchers ... have made the War of the Roses look like a teddy-bears' picnic.\" [7](#note07) The other ape language projects criticized Terrace's treatment of Nim and attempted a rearguard action to defend their claims for ape language. But by the early 1980s the tide of opinion had swung back. Descartes was right after all. Animals do not understand language. Several researchers continue working with apes on sign language to this day. Washoe is now in the care of Roger Fouts who started out as a student of the Gardners'. Penny Patterson still has Koko the gorilla. But, by and large these projects have dipped below the radar of scientific publication \u2014 though they still appear with enthusiasm in the popular media. But one ape language project maintained its scientific respectability. Duane Rumbaugh's system, in which the chimpanzees communicated by pressing buttons on a keyboard, had always been subject to tighter experimental control than the ASL-based attempts at ape language. In 1974 Duane Rumbaugh had been joined in his project by Sue Savage, whom the New Yorker described in 1978 as \"a very pretty psychobiologist.\" [8](#note08) Duane and Sue had married a year earlier. In 1980 Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh started working with a new species of ape: bonobos \u2014 also known as pygmy chimpanzees. At this time, bonobos were almost entirely unstudied. They had only been recognized as a distinct species from chimps a few years earlier. Initial efforts with a mature female, Matata, were hopeless. But when they separated Matata from the adopted infant Kanzi who had been hanging onto her throughout her fruitless training, something very remarkable happened. According to Savage-Rumbaugh, the moment the special keyboard was set up in front of Kanzi to start his language training, he began using the signs on the keys to communicate. On the very first day he pressed twelve of the keys over 120 times. He asked for banana, juice, raisin, peanuts, chase, bite, tickle, orange, outdoors, swing, cherry, ball and sweet-potato. [9](#note09) There was even evidence that first day that Kanzi could combine signs meaningfully. He indicated raisin peanut and sweet-potato tickle and seemed grateful when given each of those things. Kanzi went on to master rapidly the 256 signs, which was the most that could be fitted conveniently onto a portable keyboard. The Rumbaughs reported that Kanzi learned language \"spontaneously\" without explicit training. His education in language was no more and no less than that customarily offered to young human beings. Although he communicated with the people around him by pressing keys on his keyboard, they customarily spoke to him in ordinary English. Starting in the mid 1980s the Rumbaughs started claiming that Kanzi had mastered the rudiments of grammar. [10](#note10) In a major study carried out when Kanzi was eight years old, his comprehension of over six hundred different sentences was tested. [11](#note11) An experimenter went behind a one-way mirror (so that she could not convey any nonverbal cues, such as eye movements, to Kanzi) and asked him to carry out a command. For example, Kanzi was asked to do such things as \"Go put some soap on Liz,\" \"Put on the monster mask and scare Linda,\" and to \"Take the mushrooms to Matata.\" As far as possible the experimenters tried to formulate commands that were unlikely to have previously arisen in Kanzi's daily life. [12](#note12) In a majority of cases Kanzi did as he was asked to do. Kanzi, concluded the Rumbaughs, \"clearly processed semantic and syntactic features of each novel utterance.\" In other words, here was a nonhuman ape who understood meaning and grammar. Descartes and Terrace were wrong. The grail of the ape language studies had been found. When I first heard of Kanzi's achievements I was very excited indeed. I really felt that our understanding of the nature of the world and our place in it as human beings had been altered by what this bonobo had done. But when I studied the complete report of what Kanzi had been asked to do and started going carefully through the six hundred and sixty commands he had been given and how he had responded to each one, my excitement changed to disappointment. For a start Kanzi \u2014 like Nim before him \u2014 did not show the increase in sentence length that is typical of children learning language. In fact, at 1.15 symbols per sentence, Kanzi's average utterance is even shorter than Nim's. And it turns out that to complete many of the requests that were put to him Kanzi did not need to understand grammar. For example when Kanzi was asked to \"Take the hat to the colony room\" \u2014 which Kanzi did successfully \u2014 all he needed was some sense of \"hat\" and of \"colony room.\" [14](#note14) A hat may be taken to a colony room, but a room cannot be brought to a hat. Successful completion of this instruction suggests an understanding of some vocabulary, but it is not in itself proof of grammatical comprehension. To test grammar what are needed are pairs of reversible commands like: \"Dog bites man\" and \"Man bites dog.\" Just knowing those three words \u2014 man, bites, and dog \u2014 is not enough to comprehend the difference between these two statements. For that difference to be understood grammar is crucial. Of the 660 commands that Kanzi was given, a mere 21 formed pairs of the \"man bites dog\" \"dog bites man\" variety that constitute a critical test of grammatical comprehension. Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues reported that Kanzi responded accurately to 12 of these 21 pairs \u2014 a modest 57% correct. On closer inspection, however, it became clear to me that their method of coding Kanzi's responses was unreasonably generous. To take one example: They commanded Kanzi, \"Pour the juice in the egg.\" Kanzi proceeded to pick up the bowl with the egg in it, sniff it, and shake it. They repeated the command three times \u2014 each time changing the wording slightly \u2014 before Kanzi did what they asked him to. They nonetheless scored his response as correct. When they asked Kanzi to \"Pour some water on the raisins,\" he held a jug of water over a lettuce. This was coded as correct. Kanzi's first reaction to the request to pour milk into water was to stick a tomato in the water. When asked to chase Liz he remained seated; when asked again he touched Liz's leg and she chased him. All of these were scored correct. When Kanzi was given the two commands, \"Make the [toy] doggie bite the [toy] snake\" and \"Make the snake bite the doggie,\" in both cases the snake ended up in the dog's mouth but both responses were coded as correct. Re-scored to exclude these false positives, Kanzi achieves less than 30% correct. Why be so nitpicky? The point here is not to deny Kanzi's achievements \u2014 what other nonhuman can convey so much to his caregivers, or understand so much of what they say to him? \u2014 but to quantify them correctly. The point is not to see whether Kanzi does something involving toy dogs and snakes when asked to \"Make the doggie bite the snake,\" but to see if he understands grammar. And, on any assessment not tinted with rose-colored glasses, Kanzi just doesn't get it. Kanzi has declined my requests for interviews. He did recently speak with John Berman of ABC's Nightline. Now 26 years old, and in language training for almost his entire life, this is how Kanzi conversed with to a box of candy). Berman averred: \"Moments like this are proof that these conversations help scientists learn about apes, from the apes themselves.\" I don't disagree, though I fear the conclusion I draw is not the one Berman intended. Moments like this tell us that Descartes was right, there really are no beasts, no matter how fortunately circumstanced, that can make known their thoughts through language. Next time you see Kanzi or one of his kind on a television documentary, turn down the sound so you can just watch what he is doing without interpretation from the ape's trainers. See if that really appears to be language. Somewhere in the history of our kind there must have been the first beings who could rearrange tokens to create new meanings, to distinguish Me Banana from Banana Me. But the evidence from many years of training apes to press buttons or sign in ASL, is that this must have happened sometime after we split off from chimps, bonobos, and gorillas. Since then we have been talking to ourselves.

How did the advent of Christianity change the DNA of humanity, and why Jews \u2014 the tiniest fraction of the world's population \u2014 score highest on intelligence tests and hold so many Nobel Prizes, why there are disproportionately so many more Jewish lawyers and doctors, and what the answers to such questions tell us about human nature and nurture. Entine vividly brings to life the profound human implications of the Age of Genetics, retelling the story of the Bible through the prism of DNA, while illuminating one of today's most controversial topics: the connection between genetics and identity. The focus of genome research has shifted from our shared humanity to human differences, and we are now confronted with questions once M.D. reviews Jerome Groopman's book [How Doctors Think ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0618610030?tag=skepticcom20-20&link_code=as3&creativeASIN=0618610030&creative=373489&camp=211189) (Houghton Mifflin, 2007, ISBN 0618610030). Dr. Hall, the SkeptDoc, is Skeptic magazine's resident expert on all matters medical. How the Medical Mind Works a book review by Harriet Hall, M.D. Jerome Groopman's book How Doctors Think is a superb commentary on the intersection between medical science, compassionate personal interactions, and critical thinking. My only caveat is that it may be exploited by \"doctor-bashers\" because it shows how doctors make mistakes; but the overall impact of the book is very positive. It is a good lesson in critical thinking about any subject, not just about medicine. It shows how people make up their minds and then resist changing them, twisting or disregarding subsequent evidence to make it fit their first hypothesis. It covers a number of other common mental foibles, illustrating them with memorable clinical vignettes. Groopman cites a recent study of 100 incorrect diagnoses: only four of them were due to inadequate medical knowledge; in the rest of the cases the doctors fell into cognitive traps. He targets errors that are particularly hazardous to doctors, such as poor communication with patients, buying into fad diagnoses, bowing to economic pressures, and succumbing to pharmaceutical company influences. Doctors may be well educated, but they are no less subject to the various cognitive biases that plague the rest of humanity, educated or not. Thus, Groopman offers several guidelines to improve performance: don't stop thinking after you reach a diagnosis; keep an open mind so you can reconsider if new data suggest another possibility; don't skip steps in a misguided attempt to spare your patient discomfort; guard against treating patients differently because of your own emotions or prejudices; listen to the patient's own story and make up your own mind rather than accepting the diagnosis of a previous doctor. Groopman also gives practical advice to patients so they can help their doctors think better. They can offer to tell their story again from scratch to allow a fresh reassessment. They can ask, \"What else could it be? Is there anything that doesn't fit? Is it possible I have more than one problem?\" If they have their own ideas about what might be wrong, or if they are worried about something the doctor hasn't mentioned, they should speak up. In the push towards evidence-based medicine, we encounter pitfalls. The evidence may have been derived from a group our patient doesn't belong to. The Women's Health Initiative showed that hormone replacement therapy did more harm than good, but it studied an older population: a later study on younger women showed that it did offer some benefits when used earlier in menopause. A treatment that is right for the \"average\" patient may not apply to the individual who falls on the end of the bell curve and has other co-existing health problems. This doesn't mean we can disregard the evidence-based consensus. It means we should take the patient's risk factors, concomitant illnesses, physiologic variants, current medications, allergies, life situation, personal preferences, etc. into account when choosing the best evidence-based option for that individual \u2014 not that we should exit the evidence-based playing field and try to invent a unique treatment for a unique patient using guesswork or intuition. Medicine is not an art, it's an applied science; we need to make sure we're applying it appropriately. There is a place for clinical intuition. In an emergency, we don't have the leisure to go through a lengthy process of weighing all the information \u2014 we have to make snap decisions to save lives. An experienced clinician may pick up on subtle clues he is not even conscious of. Of course, intuition can be misleading. Plus, medical science is messy. One clinical study is followed by another with a different conclusion. No test is 100% accurate. No treatment is guaranteed to work for every individual. Uncertainties abound. The public believes x-rays and biopsies give clear yes-or-no answers, but that is not the case. They depend on human perception, pattern-recognition, and interpretation. Pathologists and radiologists often disagree with each other and even with themselves (in repeat readings). A radiologist who has recently missed a breast cancer is likely to over-read future mammograms in compensation. Computer-aided diagnosis may improve cancer detection but in one study it persuaded radiologists to change 10% of their correct readings to incorrect ones! Groopman criticizes the current batch of medical students for relying too heavily on algorithms. \"Clinical algorithms can be useful for run-of-the-mill diagnosis and treatment \u2014 distinguishing strep throat from viral pharyngitis, for example. But they quickly fall apart when a doctor needs to think outside their boxes, when symptoms are vague, or multiple and confusing, or when test results are inexact.\" On the other hand, he shows how doctors can make mistakes by not following appropriate algorithms because they think their patient is unique and they can do better. All too often there is no algorithm, no clear evidence-based guidance, and the doctor must make a difficult decision based on inadequate knowledge. Groopman illustrates the soul-searching, self-doubting worries that all good clinicians struggle with. How can we know we did the \"right\" thing if there is no \"right\" thing? Groopman says, \"Statistics embody averages, not individuals.\" The average benefit of mammography may be less than the benefit to a woman with previous breast biopsies, a family history of breast cancer, and several other risk factors. In cancer, the evidence may show that chemotherapy improves survival on average; but it's a gamble because it doesn't help everyone and may shorten survival for a few. There are other considerations such as side effects, quality of life, and limitations on lifestyle. Given the same information, one patient may choose chemotherapy while another chooses no treatment, and a good doctor tries to understand and support either choice. I was so impressed by How Doctors Think that I went on to read Groopman's previous book, The Anatomy of Hope. I was even more impressed by that one. He describes his experiences as an oncologist, showing how false hope can be damaging but how there can always be real hope based on coping with reality. He tells the stories of patients who refused chemotherapy and about one who demanded even more chemo than his doctors recommended; and he helps the reader understand the thought processes involved. One woman refused treatment because she thought the cancer was her punishment for sins she had committed, one man had watched a friend die of another cancer and mistakenly thought his own (curable) cancer was the same thing. He shows how patients can live worthwhile lives \"with\" cancer, even when it can't be cured. If there isn't hope of cure, there is always hope of a better life while life lasts. I wish everyone who treats cancer, has cancer, or knows someone who has cancer could read this book. One of the stories in The Anatomy of Hope is Groopman's own story. He had a ruptured disc, failed surgery, and chronic back pain that limited his activities severely for 19 years. Finally he ran into a rehabilitation specialist who convinced him that the pain didn't mean what he thought it meant. He had been avoiding any pain-inducing activities on the assumption that it was telling him his body would be harmed by those activities. He re-conceptualized the pain as meaning that he was so de-conditioned that his body had been trained to irrationally protest at normal, safe activities. With an intensive training program, he was able to build up his muscle strength and mobility again and he now leads a normal life and is pain-free. This is a great example of how the mind influences recovery. Not woo-woo thought transfer or mind-over-matter, but proper reality-based thinking about symptoms that can facilitate appropriate treatment. Groopman is a wise old soul. If every evidence-based medical doctor applied real science with his kind of judgment and compassion, alternative medicine might curl up and die. Shermer on CNN's Glenn Beck show on 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Last Friday night Bill Maher's HBO series was disrupted by a gaggle of obnoxiously loud 9/11 conspiracy theory \"truthers\" (as they like to call themselves), resulting in Bill charging up the aisle himself to throw them out of the studio. Last night I appeared on CNN's Glenn Beck show to discuss and debunk. [WATCH the video >](https://screwloosechange.blogspot.com/2007/10/glenn-beck-on-bill-maher-hecklers.html) Debate: Michael Shermer v. Dinesh D'Souza Oregon State University, October 15, 2007 After watching my debate with Dinesh D'Souza last week I would be interested in your comments and constructive criticisms because Dinesh and I will be debating a similar but broader topic in December at Caltech ( [\"Is Religion a Force for Good or Evil? & Can you be Good without God?\"]December 9, Beckman Auditorium, tickets available at the Caltech Public Events Office at 626-395-4652 or toll free at 888-222-5832). Please email your comments to me at [mshermer@skeptic.com]. Below are a few of my notes used during the debate. Most of the studies I reference about how atheists are just as moral as theists come from my book The Science of Good and Evil. The more recent studies are reported in either Skeptic magazine or in my Skeptic column in Scientific American. I had 25 minutes to cover five points. Is Christianity Good for the World? notes from Michael Shermer 1. What Are We Debating? \"Is Christianity Good for the World?\" The answer is obvious: It Depends! Religion is so complex, so all-encompassing, so sweeping and culturally enveloping that it would be absurdly simplistic to offer a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, comparable to asking \"Is government good for the world?\" Religion is good when it does good, and bad when it does bad. Christianity reminds me of Winston Churchill's comment about Americans: \"You can always count on Americans to do the right thing... after they've tried everything else.\" Well, you can always count on Christians to do the right thing...after they have tried everything else.\" 2. Which Christianity? Good for Whom? Which Christianity? (Catholic, Protestant, Evangelical, Mormon, Episcopalian, Pentecostal?) 33,800 different Christian denominations worldwide. Which is the right one? Good for whom? Individuals, communities, society? - Protestant Christians determined to murder Catholic Christians over turf in Northern Ireland? Not good. - Mormon Christians who belong to the fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who believe that is acceptable to force 13-year old girls to have sex with men five times their age? Not Good. - Pentecostal Christians who indoctrinate young children at Jesus camps into becoming warriors for Christ who are willing to kill for their lord? Not good. - Evangelical Christians who believe so strongly in the sanctity of life that they blow up abortion clinics and kill doctors? Not good. - Catholic Christians whose Priestly pedophile program of, in the words of Christopher Hitchens, \"No Child's Behind Left\"? Not good. 3. Gay Marriage & Homosexuality as a Case Study The issue of Gay marriage in particular and homosexuality in general is a case study in what is wrong with religion, especially Christianity. The overwhelming evidence from science shows that gender preference is primarily determined by our genetics and prenatal biochemistry, especially embryological hormone balance. Almost everyone is born attracted to members of the opposite sex. A tiny percentage \u2014 perhaps as few as one to two percent \u2014 are attracted to members of the same sex. Asking a homosexual when he or she chose to become gay is like asking a heterosexual when he or she chose to become straight. Nevertheless, on this particular issue Christianity remains mired in pre-civil rights, pre-enlightenment, even pre-scientific thinking, basing their beliefs on a single biblical passage (Leviticus 18:22: \"Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination\") that itself is tucked in between other passages that instruct parents to kill their disobedient children and to execute adulterous wives and nonvirgin brides. That's right, the death penalty for adultery, which would immediately eliminate a good number of Christian Congressmen and Senators, preachers and televangelists. As a consequence of this embarrassing lapse of Christian charity, Christian preachers, writers, and theologians think nothing of tormenting gays by telling them that their desire to love another person of the same sex is an \"abomination,\" by telling them that they have a disease that can be \"cured\" through \"treatment\" (such as forcing gay guys to watch football games), and by telling them that promiscuity is evil but that the single best prophylactic against it \u2014 marriage \u2014 is legally banned from them. Christians actually believe they are being charitable by proclaiming that they \"hate the sin, not the sinner,\" which is not dissimilar to what Christians declared just before torching women for allegedly practicing witchcraft in order to save their souls, or when Christians called for pogroms against Jews for being Christ-killers. (May I point out that if Jesus had to die for our sins, that means someone had to kill him, and therefore that someone should be thanked, not persecuted and murdered.) Mark my words. Here is what is going to happen. Within a decade, maybe two or three, Christians will come around to treating gays no differently than they now treat other groups whom they previously persecuted \u2014 women, Jews, blacks \u2014 but not because of some new interpretation of a biblical passage, or because of a new revelation from God. These changes will come about the same way that they always do: by the oppressed minority fighting for the right to be treated equally, and by a few enlightened members of the oppressing majority supporting their cause. Then what will happen is that Christians will take credit for the civil liberation of gays, dig through the historical record and fine a few Christian bloggers or preachers who had the courage and the character to stand up for Gay rights when their fellow Christians would not, and then cite those as evidence that were it not for Christianity gays would not be equal. 4. Religion and Societal Morality In a 2005 study published in the Journal of Religion and Society, independent scholar Gregory S. Paul found an inverse correlation between religiosity (measured by belief in God, biblical literalism, and frequency of prayer and service attendance) and societal health (measured by rates of homicide, suicide, childhood mortality, life expectancy, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, and teen pregnancy) in 18 developed democracies. \"In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies,\" Paul found. \"The United States is almost always the most dysfunctional of the developed democracies, sometimes spectacularly so.\" Indeed, the U.S. scores the highest in religiosity and the highest (by far) in homicides, STDs, abortions, and teen pregnancies. Conservative Christians, of course, will blame secular liberals for all these societal ills, but with over 90 percent of Americans proclaiming themselves to be Christians, and the country roughly split 50/50 between conservatives and liberals, this does not add up. 5. Religion and Individual Morality In 1934, Abraham Franzblau found a negative correlation between acceptance of religious beliefs and three different measures of honesty. As religiosity increased, honesty decreased. In 1950, Murray Ross conducted a survey among 2,000 associates of the YMCA and discovered that agnostics and atheists were more likely to express their willingness to aid the poor than those who rated themselves as deeply religious. In 1969, sociologists Travis Hirschi and Rodney Stark reported no difference in the self-reported likelihood to commit crimes between children who attended church regularly and those who did not. In 1975, Ronald Smith, Gregory Wheeler, and Edward Diener discovered that college-aged students in religious schools were no less likely to cheat on a test than their atheist and agnostic counterparts in nonreligious schools. In 1996 George Barna, a born-again Evangelical Christian, in his Index of Leading Spiritual Indicators, based on interviews with nearly 4,000 adult Americans, revealed: \"Born again Christians continue to have a higher likelihood of getting divorced than do non-Christians.\" And: \"Atheists are less likely to get divorced than are born-again Christians.\" Barna found that the current divorce rate for born-again Christians is 27 percent, while it is only 24 percent for non-Christians. In addition, the Baby Boomers \u2014 that generation often criticized for sexual indulgence and moral relativism \u2014 has a lower rate of divorce (34 percent) than the preceding generation (portrayed in popular culture as the idealized 1950's Ozzie and Harriet family), who hover at 37 percent. Five years later, in a 2001 survey, Barna found that \"33 percent of all born again individuals who have been married have gone through a divorce, which is statistically identical to the 34 percent incidence among non-born again adults.\" The July/August 2007 issue of the Annals of Family Medicine published the results of a study conducted by researchers from the University of Chicago and Yale New Haven Hospital that religious doctors were no more likely (and even slightly less likely) to employ their craft among underserved patients than were physicians with no religious affiliation. Specifically, Farr Curlin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago and his colleagues surveyed 1,820 practicing physicians from all specialties: 31% of physicians who were more religious practiced medicine among the underserved, compared to 35% of atheist, agnostic, and nonreligious doctors. Religiosity was measured by religious service attendance and self-reported \"intrinsic religiosity\" questions that measured the extent to which individuals embrace their religion as the \"master motive that guides and gives meaning to their life.\" Curlin noted his own response to the data: \"This came as both a surprise and a disappointment. The Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist scriptures all urge physicians to care for the poor, and the great majority of religious physicians describe their practice of medicine as a calling. Yet we found that religious physicians were not more likely to report practice among the underserved than their secular colleagues.\" The key to understanding who helps the needy the most was spirituality, not religiosity. According to Curlin, those who identified themselves as very spiritual, whether or not they were religious, were roughly twice as likely to care for the underserved as those who described their spirituality as low. \"Part of this divergence between religion and spirituality can be traced to a rift between Christian denominations in the late-19th and early-20th centuries,\" Curlin concluded. About a century ago, he noted, many of the mainline and liberal Protestant churches began \"to emphasize efforts to right social injustices, while the more conservative churches tended to stress doctrinal orthodoxy. Research indicates that those who consider themselves spiritual but not so religious are more likely to be formed in the more liberal denominations.\" Curlin added that he is an orthodox Christian in the Protestant tradition. Conclusion Absolute morality leads logically to absolute intolerance. Once you believe that you have the absolute and final answers to moral questions, why be tolerant of those who refuse to accept your Truth? Religiously based moral systems apply this principle in spades. From the medieval Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition to the Holocaust and Bosnia, history is rife with examples of intolerance. In the name of their religion, people have lighted faggots to burn women accused of witchcraft. In the name of God, religious people have sanctioned slavery, anti-Semitism, racism, homophobia, torture, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and war. Not only does religion not necessarily make one more moral, it can lead to greater intolerance, racism, sexism, and the erosion of other values cherished in a free and democratic society. Why Darwin Matters in paperback now available at Shop Skeptic Evolution happened, and the theory describing it is one of the most well founded in all of science. Then why do half of all Americans reject it? In Why Darwin Matters, historian of science and bestselling author Michael Shermer defuses these fears by examining what evolution really is, how we know it happened, and how to test it. Shermer then discusses what science is through a brief history of the evolution-creation controversy from the Scopes \"Monkey\" trial of 1925, through the U.S. Supreme Court case of 1987, to the ongoing trials today, demonstrating clearly how and why creationism and Intelligent Design theory are 07-10-17 the new issue of Skeptic magazine featuring a special section on Medical Controversies - Do Vaccines Cause Autism?

Two Views, One Reality book reviews by Jason Rosenhouse Modern biology tells a story of human beings emerging as the highly contingent result of four billion years of evolution by natural selection. Christianity teaches that the Earth was created by an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God specifically for humans. Francisco Ayala argues that it is reasonable to see in this dichotomy two sides of the same coin. Phillip Kitcher demurs. A glut of recent books has addressed the perennial question of the proper relationship between evolution and Christianity. Whether written by scientists such as Ken Miller, Francis Collins and Joan Roughgarden, or theologians such as Alister McGrath or John Haught, the conclusion is invariably the same. No conflict is found. Several gambits are offered to attain this reconciliation: perhaps evolution is God's means of creation, the creation story in Genesis is intended allegorically, or science and religion address different questions. Representative of this genre is Ayala's short book. He opens as follows: The message that this little book seeks to convey is that science and religious beliefs need not be in contradiction. This message has a long Christian tradition that extends since the time of Augustine in the fourth century, and even earlier, to Pope John Paul II and other religious authorities of the present. There are many believers in the United States and elsewhere who think that science, particularly the theory of evolution, is contrary to the teachings of the Bible and to religious beliefs, such as Creation by God. Science has demonstrated again and again, beyond reasonable doubt, that living organisms evolve and diversify over time, and that their features have come about by natural selection, a process that accounts for their \"design.\" I will seek to convince you, dear reader, that we may accept the scientific knowledge without denying the existence of God or God's presence in the universe and all natural phenomena. After such an opening, you might be surprised to learn that fully 89 of the book's 104 pages say almost nothing about the reconciliation of science with faith. Instead we are treated to a brief historical introduction to Darwin and his work, a lucid explanation of the most basic elements of evolutionary theory and the evidence supporting it, and a brief discussion of the scientific and theological difficulties of intelligent design and creationism. This portion of the book is certainly competent and worthwhile, but it contains very little that is new. It is the book's final chapter that addresses the faith question. Ayala opens with this bit of bravado: I want to make in this final chapter two main points, which to me seem obvious or at least beyond reasonable doubt. One point is that the theory of evolution is not incompatible with belief in the existence of God and God's presence in the workings of the universe. The second point is that science is a powerful and successful way of acquiring knowledge about the universe, but it is not the only way: other valid ways of acquiring knowledge about the universe include imaginative literature and other forms of art, common sense, philosophy and religion. Obvious? Beyond reasonable doubt? How does the author back up his claim? Ayala first addresses the conflict between evolution and Genesis. He argues that numerous religious scholars reject the idea of a literal interpretation of Genesis. Many Bible scholars and theologians have long rejected a literal interpretation as untenable, however, because the Bible contains incompatible statements. The very beginning of Genesis presents two different creation narratives. Extending through chapter 1 and the first verses of chapter 2 is the familiar six-day narrative, in which God creates human beings \u2014 both male and female \u2014 in his own image on the sixth day, after creating light, earth, firmament, fish, fowl, and cattle. But in verse 4 of chapter 2 a different narrative starts, in which God creates a male human, then plants a garden and creates animals, and only then proceeds to take a rib from the man to make a woman. Ayala endorses the position of Pope John Paul II that the Genesis story is intended not as a scientific treatise on the origin of the universe, but rather as a declaration of God's sovereignty over his creation. We can certainly agree with Ayala that these are common sentiments among Christians. But you cannot reconcile evolution with Christianity simply by declaring that many people see no conflict. The issue is whether they have a sound basis for their opinions. The problem, as many creationists are keen to note, is that Genesis does not read like an allegory; it reads like history. It is an unambiguous accounting of a specific sequence of actions taken by God. A sequence, incidentally, that conflicts with the scientific account at nearly every turn. Why would a story teaching something as simple as God's sovereignty be told via a fictitious sequence of events? That aside, this is hardly the main front in the battle between science and faith. How does Ayala presume to explain why an all-loving, all-powerful God creates via such cruelty as found in nature? He does not even try. After his catalog of banalities about dismissing Genesis as an allegory, Ayala provides a brief history of the legal conflicts over the teaching of evolution in public schools, and closes with some familiar sentiments about science being only methodologically, and not metaphysically, materialistic. These are worthy sentiments to be sure, but they have little relevance to the main issue. Reconciling evolution and Christianity is more difficult than Ayala seems willing to admit. One person who is not so reticent in that regard is Columbia University philosopher Phillip Kitcher, who writes in his book on the same topic: They recognize that the Darwinian picture of life is at odds with a particular kind of religion, providentialist religion, as I shall call it. A large number of Christians, not merely those who maintain that virtually all of the Bible must be read literally, are providentialists. For they believe that the universe has been created by a Being who has a great design, a Being who cares for his creatures, who observes the fall of every sparrow and who is especially concerned with humanity. Yet the story of a wise and loving Creator who has planned life on earth, letting it unfold over four billion years by the processes envisaged in evolutionary theory, is hard to sustain when you think about the details. And later in the book: The general inefficiency of the processes, the extreme length of time, the haphazard sequence of environments, the undirected variations, the cruel competition through which selection so frequently works, is all foreseen. And the individual nastinesses to which Darwin points are expected outcomes of deploying these sorts of processes. If we search the creation for clues to the character of the Creator, a judgment of whimsy is a relatively kind one. For we easily might take life as it has been generated on our planet as the handiwork of a bungling, or a chillingly indifferent, god. Kitcher goes on to consider, and find wanting, various attempts to salvage providentialist religion from the jaws of the enlightenment. He suggests the possibility of \"spiritual religion,\" in which belief in the supernatural is discarded in favor of recognizing the moral vision to be gained from holy texts. Alas, he is quite right to suggest that it is unclear how such a religion differs in any substantial way from plain, vanilla secular humanism. This is a far harder line than the one taken by Kitcher in his earlier anti-creationist book Abusing Science, in which he hewed closely to the Ayala line that Genesis is an allegory and that there is no cause for Christians to feel threatened by evolution. In the present book Kitcher bluntly admits the relative hardening of his views. Like Ayala, Kitcher postpones to the final chapter his discussions of evolution and Christian faith. Also like Ayala, Kitcher discusses the nature of and the case for evolution, and discusses some of the major arguments offered by creationists and ID proponents. Kitcher provides considerably more detail than Ayala, but, once again, readers with experience in this subject are unlikely to find anything new. I can recommend both of these books to people looking for a fast overview of the basic issues. Though Ayala has not adequately considered the full force of the scientific case against religious faith, the remainder of his short book is admirably clear and readable. Kitcher deserves credit not only for his forthright consideration of the difficulties posed to traditional religion by modern science, but also for his blunt, and in my view correct, conclusion that the difficulties are insurmountable without fundamentally altering the nature of Christian faith. Disputes over the scientific legitimacy and religious implications of evolution frequently take place in the context of school board disputes. There is much grassroots sympathy for teaching some form of creationism in public schools as a legitimate scientific alternative to evolution. Crucial to resisting such efforts is the enlistment of religious people who have made their peace with what evolution is telling us. In that light, many on the pro-science side are critical of people like Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and now Phillip Kitcher, who state bluntly that evolution and religion are not so easily reconciled. This presents a problem. In terms of political tactics, the critics have a point. Most Americans believe in God, and alienating them by stressing the conflict between evolution and religion hardly seems like a wise method of protecting decent science education. The only thing the anti-reconcilers have going for them is that all the really good arguments are on their side. I regret that I lack a clever resolution to this impasse. In the end, however, the truth ought to count for something. Perhaps the time has come to stop worrying about political tactics and to worry instead about making the best arguments we can. After all, evolution is already marginalized in many school districts and large majorities support introducing creationism in some form. Are we really worried that some sharp rhetoric from the academic community is going to make things worse? Polygraph and Lie Detection, Part 2 Can the polygraph machine really scientifically measure if someone is lying, or are all those graphs and numbers just pseudoscience in the service of law enforcement? Can we tell if someone is lying to us by their body language or facial expressions?

Abraham's Children: Race, Identity & the DNA of the Chosen People with Dr. Jon Entine Sunday, October 28th, 2pm Baxter Lecture Hall, Caltech The author of the highly acclaimed and controversial book, Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It, investigative journalist Jon Entine, in his new book Abraham's Children, attempts to answer new taboo topics, such as: Did Moses really live? What was the real fate of the Lost Tribes? How did the advent of Christianity change the DNA of humanity, and why Jews \u2014 the tiniest fraction of the world's population \u2014 score highest on intelligence tests and hold so many Nobel Prizes, why there are disproportionately so many more Jewish lawyers and doctors, and what the answers to such questions tell us about human nature and nurture. Entine vividly brings to life the profound human implications of the Age of Genetics, retelling the story of the Bible through the prism of DNA, while illuminating one of today's most controversial topics: the connection between genetics and identity. The focus of genome research has shifted from our shared humanity to human differences, and we are now confronted with questions once considered taboo.

Girl Power This week Skepticality has a double bill of brainy, beautiful skeptics working to educate the public about the benefits of science and evidence-based reasoning. Astrophysicist Dr. Pamela Gay (of the [Astronomy Cast](http://www.astronomycast.com/about/) podcast) and Private Investigator Alison Smith (the founder of the [Skeptical Analysis of the Paranormal Society](http://www.skepticalanalysis.com/)) discuss their work and share their thoughts about the recent lectures they gave at Dragon*Con 2007 (as part of the Space, Science and Skepticism programs) \u2014 lectures that helped introduce skeptical investigation to a new kind of audience. Also, Derek & Swoopy release the full length video from Dragon*Con's \"Skeptic Smackdown\" debate, featuring skeptics Michael Shermer and Alison Smith, and paranormal proponents Patrick Burns and Graham Watkins. In this week's eSkeptic James N. Gardner reviews Janet Browne's book entitled [Darwin's Origin of Species: A Biography ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871139537?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0871139537) (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2007, ISBN 0871139537). James N. Gardner is an Oregon attorney and the author, most recently, of [ The Intelligent Universe: AI, ET, and the Emerging Mind of the Cosmos](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1564149196?ie=UTF8&tag=skepticcom20-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1564149196). The Origin of the Origin a book review by James N. Gardner Of all the world-changing books in the scientific canon, only Charles Darwin's Origin of Species is fully accessible to the lay reader. There are several reasons for this, all closely related. First, the language of physical science has always been mathematics. Isaac Newton could never have formulated a precise description of the phenomenon of gravitation absent the tools supplied by calculus \u2014 a field of mathematics that he invented for the express purpose of presenting his ideas adequately. By contrast, the language of evolutionary biology, at least in Darwin's era, was the vocabulary of everyday life \u2014 birth and death, success and failure, survival and extinction. Second, Darwin was a gifted verbal artist; there are passages in The Origin of Species that shimmer with clarity and resound with grandeur. Third, the key rhetorical tool deployed by Darwin in his masterpiece was metaphor. The Malthusian struggle for survival in human society metaphorically represented the struggle to survive endured by every creature that every walked, flew, slithered, or swam on planet Earth. Moreover, the practice of artificial selection \u2014 the process by which farmers and breeders over countless generations have molded, as if from living clay, nearly endless forms of canines and bovines as well as grasses and vegetables bred to satisfy human nutritional needs \u2014 became a symbol for natural selection, which is the process at the heart of Darwin's theory. So it is scarcely surprising that The Origin of Species is uniquely accessible to non-scientists: it is nothing less than a metaphorical retelling of the human story, rendered on the vast canvas of the entire biosphere. Janet Browne, Darwin's foremost living biographer, appropriately begins her slim and tightly written volume by celebrating this unique feature of Darwin's memorable book: Charles Darwin's Origin of Species is surely one of the greatest scientific books ever written. Yet it does not fit the usual stereotype of what we nowadays expect science to be. It is wonderfully personal in style. It has no graphs or maths, no specialized language. Amid the flood of books about Darwin that continue to spout forth unabated from scholarly and popular presses, Darwin's Origin of Species stands out for reasons that bear a remarkable resemblance to the factors distinguishing Darwin's own contribution from those of more typical scientists. First, Browne's book is clear and artful. It reads like a compelling mystery \u2014 indeed, it draws us into the compelling mystery of speciation that captivated Darwin. It highlights Darwin's personality as well as his scientific genius \u2014 just as Darwin infused his own treatise with personal musings and reflections. And it adheres tightly to its topic \u2014 the story of this one extraordinary book \u2014 just as Darwin focused relentlessly on the theme of speciation through natural selection while eschewing speculation on broader topics. As Bowne puts it: The ... scope [of The Origin of Species is limited] to one restricted problem and [does] not deal with the grand questions of the evolution of the universe, the first sparks of life or the future of the human mind. The Origin of Species was revolutionary because it reconceived what had previously been understood exclusively in religious terms \u2014 the creation of endless diversity in the living domain \u2014 in a thoroughly secular and naturalistic way (which is why the book remains deeply offensive within certain quarters of the religious community). But Darwin's scientific insights could never have achieved the monumental impact chronicled by Browne were it not for the broad accessibility of The Origin of Species. As she puts it: It was one of the first genuinely public debates about science to stretch across general society. [The] varied response, evocative of the cultural diversity of the nineteenth century, remind us that the introduction of new ideas is rarely straightforward and that the past histories of science have involved many different forms of publication, many different audiences and many different languages as well as the ideas themselves.

The author of the bestselling books The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works and Blank Slate, Pinker reveals how our use of prepositions and tenses taps into peculiarly human concepts of space and time, and how our nouns and verbs speak to our notions of matter. Even the name we give our babies have important things to say about our relations to our children and society. Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. In 2006, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most important people in the world. He conducts research on language and cognition, writes for publications such as the New York Times, Time, and Slate, and is the author of numerous scientific papers and 07-09-26 To Boldly Go Where Few Skeptics Have Gone Before It seems for any particular social or interest group, there is a convention \u2014 including skepticism. The danger is that niche meetings may speak best to those who have already heard the message. For over a decade, Dragon*Con (based in Atlanta, Georgia) has been integrating factual science and space programming with science fiction material from popular literature, film, television and gaming (such as Star Wars and Star Trek). This year, Skepticality's Derek & Swoopy worked alongside the directors of Dragon*Con's Space and Science content to bring a contingent of notable skeptics to the world's largest culture convention. On this week's episode of Skepticality, Jeff Wagg (general manager of the [James Randi Educational Foundation](http://www.randi.org/)) and musician and skeptic George Hrab share their Dragon*Con experiences \u2014 and discuss how skeptics can promote their views at conventions to help the skeptical movement find a broader audience. In this week's eSkeptic Angelo Stagnaro reviews [Paranormal Claims: A Critical Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761837728/skepticcom20-20/104-6491725-8322313?creative=125581&camp=2321&link_code=as1) (University Press of America, 2007, ISBN 0761837728), edited by Bryan Farha with a foreword by Michael Shermer. Angelo Stagnaro (\"Erasmus\") performs as a stage mentalist and divides his time between Europe and North America. He has authored six books on mentalism/cold reading including Conspiracy, Something from Nothing and The Other Side. His upcoming book on psychic and occult charlatanism is due to be released in late 2007. Paranormal Claims a book review by Angelo Stagnaro Paranormal Claims is a collection of classic articles written by the pioneers of the critical thinking and debunking communities. Bryan Farha, the editor of this collection, is Professor of Behavioral Studies in Education at Oklahoma City University and a scientific and technical consultant to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and a consulting editor for The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice. Considering the recent onslaught of pseudoscientific, pseudoreligious and pseudomystical nonsense in our bookstores and television, this book is a refreshingly logical breath of fresh air. Coincidently, the day I received this book in the mail, a friend alerted me to the imminent publication of the most self-serving and self-congratulatory piece of twaddle I'd ever come across. The author chronicled the \"channeled conversations\" of twenty long since dead celebrities in what I can only describe as an afterlife version of a supermarket tabloid; an \"after-loid,\" if you will. If I might quote Carl Sagan's article, \"The Fine Art of Baloney Detection,\" which sets the tone for Farha's book: How is it, I ask myself, that channelers never give us verifiable information otherwise unavailable? Why does Alexander the Great never tell us about the exact location of his tomb, Fermat about his Last Theorem, John Wilkes Booth about the Lincoln assassination conspiracy, Hermann Goring about the Reichstag fire? Why don't Sophocles, Democritus and Aristarchus dictate their lost books? Don't they wish future generations to have access to their masterpieces? In contrast to sensationalist drivel, Bryan Farha's book is a compilation of serious, scientifically and logically grounded articles; balm for the mind. The importance of this book should not be underestimated. It's a concise vade mecum in our struggles against those who refuse to see logic. Those who falsely claim the mantle of science, religion and/or mysticism in order to intentionally dupe others for personal gain. The critical thinking articles contained in this book outline arguments designed to confound and refute the exaggerated claims of cryptozoologists, ufologists, astrologers, psychics, medical charlatans, numerologists and other clerics of occultism. In the struggle to help bring about clarity of thought to the unwilling or incapable, this informative and convenient collection of the most important articles in critical thinking serves as a refresher to those who hope to debunk charlatanism and junk science. For those unfamiliar with some of these articles, this collection is a good introduction to the topic. Ray Hyman's classic article on cold reading, \"How to Convince Strangers You Know All About Them\" is one of my favorite pieces in the collection. It's not always easy to find classic articles on critical thinking. Considering my own recent misadventures in searching for such articles, I'm grateful for this collection. Admittedly, it would have been wonderful to have included an article by Martin Gardner, the gray eminence of the critical thinking community, but this anthology easily stands upon its own merits with contributions from scholars including Susan Blackmore, Michael Shermer, Stephen Barrett, and Geoffrey Dean. The editor includes three of his own articles and several more from James Randi. lecture reminder The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature with Dr. Steven Pinker Sunday, September 30th, 2pm Beckman Auditorium, Caltech One of the most influential thinkers of our time, Dr. Steven Pinker marries two of the subjects he knows best \u2014 language and human nature \u2014 into his new book on how words can help explain our "}
