This day was created by the AVMA (America Veterinary Medical Association) to educate cat lovers on the importance of regular wellness exams to help ensure your furry friend has a long, happy and healthy life. Did you know that 83% of cats visit the veterinarian before their 1st birthday, but over 50% don't return until they become sick or are in pain? It seems hard to believe, but according to the American Humane Society, cats go to the veterinarian only half as often as dogs. So why aren't people taking their cats to the veterinarian for routine care? We believe it is because for so many cats - and for their people - a veterinary visit is frightening and stressful. But it doesn't have to be! [Click here](https://sierraanimalwellnesscenter.com/resources/cats-reduce-stress-veterinary-visit/) for a number of manageable ways to make the vet visit easier and less stressful for both of you. And now that you know how to make a visit easier on both of you, here are the Top Five Reasons for a Routine Wellness Exam: 1. Preventive care is better than reactive care. With regular exams, Dr. Peggy or your regular veterinarian can often detect diseases and conditions that may affect your cat's health long before they become significant, painful, or more costly to treat. 2. Cats age much more rapidly than humans. Your cat will reach the equivalent of the human age of 15 during its first year of life and the equivalent of 24 by its 2nd birthday. Each year after, your kitty ages the equivalent of 4 years for every calendar year, so your 8 year-old cat would be 48 in human years. Annual veterinary care is crucial because a lot can happen in 4 cat years. 3. Cats are masters at hiding pain and illness. Veterinarians are trained to spot these signs and may detect a problem long before you may notice it. Early detection and treatment can often save your furry friend pain and discomfort. 4. Your cat may be overweight. Over 50% of cats are overweight or obese! Did you know that just 3 extra pounds can put cats at risk for diabetes, heart, respiratory, kidney disease and more? This is not the blame game! It's easy for us not to notice the pounds sneaking up when we see our cats every day, but Dr. Peggy can assess your feline's weight and make recommendations to help achieve his or her ideal weight. 5. Have you noticed any behavior changes? Make a list of information, concerns and questions to share with Dr. Peggy. Changes in eating patterns, weight, activity levels, interaction with other pets or with you, litter box use and other behavioral changes may seem subtle or minor but these subtle changes may help to uncover hidden physical issues.
