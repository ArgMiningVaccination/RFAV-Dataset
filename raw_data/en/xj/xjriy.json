Introduction and Background The following document outlines a stakeholder engagement plan for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Bio and AgroDefense Facility (NBAF). NBAF will be a stateoftheart integrated facility designed to protect the United States' agricultural economy, food supply, and public health from natural outbreaks or intentional introductions of foreign animal, emerging, and zoonotic (transmitted from animals to humans) diseases. DHS recognizes the need for comprehensive engagement plan to keep stakeholders informed as NBAF moves forward through design, construction, commissioning, and operation stages. DHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) (as the tenant research entities) are committed to transparency, open communication with stakeholders, and responding to stakeholder inquiries/concerns in a timely manner. As with any highcontainment laboratory, the study of highconsequence pathogens is not without risk. DHS is committed to mitigating these risks through comprehensive threat and risk analyses that will inform NBAF design, construction, and operation. Because public perception of these risks will be influenced by communications and outreach strategies, DHS will outline plans for risk communication as a part of the overall risk management strategy for NBAF. The purpose of the risk communication will be to educate and inform the public regarding risks and to inform the public in the highly unlikely event of an incident. To facilitate open communication and transparency, DHS has prepared this stakeholder engagement plan as a dynamic document that will evolve with NBAF to guide efforts to provide consistent, timely and useful information. This plan draws upon stakeholder engagement best practices gathered from the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) and other biocontainment laboratories, and builds on previous stakeholder engagement activities undertaken during the NBAF Site Selection EIS process. The plan also outlines a preliminary risk communication strategy that will be implemented when NBAF becomes fully operational in FY 2018. This stakeholder engagement plan will be reviewed at least annually and will be updated as needed. 2. Objectives To ensure open communication and transparency with stakeholders, the primary objectives of this plan are to: Identify the appropriate stakeholders and specifi c activities, avenues, and venues to keep them engaged and informed. Establish public confidence in the NBAF project by facilitating continual dialogue among stakeholders, and DHS, and USDA (ARS and APHIS). October 2010 A7 NBAF SSRA Report Proactively establish channels of communication (e.g. a Stakeholder Engagement Committee, regular meetings, a website) for th is dialogue in order to disseminate information and gather feedback throughout the design, construction, and operation of NBAF. Specifically engage the local Manhattan, KS community to earn public trust. Outline preliminary risk communication strategies for NBAF. 3. Lead Agency and Activity Coordination As the owner of NBAF, DHS is responsible for the planning, construction, and operation. As such, DHS will work with federal partners and other involved organizations to coordinate stakeholder engagement activities. Specifically, the DHS Office of National Laboratories (ONL) within the Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate will take the lead on stakeholder activity coordination. The Director of ONL will work with senior DHS officials to answer questions regarding NBAF. ONL will be responsible for the primary information materials for NBAF, and will update and disseminate new information as it becomes available. 4. NBAF Stakeholders - Definition For the purposes of the NBAF project, the term \"stakeholder\" is defined as any person or organization potentially affected by the planning, construction, and operation of NBAF, interested in the issues of biological and agricultural safety relative to current and emerging foreign animal diseases (FADs), or interested in business or research opportunities at NBAF. Currently, identified stakeholders include: The local community of Manhattan, KS, Kansas State University (K-State) and the Heartland BioAgro Consortium (HBAC) Private sector, non-profit, non-governme ntal organizations, and academia DHS, USDA and other Federal agencies State and local government Congress General public 5. Specific Stakeholder Engagement Activities and Action Plans The following is a breakdown of the specific engagement activities and action plans that DHS intends to undertake with various NBAF stakeholders. The following activities incorporate many of the best practices of other high containment laboratories. The overall purpose of these activities is to increase October 2010 A8 NBAF SSRA Report public confidence by establishing a continual and open dialogue between DHS and stakeholders to inform, engage, and answer questions. 5.1 - The Local Community of Manh attan, KS, K-State, and HBAC The members of the local community of Manhattan, KS are important to the success of NBAF. A strong community engagement program is the best method to inform the public, gain feedback, and develop/maintain the facility's reputation for public accountability, safety and trustworthiness. Through events such as open houses, facility tours, and town halls, the public can learn about laboratory operations and the control measures used to protect the staff, the community, and the surrounding environment. These initiatives help establish the relationships that build public confidence and accountability between the laboratory and members of the local community. Kansas State University (KState) already has a BSL3 facility, the Pat Roberts' Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI). Local and regional stakeholders were engaged before and during the construction of the BRI. They are being kept updated on the status of the BRI while research is being launched by KState faculty and scientists. DHS and USDA will work with these stakeholders to stand up the research at NBAF. To engage the local Manhattan community and other stakeholders, DHS will establish a Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC) and a comprehensive community outreach program to engage the public and facilitate a dialogue. To execute these approaches DHS and USDA will: Establish an active community outreach prog ram, prior to beginning construction, which includes the establishment of an NBAF Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC). The goal of the SEC is to promote better understanding of laboratory activities (including preparedness in case of an emergency) among the general public, serve as an information exchange between the community and the laboratory, and facilitate community outreach events. Establish a mechanism, either through the SEC or otherwise, where members of the local Manhattan community can interact with the laboratory director and staff to ask questions and understand the facility's ongoing work in science and operations, including preparedness in case of emergency. Continue to participate, give briefings, ga ther feedback, and answer questions on the status of the program in NBAF-related meetings where members of the Manhattan community are present. Pro-actively seek to engage the community at each milestone of the construction project (i.e., completion of the site-specific risk assessment, award of site-preparation, etc.) through neighborhood or town hall-style meetings. Prepare fact sheets and briefing materials to clearly present and explain the mission, design, research, risks, and mitigation strategies associated with NBAF. Participate in open houses and other public outreach activities on the campus of K-State. October 2010 A9 NBAF SSRA Report Prior to and continuing through operations, host educational programs, facility tours, community forums, community days, open houses, and town hall meetings to engage and inform the general public and to facilitate communication and dialogue. Regularly update the DHS NBAF website, www. dhs.gov/nbaf, to disseminate timely and accurate information. 5.2 - Private Sector, Non-profit, Non-go vernmental Organizations, and Academia The private sector, nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations, and academia are important partners in NBAF and its success. These groups represent the producer groups, agricultural associations, environmental groups, researchers, and academicians. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will, (in addition to the activities listed above): Establish mechanisms for information exchange between DHS and these organizations, such as research forums, national conferences, and general meetings. Hold monthly meetings with the HBAC to establish a cooperative relationship, inform them regarding NBAF's progress. Strengthen and focus community outreach efforts by keeping an integrated calendar of events where these groups will be present. 5.3 - DHS, USDA and Other Federal Agencies ONL is the DHS office responsible for NBAF construction and operations/maintenance, and will continue to engage and communicate with DHS senior staff and other Federal agencies to keep them informed on the progress of NBAF. In addition to DHS, USDA ARS and APHIS as the lead partner agencies conducting research at NBAF are vital components in the success of the overall public outreach effort. DHS will continue to work with USDA to inform them of the progress of NBAF and to partner together in public outreach. To engage other Federal agencies, DHS and USDA will, (in addition to the activities listed above): Continue to proactively provide timely in formation and regular updates to Federal agencies through briefings, materials, website updates, and meetings. Commit to meeting regularly with officials from PIADC and other relevant biolabs for on-going public outreach support and collaboration. 5.4 - State and Local Government Similar to the methods employed to engage federal government partners, DHS will seek to engage state and local government through the timely and accurate dissemination of information through a variety of methods outlined below. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will utilize all activities listed above. October 2010 A10 NBAF SSRA Report 5.5 - Congress In keeping with standard practice and operations, the DHS and USDA will regularly inform Congress on the planning, construction, and operations of NBAF, as needed. The purpose of engagement with Congress is to provide timely information, discuss issues, answer questions, ensure transparency and open communication, and mitigate the risks associated with NBAF. Specifically, DHS ONL will work through the Office of the Under Secretary for S&T, the Office of Strategy, Policy and Budget, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Public Affairs to conduct briefings, answer questions, and receive feedback from members of congress and their staff. USDA ARS and APHIS will work through their legislative affairs channels to inform members of congress, their staffs, and any appropriate committees. 5.6 - General Public DHS intends to keep the general public informed and engaged regarding the mission, research, risks and mitigation strategies associated with NBAF. DHS considers the general public to be an important stakeholder in NBAF as the mission of NBAF is to protect the nation's animal agriculture and public health. Thus, public outreach will inform the general public as to the benefits of having this facility and inform them of possible risks to animal or public health from FADs, emerging, and zoonotic diseases. To engage these stakeholders, DHS and USDA will utilize all activities listed above. 6. Risk Communication DHS is committed to implementing a comprehensive risk communication plan as part of the risk communication strategy at NBAF. The NBAF risk communication strategies will address qualitative and quantitative risks, clearly explain to the public in lay terms the risks of the facility, and demonstrate how DHS and USDA intend to mitigate those risks. The development of the EIS and the SiteSpecific Risk Assessment are the first steps in the risk communication process. Building upon the risk communication plans of PIADC and other relevant biocontainment facilities, NBAF will employ many of the same mechanisms that have proved successful in mitigating risks and informing the public of incidents at these biolabs. For example, NBAF will have an incident reporting system to facilitate communication between the laboratory and the community, including stakeholders. The reporting system establishes a tiered communication system for evaluating the severity of an incident, the appropriate \"Incident Reporting System Response\" and the required reporting to the community. The more serious the incident and the potential risk, the broader and the more highlevel the incident reporting. This tool ensures that the community is kept fully informed on daytoday activities, and understands the severity of various incidents that may occur at the laboratory and the associated potential effects on their community. It also provides a consistent method of communication to the community from the laboratory. October 2010 A11 NBAF SSRA Report 7.

October 2010 B7 NBAF SSRA Report October 2010 B8 NBAF SSRA Report Appendix C: A Subject Matter Panel Review of the Qualitative Assessment of Hazards and Risks Associated with Research on Eight (8) Specific Pathogens at the Planned National Bio\u00ad and Agro\u00ad Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, KS October C1 NBAF SSRA Report October 2010 C2 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report June 2010 A Subject Matter Expert Panel Review of the Qualitative Assessment of Hazards and Risks Associated with Research on Eight (8) Specific Pathogens at the Planned National Bio and AgroDefense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas. Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report October 2010 C4 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Executive Summary The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is in the process of developing the facility design, defining operational procedure requirements, and planning mitigation strategies for the new National Bioand Agrodefense Facility (NBAF) that will be built in Manhattan, Kansas. DHS has listed eight pathogens that may be used in research programs at the new facility once construction and commissioning are complete, and all programmatic prerequisites (permitting, licensure, SOPs, certifications, registrations, programspecific risk assessments, staffing, training, etc.) are satisfied. Additional pathogens of interest may also be studied in the future, as indicated in the body of the report. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) (DHS, 2008) provided a nonsite specific assessment of potential hazards and risks associated with accidents at the NBAF that could result in a loss of biocontainment and resulting infection(s) of humans and susceptible animal species. A Threat Risk Assessment (TRA) (DHS, 2010) considered potential hazards associated with an intentional compromise of biocontainment (by theft or sabotage) that could also result in a loss of biocontainment. Fortunately, the NBAF is being designed by a worldclass design team, the NBAF Design Partnership (NDP), which is incorporating the most current proven biosafety and biocontainment technologies, leveraging experiences and \"lessons learned\" from containment facilities around the world as evidenced later in this report. Thus, when constructed as designed and operated with appropriate protocols, the NBAF will be one of the safest and most secure biocontainment facilities (arguably, the safest and most secure) in the world. However, it is impossible to eliminate all risks\u2014either accidents or intentional events. DHS has commissioned a SiteSpecific Risk Assessment (SSRA) that is intended to address local/regional characteristics and use high fidelity modeling techniques with the latest (15%) NBAF design plans in an updated assessment of risk. Two elements of risk that will be unique to NBAF are 1) the research and handling (in the highlycontained laboratory environment) of Foot and Mouth Disease virus (FMDv) on contiguous mainland United States (Manhattan, Kansas) and 2) the capability for research work with zoonotic agents in large animal models in a BSL4 containment environment at the proposed NBAF. Foot and Mouth Disease virus (FMDv) and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFv) were selected for further quantitative (including modeling) SSRA. Inclusion of FMDv in the SSRA was mandated by congress in the Homeland Security Appropriation Act of 2010 (P. L. 11183 \u00a7560). FMDv was selected for further quantitative study as it is persistent as a dry virus, highly contagious, air transmissible, and has sufficiently characterized etiology to be modeled effectively. Furthermore, The Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110246) specifically amended a prohibition on FMDv research on the mainland in 121 USC 113(a) to allow FMD research at a designated facility on the U.S. mainland - thus assessment of the agricultural economic impact from a potential outbreak of FMDv on the mainland is critical to understanding the risk and developing appropriate mitigation strategies. The other seven pathogens identified by DHS as research candidates for NBAF are Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFv), African Swine Fever virus (ASFv), Classical Swine Fever virus (CSFv), Hendra virus (Hev), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEv), October 2010 C5 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Nipah virus (Niv), and Mycoplasma mycoides (the causative agent of Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia, or CBPP). It is notable that BSL4 containment is required for Hev and Niv, while the other pathogens can be handled at BSL3 (BMBL5, 2007). In an effort to expand the scope to include a different representative risk, DHS included RVFv for the SSRA. RVFv was selected from among the seven remaining pathogens because it is a zoonotic, vectorborne virus that is spread by several species of mosquito. The other zoonotic pathogens to choose from either did not have a well defined etiology like the paramyxoviruses, Nipah and Hendra (and thus lacked sufficient data for quantitative modeling); or had a more limited host range like Japanese Encephalitis virus that is spread by certain bird species. The remaining two pathogens are not zoonotic and, therefore, would not provide an opportunity to model risks to human community health. Six of the proposed NBAF pathogens were not specifically considered in the current quantitative assessments of the SSRA; therefore, a separate qualitative assessment of the hazards and relative risks of the complete set of eight pathogens was performed. This report presents the summary of this qualitative assessment. The assessment was performed between lateApril and mid May of 2010 and culminated with a subject matter expert panel discussion on May 11th, 2010. Part of the NBAF's mission will be to respond to emerging disease threats. If a new, highly infectious and transmissible animal pathogen were to emerge, NBAF would be the facility likely to be designated to research the threat. It must be noted that the Panel's assessment herein is limited to the eight pathogens, and that further analysis will be required if the NBAF undertakes research or studies with organisms with a higher potential to infect humans. The Panel concluded that, in general, the current design strategy for NBAF containment systems and features and preliminary operations and mitigation plans are consistent with the anticipated NBAF research needs and activities that could involve all eight proposed pathogens. This conclusion indicates that the Panel did not find design elements or operation/mitigation strategies that would preclude the use of the eight pathogens at the NBAF but does not mean that the NBAF will be ready to begin related research programs upon completion of laboratory commissioning. Some supplemental/temporary equipment and accommodations may be required for the specific animal models and research programs required to support the anticipated needs related to the eight pathogens. In addition, programspecific prerequisites, experimental design, protocol verification (including containment systems efficacy and testing), and other supporting preprogram activities are expected to be completed before research on any pathogen begins. The Panel also concurs with the current SSRA plan to include discussion on risk mitigation, design, and operational strategies for the NBAF BSL4 facilities. Additionally, the Panel concluded that the magnitude of potential consequences and risks of a loss of containment/outbreak for the NBAF are adequately represented by the quantitative assessment being performed for FMDv and RVFv. Although it is reasonable and valuable to assess the risk of all eight of the proposed NBAF pathogens, in particular pathogens that must be handled at BSL4 (Niv and Hev), a full quantitative assessment of risk (to include fate, transport and deposition modeling) of Nipah and Hendra will be far more meaningful and accurate as more data regarding their transmissibility, October 2010 C6 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report pathogenesis, susceptibility, etc. are determined by the scientific community. Based on the etiological, biosafety, biosecurity, and host range properties of the other, wellcharacterized Risk Group 3 and 4 pathogens (WHO) reviewed during this assessment, the Panel concludes that there is no evidence that the NBAF design, operation, and mitigation strategies are not compatible with the complete list of eight pathogens and that the quantitative modeling efforts being performed for FMDv and RVFv are reasonably representative (for the intended SSRA purposes of design feedback, operational planning, and mitigation strategies development) at the current point in the NBAF design process.

Work Process Signature Science began management and coordination of the QRA Subject Matter Expert (SME) Panel Meeting on April 22, 2010. Potential SMEs were identified in the areas of foreign animal disease research, animal handling, BSL3 and BSL4 biocontainment laboratory facility design and systems, epidemiology, biosafety, biosecurity, mitigation and response, agricultural economics and public health. (Appendix A contains a list of QRA SME Panel members.) The Panel Meeting was set for May 11, 2010 at Signature Science's Austin, Texas campus. The meeting was continued on May 12 to accommodate more individuals' schedules. SMEs were contacted and enlisted for the effort based on their availability to participate and their ability to supplement a literature review with contributions in the following areas: Pathogenspecific (of the eight) anecdotal information or experiences; Relevant BSL3Ag, BSL3, or BSL4 insight on design considerations, operating practices, and/or mitigation strategies; Unpublished (but referenced) research or data of interest; and Pathway expertise (liquid effluent, solid waste disposal, carcass disposal, and ventilation system (air handling)) relevant to the SSRA objectives. In parallel with the meeting coordination effort, a literature review commenced with the objective of developing a summary of characteristic data on each of the eight pathogens to be referenced in support of Panel discussions. The matrix included data on pathogen etiology, host range, epidemiology, immune response, and laboratory requirements. (The Pathogens Summary Matrix is attached in Appendix B.) Expectations and instructions for the SMEs were documented and, along with a draft of the pathogen summary information, were sent to the SMEs on April 28. (The QRA SME Instructions document is attached in Appendix B.) Input to the pathogen summary information and the QRA process was requested from the SMEs and received throughout the following week. Signature Science continued the literature review and meeting coordination efforts, with a final Data Packet sent to the SMEs on May 5, 2010. The SME Panel met in Austin on May 11 and again, with subset group, on May 12. SMEs unable to travel to Austin participated via teleconference. October 2010 C9 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Discussion sessions included a review of the current NBAF design status, waste treatment pathways, solid waste handling plans, air filtration systems, ventilation system controls, and person/animal/material handling flows. SMEs reviewed and adjusted the proposed set of pathogen influenced design, operations, and mitigation considerations. SMEs also established the working range of design, operations, and mitigation influencing pathogens and accompanying research program characteristics. SMEs quantified the range of pathogen characteristics and discussed design implications. SMEs compared and assessed the NBAF design based on the established pathogen characteristics, and developed and presented recommendations and conclusions. (Notes from the QRA SME Panel Meeting are attached in Appendix C.) The QRA SME Draft Final Report, incorporating the Panel's recommendations and conclusions, was provided to the QRA SME Panel and additional reviewers on May 14. (A list of QRA Final Report Reviewers is attached in Appendix D.) SME and reviewer comments and input were incorporated into this Final Report. Pathogen/Research Program Characteristics During the QRA SME Panel Meeting, a subset of pathogen and accompanying research program characteristic categories were identified as critical to determining whether NBAF was designed for and could mitigate hazards presented by conducting research with these pathogens at the facility. The categories identified and considered in this QRA included: anticipated research needs of the NBAF, associated anticipated animal models, pathogenspecific operational protocols, pathogenspecific occupational health and biosafety considerations, availability of vaccines and therapies, pathogen specific biosecurity considerations, pathogenspecific outbreak mitigation response strategy considerations, pathogenspecific inactivation requirements and methods, North American vector range (indigenous), North American host range (indigenous), endemnicity potential, morbidity and mortality (animal), morbidity and mortality (human), diagnostic capability in local and regional areas including NAHLN and LRN, potential economic impact of an outbreak due to a \"regulation induced trade ban\" and potential economic impact of an outbreak due to an \"effective trade ban.\" As part of the QRA process, it was important to understand whether work with any of the pathogens required facilities and strategies above and beyond those under consideration within the context of the SSRA. Key considerations for each category are described below, along with a summary analysis of implications and suggested modifications to accommodate any pathogens with special requirements. Anticipated Research Needs The general research areas anticipated at the NBAF (as identified by the QRA Panel and listed in Table 1 below) that span all eight of the proposed research pathogens described above include vaccine October 2010 C10 Table 1.

October 2010 C11 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Several pathogenspecific research focus areas were identified, such as those for Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDv) for example, that included increased emphasis on vaccination development efforts that would (if successful) allow vaccinated herds to maintain a diseasefree status through the introduction of DIVA vaccines, or prevent vaccinated animals from being carriers of FMDv through the development of vaccines that impart sterile immunity. Clearly, diagnostic tool and assay development are important countermeasures to control highly contagious, higheconomic impact threats such as FMDv and to differentiate foreign animal diseases (FADs), such as CBPP, from closely related non pathogen organisms. Other pathogen specific research areas involve work to identity modes of transmission, North American domestic host susceptibility and identification of natural reservoirs. Research of vectorborne FADs such as ASFv, JEv, and RVFv will likely involve the study of infected arthropods (specifically ticks and mosquitoes) and large animal hosts such as cattle, horse and sheep. Studies may also include surveying the domestic counterparts to known vectors and reservoirs of these FADs to understand the potential to infect, amplify and spread the disease domestically. This may include studying the replication potential of JEv and RVFv in domestic mosquito species, or Hendra and Nipah in North American bats. The current NBAF design will accommodate basic research; diagnostic development, testing and validation; advanced countermeasure development (including GMP vaccine development laboratories); and training for the highconsequence livestock diseases included in the preceding table. The existing facility at PIADC has been safely conducting research in similar areas of vaccines and biological countermeasures to FMD and other high consequence foreign animal diseases and diagnostic and detection tools for highpriority foreign animal and highconsequence zoonotic diseases for over 50 years. The NBAF design basis has leveraged existing, successful, and well characterized facility elements, such as those at the PIADC, and current stateofthe art containment techniques and improvements to maximize the safe handling of the research pathogens. The Panel agreed that the current NBAF design, in general, was adequate to address the research areas identified for each of the eight proposed research pathogens, with the following exception: the potential animal models and arthropod vectors necessary to fulfill these research needs may require BSL3E and BSL4 containment for small mammals, birds and mosquitoes at the NBAF. The NBAF BSL3E space, as of the April 30, 2010 design iteration, does include an insectary (comprised of two holding/rearing rooms and one entry vestibule), which could support transovarial studies on mosquitoes infected with pathogens that require BSL3 containment within small insectary environmental chambers. Although not included in the current design plan, according to the NBAF Design Partners (NDP), due to the containment nature of the BSL4 space (i.e., sealed enclosure, pressure controlled air environment, HEPA filtration, etc.) it is possible for an insectary to be arranged within BSL4 laboratories and BSL3Ag facilities (as appropriate based upon agent risk assessment). This could be accomplished using commercially available (e.g., Darwin or Espec) insect rearing environmental chambers, which come in a wide array of sizes and operating systems to control the interior environment and accommodate a variety of arthropods. Work with infected arthropods, even within the designated chambers, poses a October 2010 C12 Table 2.

Therefore, the Panel recommends that procedures and housing chambers designed for this work be fully verified prior to implementation. If NBAF research includes arthropod vector exposure to infected hosts for transmission studies, then appropriate housing to contain both the potentially infected arthropod and the animal host (presumed to be large mammal such as a cow, horse or sheep) will need to be designed, developed, and verified prior to implementation as this system is not currently part of the NBAF design (small mammal considerations discussed in the following animal model segment). Anticipated Animal Models The NBAF will require a level of flexibility in room design and layout to accommodate the range and size of animal species required to meet the planned research and training missions. While the current research program is limited to eight pathogens, future disease priorities may require the adoption of other animal models as novel emerging pathogens are identified. For example, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory now must house certain bat species, which require specialized handling and care facilities not in the original research mission, in response to the emerging Hendra/Nipah virus situation in the Pacific region. A certain level of design and research program flexibility must be maintained to be prepared for unknown future research needs; however, this planning must account for the overall NBAF mission and the availability of other U.S. research facilities to meet growing needs. Within the United States, there are other facilities that can perform small animal or nonhuman primate models of human and animal disease. NBAF's mission will be predominantly focused on large animals that are natural hosts and are of significant agricultural or economic concern. The proposed eight pathogens have overlapping requirements for animal models that fall within the NBAF mission and current NBAF design considerations including cows, pigs, sheep, goats, and possibly horses. (See Table 2 for anticipated animal models.) The majority of the eight pathogens to be researched at the NBAF have acceptable animal models using either cows or pigs. The NBAF design was focused on the use of large animal models and, as such, is wellsuited for research with these mammals, including the American Bison, if needed, for CBPP research. The NBAF should reserve small animal (mice, rats, hamsters, bats, ferrets, etc.,) housing and research space within the containment laboratories for additional study of the eight research pathogens and/or October 2010 C13 Table 3.

Special accommodations, such as microisolators, should also be considered for those other animal species to be demonstrated during the Foreign Animal Disease training programs, such as chickens to demonstrate exotic Newcastle disease and avian influenza (see \"Other Pathogen Considerations\" section for details regarding the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (FADD) training program). Although not part of the current design detail, the modular and flexible nature of the basic NBAF design can accommodate the study and rearing of small mammals (including bats) in BSL4 containment with only slight modification. Currently, all NBAF animal rooms are capable of housing various commercially available penning systems, either portable or fixed, to accommodate a variety of species, research models and sizes (such as mice, rats, hamsters, ferrets, and piglets). The current NBAF containment lab environmental systems can be adjusted to control air pressure and temperature for the various species (large or small). Bat rearing and research studies (if desired) can be accommodated within BSL4 containment through the use of netting suspended from the ceiling or side walls; however, portable or demountable divider partitions would need to be designed and constructed to allow researchers to enter the holding room and observe the bats without entry to the actual nesting areas. PathogenSpecific Operational Protocols Currently, the NBAF animal flooring systems are designed as built up high performance resin finish systems with appropriate slip resistance for both animal and staff safety. The high performance finish systems include a waterproof membrane system over a double concrete slab system to protect basement construction. All animal pens that accommodate large animals will be equipped with an embedded rubber floor system for animal comfort. These design elements are appropriate for large animal work; however, the current NBAF design assumes that no natural or artificial bedding material will be used at the NBAF. If neonatals or small animals are to be studied or used for the generation of reagents, natural bedding materials may be appropriate to maximize small animal care and waste control and should be considered. As the use of natural bedding materials may have an impact on liquid and solid waste disposal design and operations, these elements should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure drains and traps can handle residual soft bedding washdown into the liquid wastesteam, etc., at the NBAF. Octob er 2010 C14 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report As seen in Table 3, above, six of the eight foreign animal diseases evaluated in this qualitative risk assessment can be handled under BSL3 Ag operating conditions (ASFv, CSFv, FMDv, JEv, RVFv, and CBPP). The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), Institute for Animal Health and Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health successfully work with four of these agents (ASFv, CSFv, FMDv, and CBPP) in large animals (cattle, sheep, pigs) under the safety practices and engineering controls offered at the BSL3 Ag level. The current NBAF design also includes Animal BSL4 laboratories equipped to handle large animals such as cattle, horses, sheep and swine. Operations within an Animal BSL4 laboratory that include experimentation and handling of large potentially infected animals that may kick, bite, spit, spray urine or solid wastes, etc., come with a unique set of safety considerations. Of the current pathogens proposed for study at the NBAF, Nipah and Hendra are the only agents that require BSL4 and ABSL4 practices and facilities. The operational protocols for handling large animals are clearly understood and used successfully within BSL3 Ag facilities; however, transfer of these practices to operations within Animal BSL4 laboratories may require special consideration and additional training of staff to ensure operator safety. Areas discussed by the Panel included: methods/equipment used in animal penning and caging, animal transfer and movement, necropsy procedures, and specialty PPE and decontamination considerations. The Panel concluded that the NBAF design should address the following requirements regarding large animal penning, caging, transfer and movement within BSL4 containment laboratories: Penning systems that are designed for flexibility (multiple species) and durability due to exposure to disinfectants and abuse by animals; A penning system that assists to herd or direct animals to restraint systems; Animal restraint systems (\"squeeze\" and \"head gates\") that permit the researcher controlled access to the animals without danger; A carcass removal system from the room; this includes properly locating mechanical assist points inside the room and access to doors to the contained corridor leading to necropsy; An animal feeding process that permits the animal care attendant to remotely drop feed into bins/troughs that protect him/her from the animal; Breathing air systems that permit the researcher and animal care attendant full access to the animals without risking an air supply line breach or difficulties switching from one air port to another; different options exist including an internal penning system allowing 360\u00ba access with a center rotating boom, zip line to manage the air coil or perimeter drops that avoid the line crossing through the animals zone/path; and Air pressure resistant (APR) doors that are robust to allow an animal hitting it without deformation. October 2010 C15 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Through discussion with the NDP, the Panel determined that the current NBAF design adequately addresses the animal penning, caging and transfer concerns identified. The applicable NBAF design elements that address these concerns include: Caging Design Elements: NBAF penning and gating systems will be designed to protect the staff from charging or kicking animals with appropriate impact design, as well as shin and leg protection systems; Individual restraint systems will be installed in each pen to allow research staff to have a full range of access to the animal. Restraint systems will include selflocking head gates, tie rings, and pen panels that rotate on a fixed position to allow additional restraint. All embedded restraint systems will be recessed and sharp edges on all exposed surfaces will be covered to prevent staff injury or snagging of clothing or PPE. Recessed systems will also consider ergonomics to allow appropriate finger and hand clearance; All penning and gating latching and hinging systems will consider ergonomics and safety in their designs. Designs must provide positive latching and an automatic ratchet system to prevent impact and kick back of the gating swings. All penning systems will be polished smooth of burrs and welds to prevent injury to animals and staff; and All penning and gating systems are proposed to be stainless steel and be sealed to prevent contamination. NBAF Animal Movement Operations: Once animals are within the containment facilities, the intent is to move animals individually or in manageable groups, whether in the clean or dirty corridors: Incoming animals will be staged at the arrival dock and the animals sorted and moved to prescheduled rooms via the clean corridor in groups sized to the animal room capacity; The clean and dirty corridor system will be designed with a series of control gates allowing movement of animals in groups compatible with room size and capacity. Controls gates will be positioned at intervals down the length of the corridor to permit slow and systematic movement. Animals will be guided into each pen via a series of room control gates and penning systems; The large animal rooms will be equipped with a herd management chute system to allow twice daily procedures including blood drawing and weighing; Animal restraint squeeze chutes will be provided at all animal operations requiring procedural activities to ensure staff safety; Additional animal restraint systems will be included to accommodate species that are not suited to traditional large animal squeeze chute systems. These include a white tail deer drop chute; October 2010 C16 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report All animal rooms are capable of housing various penning systems portable or fixed to accommodate a variety of specie or research models and sizes; and The NBAF design team consulted with worldrenowned animal behaviorist, Temple Grandin, to include design elements that minimize distress during animal transfers and procedures (such as using curved corners during herding activities, incorporating light at the end of a shoot system, etc.). Comprehensive pathogenesis research includes necropsy of infected animals. The Panel agreed that infected animal necropsy poses the highest risk of aerosol generation and worker injury/exposure, in particular necropsy of large animals potentially infected with Nipah and Hendra, which must be done in BSL4 facilities. The NBAF design team has already included, or is currently considering inclusion of, the following elements to improve operator safety during large animal necropsy: Carcasses may be moved from holding rooms by a system of embedded rings for electric winch attachment. Overhead rail systems were investigated but viewed as problematic especially considering decontamination and compartmentalization of containment zones and the loss of continuity of the hoist rail system. Carcasses may also be moved by modified electric forklifts fitted with stainless steel containment pans. All other animals will be walked to the necropsy facility; Necropsy suite will be fitted with a squeeze chute system to assist in the euthanasia process and final weighout prior to necropsy. All animal movement in the necropsy will be done by a hoist rail and lift system with access to the carcass coolers and carcass disposal system; Necropsy suite size may be scaled down to minimize surface area for room decontamination (not currently part of the NBAF design, but can be considered); Include a cleanable or disposable curtain system that surrounds the necropsy table and serves to prevent excessive spraying of blood or bodily fluids (being considered); and Splash and sprays may be mitigated by limiting or restricting use of aerosolgenerating necropsy equipment such as band saws in the necropsy area. Regarding decontamination and specialty PPE considerations the Panel had the following recommendations: Proper donning/doffing, decontamination, and inspection of footwear is important due to presence and potential packing of infected fecal material. The Panel recommends that standard operating procedures require the \"buddy system\" so that staff can inspect one other for fecal material prior to showering out. Related to this, the chemical decontamination showers should be designed to allow for at least two people to accommodate mutual inspection; and Positive air encapsulating suits that permit worker protection, good flexibility, good visual range, filtered air, and clear ergonomic communication system between workers are critical to operator safety, especially when working with large animals.

Animal handling precautions. Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Specific NBAF PPE considerations for BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories will be determined during the full scale mockup phase of the NBAF design process. PathogenSpecific Occupational Health and Biosafety Considerati ons Standard medical support services, such as those identified in the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th edition, are expected to be sufficient for those personnel working with the zoonotic FADs proposed for the NBAF (JEv, RVFv, Hev, and Niv). These medical support services are expected to include at a minimum: access to available immunizations, periodic medical evaluations and medical support for occupational illnesses and injuries. Special consi deration should be given to those medical support services provided for personnel working with Hev and Niv, which must be handled at BSL4. BSL4 occupational health standard operating procedures for work with these pathogens should address unexplained worker absence and include protocols for the monitoring (including serum sample collection), medical evaluation, workup, and followup of workers with unexplained nonspecific illness (BMBL, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Fifth Edition 2007). Due to the exotic nature of the FADs proposed for study at the NBAF, establishment of local medical personnel and facilities that are accessible to the NBAF workforce and knowledgeable in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of the proposed zoonotic diseases should be part of the comprehensive NBAF Occupational Health and medical monitoring program. All animal handling personnel working within the BSL4 laboratories must have specific and thorough training in handling hazardous infectious agents and infected animals, including training in animal husbandry procedures, hazards present, and precautions to prevent exposures. In addition, laboratory personnel should have a thorough understanding of the signs and symptoms of disease caused by the zoonotic agents (Hev, Niv, RVFv). Human Vaccines and Therapies Vaccines and/or therapeutics are available to personnel identified as having an occupational risk of exposure to two (JEv, RVFv) of the four zoonotic pathogens considered in this QRA. (See Table 5 for more detail.) Because BSL4 agents were not explicitly considered for the SSRA, it is particularly important to assess whether the current NBAF design and anticipated standard practices safely October 2010 C18 Table 5.

As with any pathogen that must be handled in BSL4 containment, it is critical that the facility Biosafety Officer review and validate the proposed test plans, and research methodologies and staff readiness prior to initiating work. It has been demonstrated at facilities similar in design and function to the proposed NBAF workspace that workers have safely accomplished critical research with Hev and Niv. Furthermore, without research facilities such as the NBAF, it would not be possible to advance the ability to detect, treat, and mitigate future risks from these diseases. PathogenSpecific Biosecurity Considerations The National Select Agents Registry (NSAR) Program oversees the activities of possession of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health, or to animal or plant products. APHIS and CDC implement the provisions through a series of regulations. These regulations include lists of select agents for USDA (9 CFR 121.3) and overlap agents\u2014those pathogens that are listed for both USDA and HHS (9 CFR 121.4). As shown in Table 6, all eight of the pathogens included in this qualitative assessment require Select Agent registration\u2014five USDA select agents (ASFv, CSFv, FMDv, JEv, and CBPP) and three overlap select agents (Hev, Niv, and RVFv). October 2010 C19 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report The nature of the research work at NBAF will require DHS compliance with the NSAR Program. Through the program, APHIS and CDC provide security information guidance documentation (and a security plan template) that assist the laboratory entity in compliance with appropriate federal regulations. The general security requirements include (but are not limited to) a written security plan for the following security program elements (9 CFR 121.11): SiteSpecific Risk Assessment (note: while the terminology is the same, this requirement is not satisfied by the SSRA referenced in other parts of this Panel report) Physical security, inventory control, and information control systems; Access control; Access approval; Means of securing Select Agents and toxins; Intraentity transfers; Drills and exercises; and Records retention. Information in the NBAF plan must be developed to address specific NBAFrelated threats, in addition to general biocontainment concerns. Because of recent foreign reports of FMDv infection and public concern about the substantial economic consequences from FMDv outbreaks, this pathogen has the potential for elevating the perceived threat level (DHS, Threat Risk Assessment, 2010). Thus, FMDv may be considered as a security risk bounding pathogen from the USDA Select Agent list. RVFv is an overlap pathogen representing risks to both susceptible animal species and humans. Thus, FMDv and RVFv are considered to represent the biosecurity risk space. The potential consequences of containment losses due to intentional actions related to these two pathogens are addressed in the SSRA and TRA. Therefore, the complete range of eight NBAF pathogens is adequately represented, for modeling purposes\u2014not and RVFv. Response Strategy Conside rations Each pathogen will require a tailored outbreak response strategy, but there are key core steps to any Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) response including: Identify the agent; Slaughter animals on affected premises; Potentially cull or vaccinate uninfected animals in zone around outbreak; Dispose of carcasses and exposed materials; October 2010 C20 Table 7. Pathogen \u00adSpecific Outbreak Mitig ation Response Strategy Considerations ASFv and susceptible animals in control zone; populations FMD Cull vs. vaccin ate decision monitor potential wild animal reservoirs (wild pigs and deer) JEv Vector control measures; monitor bird populations RVFv Culling of infected animals; Vector control measures Hev Cull infected animals; Monitor local horse and bat populations Niv Culling proce dures for pig industry; monitor bats Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Disinfect exposed premises; Designate infected zone, with control of susceptible animal movements; Initiate an epidemiological investigation, with tracing of possible sources and possible spread of infection; and Surveillance of infected zone and surrounding area as needed to regain trade status. Table 7 outlines mitigation response strategy considerations for each pathogen. Three pathogens will require additional response steps, as they are insectborne. ASFv, in its sylvatic cycle, is transmitted by soft ticks; it is also spread from pig to pig via direct contact. JEv and RVFv are transmitted by mosquitoes and, to some extent, biting flies. A well defined vector control program will be needed for the control of certain types of ticks and mosquitoes. These plans should include the disruption of both human and animal feeding cycles by the use of behavior modification (avoidance and repellants) and insecticides. Tailored plans may be required depending upon the feeding habits and activity of the potential insect host. For instance, some mosquito species are active during daylight while others are active early evening. For disease outbreaks that have a major trade impact and for which vaccines currently exist as a potential control measure, such as FMDv, detailed plans and guidance documents on the cull vs. vaccinate decision must be clearly elucidated and all stakeholders must understand the implications of the decision. USDA APHIS has developed such plans; however, local and State planners may require assistance to adapt or refine these materials for use locally. Disease surveillance programs may be required for susceptible feral animal populations to track potential introduction into those reservoirs. October 2010 C21 Table 8.

Table 8, below, itemizes current methods by pathogen. At least two types of readilyavailable and commonly used chemicals including alkalis and halogens (including some specific oxidizing agents) can, and most likely will, be used at NBAF. The alkalis (sodium hydroxide and others) are effective against ASFv, CSFv, FMDv, and, the pathogen that causes CBPP. The halogens (sodium hypochlorite and potentially some iodophors) may be selected for use on JEv, RVFv, Hev, and Niv. An oxidizing agent (such as Virkon\u00aeS) is also likely to be used at NBAF. Virkon\u00aeS has demonstrated efficacy against several of the eight pathogens in its current use as general disinfectant at the PIADC. In order to mitigate possible use of the 'wrong' disinfectant, the NBAF should, in its operational planning, strive to develop universal methods of disinfection, with the use of one or two agents that will work with all pathogens. Some of these chemicals present engineering and operational challenges for NBAF designers and researchers. Compatibility issues and the corrosive characteristics of decontamination chemicals/solutions influence the selection of materials of construction and other engineering/design practices. Operational challenges will be managed by the development and validation of facilityspecific protocols and procedures. Table 8.

The maximum deactivation temperature of the eight pathogens (based on a 60minute exposure time) is driven by FMDv\u2014FMDv is known for its heat tolerance. Standard autoclave conditions (121\u00baC, 15 psi above atmospheric pressure) are adequate for the deactivation of all eight pathogens\u2014including FMDv, in most cases. Common batch processing of liquid effluent decontamination systems can be adjusted to accommodate the heat inactivation requirements of nearly all mesophilic pathogens\u2014subject to verification and validation in waste matrix and its components. All seven viral pathogens have a similar range of pH toleration. Generally, the pH range of pathogen inactivation for all eight pathogens is < 3.0 and > 11.5. Hev and Niv (the two pathogens from the set of eight that must be handled at BSL4) have a relatively high tolerance for acidic or basic environments\u2014 inactivation of these viruses occurs below an approximate pH level of 3 and above 11. CSFv inactivation levels are estimated to be less than 3.0 and greater than 11. North American Vector Range (indigenous) Within five years of its introduction to North America, West Nile virus spread from New York to California because of its ability to infect both native bird and mosquito species. The rapid spread of West Nile virus was facilitated by migration of susceptible bird species. There is concern that a similar situation could occur if an insectborne pathogen is somehow released from the NBAF. Table 9, below, lists the indigenous North American vector range, where applicable, for the eight pathogens. October 2010 C23 Table 9.

RVFv Susceptible domestic and wild animal populations widespread across North America Hev North American bat susceptibility illdefined; battohorse transmission may be less likely in North America because lack of presumed susceptible bat host. Niv North American bat susceptibility illdefined; battopig transmission may be less likely than in Asia because of animal control measures; however, pig to pig transmission is still likely. CBPP Cow population is wide spread; bison more limited distribution within North America Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report It has been shown experimentally that North American mosquito species may transmit JEv (Reeves, 1946) and RVFv (Turrel, 2008) to some degree. It is unclear, however, if these species can efficiently transmit these viruses in nature. Culex mosquitoes have a broad geographical distribution in the United States and can potentially transmit both JEv and RVFv. In addition, North America has a broad range of soft tick species that have been shown, at least experimentally, to transmit ASFv (Groocock, 1980). Soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros that are similar to those that spread ASFv in Europe (Endris, 1992) and Africa are located within North America. In Africa, these ticks typically live in underground burrows associated with wild pigs. More research will be required to better define the risk of transmission and spread of these viruses by North American insect species. North American Host Range (indigenous) NBAF's mission is focused on pathogens that are agriculturally important; therefore, the susceptible animal populations in North America are numerous and widely distributed (see Table 10). There are multiple domestic and wild susceptible animal species in North America that are at risk of infection to many of the eight pathogens in the NBAF research mission. October 2010 C24 Table 11. Potential Endemnicity ASFv Low to moderate, as low virulent strains could enter the animal population undetected for weeks; requires close contact between soft tick and susceptible animal populations. Outbreaks in Europe mid20th century were eradicated. Some North American ticks infected with ASFv have increased mortality. No outbreak ever reported in the US. Feral pigs could harbor the virus undetected. CSFv Low to moderate, as low virulent strains could enter the animal population undetected for weeks; requires close contact between susceptible animals. Vaccine is available to limit disease, but trade impacts. Eradicated in the US in 1976 (USDA APHIS, 2005). Feral pigs could harbor the virus undetected. FMD Moderate; eradication typically by culling and/or vaccination programs, but major trade impacts. Eradicated in the US in 1929 (USDAAPHIS, 2007). Strict importation limits from endemic countries are in place. JEv Moderate; requires close contact between mosquito vectors, water sources, and susceptible animal populations. Vaccine is readily available for humans. No outbreak ever reported in the US. RVFv Moderate; broad animal host and vector range. No outbreak ever reported in the US. Hev Unknown; little is known about factors impacting endemnicity in North America. No outbreak ever reported in the US. Niv Unknown; little is known about factors impacting endemnicity in North America. No outbreak ever reported in the US. CBPP Low; eradicated in US in 1892 (FAO Animal Health Manual, 2002) but modern control measures could limit spread. A vaccine does exist to limit infection. Strict importation limits from endemic countries are in place. Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report FMDv and RVFv have the largest range of susceptible animal species that are native to North America. Other pathogens, such as Niv, Hev, ASFv, CSFv, and JEv have a more limited range of susceptible host species in North America that may assist control measures. Fruit bats are considered a major, natural reservoir for Hev and Niv viruses in Asia, but the Pteropus genus is limited in North America. It is unclear if other bat species in North America are susceptible to Hev or Niv virus infection and would serve as a suitable animal reservoir. Potential Endemnicity All eight of the pathogens currently on the NBAF research agenda are considered Foreign Animal Diseases in the United States. However, this does not mean that these diseases were never present within the United States at one time in the past. CSFv, FMDv, CBPP were eradicated in the United States in 1976, 1929, and 1892, respectively. There has never been an outbreak of ASFv, JEv, Hev, or Niv in the United States. With so little known about the ability of North American bat species to act as hosts for Hev or Niv it is very difficult to determine how likely a release will result in an endemic status in the United States in this animal population. The Panel's analysis of potential endemnicity of the eight pathogens is summarized in Table 11, below. October 2010 C25 Table 12. Morbidity/Mortality (Animal) ASFv Morbidity approaches 100% (CFSPH, 2008). Mortality - often approaches 100% in domestic swine. Subacute: 3070%. Chronic: low mortality (OIE, Oct. 2009). CSFv Varies with viral strain. Acute: Chronic: few animals affected high mortality - always fatal. (100%) Subacute: lower morbidity and Some cases are asymptomatic (CFSPH, mortality 2008). rates.

Mortality is 15% in adults; 20% in calves (FAD, 7th JEv Morbidity in horses reported from field cases range from less than 1% to 1.4%. Mortality in non immune infected piglets can approach 100%. Rate is near zero in adult swine. Mortality rates in horses can vary from 515% but can reach 3040% in more severe epizootics (OIE, Oct. 2009). RVFv Morbidity is highly variable and dependent on susceptibility of hosts and presence of insect vectors. It can be very high and affect entire herds (FAD, 7th Ed., 2008). Mortality during epidemics is 10% (cattle); 20% (calves); 70100% (lambs, kids); 1070% (adult sheep, goat) (FAD, 7th Ed., 2008). Hev Infections seem uncommon (CFSPH, Sept. 2009). in horses. The case fatality rate in horses, as of Sept 2009, is 75% Niv Morbidity in confined animals approaches 100% and mortality tends to be low in swine older than 6 months. Mortality in piglets can be high (40%). High morbidity and low mortality (<5%) in young swine. Limited clinical information exists for other species, such as dogs and cats. Fruit bats show no serious signs of infection (OIE, Oct. 2009). CBPP CBPP is not thought to be a highly contagious disease. With increased confinement, morbidity rises. In a herd situation where animals have close contact, the infection rate is 5080%. Most animals that present with severe acute infection will die. The mortality rate has ranged from 1070% in various outbreaks. Mortality in the subacute and chronic forms may depend on other intercurrent factors such as plane of nutrition, level of parasitism, and general body condition (FAD, 7th Ed., 2008). Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Infection of North American soft ticks has been demonstrated experimentally, but it resulted in higher tick death, suggesting that nonadapted ticks may not be ideal hosts and that establishing an endemic infection may be more difficult (Kleiboeker, 1998; Endris 1992; Niebylski, 1987; Groocock, 1980). CBPP is difficult to detect before death, so the disease could spread extensively before being identified. In that case, a largescale slaughter operation may be required to eradicate the disease. Pigs are the only reservoir for CSFv, so direct contact between susceptible animals is required to maintain the disease in a population. Modern agricultural control programs may prevent the reestablishment of CSFv in the United States (CFSPH, 2007). Of greatest concern for establishing a more permanent presence in the United States are FMDv and RVFv due to the high number of susceptible domestic and wild animal populations. In general, modern biosecurity and animal control measures limit the establishment of permanent disease status for most of these eight pathogens; however, given the complex interactions between susceptible animal species, geographical distributions, and the potential role of insect vectors, more detailed studies will be required for each pathogen to determine the likelihood of establishing an endemic infection in the United States if a release occurs. Morbidity/Mortality (Animal) All of the pathogens on the current NBAF research schedule cause significant morbidity or mortality in animals of agricultural concern, such as cows, pigs, or sheep (see Table 12). With all of the pathogens there is a range of morbidity and mortality depending upon the host animal, pathogen strain, general health, animal age, living conditions, and supportive care. October 2010 C26 Table 13. Morbidity/Mortality (Human) ASFv Not applicable - Nonzoonotic. CSFv Not applicable - Nonzoonotic. FMD Not applicable - Nonzoonotic. JEv Most human infections with JEv are asymptomatic; <1% of people infected with JEv develop clinical disease. Case-fatality ratio is approximately 20%-30%. Among survivors, 30%-50% may still have significant neurologic or psychiatric sequelae, even years after their acute illness (CDC, 2010). RVFv Most people with RVF recover spontaneously within a week. Ocular disease is seen in approximately 0.5% to 2% of cases, and meningoencephalitis and hemorrhagic fever in less than 1%. The case fatality rate for hemorrhagic fever is approximately 50%. Deaths rarely occur in people with eye disease or meningoencephalitis, but 1% to 10% of patients with ocular disease have some permanent visual impairment. The overall case fatality rate for all patients with RVF is less than 1%. (WHO, May 2010) Hev Hev infection has been reported in 7 people, all of whom had close contact with infected horses during their illness or necropsy; 4 of those died. Only a percentage of those exposed to infected horses have become ill. There has been no evidence of seroconversion in people who are often in close contact with flying foxes. (WHO, July 2009 and CFSPH, Sept. 2009) Niv Humans are susceptible to infection, resulting high; 4075% recorded in different outbreaks. in serious clinical (WHO, July 2009) disease. Mortality rate in humans is CBPP Not applicable - Nonzoonotic. Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report While natural mortality is low in FMDinfected animals, the morbidity of the disease is very significant. Sickened animals have considerable weight loss. The low infectious dose, pathogen stability, broad host range, and the high morbidity make FMD a major agricultural concern. While the other pathogens cause severe disease or death, the relative impact on the agricultural sector is more limited because of narrowed host range. Morbidity/Mortality (Human) Only the zoonotic pathogens JEv, RVFv, Niv, and Hev have the ability to infect humans (see Table 13). ASFv, CSFv, FMD, and CBPP do not, generally, cause human disease. JEv and RVFv cause human disease over a wide global area but few cases result in actual clinical disease (1% or less). Both JEv and RVFv are insectborne, so the disease could potentially be spread over a larger geographical area by insects. If introduced into North America, this low level of infection in humans may go undetected for a period of time as the general symptoms may not immediately indicate a novel infection. Hev and Niv have a more limited global distribution and the diseases are more rare in comparison to JEv or RVFv, but the mortality rates can be significantly higher (>40%). For human disease implications, RVFv is of great concern because of the broad animal and insect host range and the ability to potentially spread to a wider geographical area before the disease is detected.

(Martin, Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Diagnostic Capability in Local a nd Regional area and the NAHLN (National Animal Health and Laboratory Network) and LRN (Laboratory Response Network) Both the NAHLN and the LRN were established to provide regional surveillance and diagnostic capabilities for animal and human pathogens of significant concern. Currently, the LRN does not have a distributed capability to address the zoonotic pathogens (JEv, RVFv, Hev, and Niv) at its reference laboratories located in regional proximity to the proposed NBAF site. However, diagnostic capabilities and advanced handling capabilities (BSL3 and BSL4 facilities) are available at the National Labs equipped to manage diagnostic specimens indicated for JEv, RVFv, Hev, and Niv analyses. This Panel recommends evaluating methods for enhancing local diagnostic capability for the pathogens being researched at the NBAF, to support regional surveillance and reachback capability. Similar to the LRN, the NAHLN provides a distributed, regional capability of surveillance and diagnostic capability for exotic animal diseases. In addition, veterinary biologics are also sustained at the regional sites. Of the eight pathogens considered for this QRA, it is understood that only two (CSFv and FMDv) of the pathogens are currently involved in NAHLN surveillance (CSFv) and/or diagnostic (CSFv & FMDv) programs (see Table 14). In addition to the NAHLN, APHIS laboratories in Ames, IA and on Plum Island lead national level exotic and foreign animal disease research and sustain the requisite facilities and animal models necessary to understand and prepare for these threats. The NBAF represents a critical and much needed addition to the nation's capabilities and preparedness in a region that is uniquely susceptible and impacted by foreign animal disease. Trade Regulations and Potential Restrictions The OIE requires immediate notification from member countries of listed or emerging diseases (OIE, 2010 and OIE, 2009). Member countries can self declare freedom of a country, zone or compartment from an OIE listed disease. However, OIE does not recognize self declaration for bovine spongiform October 2010 C28 Table 15. Trade Regulations and Potential Restrictions ASFv OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include swine. CSFv OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include swine. FMD OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include cattle, swine, sheep, goats , farmed cervids. JEv OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include swine. RVFv OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include cattle, bison, sheep, and goats. Hev Not an OIE listed disease (AU DAFF, 2008). Agric ultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include equine. Niv OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include swine. CBPP OIE listed and notifiable disease; Agricultural sectors with high probability of immediate international trade restrictio ns after notification include cattle and bison. Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report encephalopathy, foot and mouth disease, rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. If a notification is provided for a particular disease, immediate international and domestic trade restrictions are likely for the affected species listed in Table 15. In addition to trade bans specified by national and international regulations, an important consideration is the duration and magnitude of an effective trade ban which may be realized by the uncontrolled release of any of these pathogens. Effective trade bans and restrictions reflect the changes in commerce and trade (e.g., consumer behavior, political decisions, interest group behavior, market reactions) that can augment the impacts of regulation induced trade bans and/or cause significant economic disruption in the absence of any officially mandated ban (see for example Paarlberg, et al 2003, Otte, et al 2004). Recent disease outbreaks in livestock provide examples of swift reactions by trading partner and the important economic consequences of these events. Domestically these include the impacts of H1N1 on the U.S. swine sector and BSE on the U.S. beef sector. Internationally, examples include FMD in the U.K.; BSE in Canada; Hev in the equine sector of Australia; Niv in Bangladesh, India, and Malaysia. Additional information can be found at web sites for USDAAPHIS (www.aphis.usda.gov ), C29 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Summary of Key Conclusions and Recommendations The Panel concluded that, in general, the current design and strategy for NBAF containment systems and features and preliminary operations and mitigation plans are consistent with the anticipated research needs and anticipated NBAF activities that could involve all eight pathogens. Site and design specific risk mitigation strategies for potential events (earthquake, tornado, flood, dust storm, etc.) that could adversely impact operations of the facility and therefore containment should continue during the design process. Specific supplemental and/or temporary equipment and accommodations may be required to support the anticipated animal models and research program needs related to the eight pathogens. In addition, programspecific prerequisites, experimental design, protocol (including containment systems efficacy and testing) verification, and other supporting preprogram activities are expected to be completed before research on any pathogen begins. The Panel concluded that the magnitude of potential consequences and risks of a loss of containment/outbreak for the NBAF are wellrepresented by the quantitative assessment being performed for FMDv and RVFv. It is reasonable and valuable to assess the risk of all eight of the proposed NBAF pathogens, in particular pathogens such as Niv and Hev which must be handled at BSL4. However, a full quantitative assessment of risk (to include fate, transport and deposition modeling) for all eight pathogens was not found by the Panel to be necessary or entirely feasible (e.g. for Nipah and Hendra) until the NBAF design is more mature and additional published data and validated models are available. In particular, a full quantitative assessment of risk for Nipah and Hendra will be far more meaningful and accurate as more data regarding their transmissibility, pathogenesis, susceptibility, etc. are determined by the scientific community. Part of the mission of NBAF is to respond to emerging threats. If a new, highly infectious and transmissible organism were to arise, NBAF would be the likely facility designated to investigate (beyond the diagnostic role where the samples are logged and discarded). It must be noted that the Panel's assessment is limited to the eight pathogens which have been represented, and that further analysis will be required if the NBAF undertakes research or studies with organisms with a higher infectious potential for humans. October 2010 C30 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Other Pathogen Considerations In addition to the eight pathogens listed as major NBAF priorities, other pathogens may be used or stored at the facility. The Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (FADD) School held at PIADC does not demonstrate for training purposes the highconsequence zoonotic diseases on the research list: RVF, JEv, Niv, or Hev. The training program demonstrates several pathogens that are not included in the NBAF research plan: African horse sickness disease (contagious, paramyxovirus) Avian influenza (contagious, H5N2 strain that does not cause disease in humans) Peste des Petits Ruminants (contagious, paramyxovirus) It is expected that these FADD School training demonstrations will continue once this function migrates to the NBAF. Additional diseases that may be demonstrated at PIADC include: Rinderpest (contagious, paramyxovirus) Goat Pox (contagious, poxvirus) Lumpy Skin disease (insectborne, poxvirus, may be emerging) Swine Vesicular disease (contagious; picornavirus; identical clinical signs, in pigs only, as FMD) Rinderpest is believed to be eradicated globally, so training demonstrations with this pathogen ceased in November 2009; however, it is conceivable that it might be shown in the future due to agroterrorism concerns. None of the above pathogens cause significant human disease. In order to perform the training mission, NBAF will have to store and propagate stocks of the above pathogens. Students will monitor the disease course, collect diagnostic samples, and perform necropsies to better understand the disease course and pathology. As a result of these activities, significant amounts of the pathogens will be in the facility solid and liquid waste streams. In addition to its training mission, the NBAF will also receive diagnostic samples from both domestic and international sources. Some of these samples may contain unknown pathogens. Typically diagnostic October 2010 C31 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report specimens are destroyed soon after agent identification. The amount of pathogen in each sample is generally small and considered a lower risk if handled properly. The NBAF may also continue the repository mission of PIADC. If so, small amounts of a wide variety of agricultural agents may be stored in secured freezers at the facility. This repository, or pathogen library, is extremely valuable for future research or disease outbreak investigations. References (2006). Emerging and Exotic Diseases of Animals. A. D.

Specifically, eight pathogens have been named in the NBAF EIS: 1) African Swine Fever virus (ASFv), 2) Classical Swine Fever virus (CSFv), 3) Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus (FMDv), 4) Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEv), 5) Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFv), 6) Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), 7) Hendra virus (Hev), and 8) Nipah virus (Niv). For the purposes of the EIS (December 2008) and its inherent hazard analysis and risk assessment, DHS selected FMDv, RVFv and Niv for modeling and as sessment (EIS E-12). Subsequent Government Accounting Office (GAO) review (GAO, July 2009) suggests and Congressional Law (P.L. 111-83 \u00a7 560) requires that DHS prepares an additional Site-Specifi c (Manhattan, Kansas) Risk Assessment (SSRA) for FMDv with a different plume modeling approach. This SSRA is to be completed before NBAF construction funds will be released. DHS elected to add RVFv to the SSRA to include the additional fidelity and design feedback associated with the m odeling and consideration of a zoonotic pathogen. Congress also conditioned the release of NBAF constr uction funding on a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) review of the SSRA. NAS recommended (NAS, March 2010) that all eight pathogens mentioned in the EIS be considered in the SSRA. DHS is motivated to provide the safest large-anim al biocontainment facility possible while minimizing construction delays (with significant delay costs) and satisfying Congressional requirements. NAS is motivated to seek the most comprehensive and comple te SSRA that addresses potential hazards and risks. The solution identified by DHS is to: Provide the full-fidelity modeling and assessment of risk for the FMDv and RVFv pathogens, and Provide a qualitative site-specific assessment of the risks (this Qualitative Risk Assessment or QRA) associated with the full suite of eight pathogens to inform the SSRA and supplement recommendations and conclusions for design and operations feedback.

October 2010 C45 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Appendix C: QRA SME Panel Meeting Notes October 2010 C46 Conclusions Pathogen Do these eight pathogens \"bound the list\" of foreseeable NBAF pathogens? Affirmative, in general (panel). Some discussion about the potential of need for research on pox viruses and hantavirus es and SARSlike pathogen s. Panel agrees that no prion diseases will need to be include d in NBAF research. TT Panel No H5N1 or H1N1 research should be conducted at the NBAF . Panel None of the eight would survive the engineered containmen t systems, if used properly. WW, PK, JK The panel suggests that, for modeling purposes, FMDv is an appr opriate repre sentative pathogen for a fomite transfer scenario. Panel The panel suggests that, for modeling purposes, FMDv is an appr opriate repre sentative RVFv are good representa tive ) econo mic conseque nces of outbreak impa ct. TM Handling of large animals in BSL4 (Hev, Niv) does present some additional risk. Panel Design NBAF auto clave specification will include a high temperature requirement of no less than 146\u00baC. PL There are no concerns about the effica cy of plann ed engine ering systems to contain all eight of the pathog ens. Panel No BSL2 effluent deconta mination system is needed at NBAF . (No consideratio n should be given to using the BSL3 effluent decontamination system for BSL2 effluent.) Panel Floor drain strategy is acceptable. (Panel) Strategy is for no floor drains, exce pt showers, in BSL3E (including \"Special Procedure\" rooms) , cappe d floor drains in BSL4, open floor drains with removable strainers and grating in BSL3A g (and BSL4 and ABSL4) animal holding rooms. Eyewash stations have no drains. SF Fire escapes from BSL3 will not lead directly outdoors but into a containme nt area. PK The currently proposed backup carcass disposal system, and alkaline hydrolysis digester, should be effective in destroying all eight pathoge ns. Panel Current NBAF design strategy for air handling systems is accepta ble to the panel. This includes the following strategy elements: BSL3 contai nment Panel Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C47 BSL3Ag: single intake HEPA/double (series) exhaust HEPA (no parallel series path) BSL4: single intake HEPA/ double (serie s) exhaust HEPA The endorse ment of this air handlin g strategy follo wed discussion about a perceived design standard (reference d by the BMBL) described in the ARS Facility Design Standar ds 242.1 , July 2002, that indicates BSL3Ag exhaust air should have doubl e (series) HEPA in a parallel redunda nt configuration. For reference, the relevant section of 242.1 (9.4.4.C.6) is provided below: The most severe requi rements for these modern, high level biocontainment facilities include HEPA filters arranged both in series and in parall el on the exhaust side, and series HEPA filters on the supply side of the HVAC systems serving \"high risk\" areas where large amounts of aerosols containing BSL3Ag agents could be expected [e.g., large animal rooms, cont aminated corridors, necropsy areas, carcass disposal facilities, etc.] The panel expressed concern regarding the practicali ty (size, space, config urati on, mainte nance, costs, of parallel (fully redu ndant) series HEPA exhaust pathw ay. Operations The specific protocol for maintaining and operating the incinera tion system needs to be developed and validated. Panel Recommendations Design Some engine ering (enviro nmen t conditioning, ventilation, etc.) may have to be performed to acco mmo date small/ medium animal cagin g systems. PK There is some concern over the \"dual use\" necrops y suite. Converting between contain ment levels may be problema tic. The panel suggests that additional design consideration be given to the incorporation of a dualuse necropsy suite. SF, PK, Panel Do not restrict pote ntial research activities by lack of engine ering . (Allow for equipme nt additions, proced ural flexibility, etc., that can accommod ate future research need s.) PK Do not desig n dedicated facility space/configuration s for lowlikel ihood programs or speculations. SF Current desig n consid erati ons do not specifically include (or exclude) the accommodation of bats, wild birds, lizards, arthropods, small rodents, and aerosol room facilities. The panel suggests that design consi deration be given to ensur e that nothing in design would preclude the addition of such systems in the future. SF, Panel BSL4 should have a dedicated deconta mination room, which could also be used as an emerge ncy exit, with VHP deconta mination. Panel Containmen t design strategy should ensure that emergency exits from BSL4, BSL3Ag, and BSL3E suites and facili ties should flow into the BSL3 contai nme nt area. Placement of BSL3 contain ment area emerge ncy exits should be well considered and accessible to emerge ncy responders and, possibly, portable decontamination equipme nt. Panel Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C48 Special desig n considerati on should be given to minimizin g the potential for loss of contain ment via the dunk tank well(s) between BSL3 and BSL2. Panel The panel suggests that desig n conside ration be given to the incorporation of dampers and HEPA caissons into the containme nt ceiling. Such designs are currently being incorporated into other facilities. PL, panel Special desig n considerati on should also be given to the reduction/removal of all facility and equip ment (pennin g, gating, etc) hazard s (pinch points, sharps, etc.) that could damage/com promise PPE while worker s are in the BSL4 animal handling areas. Panel Special desig n considerati on should be given to sizing the chemical showers in the BSL4 area. Shower s should be able to acco mmodate 2 persons to permi t 360\u00b0 inspection of PPE by each person . Shower size should also take into consideration the potential need for emerge ncy decontamination in the case of injury or sudden illnes s. PK, Panel The panel suggests that the BSL4 animal handli ng spaces, in particular, provide for chutes as oppose d to \"head squeeze\" chutes\u2014to reduce the potential of staff injury. Panel Special desig n considerati on should be given to all animal transit pathways to provide \"rounded\" (or radiused\") corners and proper lighting to assist in animal movem ent motivation. AH, SF, Panel The panel suggests that all animal matting systems be free of sharp edges or corners in the traction pattern to help minimize the potential of airborne feces spray, \"buildup\" and the subsequen t need for more labor intensive (and potentially high risk) matt cleaning. Matt adhesives must provide complet e and longterm attachment to subfloor. Suggest a combina tion of SOP changes and harde r floor surfaces to get feces flow and to prevent animals from lying in their own waste. An alternative is straight hard epoxy floors with floating mats that can be pulled out (without getting in pen) and cleaned on both sides. PL, SF, Panel The panel suggests that designers cons ider washdo wn system fixtures or other solutions that will minimize the potential for repetitive stress injuries to animal care workers. (Risks may increase if worker injury/discomfort influences applica tion of full cleaning protocols.) PK, Panel The panel suggests that designers include (or at least don't preclude) the use of twoway commu nication systems for the enca psulation suits to be worn in BSL4. Also suggeste d that modified suits be used with large anima ls in the BSL4. DD, PL It is suggested that desig n consideration be given to escape routes for workers in large animal BSL4. PL The panel suggests that desig n conside ration be given to a relativ ely new decontamina tion system that uses a reverse polymerizatio n (a produ ct/process being marke ted by Environme ntal Waste International, a Canadian company) proces s for \"red bag\" waste and other contaminated materi als. Process would provide redu ndan cy to incinera while reduci ng waste and produc ing ener gy. Panel, PL The panel recommends that no skirts be used around the hydraul ic lifting components of the necropsy table. It is more difficult to clean and less likely to be cleaned if skirt is in place. Panel Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C49 It is suggested that desig n consideration be given to the accommo dation of the potential for temporary use of organic bedding for research that may involve the use of neonatal large animals. SB The panel suggests that desig n conside ration be given to features that conne ct the throat/chu te of any carcas s disposal options to any containme nt area. Panel The panel suggests that additional consideration (renderer, digester, RP, other) be given to the selection of carcass disposal systems, particularly for the BSL4. Is there intent to provide redundant carcass disposal systems? Panel Operations Risk assessments should be on ongoin g part of NBAF operations and prior to starting work on any new research prog ram. (panel) Panel Procedural training and biosafety traini ng specific for each research program and for each pathogen must be freque nt and rigorous. (pan el) Panel NBAF policy should include arrangeme nts with local med ical facilities (Mercy Regional Health Center, perhaps) and providers for human med ical services specifi cally related to zoonotic path ogens and potential laboratoryrelated injuries. Panel suggested onsite medi cal area housing nine quarantin e (isolation) beds in the event that workers are exposed during a spill scenario. Staff rehearsals of potential scenarios are also suggested . (pan el) Panel NBAF proce dures must include valida ted protocols for the transfe r of inactivated materials from a higher contai nme nt level to a lower containm ent level\u2014i ncluding BSL2. Panel Dunk tanks (included in current design ) are effective for surface decontamination of a triple bagged prod uct only. Decontamination solution (active ingre dients, additives, temperature, etc.) should be determi ned by protocol and validated for contac t time, concentration, and effectiveness. Panel Design and procedures should minimize the likeliho od of having contain ment boundary failure when the volume of dunk tank solution is too low to maintain containm ent betw een both sides. Panel The panel suggests that desig n conside ration be given to providing \"360\u00b0\" access to penned animals in the BSL4 area. Additionally, design consideration should be given to a supplie d breathing air system that accom modate s worker movemen t for the \"360\u00b0\" acce ss while keeping air supply air supply lines from the reach of penne d animals. Penned animals should also be unab le to reach any wallmoun ted systems. PL, Panel The panel suggests that NBAF policies include provisions for the hiring/develo pmen t/main tenance of EMT certifica tions for some staff members . This suggestion is intended to help mitigated risks associated with assisting injured or ill personnel while in containm ent, and stabilizing such patie nts while be deconta minate d for removal from contai nme nt. JK, Panel Consideration should be given to the validation of the digester with each of the pathogens, as well as pH and temperature of the residue released into the waste water treatment system. Panel, PK, BE Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C50 Adequate and frequent training programs are neede d to ensure that personne l are familiar with the complicate d building automati on systems. DD Observation or Question Pathogen ASFv and CSFv may be the most \"robust\" or \"survivable\" pathoge ns of the eight. WW, PK, JK CBPP is very difficult to transmit. PK Current FADD Course and PIADC includes infections with ASFv, CSFv, CBPP, and FMDv. Additional FADD diseases that are currently demonstrated at PIAC D include African Horse Sickn ess (AHS) (causative agent: AHS virus), Sheep (PPRv). Notably, none of these pathog ens cause significant human disease. Panel, WW, TT Future resear ch needs for all 8 pathoge ns may involve pathogenes is, routes of entry, viremia, and counter meas ure studies. WW ASFv and CSFv research needs strain characterization, pathoge nesis, counter meas ures, vaccin ng arthropods for ASFv), aerosol, infectio us does, route of entry studies, and specialty contaminatio n issues. (pan el) Panel FMDv resear ch needs may be much the same as other programs (like those mentioned for ASFv and CSVv) but will include more on DIVA vaccines, sterile immunity, carrier state in animals (impacts on outbreaks) evalua tion and devel opment of diagnostics, and immuni ty duration. Panel JEv may have some special facility needs. Transovarial studies could require BSL3 insectary. Current NBAF design has Insectary in BSL3E. Such research may be done at other faciliti es (Laramie, BRI), however. Which vectors (mosqui toes) in U.S. are susceptible and will ampl ify virus? Panel Hev and Niv research may involve smalle r animals (fruit bats? ). If we accommod ate such animal mod els with equipment, design needs to include consider ations consistent with contain ment and capture of small animals. North American bats can get potentially get infected. Niv is a potential agent of terrorism. PK DD, WW PK CBPP research needs include differ entia l diagnoses and vaccine development/ testing. Panel Are American Bison susceptible to CBPP? More data neede d. PK CBPP eradicated from America in late 19th century. CBPP is low risk for entry to US. It is difficult to get a \"take\" at FADD school. Even 100200 mL direct injection to lungs may only result in a 50% infection rate. WW Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C51 feasibili descri ption of futur e progr ams that should be consul ted\u2014 includes Cyril Gay input. PK Peste des Petits Ruminan ts (PPR) may be an interesting disease for study at NBAF. This virus may soon be \"eradicated\" but it remains in many freezer s around the world. However, rinderpest is on the rise in small rumina nts. WW PK RVF resear ch with mosquitoes may be more approp riate for BRI. WW The need for an Insectary at NBAF (que stion posed by EC) may be to study vesicular stomatitis (answer by WW). EC WW A possible animal mode l for the study of Hev is ferrets. Would ferrets be an animal that could be accommodate d by current NBAF plans? (AH) Yes, with additional equipment\u2014 but no required design changes. Make use of ABSL3 or add caging systems to BSL3Ag. AH SF Swine Vesicular Disease is another pathogen of pote ntial research inter ests at NBAF. desig ned) systems (and like Virkon S) will effectively inactivate SVDv. PK introduction (outbreak ) of any exoti c (new ) disease will have an econo mic impact. The magnitude of the impact is influe nced by actual and effective trade bans. It is not clear that an outbreak of each of the eight patho gens would result in actua l trade bans; although, it's likely that Swine Fevers, FMD, and RVF would have significan t trade impa cts. Most of these diseases are formerly listed as \"List A\" pathogens the OIE's list. Niv and Hev would proba bly not trigger automatic actual trade bans but may trigger effective trade bans. TM Manhattan, KS wants to have capabili ty to diagnose and treat locally for quicker response. The need for advanced diagnostics in the local comm unity is recognized. TT, BP, BE Further discussion is needed on Lab Response Netw ork (LRN). None of the eight pathoge ns are in LRN. NP Design There have been no infected animal escapes at Plum Island or Winnipeg. (WW) WW Necropsy is the highest risk activity/facility due to generation of large amounts of infectious liquids. Consideration should be given to mitiga ting splash and spray hazards. Should necropsy be performed in BSL4 or carcass disposal only? JK, WW, SF Band saw at Ames is not used for segm entation very often and is not sugg ested on a level 4 animal. JK Will NBAF be able to do large animal studies with insects? (PL) Maybe in smaller animal holding rooms with additional equipme nt and some minor engine ering . Such rooms may require low ceilings. PL SF PL The exposure of large animals to an aero sol is usually accomplished with a mask for the animal as opposed to creating an aerosol in a space. WW Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C52 Is it possible that other animal mode ls will be used at NBAF? (WW ) It is possible, but other animal mod els may require speciali zed equipm ent and proce dural modifications \u2014large animal mod els are part of the core NBAF mission. SF, DD Floors will be covered with a highperfor mance resin finish. (SF) One sugges ted product is Septi plex, a polyurethane . PL BSL3Ag waste and effluent are much more difficult to manage that BSL3 waste and effluent because of the animal waste products (including solid fraction), feed waste, and other miscellaneous small solids. Panel UV decontamination systems should not be included as part of containme nt practi ces or as part of the engineere d containme nt systems. Panel Flooring systems, such as the Tenderfoot\u00ae system may need to be accom modat ed in the BSL3Ag and BSL4 animal handlin g area s. Design should not preclude the safe and practical use of such systems. SF Vapor decontamination systems should be included in ductwork design. PL There has been no \"red bag\" accident (known loss of contain ment) reported by the failure of engine ered systems in the last 2030 years. PL Animal weighing systems can be proble matic. A sugg ested approach is to use portable scales. SF Large animal handlin g in a BSL4 area adds to desig n considerations for doors. Ambulatory animals will step over thresholds but nonambula tory animals and large equipm ent may be difficult to navigate with large thresholds. In addition, doors must be able to withstand a blow from a large animal moving at high speed (with stand impact at 35mph from 1500lb animal). Some door providers have had high failure rates (welds, seals) in the past and NBAF should devel op thorough inspection and testing protocols for all doors. Panel, DD An observation was made that compressible door seals do require power to reseal. (anon.) Discussion of potential washing systems include the following example: 1) initial wash with high volume/ low pressure hose to get solids to drain, 2) second wash with high pressure to get pack ed solids off, 3) decontami nation, 4) final high pressure wash after animals are gone. SF The clean/dir ty corridor system will be compartme ntalized to minimize the impact/response neede d if a \"dirty\" animal is accid ently introduced into a clean corridor. SF Design should include nonambulatory animal move ment systems (winches and hoists)\u2014 current design featur es appear to include these features. SF, Panel Observations were made on the importance of isolation and flexible moun ting for the throat (of loading chute) of any carcass disposal system. Moveme nt between the throat and the contai nment floor can cause damage and poten tial leaks in the contai nme nt area. PL Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C53 The panel has mixe d opinions and experiences with the inclusion of maceratio n systems in effluent decontamina tion pathways of animal holdi ng rooms. Animal and other miscellaneous solids (feed, rubb er, detritus, etc.) complicate the inactivation process but macerators are prone to failure and require mainte nance. Panel Operations Some proced ure additions , such as necropsy splash shields, may provide some risk reduction benefit by reducing the spread of infectious liquids, aerosols and tissue. JK, DD Should animal careta kers wear respiratory protection (N95) in BSL3Ag? WW Blood from exsanguination (common first step in necropsy) goes directly into floor drains. SF Can arthropod work be done in BSL4? (DD) None currently anticipated. Panel NBAF is not intended to be a universal research facility. There are other research facilities in the US that are better equipped to handle some research programs. Selectivity of mission will help minimize risks. Panel Mecuric chloride should not be used as a disinfe ctant at NBAF. (DD) Acids and oxidizers (like Virkon S) work well against most pathogens. (JK) Virkon S may damage conc rete. BE Vapor decontamination pathways should be validated for effica cy of transfer material deconta mination and for facility/fixture decontamination (door seals, closures, etc.) Panel All vapor decontamination sources and liquid deconta mination solutions should be validated prior to use/incorporation into SOPs. Panel FedEx currently provides a \"white glove \" service for delivery of important samples to PIADC. FedEx may be able to offer a similar service for NBAF but this need may be mitigated by the geographic location selected for NBAF . WW, Panel Some probl ematic issues have been noted regarding the shipment of infectious materials betwee n eligible facilities. Such issues should be resolved to minimize the potential for \"workarounds\" that may result in unsafe or illegal transfer activities. PK, Panel Other than commonly used BSL4 practi ces, the handling and care of large animals in BSL4 will require significan t investment in the development of protocols and procedures. A few examples of BSL4 animal managem ent include: feces collection and managem ent, a staff \"buddy\" system, outer footwear selection (nonslip capabiliti es consistent with floor finish and animal operations, steel toe, shank, etc.), cleaning, etc. PL, JK, Panel Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report QRA SME Meeting Discussion Notes Speaker(s) Octob er 2010 C54 Qualitative Risk/Hazard Assessment Final Report Appendix D: QRA Final Report Reviewers October 2010 C55 Larry Barrett, Ph.D. Director, Plum Island Animal Disease Center DHS, Science and Technology Directorate John D.

Scope of the Effort The Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate (through the Office of National Laboratories) has the primary responsibility to develop the National Bio and AgroDefense Facility (NBAF) emergency response plan (ERP) covering preparedness, response and recovery. The NBAF ERP will follow components in the National Incident Management System (NIMS; http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims /). The NBAF ERP will provide guidance and direction to assure an integrated and coordinated response to emergency situations (e.g., an accidental or intentional release of footandmouth disease virus or other hazardous pathogen from the facility, hazardous chemical spill, weatherrelated event, etc.). It will support/define the response efforts both horizontally across the Federal Government and vertically among Federal, State, and local entities. In addition the ERP will address NBAF's response to emergencies and other incidents occurring at nearby facilities (e.g., Kansas State University, Biosecurity Research Institute) or within the local community that could impact the operations and/or security at NBAF. The ERP will build upon the documents prepared, or to be prepared, in support of the NBAF site selection and the preconstruction/construction of the actual facility. The ERP will be developed and implemented prior to beginning operations of the NBAF. 2. Organizations who will be Engaged in the ERP Development The NBAF ERP will be the responsibility of the ONL Operations and Oversight Group working with appropriate NBAF staff (e.g., Laboratory Director, Operations Director, and Responsible Official [RO] for biological select agent and toxins [BSTA]). ONL will reach out for support/expertise in developing the ERP to other organizations such as: S&T ChemBio Division and S&T Laboratories (PIADC and NBACC) Other DHS Components (e.g., Office of Security, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency) U.S. Army Garrison, USAMRIID, and other National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) partners at Ft.

The emergency response plans will include, but not be limited to, clearly indentifying and articulating the procedures for the following: Emergency notification Medical emergency Evacuation of buildings and/or site (including those with disability) Fire Tornado, earthquake, or flood Criminal or violent behavior including demonstration/civil disturbance, bomb threat, etc. Hazardous materials release (e.g., biological select agents and toxins, pathogens other than BSAT, flammable/ combustible gases in labs and storage areas, radioactive material, oil spill or leak) including shipments to the NBAF Utility failure Building system failure (e.g., response actions to discharge scenarios such as ventilation October 2010 D4 NBAF SSRA Report problem resulting in loss of negative pressure in containment spaces, effluent waste discharge problem, natural gas leak, breaches of primary biocontainment) The ERP will address an emergency at facilities in proximity to the NBAF (e.g., KState TRIGA Mark II research reactor used to train nuclear reactor operators) that might affect NBAF operations. 3.3 NBAF Operational Plans The ERP will be integrated with the appropriate NBAF operational plans including, but not limited to: Incident Response Plan (IRP) for biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) per 73.14, 7 CFR 331.14 and 9 CFR 121.14 (including plans for theft, loss or release of BSAT in compliance with Federal statutes; accidental releases or occupational exposures will be immediately reported to APHIS Agricultural Select Agent Program via Form 3; BSATexposed animals will be handled in the same manner as the agent or toxin itself for the purpose of reporting a BSAT theft, loss or release to appropriate Federal, state and local agencies). The IRP will address pathogens other BSAT. Biological Safety Plan Biosecurity Incident Response Plan for NonBiological Incident Occupant Emergency Plan for the laboratory/animal room sections and for administrative sections of the NBAF Security Plan (facility, physical, policies for personnel, data and cyber) Emergency Preparedness (drills, training and documentation, securing building contents, building evacuation diagram and plan) Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan 3.4 Supporting Agreements for the Plan Effective implementation of the NBAF ERP will require MOU's or formal agreements with local, state, and Federal authorities (and others as necessary) for mutual aid and sharing/ utilization of resources (personnel, equipment, and facilities). In order to assure effective emergency management operations, there exists the need to coordinate activities of government agencies or other entities which provide mutual aid and have their own incident response plans. Per the NIMS model, protocols must be in place to designate the overarching authority to manage and coordinate structure and concurrent implementation processes consistent with their responsibilities. These may include: Kansas State University (KSU) KSU's Biosecurity Research Institute (BRI) City of Manhattan, KS Riley County Ft. Riley (Chemical unit, Bomb Unit, Irwin Army Community Hospital, possibly setting up special immunization program [SIP] with new hospital being built, etc.) Hospital/Facility emergency plan at local and regional hospitals (e.g., Mercy Regional Health Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital at Ft.

October 2010 D10 NBAF SSRA Report Appendix E: Proposed Procedure for Select Agent Registration Permitting (including Foot and Mouth Disease Virus) for the National Bio\u00adand Agro\u00ad Defense Facility (NBAF) October October 2010 E2 NBAF SSRA Report I. Purpose The purpose of this report is to provide an outline of the procedure that will be used to obtain the registration and permit for biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) for the NBAF. The NBAF will be sited at Manhattan, Kansas on the Kansas State University. The FY10 appropriations language requires that Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), submit to Appropriation Committees a report that describes the procedure that will be used to issue the permit to conduct live Foot and Mouth Disease virus (FMDV) research at the NBAF under Section 7524. The BSAT registration and permit process will follow the established USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Agricultural Select Agent Program procedures. II. Background on NBAF A. Mission of NBAF (extend the research and diagnostic capabilities of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center [PIADC]) DHS is charged with the responsibility and has the national stewardship mandate for detecting, preventing, protecting against, and responding to terrorist attacks within the U.S. These responsibilities, as applied to the defense of animal agriculture, are shared with USDA and require a coordinated strategy to adequately protect the Nation against threats to animal agriculture. Consultations between DHS and USDA on a coordinated agricultural research strategy, as called for in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-296) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9), ''Defense of U.S. Agriculture and Food,'' dated January 30, 2004, revealed a capability gap that must be filled by an integrated research, development, test, and evaluation infrastructure for combating agricultural and public health threats posed by foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate is responsible for addressing the identified gap. Accordingly, to bridge the capability gap and to comply with HSPD-9, DHS proposed to build the NBAF, an integrated research, development, test, and evaluation facility. Colocating DHS with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection ServiceVeterinary Services (APHIS-VS) and Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at the NBAF would enable research, diagnostics, and responses to outbreaks in agricultural animals (i.e. cattle, swine, and sheep) at a U.S. based facility. Colocating these functions in a single secure facility would maximize synergies and provide enhanced capabilities for the detection and prevention of foreign animal diseases in the U.S. The NBAF would meet the capabilities required in HSPD-9 by providing a domestic, modern, integrated highcontainment facility containing laboratories and animal rooms for an estimated 250 to 350 scientists and support staff to safely and effectively address the accidental or intentional introduction into the U.S. of high consequence foreign animal, emerging and zoonotic diseases. Currently, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), where much of the research on foreign animal diseases is performed, is an essential component of the national strategy for protecting U.S. agriculture from threats caused by intentional attack (i.e., agroterrorism) or unintentional introduction of foreign animal October 2010 E3 NBAF SSRA Report disease viruses such as foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). However, PIADC was built in the 1950s, is nearing the end of its lifecycle, and does not contain the necessary biosafety level facilities to meet the NBAF research requirements. The NBAF would fulfill the need for a secure U.S. facility that could support collaborative efforts among researchers from Federal and state agencies, academia, and international partners to perform necessary research at the required biosafety level (BSL)3Ag/4. Additionally, as discussed in the Report of the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Proliferation and Terrorism (December 2008) and Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism Report Card (January 2010), the U.S. should continue to undertake a series of mutually reinforcing domestic measures to prevent bioterrorism. Prior to passage of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (H.R. 6124 [2008 Farm Bill]), which became law on May 22, 2008, the U.S. Code (21 U.S.C. Section 113a) required that live FMDV could not be studied on the U.S. mainland unless the Secretary of Agriculture made a determination that such study was necessary and in the public interest and issued a permit for such research to be conducted on the mainland. Section 7524 of the 2008 Farm Bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a permit to the Secretary of Homeland Security for work on the live FMDV at any facility that is a successor to PIADC and charged with researching high consequence biological threats involving zoonotic and foreign animal diseases. The permit is limited to a single successor facility. DHS conducted a competitive site selection process to identify and evaluate potential candidate sites for the NBAF. The site selection process was initiated by publication of a Notice of Request for Expressions of Interest (EOI) submissions for Potential Sites for the NBAF in the Federal Register on January 19, 2006 (71 FR 3107-3109). DHS developed and implemented a rigorous process for the evaluation of the EOI submissions received, against DHS's four evaluation criteria (i.e., Proximity to Research Capabilities relevant to the NBAF mission, Proximity to Workforce, Acquisition/Construction/Operations Requirements, and Community Acceptance) and associated subcriteria. These criteria and their associated sub criteria were developed by an interagency working group to ensure that the NBAF would meet the interdependent needs of DHS and USDA to adequately protect the Nation against biological threats to animal agriculture. In July 2007, DHS identified five site alternatives that surpassed others in meeting the DHS evaluation criteria, subcriteria, and DHS preferences, and determined that they, along with the Plum Island Site and a No Action Alternative, would be evaluated in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) as reasonable alternatives for the proposed NBAF. DHS published the Preferred Alternative Selection Memorandum in December 2008 (see the DHS Web site at http://www.dhs.gov/nbaf ), which describes the basis for the selection of the Preferred Alternative. DHS's Preferred Alternative to construct and operate the NBAF is the Manhattan Campus Site in Manhattan, Kansas (Record of Decision in the Federal Register on January 16, 2009; 74 FR 30653080). October 2010 E4 NBAF SSRA Report B. NBAF Facility Design Process DHS will implement specific risk mitigation measures in the design, construction, and operation of the NBAF. The facility will be designed to meet containment requirements set forth in USDA guidelines and BMBL guidelines, as well as the National Research Council and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Care (AAALAC). In addition, the design process takes into account the construction and operations lessons learned from other similar biocontainment laboratories in the U.S. and around the world. Laboratory visits and interviews were conducted to gather the necessary information that can be used to inform the present NBAF design process. PIADC, the current facility where live FMDV research is currently conducted, has provided significant input into the design using their 50+ years of operating experience. In addition, architectural design features, biocontainment technologies, operational procedures, training and protocols, and waste management technologies and procedures to minimize operational and environmental risks will be incorporated. Risk assessments are performed as part of the design process to ensure robust design and operating procedures are developed. For example, a Threat and Risk Assessment was done for the NBAF site in Manhattan, KS that will be used to develop a comprehensive riskbased physical and personnel security program for the NBAF. A sitespecific risk assessment has been conducted for the NBAF that identifies facility and operational risks that require mitigation strategies. The mitigation strategies will require robust physical containment barriers, such as specialized air handling systems for contamination control. Additionally, DHS will consider, where applicable, recommendations from other reports that provide lessons learned information to improve or enhance design for biosafety and biosecurity. For example, NBAF will consider the recommendations of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on perimeter security found in the September 2008 Report to Congressional Committees entitled Biosafety Laboratories: Perimeter Security Assessment of the Nation's Five BSL-4 Laboratories (GAO081092). C. Biosafety and Biosecurity In addition to implementing robust design features, DHS will have sitespecific standard operating procedures and response plans in place prior to the initiation of research and diagnostic activities at the NBAF to minimize risks of select agent release. The operating procedures will cover both biosafety and biosecurity. Biosafety refers to the application of combinations of laboratory practices and procedures, laboratory facilities, safety equipment, and appropriate occupational health programs when working with potentially infectious microorganisms and other biohazards. Biosecurity and personnel reliability are related to laboratory biosafety and biocontainment. The principles of biosafety and biocontainment have been articulated in two key reference documents: the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (first published in 1976), and the CDC/NIH manual Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL , initially issued in 1984; 5th edition released online in 2007). These documents have been amended and revised over the years to reflect advances in science and technology. The BMBL is generally recognized as the code of practice for biosafety and biocontainment in the U.S. October 2010 E5 NBAF SSRA Report The DHS policies for biosafety and biosecurity comply with current Federal regulations, guidelines, and policies for DHSsponsored activities involving biological agents including the Select Agent Regulations [7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 331, 9 CFR 121, 42 CFR 73], the current edition of the BMBL and the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules , as appropriate. The Instruction Handbook for DHS Personnel Suitability (12101007) serves a general role in personnel reliability across the Department by establishing screening requirements and processes for all individuals who require unescorted access to DHS owned facilities, DHScontrolled facilities, or commercial facilities operating on behalf of DHS. Various Biological Personnel Reliability Program (BPRP) and biosurety related elements are implemented at PIADC, as well as the other DHSoperated laboratory, the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) under their specific policies and procedures. PIADC and NBACC have developed facilitywide policies and operating procedures pertaining to biosafety, biosecurity, and personnel reliability. These policies and procedures comply with Federal regulations on select agents, support the overall DHS policies and apply to all staff, subcontractors, or visitors that have access to BSAT. DHS will utilize the operational expertise from the policies and procedures at these laboratories, as well as other applicable operating laboratories, in the final development of its permit application process for NBAF. When the NBAF is operational, it will comply with all applicable Federal regulations, guidelines and policies. PIADC had a 3day inspection by the USDA APHIS Select Agent Program on January 57, 2010 (inspection team included the Deputy Director for the CDC Select Agent Program). The inspection covered the biosafety and biosecurity laboratory procedures used to manage live FMDV in the laboratory. The out brief comments from the USDA APHIS inspector were very positive for the select agent program and no major deficiencies were noted. The NBACC BSAT programs are currently being conducted at USAMRIID (until the new facility is operational) and NBACC employees are working under USAMRIID's BPRP. DHS has a full time biosurety officer engaged in the day to day oversight of the DHS biocontainment laboratories and advising the laboratories on their biosafety and biosecurity practices. II. Background on Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Public Law 107188), entities that possess, use, or transfer biological toxins or agents deemed a threat to public health must register with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been designated by the HHS Secretary as the agency responsible for implementing the provisions of the law for HHS. This Act includes the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 (ABPA; subtitle B) where entities that possess, use, or transfer agents or toxins deemed a severe threat to animal or plant health or products must notify and register with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA APHIS has been designated by the Secretary as the agency responsible for implementing the provisions of the law for USDA. The FMDV permit falls under the USDA APHIS Agricultural Select Agent Program purview. October 2010 E6 NBAF SSRA Report The Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) is a joint program from HHS/CDC and USDA APHIS that regulates Federal and nonFederal entities that possess, use or transfer biological select agents and toxins (BSAT). Although CDC and APHIS differ in their overall scope, the BSAT regulations are the same. The regulations [Title 7 CFR Part 331: Plant select agents, Title 9 CFR Part 121: Animal and overlap select agents and toxins, Title 42 CFR Part 73: HHS select agent and toxins] require certain conditions to be met in order to possess, use, and transfer BSAT. Per 7 CFR Part 331.7(g), 9 CFR part 121.7 (g), and 42 CFR 73.7 (g), the entity registration number will be valid only for the specific select agents and toxins, and the specified activities and locations provided by the entity in the application package (APHIS/CDC Form 1). BSAT registration for the NBAF USDA APHIS is responsible for implementing both the ABPA (registration of entities according to select agent regulations) and the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA; permitting regulations). Entities wishing to possess, use, or transfer select agents and toxins listed by APHIS must be in compliance with regulations pursuant to both Acts. DHS, in coordination with USDA, will work with APHIS staff to meet regulatory requirements of both Acts in the permit application process. 1. DHS will submit the BSAT registration after the NBAF is commissioned DHS and USDA have identified 8 diseases that would potentially be studied at the NBAF. The bioagents causing these diseases are select agents: footandmouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus, African swine fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony), Japanese encephalitis virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. This list may change based upon continued evaluation of risks to the U.S. agricultural system including threats to the food supply and public health. DHS will register the BSAT for the NBAF with USDA APHIS Agricultural Select Agent Program and any needed CDC involvement (e.g., NBAF research on overlap select agents such as zoonotic agents that can be transmitted from animals to humans) will be managed by APHIS according to APHISCDC standard operating procedures. Overlap select agents (e.g., in the NBAF, examples include Hendra virus, Nipah virus and Rift Valley Fever virus) and HHS select agents require the participation of the CDC Division of Select Agents and Toxins in the review and approval process, which APHIS will facilitate. DHS will be obtaining the certificate of registration for the NBAF to possess, use and transfer BSAT under the conditions that will be specified in the entity registration application submitted to APHIS. Registration of an entity requires: that an \"Application for Laboratory Registration for Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins\" (APHIS/CDC Form 1) be completed and submitted to APHIS; October 2010 E7 NBAF SSRA Report that the U.S. Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Service (CJIS) complete a security risk assessment (SRA) for the designated Responsible Official (RO), Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO), and all individuals who will have access to BSAT; and an inspection of the facility by FSAP. Before registration is granted, the facility must also meet biosafety requirements that are commensurate with the risk that the agent or toxin poses and must establish security measures that provide graded protection in accordance with the threat that the agent or toxin poses. For the NBAF Form 1 submission, the DOJ number section will be left blank since the NBAF is a new entity (a new entity must get DOJ numbers assigned to their employees regardless of whether the employees have had a DOJ number with another entity such as PIADC). The following is a general summary of the process: After the Form 1 has been submitted to APHIS, the entity Responsible Official (RO) submits a request to the FBI for fingerprint packets for all employees working with BSAT; APHIS will issue the entity a letter with the unique DOJ identifying numbers for each individual listed on the registration; The RO forwards to each individual their unique DOJ identifying number; The RO provides everyone with their own DOJ number and each individual fills out FBI form (FD961) and puts their unique identifying number in block 11; When fingerprint packets arrive, each individual follows all of the FBI instructions (http://www.fbi.gov\\hq\\cjisd\\cjis\\htm ) for submitting fingerprints and returns fingerprints to the entity RO; The RO will mail in bulk batches the completed fingerprint packets and FD961 forms to the FBI, CJIS. 2. Timeline Approximately 24 months before the NBAF is operational, DHS (working with USDA staff from PIADC will begin the planning, preparation and work needed for the submission of the Application for Laboratory Registration for Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins\" (APHIS/CDC Form 1). FMDV is a part of this select agent list. This activity will require the biological safety officer (BSO) to be onsite and working with each future NBAF principal investigator that will be working with BSAT in BSL3/3Ag/4 (laboratory and animal rooms) to gather the detailed information needed for the Form 1 submission. Extensive documentation must be prepared before the application can be submitted including the development of a statement of work objectives/planned use for each BSAT, description of the methods/procedures that will be used for each BSAT, list of BSAT storage room numbers, and BSAT use October 2010 E8 NBAF SSRA Report room numbers for each biosafety level (BSL) with a list of BSAT planned to be used in each of these rooms. Biosafety and security planning for select agents and toxins must consider graded protection commensurate with the risk of the select agent or toxin. The NBAF biosafety, security and incident response plans will incorporate the provisions of 9 CFR parts 121.11, 121.12 and 121.14. These plans will be reviewed as part of the registration and inspection process. Before the inspection is scheduled, DHS will: (1) assemble the trained staff, (2) develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) and plans (e.g.,safety, security, incident response, etc.), (3) install and certify IT infrastructure (e.g., laboratory information management system for BSAT inventory control), (4) stand up the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and (5) obtain the voluntary accreditation from AAALAC. 3. Other requirements for FSAP registering (sitespecific facility risk assessment) The entity application must include a sitespecific risk assessment of the facility that addresses vulnerabilities and threats (not limited to manmade events, but must include natural events as well). DHS, through the NBAF Design Partnership (NDP), has had Sandia National Laboratories' International Biological perform a threat and risk assessment (TRA) for the NBAF facility in Manhattan, KS. The TRA focused on a technical risk assessment of 418 different security scenarios with a technically robust risk assessment methodology. This report covers risk identification, risk assessment and risk characterization. The sitespecific TRA, along with applicable regulatory requirements and agency specific requirements, will be used to implement the necessary physical security system to meet the performance requirements of risk reduction for a BSL3/3Ag/4 facility. In addition to the security risk assessment, DHS has completed a sitespecific risk assessment to identify mitigation strategies needed for safe and secure operations of the NBAF facility. October 2010 E9 FY 2010 Complete plans for BSAT permit process (includes live FMDV) FY 2011 Finish NBAF design FY 2012 Start NBAF lab construction FY 2014 Begin NBAF BSAT registration application process FY 2016 Submit BSAT registration for NBAF (after commissioning of the facility) FY 2018 Begin live FMDV research at NBAF NBAF SSRA Report III. Permitting for the NBAF After a certificate of registration is granted, a permit according to the AHPA will be required for each select agent that the NBAF will possess. An APHIS/CDC Form 2 (transfer form) will be completed and approved by USDA/APHIS prior to any movement of live FMDV (and other select agents) to the NBAF. To plan accordingly and to ensure a thorough application process, DHS has already been in discussions with APHIS/VS Select Agent Program office to ensure that the AHPA permitting requirements are in place before live FMDV (and other BSAT) is moved from PIADC to NBAF. The permit process schedule is as follows: October 2010 E10 NBAF SSRA Report Appendix F: A Review of Recent Outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) October 2010 F1 NBAF SSRA Report October 2010 F2 NBAF SSRA Report 1. Foot and Mouth Disease Case Study Review Introduction Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a serious, highly contagious, viral disease that affects clovenhoofed animals. Although it typically does not cause death in healthy adult livestock, the disease can leave domestic and wild animals severely debilitated. FMD can reduce milk and meat products from animals, but the disease is most devastating on the agricultural structure and economy of the country affected. An outbreak of FMD can result in severe losses in production of milk and meat and in movement restrictions, completely stopping many agricultural exports. An FMD outbreak can affect the country's agricultural economy for many years. Clinical signs Presence of FMD within a group of animals is usually characterized by fever and blisterlike lesions followed by erosion on the tongue, lips, mouth and on the teats, and in between the hooves. The damage to hooves can cause lameness in the animal (APHIS Veterinary Services, 2007) and thus affect its ability to move, eat, and reproduce. Young animals experience a higher mortality rate, with a 20 percent or higher mortality rate in young calves, piglets, and lambs (US Animal Health Association Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). Animals of all ages with FMD may become anorexic and experience a sudden rise in temperature (FMD Info.org, 2010), which can often be mistaken for other more common diseases, and thus FMD can go undiagnosed and can spread the disease rapidly. In addition, some animals not exhibiting clinical signs can serve as virus hosts and spread the disease prior to veterinarian notification. Thus, the critical response time to an FMD breakout is limited (Rivas A.L., 2002). Thus, FMD is a particularly dangerous disease to the U.S. agricultural community because it has the potential to enter the country and spread prior to detection. Risk factors for disease spread An FMD outbreak has the potential to cause one of the largest U.S. agricultural losses of any foreign animal disease because of its ease of spread and ability to infect many species. FMD is likely the most contagious of all animal diseases due to (Ekboir, 1999): The small amount of infected dose required for effective transmission; The short incubation period of three to eight days; The release of the virus before the onset of clinical signs; The massive quantities of virus excreted from infected animals; The ability of the disease to spread rapidly over large distances; and The ability of the virus to survive in the environment. Because FMD is so easily spread, the primary defense against FMD within the United States has been to prevent the disease from entering the country. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and partner agencies work together to ensure that imported meat and animal products are FMD free. The USDA October 2010 F3 NBAF SSRA Report actively monitors for occurrence of FMD and other foreign animal diseases worldwide and works to evaluate the risk of exposure. Introduction into livestock populations Introduction of FMD into a livestock population can have severe impacts on the entire country's agricultural community. FMD can be introduced into a group of animals by infected animals or materials that have been exposed to the disease. FMD is a hardy virus that can easily contaminate vehicles, facilities, hay, or food; in the right environment, it can persist in contaminated items such as soil or manure for months (Government Accountability Office, 2002). While humans do not contract FMD, they can contribute in its spread when in contact with infected animals (FMD Info.org, 2010). Humans can act as carriers for the disease since FMD can survive 24 hours in the human respiratory system and for several weeks on clothing (Ekboir, 1999). Coupled with the fact that clinical signs can be mild or masked by other conditions, it can be difficult to rapidly diagnose FMD in order to prevent further spread. 2. Control strategies Prevention The primary control strategy employed by the U.S. agricultural community is prevention, using a two tier strategy: border control and active surveillance. Because FMD is usually introduced into a country by an infected animal or contaminated feed, the U.S. prohibits entrance of food products or animals and animal products from FMD endemic areas or countries that have not proven to be FMD free (Bashiruddin). All animals imported into the U.S. are monitored prior to entering the country (FMD Info.org, 2010). Disease control once in the country In case of confirmation of FMD on a farm within the U.S., many states, in coordination with the USDA, would activate emergency response plans that include measures to limit spread and exposure. Prompt identification is key to containing disease spread, so farmers and veterinarians are routinely educated on clinical signs and watch for signs of FMD. In addition, the USDA has tried to eliminate negative incentives for reporting of FMD by ensuring that farmers are fairly compensated for depopulated animals, including considerations for the short and longterm costs of the disease. Once FMD is confirmed, the goal is to eliminate the disease as quickly as possible, investigate the source, and trace all animals that may have been in contact with the disease. The USDA's first response to an outbreak would be \"stamping out\" or imposing animal movement restrictions, depopulation, and eradicating the disease immediately (APHISVeterinary Service, 2007). Response operations could include securing the affected site and establishing quarantine zones, tracing all contacts with the index farm, and establishing movement control (FMD Info.org, 2010). October 2010 F4 NBAF SSRA Report Response The manner and speed in which FMD develops in livestock depends on which strain of FMD virus is involved, as well as livestock characteristics (Veterinary Exotic Disease Division, 2004). Thus, the response to an outbreak of FMD within the United States would be tailored to the characteristics of the outbreak. The USDA has a prescribed response to an FMD outbreak, but this has not been tested on an actual FMD occurrence within the U.S. Once FMD has been controlled, APHIS would assist producers to recover from losses and evaluate the disease situation throughout the U.S. In order to be considered disease free, the U.S. must observe the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) rules on surveillance and disease eradication, and destroy all infected and vaccinated animals (OIE, 2005). Vaccination Because there are seven different serotypes of the FMD virus, all of which have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to prepare for a vaccine strategy on a largescale basis. Vaccination is also a controversial disease control technique because vaccine technology is rapidly evolving and due to economic effects of vaccination. Vaccination of livestock can help contain the disease if it is used strategically to create barriers between the infected and diseasefree areas. (APHISVeterinary Service, 2007) Currently, the U.S. vaccine bank stores several serotypes of FMD and its associated antigens and can provide hundreds of thousands of doses of FMD vaccine within days. There are several justifications for employing a vaccine strategy in case of an outbreak, and these include: Reducing the incidence of clinical disease in livestock when exposed to the virus; Reduction of the number of animals needing depopulation during an outbreak; Reduction of the amount of virus produced by the infected animals, thereby reducing the likelihood of disease spread (Veterinary Exotic Disease Division, 2004); and Rapid containment of the disease. In addition, new vaccines have many benefits, including being relatively inexpensive to produce and not requiring FMD materials to be made (McGinnis, 2007). In addition, new vaccines also allow scientists to determine whether an animal found to have FMD antibodies acquired them through vaccination or infection. This is a relatively new development that supports the use of vaccines. 3. Select examples of outbreaks of FMD across the world Although the United States has not experienced an outbreak of FMD since 1929, several countries have experienced outbreaks that have greatly the effected their economies. These examples provide an opportunity for education on containing and eradicating the disease, and show best practices for disease management. FMD in the United States FMD has been introduced into the U.S. on eight occasions on record. One of the larger outbreaks occurred in 1914 in Michigan. From Michigan, it spread to 22 states and contaminated the Chicago October 2010 F5 NBAF SSRA Report stockyards. During the outbreak, over 172,000 animals were depopulated (Ekboir, 1999). This incident was one of the first largescale foreign animal disease outbreaks to affect U.S. agriculture, and therefore widespread surveillance and notification mechanisms were not yet in place to prevent the spread of disease. Another serious outbreak occurred in 1924, when FMD was found in cattle in Alameda County, California (near the San Francisco Bay Area). The outbreak soon spread to 16 more counties before quarantines were established to prevent movement of animals, animal products, and vehicles to and from affected areas. Although this particular county in California is no longer primarily livestock, many California counties still have very large herds and are susceptible to disease. This outbreak greatly affected cattle, goats, swine, and sheep, as well as wild deer. Overall, over 109,000 herds were infected or depopulated with an approximate value (in nominal dollars) of $4,350,000. This would be the equivalent of over $54,000,000 in 2010 dollars. During this outbreak, 63 days elapsed before diagnosis and 90 days elapsed before declaration of an emergency, which contributed to the widespread nature of the disease. The cost of eradication was estimated at approximately $7 million (over $87 million in 2010 dollars); including compensation for destroyed animals. This cost does not include production or trade losses (Ekboir, 1999). Thus, the combined cost of this outbreak would equal over $1 billion in 2010 dollars, despite the limited spread of the disease. The current cattle population in California is over 4.7 million head (Juan Guerro, 1991), significantly more than in 1924, and more concentrated due to increased urbanization. Thus, an outbreak today would have an even greater impact on the state of California's economy and the U.S. export economy as well. Although reimbursement to farmers was considered in the calculation, the USDA today also calculates the cost of repopulation of the farm as compensation, so today's cost of an FMD outbreak would be relatively higher. The 1929 outbreak of FMD, the last domestic FMD outbreak, shows how improved surveillance and decreases in diagnosis delays are effective in reducing the impacts of the disease. The disease was diagnosed within three days of the emergence of clinical signs and an Emergency Declaration was issued within 10 days (Ekboir, 1999). Likely because of early recognition, only just over 3,000 animals were culled in this outbreak (or three percent of the number culled in 1924), and no wild deer showed clinical signs. Issues surrounding the U.S. outbreaks The 1924 outbreak and associated response shows how late identification and response increases the possibility for extended spread and economic effect on the agricultural sector. Because this outbreak was one of the earlier extended outbreaks of FMD, farmers were not acutely aware of the clinical signs of FMD and thus could not alert officials due to their lack of ability to identify the disease. It would be highly unusual for 63 days to elapse before the disease is diagnosed now because of better disease surveillance, and improved disease awareness and communication. In addition, although the disease had been diagnosed, three months passed before an emergency declaration was made. This time lag thwarted Federal officials from effectively coordinating and informing local farmers of prevention October 2010 F6 NBAF SSRA Report practices, movement control methods, and proper depopulation activities to be taken. In the U.S. today, federal assistance to coordinate these activities would arrive sooner. In addition, lack of rapid quarantine measures greatly affected the disease spread. In the 1914 outbreak, movement of animals was largely not controlled or monitored on the Federal and State levels, and this enabled the disease to spread across many states and regions of the country. When the disease was identified, quarantines were not put in place, thus the disease made the livestock industry less viable across the U.S., including the Chicago stockyard. Best practices and lessons learned The 1929 outbreak shows how improvements in disease eradication methods are effective in containing an outbreak. During the 1924 outbreak, farmers and government officials were aware of the threat and were able to correctly identify and eventually contain the disease. The rapid disease identification during the 1929 outbreak led to a swift emergency declaration, and thus movement control measures were put in place. The progression of emergency response that took place between the U.S. outbreaks also illustrates how close coordination between state, local and Federal officials can be an effective tool in disease eradication. During the 1929 outbreak, an Emergency Declaration was issued which allowed Federal, State, and local officials to work together and communicate on disease control efforts. The 1929 outbreak was the last recorded case of FMD within the U.S., but these outbreaks showed how improved surveillance greatly decreases the disease spread. Early disease identification and containment greatly decrease the number of clinical cases of FMD and reduce the spread through several groups of livestock. This reduces the overall economic burden that the U.S. would face in the event of an FMD outbreak. In both the 1924 and 1929 outbreaks, the Agriculture Departments responsible for foreign animal diseases did not have extensive experience with FMD and could not correctly identify the disease early in the outbreak. Currently, the U.S. conducts routine surveillance within the U.S. and abroad to ensure that any cases of FMD would be identified quickly and appropriate disease control measures would be in place. The USDA also conducts hundreds of field inquiries domestically each year for early detection purposes (FMD Info.org, 2010). If a U.S. farmer suspects a case of FMD, either by contact or by clinical signs presented in an animal, the farmer would contact the USDA or state veterinarian's office that would then deploy a Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician (FADD) to officially diagnose the case. The FADD would question the farmer about animal contact and movement, examine the animal(s), and send specimens to a laboratory for analysis (Lenhoff, 2006). Increased domestic and foreign travel by the general public has created a new susceptibility to foreign animal disease for U.S. agriculture. Therefore, another surveillance method (which was not in place during the 1924 and 1929 outbreaks) occurs at U.S. borders to ensure that FMD does not enter the country. Currently, travelers into the U.S. are prohibited from bringing agricultural products into the country and are questioned about close contact with farm animals. In addition, ports of entry and airports are regularly surveyed, and passengers, luggage, and cargo are checked as deemed necessary. These inspections include Customs and Border Patrol officers and dog teams. October 2010 F7 NBAF SSRA Report In addition, the USDA conducts an aggressive public education campaign with tools to inform the public about how to prevent introduction and spread of foreign animal diseases. There were no multistate disease control measures (e.g., organized communications systems between states, or between State and Federal agricultural personnel) to prevent FMD outbreaks throughout the 1920s. The public education campaigns used now ensure that agriculturists at all levels have the same information on disease status and prevention, as well as disease eradication strategies. The USDA also places staff internationally to conduct routine surveillance in both FMD endemic and FMDfree countries. USDA has animal health experts stationed in over 27 countries and has agricultural trade officials stationed in 129 countries (Government Accountability Office, 2002). This measure helps alert the USDA of any potential outbreaks or sources of FMD that may come into the country. The USDA personnel stationed abroad also assist with preparedness and eradication strategies in their host nations to help reduce the risk of international spread of the disease. By helping other countries eradicate and control FMD, the USDA reduces the probability of the disease reaching U.S. ports of entry (Government Accountability Office, 2002). The USDA places restrictions on imports of animal products from FMD affected countries; other products from those countries, such as feed hay, fresh meat, and some dairy products, are completely prohibited (Government Accountability Office, 2002). FMD in Asia Taiwan Another relevant outbreak occurred in Taiwan. Between March and July 1997, an outbreak of FMD serotype O occurred in pigs in the Hsinchu province (western Taiwan). The disease was first detected on 14 March and successive cases were reported on the same district within three days. A total of 6,147 pig farms were infected, affecting over 4 million pigs. (FAO) The epidemic peaked five weeks after the disease was identified. In addition to quarantine and depopulation, the Taiwanese government instituted a twodose, blanket vaccination program which led to a significant reduction of new outbreaks. Pigs and susceptible zoo animals were vaccinated by authorities to control the spread of the disease and to help protect zoo animals. Except for two cities, the entire island of Taiwan was declared an FMD infected zone. This outbreak resulted in the death of 37 percent of pigs in Taiwan from either infection or depopulation. A large portion of the Taiwanese pig population was affected by FMD, and thus affected the export potential for Taiwanese swine. Since pigs can excrete vast quantities of the virus, they are a potentially significant source of air dissemination of the virus. Therefore, pigs can be described as amplifying hosts, while cattle can be indicators of infection (Ekboir, 1999). Although the disease was eradicated relatively quickly, export bans to countries like Japan and the U.S. were extended because of the vaccine used to control the disease. Although only a fraction of the pigs on the island were actually infected, millions were affected by depopulation efforts or quarantine. The total economic cost of the epidemic was estimated at $1.6 billion, including market losses (including the ban on exports to Japan), vaccines, carcass disposal and other indirect costs (P.C. Yang DVM, 1999). Over 10 million pigs were affected by the outbreak even though less than half of the farms were October 2010 F8 NBAF SSRA Report infected with only 21.7 percent of pigs on infected farms showing clinical signs. Taiwan's agricultural sector is considerably smaller than that of the U.S, contributing to 1.4 percent of the $383 billion GDP (The World Bank). Of this value, livestock accounts for 30% of the total. This is very small considering the U.S. GDP of over $14 trillion where agriculture represents 1.2 percent of the GDP, or over $168 billion in total. Thus, this relatively small outbreak still presented a considerable cost to the Taiwanese agricultural economy and a similar sized outbreak would impact the U.S. agricultural sector even more. Unique features of the Taiwan outbreak One of the unique features of this outbreak was the fact that the disease was relatively limited due to the physical movement restrictions of the animals. Because Taiwan is an island that occupies over 13,000 square miles (between the sizes of Maine and Indiana), the disease spread was greatly limited and due to depopulation efforts and vaccination programs, the disease was eradicated relatively swiftly. However, the outbreak occurred during the traditional Chinese New Year, which is traditionally marked with increased animal movements. This cultural difference allowed the disease to be more widespread in a short amount of time. (P.C. Yang DVM, 1999) China Recently, China confirmed that an FMD (Serotype O) outbreak occurred on April 7, 2010 in Gansu. A total of 640 cases were reported and 831 animals were shown to be susceptible to the disease due to proximity to infected farms. These animals were destroyed. As of April 15, the source of the outbreak had not been identified (oie.com, 2010). This may have been in relation to a recent outbreak of FMD confirmed in South Korea originating on a farm on Ginghwa Island and has since spread to the South Korean Mainland. This outbreak also involved Serotype O and authorities have since depopulated over 30,000 animals on more than 225 farms (oie.com, 2010). According to the OIE, the cause of this outbreak still remains unidentified, but farmers are working to depopulate farms to limit the spread of disease. This outbreak has since been detected in Hong Kong where a total of 1,240 cases were found and over 2,000 animals showed signs of susceptibility to the disease due to proximity to infected animals (OIE, 2010). This outbreak has been relatively well controlled by rapid depopulation of infected farms, but still persists in several areas of China due to continued export and movement of pigs. Relevance of Asian outbreaks to U.S. cases The lessons learned in the Taiwan outbreak can be relevant to the U.S. agricultural system because Taiwan is a highly industrialized area that also has a large agricultural sector. In addition, it is believed that the FMD infection could have been present on Taiwan six weeks before the disease was detected on the island. This could have been due to the fact that Taiwan had been FMD free since 1929, and thus there was a general lack of awareness regarding the risk of disease (P.C. Yang DVM, 1999). The U.S. has a similar lack of awareness and/or lowered perception of risk since 1929 was the last year of an outbreak in this country. Overall, this case is relevant because it shows the large economic cost of an outbreak and the effective deployment of vaccine. Because countries like Japan and the U.S. rapidly ban imports of meat and meat products from FMD countries, despite the extent of the outbreak, the total economic costs and losses greatly exceed the costs to eradicate the disease. In the case of an FMD outbreak in the U.S., export to October 2010 F9 NBAF SSRA Report the top four markets for U.S. beef, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Canada (Background Statistics USDA), would be greatly reduced. Best practices and lessons learned The Taiwanese outbreak also shows how effective movement control of animals, as well as blanket vaccination can effectively eradicate the disease. The use of vaccines greatly reduced the number of new outbreaks on the island, which helped contain the disease over time. Many countries, including the U.S., are hesitant to employ vaccination strategies because of the longterm economic impacts of export restrictions. The Taiwan outbreak shows how an effective vaccination strategy, even one limited in scope, can help eradicate the disease quickly. Although the benefits to vaccination are apparent and have been shown in previous outbreaks, the USDA has many reservations about implementation of a vaccine program because: Maintaining immunity requires revaccination of each animal (most vaccinated cattle retain immunity for 21 days); (McGinnis, 2007) There is a risk of disease spread through and outside the vaccination zone; Vaccine used in mass prophylaxis would have to match the exact serotype of the disease infecting the livestock, which can be a risk early in the outbreak, prior to serotype distinction (typically four days); If a vaccinated animal is exposed to the disease, that animal could possibly act as a host for an extended period of time; and Finally, if a vaccination program were implemented, the U.S. would lose FMDfree status which would severely compromise international trade values of livestock and would impose severe restrictions. (APHIS Veterinary Service, 2007) These scenarios would all greatly affect U.S. livestock value and thus affect the export community in general. FMD free countries (like the U.S.) are required to undergo a threemonth waiting period between the time of slaughter of the last vaccinated animal and the time that they can achieve FMD free status, assuming ongoing surveillance and serological testing have demonstrated that the country is in fact FMD free (APHIS Veterinary Service, 2007). Thus, there is little incentive to vaccinate infected livestock because it may slow down the recovery process. Countries should weigh the benefits of faster eradication versus the drawbacks of extended export controls. FMD in North Africa FMD is endemic in many countries in Africa and has surfaced among farms for several decades. Although the Sahara desert has played a role as protective barrier from disease spread into West Africa, many countries throughout the continent have faced exposure to FMD (FAO). In 1999, FMD was detected in beef cattle in Algeria, near the capitol of Algiers. A limited spread eastward and westward was also reported and a total of 165 farms and 139 communities were infected. In all, 1,605 animals were destroyed, 2,153 slaughtered, and 1,270,685 vaccinated. This strain was October 2010 F10 NBAF SSRA Report recognized to have a close relationship with strains found in West Africa and this showed a new route of virus introduction into the Meghreb region represented by the Sahara desert. Unique features of the outbreak The disease spread was generally limited due to the blanket vaccination implemented earlier (during the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks in Morocco and Tunisia) and because Islamic festivities led to an increase of slaughter of several million susceptible animals. These festivities also led to an increased slaughter of several million susceptible animals, thereby limiting the extent of the disease spread (FAO). This would not be as much of a consideration for commercial livestock within the U.S. because there are no large cultural events governing the movement of animals. Cultural activities could have an effect on small groups of animals owned by individuals or families, and could affect live animal markets, but would not have a large impact on commercial operations. This outbreak was also an illustration of disease spread through new routes of introduction. This case illustrates how new or unexpected modes of transmission (i.e., across the Sahara desert) should now be considered as viable. With the increase in trade exchange between countries and improved means of communication and transportation, the previously assumed disease barriers may not be effective in preventing disease spread (FAO). In general, increase in trade exchanges, including improvement on means of communication and transportation; create opportunities for FMD to enter new populations and areas (FAO). Relevance to U.S. cases Although FMD attacks all clovenhoofed animals, cattle are the most susceptible animal species and are also extremely high value species within the U.S. economy. Cattle are particularly susceptible to the airborne virus and they may excrete the virus for at least four days prior to symptoms appearing in the animal. Although the U.S. and Northern African cattle sectors vary in size and scope, they are both important to the agricultural economies of the countries. The U.S. cattle market is a high value agricultural market and is susceptible to foreign animal disease. The beef industry in particular is an important enterprise in U.S. agriculture. The 2008 cattle inventory within the U.S. was estimated at 94.5 million head domestically (USDA, 2009). The retail equivalent value of the U.S. beef industry (both domestic and international sales) for 2008 was $76 billion, with 2008 exports totaling $2.987 billion. Over one million farms and ranches within the country benefited directly from the sale of cattle and calves in 2000 and gross sales in that year totaled over $40.76 billion. This accounted for 20% of overall agricultural receipts, making the beef sector the largest single domestic agricultural enterprise (Lawrence D. O., 2001). Although this was a record sales year, the industry has been relatively stable since the 1990s. Cattle are produced in all 50 states and they are significant economic drivers especially in rural communities. In many areas of Northern Africa, cattle represent livelihoods for both families and communities, as they are often the main source of both income and food. The U.S. economy is not as reliant upon individual cattle for livelihoods, but the cattle industry does contribute to a large sector of the economy. Thus any damage to the industry would greatly affect people's livelihoods and the larger U.S. economy. October 2010 F11 NBAF SSRA Report The African outbreak examples illustrate a new route of introduction and how this can create a large disease outbreak in a large geographical community. The greatest diversity of FMD viruses is located in Africa and relatively few vaccines are available to protect against these strains (OIE/FAO, 2009). Best practices and lessons learned This outbreak also showed how vaccines can affect an outbreak. The local populations surrounding these outbreaks were partly protected by blanket vaccination implemented following the 1997 and 1998 FMD occurrences in Morocco and Tunisia (FAO). Fortunately, livestock exports were not a large part of the agricultural economies affected by this outbreak because vaccination of these populations reduced their export potential. However, this would be the case in the U.S., where approximately 10 percent of U.S. beef is exported, and exports have dramatically increased since 1980. (Lawrence D. O., 2001) Vaccination also prevented the extended spread of disease throughout North Africa. Although vaccines are typically difficult to obtain and distribute across the region, livestock were not as susceptible due to previous vaccination efforts. Although vaccines may not be the most rapid method for stopping disease spread, it can contribute to longterm disease spread prevention. Denmark In March and April of 1982, Denmark experienced an outbreak of FMD. During this outbreak, there were 1,700 herds within a radius of 15 miles from the first index herd, which was misdiagnosed initially (Ekboir, 1999). This experience is comparable to a U.S. outbreak because the density of cattle in Denmark is similar to areas of cattle density in California, a large cattle producing state. During this outbreak, an initial surveillance zone of 750 foot radius was established around each heard showing clinical signs. In addition, movement control was established, affecting both people and animals in and out of the infected herds. A control area of 6.25 mile radius was also established around the herd showing clinical signs, with no movements of animals among farms and controlled movement to slaughter; only infected herds were quarantined and slaughtered. The dissemination rate of the disease was significantly reduced after four weeks and the epidemic was stamped out after two months, with only 20 herds affected. According to studies, the success rate of the stamping out procedure and eradication of disease was due to individual farmer's actions. Each farmer on affected farms and farms within the disease risk zone depopulated their own livestock, which helped reduce the incidence of disease throughout the region. The farmers were well informed of the FMD situation through public media such as television and radio. Although the weather conditions in Denmark were favorable for windborne spread, this type of spread did not occur because a sharp drop in disease dissemination rate reduced the overall virus circulating in the area. Most of the virus was excreted early in the disease before there was a chance of depopulation and thus prompt quarantine was more effective than depopulation in this case (Ekboir, 1999). Unique features of the outbreak Denmark was relatively lucky because of limited airborne spread, but stamping out was effective in disease eradication. The Denmark outbreak also shows how unconventional spread methods (e.g., windborne spread) pose a threat to groups of livestock under quarantine. If windborne spread had been October 2010 F12 NBAF SSRA Report a factor, this would have counteracted the \"stamping out\" efforts, therefore extended the spread of the disease. Although experience has shown that long distance spread of FMD is mainly due to transport of animals and their products, rather than windborne spread, this threat should be factored into disease control planning. Best practices and lessons learned This case highlights effective coordination and communication between federal officials and local farmers. One of the primary reasons that the stamping out effort was so effective was due to the fact that farmers were well informed of the state of the disease through public media campaigns. If FMD were detected in livestock within the U.S., the APHIS Emergency Operations Center (EOC) would be activated to begin coordination efforts between Federal, State, and local officials and communicate disease eradication efforts. In addition, the EOC would ensure that proper information was disseminated across jurisdictions to ensure that proper action would be taken. In addition, U.S. Federal officials would immediately notify animal health officials in both Canada and Mexico about the FMD outbreak and response efforts, showing international cooperation and coordination. These countries would work together to establish movement control to limit the inter country movement of livestock and prevent further spread of disease. In addition, the three countries would work together to ensure that farmers in all countries received proper disease spread information and knew the correct actions to take across borders. APHIS would also notify the OIE of the outbreak, last animal depopulated, and all steps taken to control the disease. The effective communication and coordination at all levels would hopefully reduce the spread of disease and reduce the threat of FMD spreading across international borders. United Kingdom The United Kingdom (U.K.) experienced two relatively recent outbreaks that greatly affected the livestock population and the agricultural economy. The U.K. examples illustrate the potential economic devastation that FMD can have on both a developed nation's livestock industry and other sectors such as tourism. 2001 outbreak Although the most recent outbreak of FMD occurred in 2007, the U.K. experienced a serious outbreak in 2001. The introduction of FMD virus was confirmed to have occurred in late January or early February, with clinical detection occurring on February 20, 2001, just three weeks after the initial introduction. During the eight month outbreak, the disease spread rapidly resulting in over six million animals depopulated (i.e., sheep, cattle, and pigs) which resulted in over $6 billion in losses to agriculture and the food industry in the U.K. In addition, about $5 billion was paid by the government in compensation for slaughtered animals and carcass disposal. In addition, the FMD outbreak had serious negative consequences on both city and country tourism industries. (DEFRA) In the U.K., agriculture represents 1.4 percent of the $2.76 billion GDP, and is significantly smaller than that of the U.S., but still represented a large financial impact to the country. October 2010 F13 NBAF SSRA Report 2007 outbreak In August of 2007, an FMD outbreak was confirmed in cattle on a farm in a county in Southeast England. Four days later, FMD Serotype O was diagnosed on a nearby farm and by midAugust, fewer than 600 animals were depopulated. The virus was quickly isolated and was found to be a subtype referred to as BFS, which was used in the nearby Pirbright laboratory. (Perlez, 2007) A government investigation found a \"strong probability\" that the FMD strain involved originated at a laboratory complex where the virus is used for research and vaccine production (Nolen, 2007). Investigators speculated that human movement of the virus, either accidental or intentional, was a possibility. In addition, British officials rapidly shut down animal movement after the disease was detected during the 2007 outbreak. This, as well as rapid surveillance of surrounding farms and zoos, ensured that the disease was quickly contained. The U.S. also has effective surveillance methods and can implement regional quarantine, stopping animal and human movement between infected and uninfected farms. Early detection and quick response to the outbreak were key factors in the containment of the disease spread during the 2007 outbreak. British authorities identified the virus and confirmed that it was Serotype O two days after initial clinical signs presented in cattle. British authorities quickly shut down all movement of animals after a cow from another nearby farm tested positive as well. Several further outbreaks of FMD on nearby farms, as well as at a nearby zoo were investigated in August, and many tested negative for the disease. On August 24, no further disease outbreaks were reported since the initial discovery and the protection zones were lifted in the surrounding farms. The surveillance zone was removed soon after. Despite this, in September, a second outbreak of FMD was found on a farm 30 miles from the original case and a three kilometer radius protection zone was established, as well as a surveillance zone. This helped contain the disease spread and restrictions were soon lifted. (Wikipedia) Relevance to U.S. cases The U.K. outbreaks illustrated how susceptible a large industrialized country can be to a foreign animal disease. Although the U.K. does not have an agricultural based economy, a large sector of their economy is livestock export. In 2007, agriculture represented 0.6 percent of the national GDP, much less than the 1.6 percent that agriculture represents of the U.S. GDP (The World Bank). Despite having a smaller relative impact size, the U.K. experienced significant economic losses during both outbreaks because FMD affected many areas of the agricultural sector, as well as the tourism sector. Thus, an FMD outbreak could cause a larger economic impact to the U.S., including supporting sectors and regional tourism. This illustrates how devastating an FMD outbreak could be on the overall U.S. economy. Agriculture, especially the livestock industry, is an important part of the U.S. economy; therefore, any disruption to this sector could greatly affect the U.S. economy. In 2007 (the most recently available year for data), agriculture contributed to 1.3 percent of the total U.S. GDP (The World Bank) and since 2001, the livestock and poultry sector have been valued at over $100 billion (Government Accountability Office, 2002). October 2010 F14 NBAF SSRA Report An FMD outbreak causes both direct and indirect costs to producers and those associated with the agricultural industry. The direct costs include animal and animal product losses (including milk sold). The value of the depopulated animal is directly reimbursable by either the State or Federal government, but many indirect costs are not considered in this process. These costs include (Lawrence D. O., 2001): Eradication costs, including the cost of slaughter, disinfection of housing facilities, and carcass disposal; Production losses arising from lost production during the outbreak and postoutbreak in depopulated premises and industries linked to livestock; and Longterm value reduction of agricultural products due to public perception both domestically and overseas. The price difference between meats from a previously infected country versus an FMD free country can be as high as 50%. In one study conducted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the largest impacts of an FMD outbreak would be from the loss of export markets and a reduction in domestic demand due to consumer fears. The study estimates that an FMD outbreak could cause an estimated decrease of $14 billion in U.S. farm income. As the largest affected market, the live swine industry would likely experience the largest losses, followed by the beef industry as the second most affected market. (Philip Paarlbert, 2002) Best practices and lessons learned The rapid response and containment of this outbreak shows great improvement over response techniques from the 2001 outbreak. Due to quick government response and the use of rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, the British government was able to quickly diagnose the disease and minimize the loss of unaffected animals in the surrounding farms. In addition, due to the severity of the 2001 outbreak, the British government's Department of Environmental, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) conducted public awareness campaigns to educate and inform local farmers and issued hourbyhour updates that effectively communicated the situation to the stakeholders. Because of these and other related efforts, affected farmers and producers cooperated with the detection and eradication process which helped limit the spread of disease. (Adams, 2007) Typically in Europe, FMD has been detected on average 21 days after introduction (The role of vaccination in a future outbreak of FMD, 2006), but current U.S. surveillance mechanisms have improved and decreased time between introduction and detection. This may vary due to different disease spread mechanisms or routes of introduction, but overall, surveillance methods have improved both within the U.K. and in the U.S. Current U.S. disease control measures Although the U.S. has not experienced an outbreak of FMD since 1929, the USDA and other agencies have implemented several control strategies to help protect domestic agriculture from widespread exposure. October 2010 F15 NBAF SSRA Report Wildlife as a virus source In all of the cases studied and mentioned above, wildlife did not play a significant role in introduction or spread of FMD, and it is not known the extent to which wildlife contracted the disease. The role of wildlife in an FMD outbreak is not completely understood and thus is a consideration for many studying the disease. Currently, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists are concerned about the potential threat that FMD may pose due to spread through North American wildlife, particularly through deer, wild pigs and other clovenhoofed wildlife populations. (U.S. Geological Survey) Both USGS Wildlife Disease specialists, as well as wildlife service's personnel from the USDA regularly monitor wildlife for disease, especially those in close proximity to livestock. Because the virus can also be transmitted mechanically through animals such as rodents and birds, these animals are also monitored closely. In addition, these USGS staff members routinely work with wildlife specialists from both Mexico and Canada to maintain situational awareness on foreign animal diseases. This information is routinely used to develop contingency plans for informing DOI, state, and local resources of the disease risk posed to wildlife. Clovenhoofed wildlife are also susceptible to FMD, however the clinical manifestations can vary greatly from severe clinical signs to unapparent infections (US Animal Health Association Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). Thus, wildlife also has the potential to spread FMD because of their contact with livestock. Currently, USGS scientists are concerned of the potential threat the FMD may pose to North American wildlife, and subsequently to other livestock the wildlife contacts. Wildlife can harbor the virus, even with vaccination and control effects on livestock. The virus can easily be transmitted mechanically by animals (e.g., rodents or birds) that frequently come in contact with livestock. While these vector rodents do not become infected by the virus, studies have shown that FMD can survive for a short time on their bodies and pass through birds' digestive systems. These findings show that although wildlife may not become infected, they can easily facilitate the spread of the virus and overcome quarantine and movement restrictions. In addition, the disease can spread between livestock and carrier animals when and where they drink from a common source. (Mclean, 2007) In general, relatively little is known about the effects of FMD in major North American wildlife populations, although experimental infections of bison, elk, pronghorn antelope, and mule deer have been conducted by the USDA. These tests have shown that these animals, even with vaccination, do exhibit clinical disease when exposed to FMDv; intraand interspecies transmissions have occurred in all species except elk. (US Animal Health Association Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). Countries that have eradicated FMD from domestic animals have done nothing systematic to control FMD in wildlife; yet, no recurrence of disease in wildlife was observed. Although FMD is a risk to wildlife, studies have shown that once FMD is eradicated from the domestic livestock population, FMD also disappears from wildlife. (US Animal Health Association Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). October 2010 F16 NBAF SSRA Report Case study conclusion Overall, each case study demonstrates differences in disease spread and detection and shows how differing cultural and economic practices affect disease eradication effectiveness. The case studies all show that early detection and depopulation of infected animals are effective practices in preventing further disease spread. In addition, some countries have implemented vaccination rings around infected herds to control disease spread. Although in some cases it has shown to reduce FMD spread to farms beyond the vaccination ring, the FMDfree status of the country is affected. In countries that are considered FMD free, this consideration is critical. Current U.S. surveillance techniques are expected to increase the probability of rapid detection and eradication, and fortunately the United States has not been faced with a recent outbreak. Since the U.S. values its FMDfree status, the use of vaccine in a contained outbreak is unlikely. In the case of a large FMD outbreak, vaccination is an option for containment, but policy and state politics will likely determine the extent of its use. 4. Works Cited Adams, L. G.

Rift Valley Fever Case Study Review Introduction Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is currently one of the most prominent animal disease problems in Africa and poses a risk to U.S. livestock. Not only does it adversely affect the health of livestock, it can also be highly contagious and dangerous to human populations close to livestock. Additionally, RVF impacts the livestock trade and the countries' economy that relies heavily on livestock sales. Epidemiological Factors of RVF RVF is an arthropod borne viral disease that presents in ruminants as well as in humans. In livestock, the disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle, causing high mortality rates in young animals and abortions in pregnant animals (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). The incubation period for RVF ranges from 12 hours (newborn livestock) to 1724 hours in adults. Age has been shown to be a significant factor in an animals' susceptibility to the severe form of the disease. Morbidity is typically high (70100 percent) in young and newborn animals, but significantly lower (10 70%) in older livestock (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). Disease Characteristics RVF is primarily found in regions of eastern and southern Africa, the predominant areas where sheep and cattle are raised (Centers for Diseaes Control CDC), although recent RVF outbreaks have occurred outside of these regions. RVF can spread to areas that were previously unaffected, this spread has typically occurred when infected animals have introduced the virus into areas where vectors were present (World Health Organization, 2007). The virus is typically spread through several modes of transmission, including (F. Glyn Davies, 2003): Mosquito bites Biting flies Aerosol of blood from infected tissue Meat at time of slaughter of infected animals, and Raw milk from infected animals Three major factors increase the likelihood of RVF spread (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009): The preexistence or introduction of the virus in the area The presence and susceptibility of livestock in the area Climatic or environmental conditions that encourage massive vector populations Although RVF is not endemic in the U.S., changes in climate or the introduction of infected hosts could increase the likelihood of infection. Outbreaks of RVF are typically observed during years in which heavy rainfall and local flooding have occurred. In Africa and the Middle East, RVF outbreaks are typically October 2010 F20 NBAF SSRA Report associated with periods of aboveaverage rainfall and increased amounts of vegetation. Flooding severity is increased by development in areas around water (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Although flooding and climate conducive to RVF have typically occurred in Eastern and Southern Africa, RVF also has spread to Northern Africa and to the Middle East, indicating that many more countries are susceptible than just the RVFendemic nations. Climactic factors can all be easily monitored and outbreaks predicted using remote sensing satellite imagery and thus many agencies have successfully developed forecasting and early warning models for RVF (World Health Organization, 2007). Accurate monitoring has allowed authorities to implement disease abatement measures when heavy rains are reported in order to avert impending epidemics (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). RVF and the Relationship to Climate Typically, disease spread into new areas has been the result of human social or behavioral changes. However, some diseases and vectors are more likely to be affected by global climate change. Scientific predictions of global climate change include changes in precipitation and ambient temperature in several global regions. In addition, changes in precipitation will impact the flow of rivers and lake levels and may affect the duration and severity of dry and wet seasons. RVF outbreaks have also been associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is a climate pattern that affects the tropical Pacific Ocean. ENSO is best known for its association with floods and other weather disturbances in many global regions, which may vary with each. East Africa and the west Nile basin often experience wetter than normal conditions from March to May due to the warmer cycle of the ENSO. RVF can be combated through environmental sanitation as well as health education, but this will not totally eliminate the possibility of introduction of RVF in the U.S. (Shope, 1992). The spread of RVF to new areas is highly dependent on climatic factors as well as ecological change. Currently, RVF is limited in its spread because of limits in the ecology of the animal or insect reservoir, but this may change with climate change. Mosquito borne viral diseases are among the diseases that have been predicted to become more severe and move into North America due to global climate change. RVF is a candidate disease to be affected by global climate change (Shope, 1992). RVF is a threat because the virus is capable of being transmitted by a wide variety of mosquitoes and can maintain itself in a nonimmune population. Vaccination There currently is no course of treatment for RVF. However, vaccines for veterinary use are available. Therefore, the prevention of the disease is one of the most effective methods for addressing an RVF threat. Early warning systems using remote sensing data can support strategic vaccination campaigns by identifying areas having a high risk for disease. Outbreaks of RVF in animals are most effectively prevented by a sustained vaccination program in endemic areas. A sustained vaccination program should be considered by the government if needed as it has been proven to be an effective method for controlling RVF. October 2010 F21 NBAF SSRA Report However, vaccines may cause birth defects and abortions in sheep, similar to the symptoms of RVF, and some vaccines provide only lowlevel protection for cattle (CDC). The vaccine currently in use is a live attenuated strain of an RVF virus, which has been used in South Africa since 1952. Inactivated vaccine is also available, however, cattle vaccinated with the inactivated virus have poor antibody response (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008) and annual boosters are usually required before the rainy season to maintain immunity. The need for boosters that significantly increase the cost of vaccine programs coupled with the risk of defects and abortions, potentially make vaccination a less desirable option for farmers. Vector and Disease Control A number of challenges exist for the control and prevention of RVF. In order to effectively reduce the spread of RVF, how the virus is transmitted among mosquitoes and the role of vertebrates in propagating the virus must be understood (CDC). Several insect species are involved in the transmission of the RVF virus by both biological and mechanical means. Biological vectors include hematophagous insects, such as several species of mosquitoes, and mechanical transmitters include biting flies and other biting insects (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). There are several control measures that can be taken to prevent the introduction and spread of RVF. These include (OIE, 2009): Control of animal movements Control of slaughterhouses and animal products Draining of standing water to reduce and eliminate vectors and breeding sites Disinfection of insect breeding sites These prevention methods have varying success rates, but when used together, can be effective in stopping or preventing an RVF outbreak in livestock and in humans. RVF in Humans Although RVF primarily affects livestock, humans can contract RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects. There is evidence that humans also can become infected with RVF by ingesting raw milk or uncooked meat from infected animals (World Health Organization, 2007), from exposure to tissue or fluids from infected animals (CDC), or infection through aerosol transmission that has occurred in the laboratory environment. There is no evidence that RVF spreads from persontoperson. RVF in humans presents with an onset of abrupt malaise with fever, chills, rigors, diarrhea, vomiting, retroorbital pain, severe headache and generalized aching (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). A small percentage of humans infected develop a much more severe form of the disease that can include hemorrhagic fever (World Health Organization, 2007). There is no established course of treatment for RVF in humans, but a human vaccine has been developed, although with limited availability (The Center for Food Security and Public Health, 2007). Therefore RVF presents a public health risk within the U.S. as well. October 2010 F22 NBAF SSRA Report An RVF outbreak has a particularly negative impact on individuals in many countries in Africa because many incomes are predominantly derived from the sale of mature sheep and goats for religious festivities. Cessation of this trade has had disastrous effects on the livelihoods, particularly of vulnerable populations. Although the subsistence farming and livestock trade is not nearly as prevalent within the U.S., an outbreak of RVF would greatly harm export values and availability of many livestock and thus affect large sectors of the U.S. economy. 6. Case Studies Index Case - Rift Valley, Kenya RVF was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic of abortions in sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya. This outbreak occurred after significantly heavy rainfall in 19301931 (FAO EMPRES Animal Health Service). It was observed that European livestock introduced to Africa were more severely affected than the native African stock (Jeffery Musser DVM, 2006). The disease was first identified in sheep as several thousand ewes aborted their fetuses. In addition there was a 90 percent mortality rate for young lambs (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Cattle were also affected by this outbreak, but abortion and mortality rates were significantly lower than for sheep. Humans associated with the infected herds suffered from influenzalike symptoms and with fever, headaches, and muscle and joint pain. An initial investigation of the outbreak indicated that the disease was being transmitted by mosquitoes. Best Practices Implemented In response to the outbreak, local farmers moved their livestock to an area above the Rift Valley. The relocation of livestock resulted in the cessation of transmission of the disease, resulting in no new cases. Moving livestock was an effective disease control measure because the livestock were moved to a climate not conducive to the vector transmitting the disease. This is an important lesson learned that could be applicable to U.S. livestock as many large cattle raising areas in the U.S. have several micro climates where cattle can be relocated to in order to prevent disease spread. Kenya 2006 In midDecember of 2006, the Kenya Ministry of Health received reports of several unexplained human fatalities associated with fever and generalized bleeding. These reports were originating in the Garissa District in the North Eastern Province of Kenya. Reports of livestock deaths and unexplained animal abortions were also reported in this region. By December 20th, 11 human deaths had been reported and RVF was confirmed and an investigation was immediately launched by the Ministry of Health, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, the Kenya Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, and the Walter Reed Project. The investigators conducted patient interviews and performed field surveys to collect blood samples from patients and livestock. It was determined that the index case was a patient who had symptoms onset on November 20, 2006. Early in the outbreak, most of the cases occurred in young men who herded livestock, but later in the outbreak the distribution of cases was broader included both sexes and a larger age range. Two thirds of the total patients who provided information October 2010 F23 NBAF SSRA Report regarding risk factors reported having an animal that was recently ill and the most frequent reported RVF risk factor preceding illness onset was the drinking of raw milk. This outbreak was closely associated with heavy rainfall, which produced massive flooding throughout Kenya. In October through December of 2006, Kenya experienced three times the average rainfall for that period during the preceding 8 years. Kenya 2006 Best Practices Implemented This outbreak peaked on December 24 of that year and the number of daily cases reporting declined. A ban on livestock slaughtering in the district went into effect on December 27 and was expanded as RVF was detected in additional districts. Vaccination of animals with live, attenuated RVF vaccine began on January 8 2007 for apparently unaffected herds of livestock in the districts in which either human or livestock RVF cases were confirmed. During an outbreak of RVF, vaccination of animals in the surveillance zone can prevent further spread of the virus and protect people as well as animals. Antibody response to an RVF infection in livestock appears four to five days following infection and offspring of immune mothers may have a passive maternal immunity for the first three to four months of life as well (USAHA Committee on Foreign and Emerging Diseases, 2008). However, once an outbreak has occurred though, it is not recommended that vaccination measures be taken on the infected herd because there is a high risk of intensifying the outbreak (World Health Organization, 2007) and causing further spread. Vaccines can cause similar symptoms to RVF and therefore it can be difficult to discern between infected and vaccinated animals. Additionally, vaccinated animals can act as hosts and further the spread throughout livestock. Widespread messages on prevention were developed in the three widely used languages (English, Kiswhali, and Somali) and public meetings were held to spread information rapidly to the community. Messages were also widely disseminated via radio. Village elders, chiefs, and religious leaders were consulted on livestock movement control measures. The outbreak was quickly detected with help from the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Program, which was active within most of the affected districts. Another factor that aided the timely detection was the laboratorysupported field surveillance of febrile patients at outpatient clinics. Ongoing epidemiological and veterinary studies continue to identify factors associated with severe forms of RVF illness, characterize the role of mosquitoes in disease transmission, assess the economic impact of the outbreak, and investigate vaccine measures (CDC, 2007). West Africa The first epidemic of RVF in West Africa was identified in 1987 and was linked to construction of the Senegal River Project.1 RVF was reported in Mauritania in September of 1998. This outbreak resulted in very large livestock losses as well as many human deaths. This outbreak also caused considerable damage to the East Africa livestock export trade to the Near East and resulted in severe sociological problems, especially in Somalia, where the livestock trade is the primary means of livelihood for many communities and families (FAO). 1 CDC Rift Valley Fever Fact Sheet October 2010 F24 NBAF SSRA Report Issues Surrounding this Outbreak RVF can have a significant negative impact on a country's livestock. An RVF outbreak could result in livestock export bans that last for several years, severely affecting many livelihoods and commerce streams (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Many countries refuse to import livestock or animal products from a country experiencing an RVF outbreak, regardless of how large or extensive the outbreak is. If an RVF outbreak is discovered, many of the animals are culled to prevent the further spread of the disease and thus the livestock and their products are lost to the market. Export bans are of particular concern to the U.S. Best Practices Implemented In this outbreak, RVF was first detected in humans while the disease was circulating in the local livestock population. RVF outbreaks in livestock are often accompanied by human disease (The Center for Food Security and Public Health, 2007) and human disease has often been an indicator of epizootic RVF activity. This observation has led to the conclusion that early detection in domestic animals is essential to avoid the widespread disease in the human population (FAO). In addition, this case also showed how surveillance of human populations in conjunction with animal disease surveillance serves to accurately detect how the disease is spreading. South Africa 1951 - Rift Valley Fever was first identified in South Africa around 1951 when several outbreaks of an unknown disease were reported in the Western Free State by the State Veterinarian. In several of the outbreaks, very young lambs died in large numbers and adult ewes either died or aborted. Cattle were also affected by this outbreak and experienced abortion, hypothermia, and abdominal pain and some of these cases ended in death. The similarity of this disease to RVF was quickly recognized and blood and organs from affected animals were examined and laboratory tested. In addition, samples from human patients (who had handled infected animal material) exhibiting clinical signs were examined by the South African Institute for Medical Research and were determined to have contracted RVF as well (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009) (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009). 1974 - During the summer and fall of 1974, most of South Africa experienced exceptionally heavy rains, particularly the western region of the Cape Province, creating conditions favorable for mosquito breeding. This resulted in RVF presenting throughout the country in a severe disease spread. The sheep and cattle farming districts of the Orange Free State and Cape Province were particularly affected. The outbreak caused the loss of thousands of animals and caused significant human health issues throughout the country. Ten to twenty thousand people were infected between 1974 and 1986 and several people died from the disease (IRIN , 2010). This was the first time in South African that human deaths due to RVF were recognized (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009). 2009 - The most recent outbreak of RVF in South Africa occurred in Kwazulu Natal where cattle died within the district and many people became ill from the virus. This outbreak caused significant damage to the cattle industry in the area and claimed the lives of two people (IRIN , 2010). The index case was reported in the Northern Cape in October of 2009 on a grape farm where cattle were also kept. There October 2010 F25 NBAF SSRA Report had not been animal movement into the farm three months prior to the outbreak, but the farm had been irrigated and the dam which fed the irrigation pipe had leaked for months with drainage water pooling where cattle were grazing. In addition, changing land use was another major factor in the emergency of disease and this was reflected in the construction of the dam for irrigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this was the same area affected during the 1974 and would indicate that the virus in the area was not introduced from the outside. None of the farmers had ever vaccinated for RVF in the area and they did not have vaccine in stock (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009). The inactivated RVF vaccine was ordered for the farm with the index case and immediately surrounding farms. Other farms in the area were encouraged to vaccinate at their own cost using live attenuated vaccine. In addition, vector control was performed at the index farm using larvacides. Vector control is typically a less commonly used method of disease spread prevention because use of pesticides often has negative effects on livestock and surrounding wildlife and because during flood seasons the extent of breeding sites exceeds local capacity to control (World Health Organization, 2007). Best Practices Implemented During the 1974 outbreak, the Rapid Response Team was immediately activated when the news of diagnosis reached the Department of Health. The team met up with local response teams for initial assessments and sampled the infected sites. The index farm was immediately placed under quarantine and a veterinary attention zone with a 3km radius from the index farm was delineated. Health information was disseminated to farm personnel on exposure and clinical signs. Several recommendations came out of this outbreak including (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009) (Rift Valley Fever Outbreak Northern Cape Province, 2009): Maintaining a physical presence in the area to conduct clinical surveillance Continuation of vaccination of all livestock surrounding the index farm Intensify awareness about the disease through a media campaign, information sessions, and a hotline for general inquiries Implement a vector control program at mosquito breeding sites Maintaining a health monitoring program for veterinary officials involved in the outbreak. RVF in the Middle East In September 2000, RVF was reported in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This was the first time that RVF was reported outside the African continent. In addition to significant animal losses, this RVF outbreak also caused human disease and deaths (FAO). The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia and subsequently Yemen began receiving reports of unexplained hemorrhagic fever in humans and some animal deaths in 2000. By October of that year, 216 people were suspected to have contracted RVF (MMWR, 2000). On September 15, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the diagnosis of RVF. October 2010 F26 NBAF SSRA Report It is almost impossible to prevent RVF spread in regions where outbreaks have previously occurred, thus the Middle East is now more susceptible to recurring outbreaks of RVF. Because RVF is maintained in livestock as well as mosquitoes, it is very hard to stop an epidemic in progress. In addition, current international travel patterns, new development and construction projects, and possible changes in climate and precipitation have changed disease introduction methods and thus disease can be introduced to nonendemic areas. The U.S., where RVF is not endemic, faces risk of RVF because of these new methods of introduction on multiple fronts, including air travel, ships carrying infected animals or animal products, live animals, and possibly wind transfer of vector (Levings, 2010). Further east in the riverine delta systems of Pakistan and India, animal populations are considered to be at risk for a potential extension zone for RVF (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Wildlife including the Springbok, African Buffalo, Camels (in Egypt), and Water buffalo (also in Egypt) are susceptible to RVF infection. Wildlife can become infected with RVF but there is a large range of severity of illness. Water buffalo experience severe illness much like cattle and sheep while camels only experience abortions (Jeffery Musser DVM, 2006). Camels are likely the best indicator animals for RVF in Africa because virtually all pregnant females abort if there is a high level of RVF virus associated with extensive flooding (F. Glyn Davies, 2003) and therefore can indicate presence of RVF in the area. While not manifesting any clinical signs, many wild ruminants in endemic areas exhibit antibodies for RVF. Wild animals can thus act as carriers for the disease without presenting any clinical signs and can spread the disease to livestock if they share common drinking, eating, or sleeping locations. Scientific experimentation indicates that rodents and carnivores are also susceptible to experimental infection with some deaths occurring. However, no mortality has been observed in the wild (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Rodents are of particular concern to U.S. farmers due to the risk of infected rodents traveling between endemic and nonendemic countries while acting as carriers of the disease. Typically, U.S. farmers cannot control rodent population imports as closely as they can livestock imports and this presents a risk of disease spread. Best Practices Implemented The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Municipalities of Saudi Arabia instituted an intensive mosquito control program and restricted movement of domestic livestock. Restricting and banning movement of livestock may be effective in slowing the distribution of the virus spread to unaffected areas (World Health Organization, 2007), but do not appear to have any effect upon the course of the outbreak in infected herds (F. Glyn Davies, 2003). Additional methods of prevention which could be implemented include moving livestock to higher altitudes and confinement of stock in insectproof enclosures (The Center for Food Security and Public Health, 2007). In addition, a comprehensive educational campaign to eliminate contact between humans and sick animals and mosquitoes was implemented and included the provision of free bed mosquito nets. The Ministries also encouraged people working with animals to seek early medical evaluation in person and provided information to health care providers on the clinical presentation and management of suspected cases (MMWR, 2000). October 2010 F27 NBAF SSRA Report Case Study Lessons Learned Early detection is important in preventing and controlling an RVF outbreak. Sentinel herd monitoring has been used throughout Africa to monitor viral circulation in susceptible populations. It is recommended that periodic surveillance be carried out by regular field visits and contact with livestock farmers. In order to be effective, sentinel heard monitoring should occur in conjunction with the monitoring of other risk factors for RVF, including climatic indicators. It is also recommended that field veterinarian and laboratory personnel be vaccinated against RVF. Mass livestock vaccination campaigns of RVF should be considered where climatic and epidemiological evaluations suggest that there is a probability of RVF outbreak (FAO ). Currently, the National Veterinary Stockpile has identified RVF as one of the 17 priority animal diseases (Levings, 2010). Thus, many states have created preestablished response plans that incorporate risk assessment, surveillance, and countermeasures (including vaccination strategies). Currently, there are no systematic surveillance strategies for RVF within the U.S., but an extension of the Kenyan Rift Valley Fever veterinary surveillance program will include wildlife species, which will help inform U.S. officials on potential disease risk (FAO). In addition, the National Veterinary Stockpile has contracts in place for manufacturing of livestock vaccine for possible use if a threat became prominent. When RVF activity has been confirmed, government authorities should (FAO ): Define the extent of the infection and target population Define potential extension routes for further spread Monitor physical indicators of precipitation flooding and pooling Monitor mosquito populations in the affected areas Conduct surveillance for clinical disease in humans and animals Cease all trade for at least six months after the last evidence of RVF virus activity has been obtained Consider ceasing slaughter activities of animals to prevent spread to humans Implement vaccination measures on surrounding herds if appropriate Countries like the U.S., that are currently free of RVF, should actively prepare contingency plans and have eradication plans as their goal. Active surveillance and forecasting should occur as well as continued public awareness campaigns on clinical signs. October 2010 F28 NBAF SSRA Report 7. Works Cited CDC. Rift Valley Fever Fact Sheet.

During this same period, within approximately 120 nautical miles of Manhattan, KS, there was on average approximately 58 tornados per year, and as recently as June 11th, 2008 a tornado hit the Kansas State University campus in Manhattan. Due to the plausibility of a tornado impacting the proposed NBAF facility, and the possibility of subsequent pathogen containment loss, the NBAF SSRA provides a detailed examination of the risks associated with this natural hazard. The climatological record is examined to characterize the frequencies that tornadoes occur in this region by intensity level. This information is combined with information from peerreviewed scientific literature to ascertain how often tornados occur as a function of their intensity so that a risk of pathogen containment loss can be estimated and used in the overall SSRA findings. Lastly, characteristic weather patterns, associated with these tornado events, are extracted from the SOM analysis (described earlier in this report) to determine the likely plume dispersion patterns from tornado impact event. 2.0 F-Scale Based Tornado Frequency Analysis Due to limited size and the relatively small area affected by any single tornado, its existence is one of the most difficult natural weather phenomena to document. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) maintains an archive of all of the reported tornados since January 1, 1950 [available online at: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/]. This data set represents the most reliable accounting of tornado events, and is the \"official\" record of confirmed tornados in the U.S. The archive contains information on the intensity, touchdown time, initial touchdown location, tornado path, injuries, fatalities, and numerous other factors related to the tornado event. In spite of the extensive effort that has gone into the collection of the information contained in the tornado event database, numerous studies have characterized its shortcomings. Studies by Galaway (1977), Kelly et al. (1978), Tecson and Fujita (1982), Doswell and Burgess (1988), and Ray et al. (2003) have identified and documented significant biases in the temporal record. Between 1950 and 1992 the number of confirmed tornados increased from approximately 200 per year to over 1000 per year. This increase in the number of tornadoes is widely attributed to an increase in population, improved awareness of tornados by the public, and improved detection and identification of tornados following the deployment of weather radars. Spatial biases, associated with population, have also been identified to be present in this data set (Schaefer and Galaway 1982; Grazulis and Abby 1983). While clear evidence of a positive bias in tornado frequency associated with population is present in the SPC tornado data base, McNulty et al. (1979), Grazulis and Abby (1983), King (1997), and Ray et al. 2003, all note that population centers are not consistently associated with higher tornado frequency. Ray et al. (2003) found that in the U.S. central plains, National Weather Service (NWS) Offices and NWS weather radar sites exhibited a strong correlation with the number of confirmed tornados in the SPC data set.

In their study, the correlation between NWS facilities and the tornado reports was used to remove the apparent spatial bias, and improve the estimate of total tornado occurrence as a function of location. Their results indicate that the true total number of tornadoes is likely to be about 60% higher than the number of confirmed tornadoes that occurred between 1978 and 1992. The NBAF SSRA leverages the work of Ray et al. (2003) described above to estimate the risk of pathogen containment loss associated with a tornado. Containment loss is likely to be associated with the intensity of the tornado and associated building damage. The risk of containment loss increases due to the increased likelihood of substantial damage to the facility, which is directly correlated with tornado intensity. The Fujita scale (FScale) is a widelyused community accepted tornado classification and damage definition metric. (Table 1). The FScale was recently updated (January 2007) to the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EFScale). Since the majority of the database and reference materials all use the original F Scale, this study also uses the FScale wind and damage definitions instead of the newer metric. Table 1. F\u00adScale Description The original Ray et al. (2003) study computed tornado climatologies for all tornados and did not attempt to correct the spatial biases for each of the FScale tornado intensities. To address the need for accurate tornado occurrence estimates as a function of tornado intensity we have conducted an analysis that extends the work of Ray et al. (2003). One of the challenges of characterizing tornado occurrence as a function of FScale is that in addition to the documented biases in the climatological record discussed above, the more intense tornados F3F5 are extremely rare events. For example, during the entire period of record (59 years), over the entire continental U.S., there were only 496 F4 and F5 tornado events (Table 2). The relative rarity of these strong tornado events is also illustrated in Figure 1. Here the tracks of all of the confirmed tornados between 1950 and 2009 are depicted over the central Great Plains region. As shown, black tracks represent F0F1 tornados, blue tracks represent F2F3 tornados, and the red tracks illustrate the F4F5 tornado events. For reference purposes the red dot represents the NBAF location. Because tornados are rare events, and this is particularly true for intense tornados, it is difficult to produce a statistically relevant occurrence frequency for the immediate vicinity of Manhattan, KS. This point is illustrated in Table 3, which contains a summary of the confirmed tornados that occurred within approximately 10 nautical miles (nmi) of Manhattan, KS, and in Figure 2, which October 2010 H4 FScale Torna do Count Percentage of Total % NBAF SS RA Report depicts the paths of these tornados. Over the 59year record, there have been only 14 confirmed tornadoes of any intensity documented in this area. Since the climatological record is not long enough to capture a statistically relevant number of tornadoes at all of the intensity levels in the immediate vicinity of the NBAF, it is necessary to identify an area (as large as possible) where the overall tornado occurrence statistics are relatively uniform and representative of tornado frequency for Manhattan, KS. To accomplish this, we examined the tornado occurrence statistics in 1\u00b0 longitude bands from west to east and 1\u00b0 latitude bands from north to south to identify regions of uniform tornado occurrence and/or trends in the SPC database (Figures 3 and 4). The results illustrate that a region of higher tornado occurrence is present over southern Nebraska, most of Kansas and Oklahoma, and northern Texas between longitudes of 102\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 W and latitudes of 32\u00b0 to 41\u00b0 N. This area constitutes what is often referred to as a portion of \"Tornado Alley\". The local maximums in tornado frequency at 98\u00b0 west and at 32\u00b0, 35\u00b0, and 39\u00b0 north roughly correspond with localized regions of higher population associated with the cities of Dallas Ft. Worth, TX, Oklahoma City, OK, Kansas City, MO, and smaller towns along the transportation corridors of U.S. interstate highways 20, 40, and 70. Outside of the 32\u00b0 to 41\u00b0 N latitude and 102\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 W longitude band, the number of tornados markedly decreases. Based on these findings, we chose the area illustrated by the dashed red box in Figure 1, to provide tornado climatology statistics used in this study. Using an area of this size significantly increases the total number of tornados in each of the FScale categories and provides tornado occurrence statistics that are both statistically relevant and representative of the conditions that can be expected at the NBAF facility. Table 4 contains a listing of the tornado occurrences by F Scale for the area outlined by the red dashedline box in Figure 1. Table 2.

Statistically Relevant Tornado Occurrences (1950\u00ad2009) Ray et al. (2003) found that the adjusted true number of tornados is about 60% higher than those reported between 1978 and 1992 in the SPC tornado occurrence record. In particular, over Manhattan, KS, it was found that the average number of tornados (for all FScale intensities) was 0.0625 tornados per year per 100 square kilometers (y1 (100 km2)1). Assuming that all locations inside the 100 km2 are equally likely to be struck by the tornado, this corresponds to a return period of approximately 16 years. We extended this original analysis by computing the mean return period for tornados of a given intensity or higher. The mean return periods were determined by combining the probabilities of the tornado intensities with the adjusted probable number of tornados from Ray et al. (2003), using the formulation of Wilks, 2006 (Equation 1). Table 5 lists the results of this computation and provides the average return period for a given tornado FScale intensity or greater event. It is important to note that this measure does not guarantee that an event will occur within a particular return period. This measure is simply the average time between these events, assuming a very long sampling period (Wilks, 2006). These return periods are then used in Task 2 to characterize the corresponding pathogen containment loss risk associated with tornados across the full spectrum of tornado intensities.

Statistically Relevant Tornado Occurrence and Average Return Period October 2010 H9 NBAF SSRA Report It is well known that tornados preferentially form under certain atmospheric conditions. While we intuitively know that these conditions occur in the spring and early summer months, the corresponding atmospheric conditions that impact the subsequent transport and dispersion of any released pathogen are not necessarily intuitive. In order to determine the appropriate atmospheric conditions required to drive the plume modeling analysis, we combined the SOM analysis with the tornado climatological record for the 21year period from 19852005. Tornado records within approximately 100 nmi of Manhattan were used to ensure that the SOM weather patterns are indicative of the conditions in which tornados form in the vicinity of Manhattan, KS. Within this range of the NBAF the tornado record contained 763 confirmed tornadoes, and was adequate to diagnose clear patterns in the SOM weather pattern classifying analysis. The SOM weather pattern for each event was determined by matching each tornado event with the date and time from the SOM map node members. Figure 5 depicts a histogram of the number of times that a given event fell into a particular SOM node. This frequency distribution was then mapped to the same SOM node configuration for Manhattan, KS to characterize the series of SOM weather patterns that should be used to represent the dispersion patterns following a tornado impact on the facility (Figure 6). The results of this analysis indicate the specific SOM nodes, which represent the larger scale atmospheric conditions, prevalent during these documented tornadic events. These nodes and the corresponding weather conditions, are then used as inputs for the subsequent plume modeling of the tornado release scenario (Scenario 11), described in Section 3.3.11 . Figure 5.

Aerosolized FMDV shows similar stability in Eagle's Media (cell culture fluid), bovine nasal fluid, bovine milk, bovine fecal slurry and porcine fecal slurry. However, aerosolized FMDV shows a significant decrease in stability when suspended in bovine salivary fluid.2,3 The FMDV strain O1BFS 1860 was used in cases; O1BFS 1860 is the most commonly used FMDV strain for research.4 The stability of other FMDV strains may vary, but will follow similar trends. For example, FMDV strains isolated from dry climates (constant low humidity) show increased viral stability at low humidity over O1BFS 1860, but are still more stable at high humidity than low humidity.5 The Effect of Relative Humidity Humidity is an important factor in the stability of aerosolized FMDV, with viral stability increasing as percent relative humidity increases. It should be noted that although relative humidity is high, during a storm some FMDV virus can be removed from the air by falling raindrops.6 FMDV decays rapidly during the first five minutes following release of aerosolized virus. After five minutes, the virus decays more slowly. Following the examples in FMDV literature, the primary (first five minutes) and secondary decay rates have been modeled, separately (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In these charts, the Yaxis represents the decay of viral viability per period of time. The numbers indicate the log reduction of the virus over the described period of time at that humidity. The larger the number, the more decay is occurring (logarithmically). For example, in Figure 2, at 40% RH, the amount of virus viable at time 0 will decrease by four logs after one hour. That is, if there is 1,000,000 pfu of FMDv at time 0, there would be 100 pfu one hour later at 40% RH. In contrast, at high RH, the decay is near zero. The primary and secondary decay rates are similarly affected by relative humidity, with low decay rates at relative humidity in excess of 55% and high decay rates at relative humidity under 40%. 2 Barlow D., Donaldson A. \"Comparison of the Aerosol Stabilities of FootandMouth Disease Virus Suspended in Cell Culture Fluid or Natural Fluids.\" Journal of General Virology. 20. 1973. 3 Donaldson A. \"The Influence of Relative Humidity on the Stability of FootandMouth Disease Virus in Aerosols from Milk and Faecal Slurry.\" Research in Veterinary Science . 15. 1973 4 Cottom E et. al. \"Transmission Pathways of FootandMouth Disease Virus the United Kingdom in 2007.\" PLoS Pathogens . 4(4). 2008. 5 Donaldson A., Sellers R., Lacey J. \"Quantitative Data on Airborne FootandMouth Disease virus: Its Production, Carriage and Deposition [and Discussion].\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

October 2010 I4 Effective Solar Flux (J/m2254/min) Approx. Decay Rate Log (% viral viability)/hour 0.05 0.028 0.057 Report The Effect of Ultraviolet light (UV) Ultraviolet exposure also impacts the stability of aerosolized FMDV. While experimental data is available for UV decay of FMDV in suspension, 10 little is available for aerosolized FMDV. Donaldson and Ferris investigated aerosolized FMDV stability in open air conditions (including UV from natural light) using a micro thread technique. Their data showed weak correlation between mean UV intensity and viral decay, but this, by the author's own admission, was probably due to flaws in experimental design and uncontrollable environmental variables.11 In the absence of experimental data, we used an estimated UV decay rate based on the UV sensitivity of viruses in the same family (Picornaviridae) as FMDV, as described by Lytle. 12 The rate of decay due to UV exposure is significantly less than the rate of decay due to humidity under most conditions. The contribution of UV to FMDV decay rate during the first five minutes after aerosolization is insignificant, so we did not incorporate UV decay into our model for primary FMDV decay. UV significantly contributes to aerosolized FMDV decay after five minutes, especially at high levels of humidity. Using Lytle's estimates, for a virus of the family Picornaviridae with a genome of size of 8.1 kb, theUV 254 D37 for FMDV is 45.7 J/m2 (UV exposure at 254 nm resulting in 37% viable virus). Lytle calculated total effective solar flux of noontime sun for locations across the United States during summer and winter based on solar radiometry data. The site of interest, Manhattan, Kansas has an elevation of 311 m and latitude of 39.2 \u00b0N. Lytle provides solar flux for the similarly situated Davis, California, which has an elevation of 18 m and lies at latitude 38.5 \u00b0N. Effective solar flux in Davis at midday on a clear day (15 July) is 0.35 J/m2 254/min., and we used this number as a conservative estimate of the maximum effective solar flux in Manhattan, Kansas. We calculated UV decay rates for FMDV for effective solar flux between 0.05 J/m2 254/min. and 0.4 J/m2 254/min. (Table 1). Secondary decay rate curves of FMDV were generated taking into account decay as a result of both UV and humidity (Figures 3 and 4). Table 1.

Notably, they did not show data for RVFv decay at 80% relative humidity, only at 50% relative humidity. Brown found that viral stability decreased with increasing humidity based on data at three humidity values: 30%, 55% and 80%. The aerosolized decay rates were roughly equivalent between the two studies (comparing 50% and 55% relative humidity.). Brown was unable to provide a clear reason for the disagreement between the two studies, hypothesizing that improved technologies, differences in suspension media, and differences in viral protein concentration might contribute to the different results. Given that the Miller publication only provided a decay rate for one relative humidity, and that the decay rate at this point was in agreement with Brown's data, we used the Brown data for our model of RVFv viral stability (Figure 5 and Figure 6; \"No UV\"). These results may seem surprising in light of the fact RVFv outbreaks have been linked with flooding and heavy rains. This is most likely due to the effect these conditions have on the RVFv mosquito vector population, not their effect on the stability of the virus itself.15,16,17 The Effect of Ultraviolet light (UV) Ultraviolet exposure also impacts the stability of aerosolized RVFv. No experimental data is available for UV decay of RVFv. A study of inactivation of Hantaan virus, a virus in the same family as RVFv (Bunyaviridae), by UV exposure corresponding to 50, 140 and 240 J/m2 showed that UV exposure 13 Miller FA et al. \"Stability and infectivity of airborne yellow fever and Rift Valley fever viruses.\" American Journal of Hygiene . 77. 1963 14 Brown JL et al. \"Airborne Survival of Rift Valley Fever Virus.\" U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease Report.

Decay Rate Log (% viral viability)/hour 0.05 0.108 0.217 Report significantly reduced the amount of viable virus over a period of three minutes.18 This UV exposure was considerably more intense than UV exposure from natural sunlight, and these experiments were conducted on virus suspended in solution, not aerosolized virus. Therefore these data are not suitable for use in our model. We used an estimated UV decay rate for RVFv based on the UV sensitivity of other viruses in the Bunyaviridae family, as described by Lytle. 19 UV significantly contributes to aerosolized RVFv decay. Using Lytle's estimates, for a virus of the family Bunyaviridae with a genome of size of 12 kb, the UV 254 D37 for RVFv is 12 J/m2 (UV exposure at 254 nm resulting in 37% viable virus). Lytle calculated total effective solar flux of noontime sun for locations across the United States during summer and winter based on solar radiometry data. The site of interest, Manhattan, Kansas has an elevation of 311 m and latitude of 39.2 \u00b0N. Lytle provides solar flux for the similarly situated Davis, California, which has an elevation of 18 m and lies at latitude 38.5 \u00b0N. Effective solar flux in Davis at midday on a clear day (15 July) is 0.35 J/m2 254/min., and we used this number as a conservative estimate of the maximum effective solar flux in Manhattan, Kansas. We calculated UV decay rates for RVFv for effective solar flux between 0.05 J/m2 254/min. and 0.4 J/m2 254/min. (Table 2). Decay rate curves of RVFv were generated taking into account decay as a result of both UV and humidity (Figures 5 and 6). Table 2.

Literature values were not available for tidal volume in every animal considered; therefore, we used Dixon's model as a comparison, which studied the relationship between minute tidal volume and body weight.24 The Dixon model was designed primarily with smaller animals in mind, so in order to account for potential prediction limitations when considering animals of a greater weight, we took an average minute tidal volume from available literature values and completed our own calculations using numbers assembled from various journal articles, as noted below. The average live weight for beef cattle was obtained from the Livestock Judging Manual.25 While the tidal volume for cattle was not available in the literature, the average respiratory rate was found in the Beef Cattle Handbook.26 Though we were unable to find the necessary values to perform our own calculation of minute tidal volume for cattle, the value for average weight was plugged into the Dixon model, which evaluates the relationship between weight and minute tidal volume. The article, \"Effect of Heat Stress,\" by McDowell RE, et al27 provided a minute tidal volume with which to compare to the Dixon model. Our final value for cattle minute tidal volume was determined by taking the average of the Dixon model output and the literature value from McDowell. Krka P, et al.28 provides the average slaughter weight for pigs. A pig's tidal volume value and average respiratory rate is calculated by Richard JC, et al.29 We performed the minute tidal volume calculation for pigs by multiplying the average respiratory rate by the tidal volume and average weight. The typical weight of a pig was then plugged into the Dixon model and the output averaged with our calculation. 24 Dixon KR, Joab BM, Snyder FD. \"A model for predicting ventilation rates in mammals.\" Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology . 3 (1). 1997. 25 \"Beef Cattle Grading.\" South Dakota State University Livestock Judging Manual: Designed for 4H Seniors and Experienced Judges . 2nd Edition.

Patent SSRA Report Appendix NBAF SSRA Report October 2010 J2 NBAF SSRA Report 1.0 Summary and Objective In order to estimate the potential health and economic consequences from an accidental or intentional airborne release of pathogen, from the proposed NBAF facility, aerosol fate and transport simulations were performed to estimate downwind pathogen exposure to susceptible animal and human populations. Utilizing aerosol release parameters derived for each airborne transport scenario/pathway (Section 2.3), aerosol airborne concentrations and surface depositions were calculated for a range of representative meteorological conditions, for the Manhattan, Kansas region (Figure 1). Resulting inhalation exposure levels and surface deposition amounts were derived for all surrounding susceptible animal and human population locations (Section 2.2), and provided the initial conditions for the determination of any resulting infections and spread of the diseases (Section 2.5 Epidemiological Modeling). For each individual aerosol exposure result, an associated probability of occurrence was provided, based on the relative frequency of the driving meteorological condition. These probabilities were later folded into the final probabilities for each scenario, to determine an overall risk ranking. This approach is discussed in greater detail in Section 2, below. Figure 1. Aerosol Fate and Transport Work Flow October 2010 J3 NBAF SSRA Report 2.0 Technical Approach 2.1 Site Specific Meteorological Data Preparation An analysis of the meteorological conditions, prevalent in the Manhattan, Kansas region, was performed using an existing climatological database, specifically developed to support aerosol transport modeling and simulation. The database provides hourly estimates of various meteorological parameters, including winds, temperature, and relative humidity. From this dataset, a subset of characteristic meteorological conditions, that most strongly impact aerosol decay and transport processes, were extracted and assigned representative frequencies of occurrence. Further details on this methodology are discussed below. 2.1.1 Climatological Database The climatological database, used for this study, was originally developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to support aerosol transport modeling for the Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Effects Modeling (JEM) system and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC). The database contains hourly, threedimensional, analyses of all standard meteorological variables over a 21year period (1985 - 2005) on a global 40km horizontal grid that extends from the surface up to a height of approximately 60,000 feet (Rife et al., 2010). This particular dataset was chosen over other existing historical datasets for a variety of reasons, including: Higher spatial resolution (40km grid spacing) as compared to other available global climatology products (typically 50 to 250km grid spacing). This allows for smaller scale meteorological spatial features to be resolved. Higher temporal resolution (hourly output) than other climatology products (output every 6 to 12 hours). This allows for the diurnal cycle to be fully resolved. More representative of regional and spatially variable weather conditions than those derived from a single meteorological observing site (e.g. Manhattan Regional Airport, KMHK). Specifically developed and subsequently validated to support boundary layer aerosol transport and dispersion modeling applications. As noted in the last bullet point, above, the ability of this dataset to represent the mean and statistical behavior of the atmosphere, particularly within the planetary boundary layer, has been validated, utilizing a variety of observation datasets, which were not used to derive the original database. Of particular interest to this study, the dataset has been validated against observations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Profiler Network (NPN), located in the central United States, to evaluate its ability to recreate the observed characteristics of the Great Plains Nocturnal Low Level Jet (NLLJ) (Rife et al., 2010). Additionally, the dataset's ability to replicate the observed spatial October 2010 J4 NBAF SSRA Report patterns of rainfall (particularly the diurnal cycle of rainfall) has also been verified by Monahan et al., 2010. Both of these processes (boundary layer winds and moisture) are essential drivers for the aerosol transport/dispersion, deposition, and decay of both FMDv and RVFv. In addition to the above database validation exercises, an SSRA specific validation of the database was performed for Manhattan, Kansas. In particular, wind velocity statistics (wind roses) from the Manhattan Regional Airport (KMHK) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) station (NCDC 2010), were compared to coincident wind velocity statistics derived from the NCAR database (Figure 2a and Figure 2b). For this comparison, only data from years 2000 - 2005, were used for this analysis. This choice was due to several factors, including: The KMHK ASOS site location has changed several times over the course of the full historical record, but remained stable over the 20002005 period. This period was considered long enough to extract a representative sample from each dataset for statistical comparisons. The difference in total sample size (37,214 for KMHK and 50,520 for NCAR) can be attributed to either missing reports or observations that failed the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) quality control (QC) processing. As shown in the summary statistics at the top of each figure, the NCAR database wind speed statistics compare favorably against those derived from KMHK (mean wind speed of 4m/s, with a standard deviation of 2m/s), although a wind direction bias of approximately 20o is apparent in the NCAR database (205o versus 182o). This directional bias is also apparent when analyzing the wind rose results. As illustrated in Figure 2a, the KMHK predominant wind direction is from the South (S, 180o) (~ 17% Frequency of Occurrence, FoC) followed closely by a SouthSouth West (SSW, 202.5o) wind direction (~ 15% FoC), with average wind speeds of 6 and 5 m/s, respectively. A similar analysis of the NCAR database (Figure 2b) shows a predominant wind direction from the SSW (~ 17% FoC), with an average wind speed of 5 m/s. Although minor differences do exist, these differences are to be expected, and are likely due in large part to issues associated with comparing a single point observation location to a model reanalysis that represents the average value in that model grid cell. October 2010 J5 NBAF SSRA Report Figure 2. Wind roses for a) Manhattan Regional Airport (KMHK) and b) the NCAR gridded historical database. Numbers at the end of each wind rose petal, represent the average wind speed (m/s) for that particular wind direction bin. 2.1.2 Climate Data Reducti on and Frequency Analysis 2.1.2.1 Overview Ideally, in order to accurately account for the effects of all possible meteorological conditions on the resulting aerosol transport, transport simulations would be performed for every hour, contained in the full 21year database, or approximately 183,960 simulations (21years x ~365days/year x 24hours/day) per release scenario and pathogen. Although comprehensive, this technique is computationally expensive, as noted by the large number of simulations. When combined with the fact that transport simulations were required for two separate pathogens and up to 6 release scenarios, the number of required simulations quickly grows to over 2 million, which is infeasible to complete in a reasonable timeframe. Additionally, this technique is wasteful, when one realizes that meteorological conditions or patterns tend to repeat themselves over the course of the 21year database record. Therefore, to reduce the computational burden and associated waste, the original 21year hourly database was decomposed into a smaller set of representative meteorological conditions using a feature extraction and classification technique know as the Self Organizing Map (SOM) (Kohonen, 1982, 1998). The SOM is an artificial neural network technique, which uses an unsupervised iterative learning technique to group large amounts of data into smaller set of clusters or \"nodes\", with similar characteristics. These nodes are then organized into the final map or SOM. The SOM technique has been widely used in a variety of scientific disciplines (Joutsiniemi et al 1995, Palakal et al. 1995, Chen and Gasteiger 1997, Kaski et al. 1998) and, more recently, has gained wider use within the synoptic climatology community (Hewitson and Crane 2002, Cassano et al. 2006, Schuenemann et al. 2009). In particular, SOMs were utilized by Cassano et al (2006) to analyze arctic circulation patterns, from an ensemble of global circulation model predictions, while Schuenemann et al (2009) used the SOM technique to identify Sea Level Pressure October 2010 J6 Table 1.

Liu et al. (2006) performed an extensive evaluation of the SOM technique's ability to extract features from known patterns and provided a list of recommended SOM configurations, when developing a SOM. 2.1.2.2 Methodology For the NBAF SSRA, the SOM analysis was performed using the freely available SOMPAK software package (Kohonen et al. 1996). The details of the SOM configuration are summarized in Table 1 below. As shown, a 10x20 hexagonal lattice of nodes was used to construct the NBAF SSRA SOM. A hexagonal lattice was chosen over a rectangular lattice structure for several reasons. It provides more neighbors within a given radius of a node, which can potentially strengthen the relationship between adjoining nodes. The overall rectangular shape of the mapping, 10 in the x direction 20 in the y direction, helps to ensure the stability of the learning process. The map size of two hundred was chosen because it is the nexus between a manageable number of meteorological scenarios, in terms of aerosol transport simulation computational expense, and a sufficient oversampling of meteorological patterns contained in the historical record. Several methods were available to initialize the SOM nodes, including: Randomly selecting data vectors from the whole data set. The selection of random values that are evenly distributed through the input data set. October 2010 J7 NBAF SSRA Report A more mathematically rigorous method, which ensures that the nodes span the subspace defined by the two main eigenvectors of the input data set. The second initialization method, listed above, was chosen based on the fact that it is more computationally efficient than the eigenvector method and because the final result is insensitive to choice of initialization method. Each SOM node was initialized randomly from a sample in the training data, which consists of 21 years of 24hour periods of output for a 1000 x 1000 km domain (Figure 3) centered over Manhattan, KS. The choice of domain size was based on initial estimates of the maximum plausible downwind distance for an infective dose of FMDv. Based on the work of Sorensen (2003), and some conservative dispersion calculations (not shown), the maximum downwind distance for an infective dose of FMDv was estimated to be approximately 250 km. In order to add another layer of conservatism and be sure that the SOM domain was sufficiently large to cover a large scale FMDv release, the estimate was doubled and set equal to 500km, thereby defining the 1000 x 100 km domain shown. The data vectors used to initialize and train the SOM were composed of 2dimensional arrays of meteorological variables that most strongly impact the aerosol transport, dispersion, and decay of FMDv and RVFv (Table 2). As shown, the variables chosen included boundary layer winds (U10m, V10m, U850mb , V850mb ), relative humidity heat flux (SH surface ). Figure 3.

The SOM was trained by taking each 24hour period of data from the training data set and finding which SOM node it best matches. Each input vector was presented to the SOM and the best Matching Unit (BMU) was determined by finding the smallest Euclidian distance between the input vector and each map node. The BMU and its neighboring nodes were adjusted by the weighted difference between the node and the input vector. For this study, a \"bubble\" neighborhood function was used, which weights all neighboring nodes, within the neighborhood radius, equally. The training process was repeated for each input vector in the data set. After cycling through the data set, the neighborhood radius and training weight were recomputed and the process repeated. For the NBAF SSRA SOM analysis, the training was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a coarse training of the SOM for 1000 iterations using an initial neighborhood radius of 10 units and an initial training weight of 0.05. The second refining stage of SOM training was for 10,000 iterations using an initial neighborhood radius of 3 units and an initial training weight of 0.03. After the SOM was successfully trained, the original meteorological input data were presented to the map a final time to determine node membership for each meteorological input vector. This was used to determine the frequency of occurrence of each SOM node. The best match between the training samples and the SOM patterns was then used to define a typical day (24hour period) for each pattern, which was defined as the input vector with the closest Euclidian distance to the SOM node vector. It was this typical 24hour period that was then used to drive the resulting aerosol transport simulations, associated with each SOM pattern.

The 10x20 SOM lattice node identifiers, their associated frequency of occurrence, and typical day date/times are shown in Figure 6. As shown, the node frequencies range from a maximum of ~ 1.7 % for Node 0 (July 7, 1999 0200 UTC) to a minimum of ~ 0.1 % for Node 112 (September 20, 2001 2000 UTC).

The resulting SOM 24hour average values, for each meteorological variable contained in Table 2 (except the 850mb winds), are illustrated in Figure 7 9. While the details in the lattice map images are difficult to see for any individual node, the images illustrates the wide range of patterns associated with each variable, and how similar patterns tend to localize in various areas of the map. For example, in Figure 7, the 10 meter wind speed lattice shows separate areas of higher and lower wind speed (represented by different colors) generally clustered at the bottom and top of the SOM lattice, respectively. Similarly, for relative humidity (Figure 8) and surface heat flux (Figure 9), higher humidity values (lower heat flux values) are clustered in the center of the lattice, while lower humidities (higher heat flux values) are clustered at the bottom of the map.

Figure 10 Figure 12 illustrate the time evolution of these variables for the most frequently occurring SOM pattern, Node 0. As shown in Figure 10, the 10meter winds over the Manhattan, Kansas region (denoted by the white circle) slowly increase from ~ 2 m/s out of the East at the beginning of the 24 hour period (0200 UTC, 2000 Local) to ~ 3 m/s out of the SouthEast at the end of the period (2400 UTC, 1800 Local), with the approach of a wind speed maximum (~ 5m/s) out of the northwest. Similarly, Octob er 2010 J15 NBAF SSRA Report relative humidity (Figure 11) and surface sensible heat (Figure 12) levels vary over the period, with humidity and heat flux levels reaching peak values (95% and 200 W/m2) at 1000 (0400 Local) and 1800 UTC (1200 Local), respectively. Based on these conditions, one can anticipate that an aerosol release of FMDv, would remain very stable during the first 16hours of transport, due to the high humidity levels, while being transported to the west and northwest, at a speed of ~ 2.5 m/s (~ 5.6 mph). Conversely, RVFv, released into this same environment, would quickly decay due to the high relative humidity conditions, before being transported an appreciable downwind distance.

Scenario Specific Cli mate Data Classification As noted above, the original NBAF SSRA SOM analysis was performed against the full 21year historical record, contained in the NCAR climatological database. The results of this analysis represent conditions covering a wide spectrum of atmospheric phenomenon. For release scenarios that are likely to occur at any time of the day, and under any type of atmospheric condition, these patterns can be used to drive the resulting aerosol transport, dispersion, and decay. For scenarios that involve releases, which are October 2010 J18 Table 3.

The scenario specific criteria, summarized in Table 3, included time of release, wind speed, and conditions associated with tornado events. For each release scenario, the likely time of release could either occur during work hours (07001800 Local) or occur at anytime over the course of a 24hour day. In addition to the time of release, release scenarios 7 (High Winds) and 11 (Tornado) required additional climate classification, since these events represented very specific meteorological conditions. The high wind speed criteria constituted conditions with winds greater than 70 knots (~81 mph), while tornadic conditions represented larger scale weather patterns, which occurred during recorded tornadic events. The tornado and high wind analysis are further detailed in the following sections. For each release scenario/event pathway, the combination of these three criteria dictated which matrix of meteorological conditions was to be used for the subsequent aerosol fate and transport calculations. As noted, the final meteorological pattern matrices were reduced from 200 to 153, 73, and 72 for the work hours, high wind, and tornado criterion, respectively. 2.1.4. Tornado Analysis Since 1994, there have been on average approximately 1250 confirmed tornadoes per year in the United States (US). Many of these tornados occur in the US central plains, including Kansas. During this same period, within approximately 120 nautical miles of Manhattan, KS, there was on average approximately 58 tornados per year, and as recently as June 11th, 2008 a tornado hit the Kansas State University campus in Manhattan. Due to the plausibility of a tornado impacting the proposed NBAF facility, and the corresponding possibility of subsequent pathogen containment loss, a detailed examination of the risks associated with this natural hazard was performed. In particularly, the climatological record was examined to characterize the frequencies that tornadoes occur in this region by intensity level. This information was then combined with information from peerreviewed scientific literature to ascertain how often tornados occur as a function of their intensity so that a risk of pathogen containment loss could be estimated and used in the overall SSRA findings. Lastly, characteristic weather patterns, associated with these tornado events, were extracted from the SOM analysis (described previously) to determine the likely plume dispersion patterns from a tornado impact event. October 2010 J19 NBAF SSRA Report 2.1.4.1. F-Scale Based Tornado Frequency Analysis Due to limited size and the relatively small area affected by any single tornado, its existence is one of the most difficult natural weather phenomena to document. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center (SPC) maintains an archive of all the reported tornados since January 1, 1950 [available online at: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/]. This data set represents the most reliable accounting of tornado events, and is the \"official\" record of confirmed tornados in the US. The archive contains information on the intensity, touchdown time, initial touchdown location, tornado path, injuries, fatalities, and numerous other factors related to the tornado event. In spite of the extensive effort that has gone into the collection of the information contained in the tornado event database, numerous studies have characterized its shortcomings. Studies by (Galaway, 1977), (Kelly et al., 1978), (Tecson and Fujita, 1982), (Doswell and Burgess, 1988), and (Ray et al., 2003) have identified and documented significant biases in the temporal record. Between 1950 and 1992 the number of confirmed tornados increased from approximately 200 per year to over 1000 per year. This increase in the number of tornadoes is widely attributed to an increase in population, improved awareness of tornados by the public, and improved detection and identification of tornados following the deployment of weather radars. Spatial biases, associated with population, have also been identified to be present in this data set (Schaefer and Galaway, 1982; Grazulis and Abby, 1983). While clear evidence of a positive bias in tornado frequency associated with population is present in the SPC tornado data base, (McNulty et al., 1979), (Grazulis and Abby, 1983), (King, 1997), and (Ray et al., 2003), all note that population centers are not consistently associated with higher tornado frequency. In particular Ray et al. (2003) found that in the US central plains, National Weather Service (NWS) Offices and NWS weather radar sites exhibited a strong correlation with the number of confirmed tornados in the SPC data set. These findings indicate that some tornados in regions with low population density far from NWS facilities go unreported, and that in general, the SPC tornado database underrepresents the total number of tornados. In their study, the correlation between NWS facilities and the tornado reports was used to remove the apparent spatial bias, and improve the estimate of total tornado occurrence as a function of location. Their results indicate that the true total number of tornadoes is likely to be about 60% higher than the number of confirmed tornadoes that occurred between 1978 and 1992. The NBAF SSRA leveraged the work of (Ray et al., 2003) described above to estimate the risk of pathogen containment loss associated with a tornado. Containment loss is likely to be associated with the intensity of the tornado and associated building damage. The risk of containment loss increases due to the increased likelihood of substantial damage to the facility, which is directly correlated with tornado intensity. The Fujita scale (FScale) is a widelyused community accepted tornado classification and damage definition metric (Table 4). The FScale was recently updated (January 2007) to the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EFScale). Since the majority of the database and reference materials use the original FScale, this study also used the FScale wind and damage definitions instead of the newer metric. October 2010 J20 Table 4. F\u00adScale Description FScale Highest 1/4mile Wind Speed 3Second (mph) Gust Damage Description F0 4072 mph 4578 mph Minor damage F1 73112 mph 79117 mph Moderate damage F2 113 157 mph 118 161 mph Considerable damage F3 158 207 mph 162 209 mph Critical damage F4 208 260 mph 210 261 mph Severe damage F5 261 318 mph 262 317 mph Devastating damage NBAF SS RA Report The original (Ray et al., 2003) study computed tornado climatologies for all tornados and did not attempt to correct the spatial biases for each of the FScale tornado intensities. Therefore, an additional analysis was performed, extending the original work, to account for tornado intensity levels. One of the challenges of characterizing tornado occurrence as a function of FScale is that in addition to the documented biases in the climatological record discussed above, the more intense tornados F3F5 are extremely rare events. For example, during the entire period of record (59 years), over the entire continental US, there were only 496 F4 and F5 tornado events (Table 5). The relative rarity of these strong tornado events is also illustrated in Figure 13. Here the tracks of all the confirmed tornados between 1950 and 2009 are depicted over the central Great Plains region. As shown, black tracks represent F0F1 tornados, blue tracks represent F2F3 tornados, and the red tracks illustrate the F4F5 tornado events. For reference purposes, the red dot represents the NBAF location. Because tornados are rare events, and this is particularly true for intense tornados, it is difficult to produce a statistically relevant occurrence frequency for the immediate vicinity of Manhattan, KS. This point is illustrated in Table 6, which contains a summary of the confirmed tornados that occurred within approximately 10 nautical miles (nmi) of Manhattan, KS, and in Figure 14, which depicts the paths of these tornados. As noted, over the entire 59year record, there have been only 14 confirmed tornadoes of any intensity documented in this area. Since the climatological record is not long enough to capture a statistically relevant number of tornadoes at all of the intensity levels in the immediate vicinity of the NBAF, it is necessary to identify an area (as large as possible) where the overall tornado occurrence statistics are relatively uniform and representative of tornado frequencies for Manhattan, KS. To accomplish this, the tornado occurrence statistics were examined in 1\u00b0 longitude bands from west to east and 1\u00b0 latitude bands from north to south, to identify regions of uniform tornado occurrence and/or trends in the SPC database (Figure 15 and Figure 16). The results illustrate that a region of higher tornado occurrence is present over southern Nebraska, most of Kansas and Oklahoma, and northern Texas between longitudes of 102\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 W and latitudes of 32\u00b0 to 41\u00b0 N. This area constitutes what is often referred to as a portion of \"Tornado Alley\". The local maximums in tornado frequency at 98\u00b0 west and at 32\u00b0, 35\u00b0, and 39\u00b0 north roughly correspond with localized regions of higher population associated with the cities of Dallas Ft. Worth, TX, Oklahoma City, OK, Kansas City, MO, and smaller towns along the transportation corridors of US interstate highways 20, 40, and 70. Outside of the 32\u00b0 to 41\u00b0 N latitude and 102\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 W longitude band, the number of tornados markedly decreases. Based on these findings, the area illustrated by the October 2010 J21 Table 5. US Total Confirmed Torna dos (1950\u00ad2009) FScale Tornado Count Percentage of Total % NBAF SS RA Report dashed red box in Figure 13 was chosen, to provide tornado climatology statistics used in this study. Using an area of this size significantly increases the total number of tornados in each of the FScale categories and provides tornado occurrence statistics that are both statistically relevant and representative of the conditions that can be expected at the NBAF facility. Table 7 contains a listing of the tornado occurrences by FScale for the area illustrated in Figure 13 Figure 13.

Statistically Relevant Tornado Occurrences (1950\u00ad2009) FScale Tornado Count Percentage of Total F0 89 0.86 % F5 9 0.09 % Ray et al. (2003) found that the adjusted true number of tornados is about 60% higher than those reported between 1978 and 1992 in the SPC tornado occurrence record. In particular, over Manhattan, KS, it was found that the average number of tornados (for all FScale intensities) was 0.0625 tornados per year per 100 square kilometers (y1 (100 km2)1). Assuming that all locations inside the 100 km2 are equally likely to be struck by the tornado, this corresponds to a return period of approximately 16 years. This original analysis was extended by computing the mean return period for tornados of a given intensity or higher. The mean return periods were determined by combining the probabilities of the tornado intensities with the adjusted probable number of tornados from (Ray et al., 2003), using the formulation of (Wilks, 2006) (Equation 1). Table 8 lists the results of this computation and provides the average return period for a given tornado FScale intensity or greater event. It is important to note that this measure does not guarantee that an event will occur within a particular return period. This measure is simply the average time between these events, assuming a very long sampling period (Wilks, 2006). It is these return periods, which were then used to characterize the corresponding pathogen containment loss risk associated with tornados across the full spectrum of tornado intensities.

While we intuitively know that these conditions occur in the spring and early summer months, the corresponding atmospheric conditions that impact the subsequent transport and dispersion of any released pathogen are not necessarily intuitive. In order to determine the appropriate atmospheric conditions required to drive the aerosol transport analysis, the original SOM analysis was combined with the SPC derived tornado climatological record, to determine which SOM patterns were associated with documented tornado events (within approximately 100 nmi of Manhattan). Within the 100 nmi range, 763 confirmed tornadoes were identified in the climatological record, and provided an adequate number to diagnose clear patterns in the SOM weather pattern analysis. The SOM weather pattern for each tornado event was determined by matching each tornado event with the date and time from the SOM map node members. Figure 4 depicts a histogram of the number of times that a given event fell into a particular SOM node. This frequency distribution was then mapped to the same SOM node configuration for Manhattan, KS to characterize the series of SOM weather patterns that should be used to represent the dispersion patterns following a tornado impact on the facility (Figure 1.3.5). The results of this analysis indicated the specific SOM nodes, which represent the larger scale atmospheric conditions, prevalent during these documented tornadic events. It was these nodes, and their corresponding weather conditions, which were then used as inputs for the subsequent aerosol fate and transport calculations associated with the tornado release scenario event (Scenario 11). Figure 17. A frequency distribution depicting the number of tornado events that correspond to a given SOM weather pattern October 2010 J26 Figure 18. The tornado frequency distribution from Figure 17 mapped to the SOM \"postage stamp\u00admap\" NBAF SSRA Report 2.1.5 High Wind Speed Analysis In addition to tornado records, the NOAA SPC also maintains an archive of all hail and damaging wind reports, within the continental United States, recorded since January 1, 1950 [available online at: http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/]. The archive contains information on the wind intensity, event date/time, and event location. Like tornados, high winds tend to be associated with severe thunderstorms, either from a short lived thunderstorm downburst or sustained straight line wind event, also known as a derecho, and therefore most commonly occur during the spring and early summer. As defined in the NBAF SSRA high wind release scenario (Scenario 7), a high wind event is classified as any event having winds, which exceed 119 mph (~ 103 knots). These events are incredibly rare, as evidenced in the SPC database, with only 57 recorded events over the entire continental United States, and only 2 events ever recorded within the state of Kansas. Due to the rarity of these events, a lower high wind threshold was required to compile a larger event sample size from which occurrence statistics could be produced that are both statistically relevant and representative of the conditions that can be expected at the NBAF facility. Therefore, for the NBAF SSRA analysis, a high wind event was classified as any event with winds greater than 70 knots (~ 81 mph). The justification for choosing a threshold of 70 knots included the following: 1) The 70 knot threshold provided a sufficient number of events to be statistically relevant number of events. October 2010 J27 NBAF SSRA Report 2) The 70 knot threshold constitutes a severe wind event. Therefore the larger scale weather conditions associated with a 70 knot wind event will likely be the same conditions, which would result in 103 knot wind event. 2.1.6. High Wind Meteorologic al Condition Mapping Using the high wind threshold of 70 knots, the number and dates of all high wind events, which occurred within a 100 nmi radius of Manhattan, was compiled. Within this range, 319 confirmed high wind events were identified in the climatological record and subsequently matched with the representative SOM weather pattern by matching the event with the date and time from the SOM map node members. The results of this analysis (Figures 19 and 20) identified the specific SOM nodes, which represent the larger scale atmospheric conditions, prevalent during these smaller scale high wind events. It was these nodes, and their corresponding weather conditions, which were then used as inputs for the subsequent aerosol fate and transport calculations associated with the high wind release scenario event (Scenario 7). Figure 19. A frequency distribution depicting the number of high wind events that correspond to a given SOM weather pattern Octob er 2010 J28 Figure 20. The high wind frequency distribution from Figure 19 mapped to the SOM \"postage stamp\u00admap\" NBAF SSRA Report 2.2 Aerosol Transport Modeling 2.2.1. Overview Using the meteorological conditions, described above, FMDv and RVFv aerosol transport simulations were performed for six of the thirteen scenarios (Table 9), described in Section 2.3, using the Second order Closure Integrated PUFF model (SCIPUFF) of Sykes et al. (2008). SCIPUFF is a Lagrangian puff model, which uses a collection of threedimensional Gaussian puffs to represent an arbitrary time varying concentration field. Turbulent diffusion is parameterized using secondorder turbulence closure techniques devised by Donaldson (1973) and Lewellen (1977), which utilizes available velocity statistics to predict the associated dispersion rates. SCIPUFF supports the modeling of various material types, including gases, particles, and liquid droplets and their associated size distributions. Particle and droplet dynamic effects are included, particularly dry/wet deposition and material decay. Urban building effects are modeled using an urban canopy model, which estimates the bulk impacts of the buildings on the wind and turbulent dispersion profiles. The SCIPUFF model was chosen for this study, over other readily available aerosol transport models, based on a variety of factors, which are listed and expanded upon, below: Execution Speed: SCIPUFF is very computationally efficient, as compared to other more sophisticated Lagrangian particle or Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models. Due to the large number of aerosol simulations required for this risk assessment, a relatively fast running model was required to complete the simulations within a reasonable timeframe. October 2010 J29 NBAF SSRA Report Applicable Downwind Range: SCIPUFF is applicable for a much wider range of downwind ranges, compared to standard Gaussian Plume models and Lagrangian particle models. Since it was anticipated that the downwind infective range of FMDv could extend up to 100s of kilometers downwind from the NBAF, a model that is applicable for these larger downwind ranges was required. Building effects: SCIPUFF utilizes a simple urban/vegetative canopy model to modify the mean and turbulent velocity profiles, below a defined canopy height (Sykes et al., 2008). Due to the low building density of the Manhattan, KS area, it was believed that SCIPUFF's urban parameterization was suitable for this study. Terrain effects: SCIPUFF supports the modeling of terrain effects on the atmospheric flow and dispersion, through the use of a mass consistent diagnostic wind model (Sykes et al., 2010). This allowed for the effects of the local small scale topography, surrounding the NBAF, which were not included in the larger scale NCAR gridded weather database, to be properly accounted for in the model simulations. Aerosol Particle Size Distributions: SCIPUFF can model aerosol sources with various particle size distributions. Aerosol particle size has a direct impact on dry/wet deposition efficiency, and subsequently, the amount of aerosol material available for ingestion and inhalation. Material Decay: SCIPUFF can utilize user specified, material decay rates in its agent fate calculations. The stabilities of both FMDv and RVFv are highly sensitive to atmospheric relative humidity levels, therefore material decay must be accounted for when modeling the subsequent fate of these pathogens Time/Space Variable Meteorology: SCIPUFF supports the input of time and space varying meteorological information, as compared to Gaussian Plume models which only allow for a the prescription of a fixed (in space and time) meteorological input. Dry/Wet Deposition: SCIPUFF can model both dry deposition (gravitational and turbulent impaction induced) and wet deposition/scavenging (precipitation induced). Batch processing capability: A large codebase of processing software has been developed which allows for automated execution and processing of SCIPUFF model results. Validation: The SCIPUFF model has been officially validated for use within the Department of Defense (DoD) to simulate the aerosol transport of Chemical, Biological, and Radiological (CBR) materials and is currently the core dispersion engine of the DoD Joint Effects Model (JEM) system and Defense Threat Reduction Agency's (DTRA's) Hazard Prediction and Assessment Capability (HPAC). Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has accepted the use of the SCIPUFF model for regulatory applications on a casebycase basis (EPA 2010). Lastly, the modeling system has been extensively validated against a variety of shortrange and longrange diffusion experiments (Sykes et al 2008). 2.2.2. Methodology/Configuration The SCIPUFF model was configured to capture a variety of scenario and pathogen specific effects, which are listed and described below: October 2010 J30 NBAF SSRA Report Local Terrain. The impact of the local small scale terrain on the local aerosol transport was included, using a 30 arcsecond resolution Digital Terrain Elevation Database (DTED Level 0), developed by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA 2000). Local Landuse. The effects of landuse characteristics on the plume dispersion were included using a 30 arcsecond resolution data base developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and based on ORNL's Landscan 2006 product. Aerosol Decay. FMDv and RVFv specific decay rates associated with relative humidity and ultra violet light exposures were included in the aerosol fate calculations, based on the decay curves shown in Figure 21 Figure 23. As shown, FMDv decay was separated into primary and secondary decay phases, based on time after release, while RVFv decay only included one decay phase. In order to account for the two FMDv decay phases, the primary decay rate was first applied to the initial release amount and assumed to occur before the pathogen was released into the open atmosphere. This effectively reduced the source amount, which was then used in the subsequent aerosol transport calculations. The second decay rate was then fed to the SCIPUFF modeling system to account for the aerosol decay, during the transport simulation. For RVFv, only a single decay rate was applied during the transport calculations, using the original source amount. A unique decay rate was applied for each of the meteorological patterns, described previously, based on their corresponding relative humidity and UV exposure (incoming solar radiation) values centered at the NBAF location. Wet Aerosols. Aerosol releases were treated as \"wet particles\", within the SCIPUFF model, which models the effects of wet aerosol size evolution, due to evaporation processes. Aerosol Deposition. Aerosols were modeled using various size distributions, depending on the method of release, to properly account for aerosol deposition, due to gravitational settling and turbulent impaction processes.

Model Output Products The raw output from each individual aerosol simulation included instantaneous airborne pathogen concentration (PFU/m3), timeintegrated airborne concentration (PFUsec/m3), surface deposition (PFU/m2), and a frequency of occurrence for the specific meteorological condition, used to drive the simulation (Figure 24 Figure 26). These products were further processed to calculate inhalation exposures based on susceptible population species, as detailed in the following sections. Octob er 2010 J34 Figure 25. a) Time\u00adintegrated concentration and b) surface deposition for CaseID 1FB, MetID 159 Figure 26. As in Figure 25. Zoomed\u00adin view NBAF SSRA Report The colored contour represents concentration and deposition values greater than or equal to 48.41 PFU\u00adsec/m3 and 0.1 PFU/m2, respectively. Purple squares designate susceptible animal species locations, while the red star designates the release location. 2.2.4. Aerosol Inhalation Exposure Calculation Based on the raw aerosol transport results, above, inhalation exposures levels were calculated for the range of susceptible species (cattle, swine, sheep, humans). Inhalation exposure represents the quantity of pathogen inhaled by a particular species, based on their average breathing rate and the ambient concentration of pathogen. As shown in Equation 2, inhalation exposure is simply the product of the timeintegrated concentration (PFUsec/m3) and the breathing rate of the exposed species (m3/sec). October 2010 J35 Table 10. Average Breathing Rates per Susceptible Species Species Breathing Rate (L/min) Breathing Rate (m3/sec) Cattle (beef) 123.95 Humans 6.0 1.0E04 NBAF SS RA Report Equation 2: E = D \u00d7 BR, E = Inhlation Exposure (PFU) D = Time- integrated Concentration (PFU-sec/m3) BR = Breathing Rate (m3/sec) The list of susceptible species and their associated breathing rates are summarized in Table 10, below. As is evident, cattle breathing rates are approximately ten times larger than all other susceptible species. Due to this fact, when exposed to particular pathogen concentration level, cattle will subsequently inhale approximately ten times more pathogen. Similarly, swine will inhale more pathogen, than sheep, which will inhale more than humans. This behavior is further illustrated in Figure 27 and Figure 28, which show exposure levels, when cattle (a), swine (b), and sheep (c) breathing rates are applied to the timeintegrated concentration values from Figure 25a and Figure 26a. The colored contour area represents exposure levels, which equal or exceed a minimum infective exposure level of 0.1 PFUs, and therefore denotes an area of infection risk. As expected, the downwind risk area for cattle, is substantially larger than corresponding risk areas for swine and sheep, and even less so for humans (not shown).

October 2010 J37 Figure 28. As in Figure 27, Zoomed\u00ad in view NBAF SSRA Report Before these exposure levels can be used to estimate numbers of initial infections, they first must be correlated with known animal population locations, surrounding the release location. Utilizing the susceptible species population datasets, detailed in Section 2.2, and the exposure levels calculated above, correlated exposure values were estimated, based on location and animal species type (Figure 29). These results, combined with the meteorological condition frequencies, were subsequently provided to the epidemiological models (Section 2.5) for further processing and analysis. October 2010 J38 Figure 29. Susceptible animal locations and species type NBAF SSRA Report For scenarios involving an aerosol release of RVFv, human exposure levels were also calculated for specific locations on the Kansas State University campus and for a grid of locations surrounding the NBAF site. The exposure grid resolution (100 meters) was based on the resolution of the underlying gridded population data (Landscan USA Gold) used for this study. October 2010 J39 NBAF SSRA Report 3.0 Aerosol Fate and Transport Results 3.1 Summary of Aerosol Fate and Transport Modeling Results The following summarizes the inhalation exposure results for all the aerosol transport scenario cases and pathogens used as the basis for subsequent epidemiological modeling. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of aerosol fate and transport modeling results are contained in this Appendix. The aerosol transport simulation data described herein were consolidated according to: Maximum Areal Coverage o Defined as the maximum surface area (in square kilometers, km2) which received a time integrated concentration, surface deposition, and inhalation exposure value greater than or equal to a specified threshold, over all meteorological conditions. Maximum Downwind Range o Defined as the maximum downwind range (in kilometers, km) that received a time integrated concentration, surface deposition, and inhalation exposure value greater than or equal to a specified threshold over all meteorological conditions. Maximum Animal Population Locations o Defined as the maximum number of animal population centers that received an inhalation exposure level greater than or equal to a specified threshold, over all meteorological conditions. Probability of Exceeding a Specified Area Size o Defined as the probability that the plume surface area (in square kilometers, km2) will exceed a specified size threshold, for timeintegrated concentration, surface deposition, and inhalation exposure, over all meteorological conditions. It should be noted that this probability only accounts for the meteorological condition frequencies of occurrence and does not account for the associated release event/pathway probabilities. Probability of Exceeding a Specified Downwind Range o Defined as the probability that the plume downwind range (in square kilometers, km2) will exceed a specified threshold for timeintegrated concentration, surface deposition, and inhalation exposure over all meteorological conditions. It should be noted that this probability only accounts for the meteorological condition frequencies of occurrence and does not account for the associated release event/pathway probabilities. It should be noted that for any particular release scenario, the meteorological condition that produced the maximum areal coverage and/or maximum plume downwind range was not necessarily the same condition that also resulted in the maximum number of animal location exposures. This was due to the orientation of the resulting aerosol plume and location of surrounding susceptible animal populations. October 2010 J40 NBAF SS RA Report For example, in release scenario 1FB, the aerosol plume with the largest areal extent (Figure 30a) covered fewer animal population centers (magenta squares) as compared to the plume that encompassed the largest number of population locations (Figure 30b). This was due to its (Figure 30a) northern orientation and the distribution of animal population centers north of the NBAF. Note that the scale of Figure 30b was enlarged relative to Figure30a to allow the reader to visualize the increased number of animal population centers within that plume.

Here, a threshold value of 48.4066 pfusec/m3 was used to define the timeintegrated concentration area coverage, while 0.1 pfu/m2 and 0.1 pfu were used to define the surface deposition and inhalation exposure areas, respectively. Also shown is the associated meteorological pattern frequency of occurrence (%) that resulted in the maximum area coverage. In every case, the frequency of the corresponding meteorological pattern was less than ~1 %.

As noted earlier, these maximum impacts, in terms of areal coverage, downwind range, and animal locations exposed, may occur infrequently when compared to the range of aerosol plume results for any one scenario. Therefore, it is more useful to analyze the results in terms of probability of a specific impact occurring, based on the range of input meteorological conditions. Therefore, the probability of exceeding a specified set of both aerosol plume areas (1, 10, and 100 km2) and plume downwind ranges (1, 10, 50 km) were calculated and have been summarized in Tables 12 through 14 and Figures 32 through 37.

This comes as no surprise, given the large quantities of viral material released (greater than 1E+09 pfus) in these scenarios. It is important to remember, however, that these results only represent the worst case meteorological conditions in terms of aerosol transport and decay, and occur only a small percentage of the time relative to all other possible conditions. For example, the meteorological condition associated with the worstcase seismic release inhalation exposure result (1FSB), only occurred 0.64% of the time. Additionally, the probability that these rare release events will occur (such as a tornado) is also very small. Lastly, these results do not include the associated probabilities of infection, given a certain exposure level. Even though a large number of animal populations may be exposed to a certain threshold inhalation exposure level, only a percentage of the total population will become infected. Those calculations, and the resulting number of infections for each case, are presented in Section 4 of the SSRA Report. October 2010 J52 NBAF SSRA Report The scenarios, 1FB (biocontainment spill, nonfunctional HEPA) and 1FC (exterior spill), produced the next largest set of plume footprints (Sheep Exposure Area > 1 km2), plume downwind ranges (Sheep Exposure Range > 8 km), and animal location exposures (> 70). The remaining scenarios either resulted in relatively small footprints, short downwind ranges, and few exposures (5FB, 6FB, 8FA) or approximately 7FSA, 8FB). all scenario/event pathways that represented normally functioning HEPA filtration systems produced zero plume footprints, downwind ranges, and animal location exposures. Upon analyzing the plume surface area and downwind range probabilities of exceedance, it is immediately apparent that the rare event FMDv release scenarios, 7FSB (Seismic), 7FW (High Wind), and 11FA (Tornado), produced the highest probabilities. This is most apparent when reviewing the probabilities of exceeding an exposure area greater than 100 km2 and downwind range greater than 50 km. As shown, the rare event releases are the only scenarios, which have a nonzero probability of exceedance. The remaining scenarios either resulted in medium to low or zero probabilities of exceeding an area of 1 km2 and a range of 10 km. The probability of any scenario/event pathway, which represented normally functioning HEPA filtration systems, producing an aerosol exposure footprint of 1 km2 and a downwind range of 1 km was 0%. 3.3 RVFv Case Observations Generally speaking, the RVFv release scenarios resulted in smaller plume footprints, downwind ranges, and fewer animal location exposures compared to similar FMDv releases, even though many of the same RVFv scenarios contained a larger initial source amount (Q). For example, the overpressure, nonfunctioning HEPA scenario (6FB and 6RB) and 3.00E+08 pfus for FMDv and RVFv, respectively. Given the large difference between the two source amounts, one would expect the RVFv aerosol transport simulations to result in much larger plume footprints, downwind ranges, and exposure locations. These counterintuitive findings can be directly attributed to the different decay behavior of each pathogen under the same meteorological conditions. RVFv decay rates are directly proportional to relative humidity levels (e.g. higher humidity equates to faster decay), while FMDv decay rates are inversely proportional to humidity levels (e.g. higher humidity equates to slower decay). As noted previously, Manhattan, KS, frequently experiences high relative humidities. Given these conditions, RVFv will rapidly decay upon release, while FMDv will remain viable over longer periods of time. This behavior is not only evident when comparing the RVFv results to the corresponding FMDv results, but is also evident when analyzing the RVFv results in isolation. As shown, all the RVFv scenarios resulted in aerosol plume footprints of less than 0.5 km2, with 7RSA, 8RB, 11RA). Additionally, the maximum plume downwind range over all scenarios was less than 2.5 km, with many equal to 0 km (1RA, 5RA, 6RA, 7RW, RVFv aerosol footprints and downwind ranges, only a few nearby animal population centers received inhalation exposures above the defined minimum threshold of 0.1 pfus. With respect to human inhalation exposures, these areas were also restricted to the immediate vicinity of the NBAF, with the vast majority of scenarios producing exposure areas of approximately 0 km2 and exposure downwind ranges of 0 km. The largest human exposure area (8RA) covered an area less than 0.1 km2 and October 2010 J53 NBAF SSRA Report downwind range less than 1 km. This is consistent with expectations, given the small average breathing rates of humans; a much larger quantity of material would be required to exceed the inhalation exposure threshold of 0.1 pfu. These findings are also evident, when analyzing the associated probabilities of exceedance. As expected, based on the small size of the maximum areal footprint sizes (all less than 1 km2), the probability of exceeding a minimum exposure area of 1 km2 is 0% for all the RVFv scenario/event pathways. Similarly, the probability of exceeding a plume downwind range of 10 km is 0% for all scenarios, with only a few scenarios resulting in nonzero probabilities (< 2.5%) of exceeding a range of 1 km. 3.4 Detailed Release Scenario Results Simulation Results are summarized below for each release scenario, using the following metrics: Areal Coverage per Meteorological Condition: Defines the surface area (in square kilometers, km2), which receives a time-integrated concentration and surface deposition value greater than or equal to 48.4066 PFU-sec/m3 and 0.1 PFU/m2, respectively, for each meteorological input condition.

Utilizing aerosol release parameters derived for each airborne transport scenario/pathway, aerosol airborne concentrations and surface depositions were calculated for a range of representative meteorological conditions, for the Manhattan, Kansas region. Resulting inhalation exposure levels and October 2010 J68 NBAF SSRA Report surface deposition amounts were derived for all surrounding susceptible animal and human population locations, and provided the initial conditions for the determination of any resulting infections and spread of the diseases. For each individual aerosol exposure result, an associated probability of occurrence was provided, based on the relative frequency of the driving meteorological condition. These probabilities were later folded into the final probabilities for each scenario, to determine an overall risk ranking. A robust analysis of the climatological conditions over the central plains was conducted using a 21year historical weather database that was specifically designed to support aerosol fate and transport applications. From this analysis, 200 representative weather patterns, and their associated frequency of occurrence, were identified, capturing both the frequently occurring and rareevent weather conditions that are prevalent in the region surround the NBAF. In addition to the above climatological analysis, a detailed examination of the risks associated with a tornado and high wind event impacting the NBAF facility was performed. The climatological record was examined to characterize the frequencies that tornadoes occur in this region by intensity level. This information was combined with information from peerreviewed scientific literature to ascertain how often tornados occur as a function of their intensity so that the risk of pathogen containment loss could be estimated and used in the overall SSRA findings. Similarly, the identification and frequencies of high wind events were also determined for the immediate NBAF region. Lastly, the characteristic weather patterns associated with these tornado and high wind events were extracted from the original 200 weather patterns, to determine the likely aerosol transport patterns. The SCIPUFF model was used to estimate the pathogen dispersion patterns. SCIPUFF is the core dispersion engine inside the DoD's operational HPAC and JEM modeling systems and has been extensively validated for the dispersion of biological pathogens. This model is capable of accurately modeling both the near and far range pathogen dispersion and can incorporate the effects of time varying meteorology, local effects (e.g. terrain, buildings, land use), and factors that affect the dispersion once the pathogens have been released (e.g. decay, gravitational settling, wet and dry deposition, and evaporation). SCIPUFF model simulations were computed for each of the release event pathway and pathogen type (FMDv and RVFv) over the full spectrum of meteorological conditions derived from the climatological analysis. The SCIPUFF simulations provided estimates of pathogen concentration time histories and surface deposition, which were then converted into inhalation exposures, based on the location and type of susceptible species. These final inhalation exposure and surface deposition estimates were then passed to the epidemiological models to determine the number of infections, for each release scenario/event pathway and meteorological condition. 5.0 References Cassano, J.J., Uotila, P., and Lynch, A., \"Changes in synoptic weather patterns in the polar regions in the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries, Part 1: Arctic,\" Int.

In very few cases were the NAADSM default values close to the consensus value used in the model. Because there was a wide variety of parameter values reported in the literature, a sensitivity analysis for each of the parameter values that we did not use in our baseline model was performed to determine the effect on the results (see Sensitivity Analysis Section). For peerreviewed publications, parameters were evaluated based on the quality of the source used by the author to determine that parameter. Notional parameters were disregarded if another source was available. Parameters that used experimental data from a peerreviewed journal article or retrospective analysis of a recent FMD outbreak were used over parameters based on a single subject matter expert interview. If any one source was found to be exemplary in its analysis of a particular value, that value was preferentially used. For example, in the case of disease transition state parameters (such as, latent period for CowCalf product type) a thorough metaanalysis of all previous primary source literature was performed in Mardones 2010, so the parameter listed in this paper was used as the NAADSM parameter. 48 The best sources as determined by the criteria listed above were used to determine the NAADSM parameter value: 43 Ward MP et al. \"The Potential role of wild and feral animals as reservoirs of footandmouth disease.\" Preventative Veterinary Medicine. 80. 2007. 44 Mardones F, Perez A, Sanchez J, Alkhamis M, Carpenter T.

For probability distribution functions all best source functions that were not triangular distributions were converted into the triangular format (triangular(a,b,c)) by estimating what the equivalent triangular function would be, where a is the minimum value, b is the point at which the maximum probability occurs and c is the maximum value). An average was found at points a,b and c and the consensus function was given as a triangular distribution. Where there was a single best source with a nontriangular distribution function, the best source function was used. Where the majority of best sources for a parameter listed the same function that function was used and an average value was not found. Values were identified for sensitivity testing: For single point values, the maximum and minimum values described by the best sources were tested as part of the sensitivity analysis when multiple values were described and when there was a significant range between the maximum and minimum value. For probability distribution functions, those functions listed by best sources that were significantly different at any one point were tested. NAADSM Transit Data Purpose The purpose of the NAADSM model is to predict the epidemiological fallout from a range of scenarios that could result in the release of FMDv from the NBAF in Manhattan, KS. The model also includes many of the states surrounding Kansas in its initial analysis of disease spread. However, given the flow of livestock across state lines, there is the potential for an infected animal to be transported out of the primary study region and into other regions of the country. To account for this, animal inshipment and outshipment data was analyzed to calculate the probability that cattle or swine would be transported from any state in the primary region to any state in a secondary region. This information was used to generate addon models that would simulate a foreign animal disease in a secondary region if triggered by livestock movement during initial model runs. Determining State Regions The first task was to determine which states other than Kansas were of interest for the model. This was accomplished by reviewing the Interstate Livestock Movements report49, which showed the distribution of cattle and swine across the United States. From this distribution map, regions were drawn around states with the greatest numbers of cattle and swine. The resulting primary region consisted of states near to, and including Kansas. These states were Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, Colorado, Texas, Arkansas, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The secondary states were states that were not close or bordering Kansas, but had significant numbers of cattle or swine that would be of a concern 49 Shields, Dennis A., Mathews, Jr., Kenneth H. \"Interstate Livestock Movements.\" Economic Research Service, USDA.

The secondary states included California, Florida, North Carolina, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky. Collecting Animal Shipment Data If available, livestock outshipment data was collected from the primary states and inshipment data from the secondary states because only the unidirectional flow of livestock from any primary state to any secondary state was necessary for the model. Cattle and swine movements between primary states, between secondary states, and from secondary states to primary states were not considered for this task. To obtain the most current and reliable information available, the majority of the final data was collected via personal correspondence with the individual states. From telephone and email correspondence with animal industry and agricultural departments, complete inshipment and/or out shipment data sets were gathered from both primary and secondary states, as listed below in Table 1. When both inshipment and outshipment data was available for any state, inshipment data was used preferentially for the final data set, as states may record the number of animals coming into a state with more accuracy than those leaving the state.50 Additionally outshipment data for Wisconsin51 was obtained from the state National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) field office. However, not all states maintain such records or have them available, so there were some data gaps.52 50 Shields, Dennis A., Mathews, Jr., Kenneth H. \"Interstate Livestock Movements.\" Economic Research Service, USDA.

This report contained the numbers of cattle and swine moved from any state in the U.S. to any other state; however, this data set was generated from individual state sources. This was problematic, as some states did not have inshipment data available. To address this problem the report tallied the outshipments to any particular state as a way to record the number of livestock imports a state received if that state did not have inshipment information available.55 However, some states lacked both outshipment and inshipment data, or only had data for cattle but not swine and viceversa.56 As a result, even after generating a state's inshipment data from other states' outshipment data there were numerous gaps in this data set. Additionally the report failed to indicate which data was actually in shipment data and which was a summation of other states' outshipment data, so there was no easy way to distinguish which data was the most accurate. Thus it was only used to determine the values that could not be obtained from personal correspondence with the states themselves. 53 Shields, Dennis A., Mathews, Jr., Kenneth H. \"Interstate Livestock Movements.\" Economic Research Service, USDA.

October 2010 K7 NBAF After collecting both inshipment and outshipment data as described above there were still a few values that remained unknown, and so a method had to be established to generate these values. Since data was available on the total number of 2008 inshipments for all secondary states57, it was determined that these values could be multiplied by the percent of total U.S. cattle and swine each primary state contained. For example, if Missouri had 4.62% of the nation's swine, then it would account for 4.62% of California's total hog inshipments. Knowing that California imported 59,000 swine in 200858, then using this formula Missouri should have outshipped 2,726 swine to California. To determine the percent of total U.S. cattle and swine within primary state, the total number of these animals in the U.S. as of January 1, 2008 or December 1, 2007, respectively, was divided by the total number of cattle and swine in each individual primary state as of 2008 or 2007.59,60 This assumed that the percentage of U.S. total cattle or swine that a primary state contained would be equivalent to the percentage of its inshipments each secondary state received from that state. Evaluating Estimates The method for obtaining estimates of the movement of cattle and swine required certain assumptions, most notably that the percent of livestock that a state owned would be equivalent to the percent of its total inshipments a second state received from that first state. However, there might have been regional or international flows that came into play. For example, Indiana imported 279,035 hogs from Canada in 200861; however, the calculations of the percentage of livestock each primary state had was based on the total number of U.S. cattle, and did not take into account the numbers of cattle that came sources outside the U.S. With this in mind, it was necessary to compare these estimates to real values obtained from NASS or personnel correspondence data. Therefore, for those data points that had both real values from actual 57 Agricultural Statistics Board. \"Meat Animals Production, Disposition, and Income: 2008 Summary.\" USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

State of Origin Pennsylvania Indiana Ohio Michigan Kentucky North Carolina Florida California Illinois sets and estimates, the difference between the estimates and real values was divided by the real values. This number equaled the fold difference between the estimated values and the true values. Reviewing these fold differences allowed the SSRA team to determine how accurate the estimates were, as the closer the fold difference was to zero, the more closely the estimate was to the real value received from NASS or personal correspondence. Deriving the Probability of Livestock Movement Once the data set containing the numbers of cattle and swine that were moved interstate was complete it was necessary to determine the probability of cattle and swine in each primary state moving to each secondary state.62 To do this the numbers of cattle and swine that any primary state moved to any secondary state was divided by the total number of cattle or hogs in each primary state. These annual probabilities were then divided by 365 to create a chart of the daily probability of livestock movement among states. These values for cattle are presented below in Table 2. Also, because Kansas was the focal state the probability of cattle movement from Kansas to Wisconsin and Minnesota was calculated, even though they were primary states. These values are presented in Table 3. 62 This number does not include animals destined for immediate slaughter.

October 2010 K9 Table 3: The probability that any bovine will move from Kansas to any secondary state, Wisconsin, or Minnesota daily Pennsylvania Indiana Ohio Michigan Kentucky North Florida California Illinois Minnesota Wisconsin calculations had to take into account the multitude of years that the movement data came from and that swine and cattle inventories are not done at the same time of year. Cattle inventory to determine state totals is performed on January 1 of each year, while the swine inventory is performed on December 1. Since December 1 of the previous year is closer to January 1 than December 1 of that same year, swine movement data was matched with the inventory for the previous year, while cattle movement data was matched with the inventory from the same year (e.g. if the number of cattle moved was taken from 2005 data, the January 2005 NASS cattle inventory total was used; if the number of swine moved was from 2005 data, the December 2004 NASS swine inventory total was used). Using this method ensured that each animal movement data value was divided by the most accurate state inventory for the year it was pulled from to obtain the most accurate probability of livestock transport possible. Estimating the Numbers of Infect ious Cattle that Move to Secondary States Using the NAADSM model outputs of the numbers of newly infected animals63 per day for a given outbreak scenario, the number of Kansas cattle that were transported to any secondary state can be calculated. For each day of an outbreak the cumulative total of infected cattle was multiplied by the probability of an animal going to any given state (recorded in Table 3), which resulted in the number of infected animals that had been transported to any secondary state at each day. The number of infected animals that were moved from Kansas into a secondary state as of the day of the first detection of the disease in Kansas could then be used to model the start of an outbreak in that secondary state. Vector Data Estimating Mosquito Bite Rate The experimental methodology for assessing mosquito bite rate varies widely. First, mosquitoes are either trapped or counted in real time. Typical trapping experiments include a hostbaited trap (i.e. humanor bovinebaited) or a CO 2baited miniature light trap. Typical real time experiments involve either an exposed human who makes a count of mosquitoes attracted to him or an exposed test animal with a human counter close by to count attracted mosquitoes. Each of these methods has drawbacks and advantages. For baited trap experiments (host or CO 2) mosquitoes are typically allowed to fly into a trap and then are unable to fly out. At set intervals all mosquitoes are removed from the trap, typically with a vacuum apparatus. The researcher may then simply count the total number of mosquitoes in the enclosure, count the total number of female mosquitoes in the enclosure, count only one specific 63 The number of newly infected animals includes both swine and cattle. However, because the number of infected swine is relatively low compared to that of cattle, for the purpose of modeling cattle transit they were included in the total number of infected animals.

Engorged and Non\u00adEngorged Mosquito Counts for Cont rol Animals in an Insecticide Efficacy Study.65 Mosquito Engorged 85% NBAF SSRA Report species of mosquito in the enclosure or count the number of engorged mosquitoes in the enclosure. Data are typically reported as a bite rate, regardless of methodology. CO 2 baited traps have been shown to result in some bias in the species collected, as certain species are more reliant on CO 2 for finding a host. In the case of realtime experiments, with an exposed host, each mosquito that lands is counted or each mosquito that bites is counted. Again, both types of experiments may be reported as a bite rate. Engorgement Rate As many studies report a landing rate instead of a bite rate it was necessary to determine how often a mosquito bites a host. A study, which investigated efficacy of different insecticide treatments for cattle, counted the number of engorged and nonengorged female mosquitoes of a specific species that were trapped on an untreated or treated cow. Mosquitoes were given 10 minutes posttrapping in a cattle baited trap to finish feeding before being collected (data summarized in Table 4). This data was used to calculate an average engorgement rate, which was used in conjunction with experimental data for trapping rate to calculate a bite rate. It was estimated that about 88% of trapped Aedes spp. mosquitoes are engorged.64 It was assumed that other species of mosquitoes were engorged at a similar proportion, as specific data was not found. Human Bite Rate Data was collected from multiple sources to calculate an approximate bite rate over a 24hour period for humans in Kansas (Table 5). More weight was given to studies conducted in close proximity to Kansas or in a similar climate. The most accurate data was assumed to come from experiments where data was derived from exposed humans reporting bite number over a period of time. The drawback to this type of experiment is that the period of exposure is typically very short, usually from 1 to 5 minutes, resulting in a large margin of error when the data is used to extrapolate a bite rate over a 24hour period. While several papers were found that report the mosquitoes' attraction to human hosts, only a 64 Schmidtmann ET et al. \"Suppression of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) and Black Fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) Blood Feeding from Hereford Cattle and Ponies Treated with Permethrin.\"Journal of Medical Entomology. 38(5). 2001. 65 Schmidtmann ET et al. \"Suppression of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) and Black Fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) Blood Feeding from Hereford Cattle and Ponies Treated with Permethrin.\"Journal of Medical Entomology. 38(5). 2001.

The high end of the bite rate was derived from a study of mosquito landings on summer campers that extrapolates to 3,347 bites per 24hours (approximately 139 per hour) if the group of humans were near a water source at dusk and took no antimosquito precautions. A lower bite rate was derived from an Alaska study involving humans wearing mosquito repellant that reported 86.4 bites per 24hours (3.6 bites per hour). Cow Bite Rate For the purposes of the RVF model, it was important to determine the number of bites per 24hours a cow receives in Kansas. Based on the data in Table 6, assuming that 88% of landings would result in a bite, it could be estimated that cattle could experience 4,0006,000 bites per 24hours. However, CO 2 baited traps collected in Kansas after a flood documented considerably fewer mosquitoes (Table 7). The average number of mosquitoes trapped per night (16 hour period) was 144 (the total of all mosquitoes collected each night either by light or gravid traps summarized in Table 7), while the number trapped per night that could potentially transmit RVFv was estimated to be 126 based on the species reported70. Based on this 16hr data, it was estimated that the 24hr rates would be 216 mosquitoes with 189 potentially able to transmit RVFv.

As a result, some mosquito bite mitigation will already be in place as ear tags can reduce the mosquito bite rate by 1755% (Table 9). Additional interventions may be necessary following an outbreak of RVF to reduce mosquito bite rate and disrupt the transmission cycle. Topical application of insecticide is the most promising form of bite rate mitigation as it has been shown to reduce bite rate by up to 87% (Table 9). 82 Schmidtmann ET et al. \"Suppression of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) and Black Fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) Blood Feeding from Hereford Cattle and Ponies Treated with Permethrin.\"Journal of Medical Entomology. 38(5). 2001. 83 Schmidtmann ET et al. \"Suppression of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) and Black Fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) Blood Feeding from Hereford Cattle and Ponies Treated with Permethrin.\"Journal of Medical Entomology. 38(5). 2001. 84 KM, Byford Craig ME and Steiner RL. \"Evaluation of cattle insecticide treatments on attraction, mortality, and fecundity of mosquitoes.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 12(1). 1996. 85 Loftin KM, Byford RL, Craig ME and Steiner RL. \"Evaluation of cattle insecticide treatments on attraction, mortality, and fecundity of mosquitoes.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 12(1). 1996. 86 Loftin KM, Byford RL, Craig ME and Steiner RL. \"Evaluation of cattle insecticide treatments on attraction, mortality, and fecundity of mosquitoes.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 12(1). 1996. 87 Loftin KM, Byford RL, Craig ME and Steiner RL. \"Evaluation of cattle insecticide treatments on attraction, mortality, and fecundity of mosquitoes.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 12(1). 1996. 88 Loftin KM, Byford RL, Craig ME and Steiner RL. \"Evaluation of cattle insecticide treatments on attraction, mortality, and fecundity of mosquitoes.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 12(1). 1996. October 2010 K15 NBAF SSRA Report Post Hurricane Interventions Much of the literature available on emergency mosquito control measures in developed countries reports on aerial insecticide spraying missions to control mosquito populations in areas impacted by hurricanes. Mosquito control campaigns were undertaken and reported in the U.S. following Hurricanes Hugo, Andrew, Charlie, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. 89,90,91 Hurricane Hugo92 According to an internal naval memo, a fourpart mosquito control program was carried out at the Charleston Naval Weapons Station following Hurricane Hugo. The campaign included land and aerial spraying and larvaciding and both mosquito and larval stage populations were significantly reduced. Landing rates decreased from 75/min to 3/min in one area and from 80/min to 25/min in another area. The report provides some recommendations for ground spraying operations, which is unique among the hurricane intervention case studies. Specifically, the \"buffalo turbine\" was found to be a very useful piece of equipment of administering larvacides and for insecticide spraying and the largest obstacle to the operation was a lack of personnel. Hurricane Andrew93 Following Hurricane Andrew, mosquito control efforts were undertaken in both Florida and Louisiana in areas affected by the hurricane. The mosquito control campaigns are briefly outlined by the CDC and provide examples of the problems that might be encountered in a mosquito control campaign and a single example of the efficacy of a single spraying mission. In Florida, treatment of over 650,000 acres with aerial application of insecticide was undertaken for 50 days to control the mosquito population. The overall efficacy of the effort is not reported, however, the results of a single mission (99,000 acres sprayed September 11) were a reduction in daytime landing rate from 14.3 mosquitoes per minute to 0.4 mosquitoes per minute. Additionally, the reduction in CO 2 baited encephalitis vector survey (EVS) trap collection for a single species was reported: 550 Aedes taeniorhynchus per night was reduced to 20 per night. 89 Simpson JE. \"Emergency Mosquito Aerial Spray Response to 2004 Florida Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne: An Overview of Control Results.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 22(3). 2006. 90 Team Leader, Vector Control Team Three (VCTTHREE.

October 2010 K16 NBAF SSRA Report In Louisiana, both aerial and ground spraying was undertaken on 788,000 acres for 36 days after Hurricane Andrew. This campaign was able to immediately reduce the mosquito population, but only shortterm. No data were provided on this campaign, but the fact that this campaign only had short term efficacy can be explained in part by an explosion in the mosquito population following the hurricane. The mosquito population in Florida, in contrast, was not affected by the hurricane; there was simply greater human exposure due to the destruction of shelter. Hurricanes Charlie, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne94 Simpson published an especially detailed account of mosquito control measures taken in 2004 when four hurricanes hit Florida in a period of four months, which was used as a case study to quantitatively determine the efficacy of aerial insecticide spraying. Following each hurricane, affected areas experienced an increase in mosquito populations, an increase in human exposure to mosquitoes and impairment of local mosquito control operations. In response, Florida put together a Mosquito Control Incident Response team to survey affected areas to identify amplified mosquito populations through trapping, and then treat affected areas by aerial insecticide spraying. Spray missions occurred on nights with favorable weather conditions and applied 0.667 oz/acre of Dibrom pesticide from 300 feet. Drawing from thirtysix missions, the typical parameters and outcomes of a spraying mission were determined (Table 10). The typical spraying mission occurred 12 days after a region had been identified as having a mosquito problem through trapping and lasted 12 nights, spraying an average of 179,138 acres. On average, a spraying mission caused a total reduction in the mosquito population of 67.7%, and a reduction in the Culex nigripalpus species of 64.1%. The least effective spraying missions were in the southern portion of the state, especially in Desto and Hendry Counties. The study implies that the reasons for this disparity are complex, including variations caused by the hurricane itself, variations in post hurricane weather and prevalence of certain species of mosquitoes (ex. Culex spp.). Notably, both of these counties were hit by Hurricane Charlie, the earliest (August) and most destructive of the four hurricanes.95 Lafayette County, in the northern portion of the state, also showed poor response to aerial spraying, although it was hit by the weaker, late season hurricane Jeanne. Again, there was no clear reason for this disparity. 94 Simpson JE. \"Emergency Mosquito Aerial Spray Response to 2004 Florida Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne: An Overview of Control Results.\" Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. 22(3). 2006. 95 Pasch RJ et al. \"Tropical Cyclone Report, Hurricane Charley, 9 14 August 2004.\" http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004charley.shtml.
