No wonder humans have been fascinated by crystals for so many thousands of years. And we are no exception. Harnessing the power of crystals in our [Chi Facial Massage Rollers](Chi-Gemstone-Facial-Roller), each featuring stunning pieces of beautiful, genuine, polished gemstone crystal, and in our [Water Crystals ](Water-Crystals)and [Helpiotrope Ear Plugs](Heliotrope-Ear-Plugs) these can help you feel absolutely fantastic inside and out. The stunning crystals that enhance these are so special they are astonishing. They are many, many millions of years old, made deep in the earth way before humans existed. Formed when liquid rock cools and hardens, the crystallisation process makes molecules pull together to create patterns, and every molecule, every pattern, creates a slightly different crystal. Precious emeralds, for example, are made from beryllium aluminum silicate and form when magma from volcanic activity cools very slowly, and diamonds - made from pure carbon - form in deep pipes under our beautiful planet's mantle. The Ancient Egyptians believed in crystal healing. Apparently Cleopatra and other ancient Egyptian royals wore Lapis Lazuli jewellery to help them access ancient knowledge. They ground up copper-rich malachite to prevent infections and even placed quartz crystals on the bodies of the dead to help them reach the afterlife. Healing crystals have been central to Chinese medicine for almost 5000 years, with acupuncture needles originally made from stone. Crystal healing has been part of many, many cultures through time, including the ancient Greeks and the Japanese, the Romans and various Indian cultures. All this history and ancient wisdom sits behind our lovely products.

We can't make any scientific claims about gemstone crystals and their powers of course, but there is a school of thought that believes there are many benefits to them. Michael Gienger, the contemporary analytical crystal healing expert, tells us that crystals absorb energy and convert it into electric energy, with every different kind of crystal emitting a unique frequency.
