As parents with children who have had adverse reactions, we know that all drugs and biologics carry some level of risk. These risks should be evaluated on each personal health history and the potential reward. We parents are the best health advocates for our children - not the state - not the school - and not big pharma. We know their health history better than they do. My girls, and yours, at 16 may not know their full medical history to know if they are contraindicated, leading to a n adverse reaction against HPV or Flu vaccines. In Maryland, childhood and teen vaccination rates are already the highest in the Nation at between 90 and 99% compliance - except for the HPV vaccine. So, what is the big rush? Follow the money. This bill would result in significantly increasing damage from the All Risk / No Reward cash cow HPV vaccine. Did you know that In the US, drug companies are free of liability for any childhood vaccine injury or death; by law, they can't be sued. Consider just three o f many reasons this bill should be stopped; Safety Risks: All drugs and biologics carry some level of risk. For example, Gardasil and Gardasil 9 HPV vaccines have been shown to actually increase a girl's risk of cervical cancer by over 44% if she is HPV positive at the time of inoculation. A teenager is not going to know this. There is no screening. Parents need to be involved in these decisions. Your child will not be told by the health care provider that the incidence of cervical cancer in the US is very low, less than 1% . The onset of such cancers are usually in adults over 50 , so would occur long after any antibodies produced by the vaccine were gone. Parental Rights: The minor and their parents must investigate the possible risks relative to prior health history and individual susceptibility. At 16 years, most minors will not know their history and could easily be subject to peer pressure or coercion without the parent's knowledge or consent. Did you know the Gardasil vaccine was fast -tracked by the FDA and was approved in just six months. Because it was fast -tracked, there are no long -term safety studies, no studies about the interaction with other vaccines given at the same time, and no studies about the interaction with birth control pills. There is also no evidence that it actually prevents cervical cancer. Cost Ineffective: For example, HPV vaccines are marketed to prevent Cervical Cancer with no evidence that they actually do! Meanwhile, slow growing cervical cancer comprises <1% of all cancers, usually in adults past 50 and is preventable with pap screening. There is < \u00bc of 1% lifetime risk of dying of cervical cancer. At about $750 per vaccine regiment, it costs $75million to vaccinate each 100,000 girls in the still unproven chance of preventi ng one death from cervical cancer. Who is going to pay for this? We all are. Recent polls show that Big Pharma the most hated industry in the world. They outspend Oil & Gas 2 to 1 in lobbying. Why would they need to do that? Why do people see drug compan ies' proven malevolence through repeated court case discovery but then accept the lie of benevolence when it comes to childhood vaccines where they have been immune from liability since 1986? Parents need to be involved with health decisions. I believe Hum ans have a right to Informed Consent, do you? If people evaluate the risk and still want it - have at it! This law would pave the way for drug companies to influence and coerce minors through more \"incentives\" and \"giveaways\" to get vaccines like HPV vacc ines - presenting serious health risks for very little benefit. I urge you to advocate for your children and oppose this bill. Cliff McDougall 2309 Ridge Road Reisterstown, MD 21136 410.935.2547 Intro I. Who is Responsible? II. Conflicts III. Surveillance IV.

Statements by the CDC are generic and encompass all vaccines and vaccine ingredients. For example, the CDC states : \"Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism\" \"There is no link between vaccines and autism.\" \"... no links have be en found between any vaccine ingredients and autism spectrum disorder.\" (CDC website, August 2017) These statements are not supported by available science . The CDC's evidence supporting these statements is limited to the MMR vaccine (Taylor 2014), thimerosal preservative (Taylor 2014) and vaccine antigen exposure (DeStefano 2013). Dr. Frank DeStefano of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office is co -author of a paper (Glanz 2015) which states: \"To date, the re have been no population -based studies specifically designed to evaluate associations between clinically meaningful outcomes and non -antigen ingredients, other than thimerosal.\" This statement applies to , among other vaccine ingredients, aluminum adjuva nt. Studies of MMR vaccine cannot be used as evidence of safety for other vaccines, for example vaccines that contain aluminum adjuvant. The overly -broad, generic assertions that no vaccines and no ingredients cause autism are th us not supported by scient ific evidence. In fact, the CDC statements are contradicted by a large, consistent and growing body of scientific evidence, including: 1) studies showing neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory effects (e.g. microglial activation) from dosages of aluminum adjuv ants lower than or approximately equal to dosages received by infants according to the CDC vaccine schedule (Crepeaux 2017, Petrik 2007, Shaw 2013, Shaw 2009); 2) studies linking vaccines to immune activation brain injury (Zerbo 2016, Li 2015); 3) studie s showing that early -life immune activation is a causal factor in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia) (Meyer 2009, Deverman 2009, Estes 2016, Kneusel 2014, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). The accumulating ev idence indicates that vaccine -induced immune activation, and aluminum adjuvant s in particular, may cause mental illnesses and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. In this paper, we present scientific evidence that aluminum adjuvant s can cause autism and other brain injuries. Also, we explain why the studies allegedly supporting the safety of aluminum adjuvants do not show safety for adverse neurological outcomes. 1Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig 1: Proposed mechanism for how aluminum adjuvant s cause autism. Each step is supported by replicated scientific studies. Immune Activation: A Cause of Autism and Mental Illness The term \"immune activation\" describes the activation of the cellular components of the immune system . The developing brain can be injured by immune activation, with life -long consequences (Meyer 2009, Deverman 2009, E stes 2016, Kneusel 2014, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). Immune activation injury is linked to autism, schizophrenia, depression and other mental illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders. Immune activation effects on the brain are mediated by immune system sig naling molecules, especially cytokines (Estes 2016, Meyer 2014, Smith 2007, Choi 2016, Pineda 2013). It is generally accepted that immune activation (e.g., from infection) during pregnancy is a risk factor for autism and schizophrenia in the offspring (Ciaranello 1995, Atladottir 2010, Brown 2012). The intensity and duration of immune activation and cytokine expression appear to be important factor s influencing autism risk (Meyer 2014). Intense immune activation is associated with greater risk of autism (Careaga 2017 , Atladottir 2010 ). Chronic inflammation is associated with greater risk of autism (Jones 2016, Zerbo 2014). However, there is no evidence that short -duration , low -intensity immune activation resulting from common childhood illnesses increa se autism risk. Timing of immune activation in relation to stages of brain development is also an important factor (Meyer 2006 , Meyer 2009 ). Animal experiments have tested the effects of immune activation during pregnancy and postnatally on the developme nt of offspring (Meyer 2009, Deverman 2009, Estes 2016, Kneusel 2014, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). In these experiments, pregnant animals (mice, rats and monkeys) or neonates are injected with a non -infectious immune activating substance such as \"poly -IC\" (w hich mimics a viral infection) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS, which mimics a bacterial infection). These substances cause immune system activation without infection. They induce fever and cytokine production and can have substantial effects on brain developme nt if activation is sufficiently intense or prolonged and if exposure occurs during vulnerable developmental stages. Immune activation has been demonstrated in mice to cause the three core behavioral symptoms of autism : decreased socialization and commun ication, and increased repetitive behaviors (Malkova 2012). Immune activation has also been shown to cause neuropathology (Weir 2015) and behavioral abnormalities in monkeys that resemble behaviors in human schizophrenia and autism (Bauman 2014, Machado 20 15). See Fig. 2. 2Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig 2: Maternal immune activation in monkeys caused behavioral abnormalities in juvenile offspring resembling behaviors in both autism and schizophrenia. MIA1 (Black)= first trimester immune activation; MIA2 (grey) 2nd trimester immune activation; CON (white) saline control. From Bauman et al. 2014 Immune activation also causes non - behavioral effects associated with human autism (c itations here link immune activation with these effects): 1) reduction in Purkinje cells (Shi 2009); 2) mitochondrial dysfunction (Giulivi 2013); 3) increase in brain volume (from IL -6 exposure , Wei 2012(b )) and neuron density in the brain (Smith 2012); 4) long term chronic brain inflammation (Garay 2012); and 5) microbiome disruption (dysbiosis) (Hsiao 2013) . These non -behavioral similarities further support the relevance of the immune activation models to human autism. The non - behavioral ( e.g., physiological) effects of immune activation have been reviewed (Labouesse 2015). The cytokines interleukin -6 (IL -6) and interleukin -17a (IL -17) have been identified as mediating the behavioral effects of immune activation (Smith 2007, Malkova 2012, Choi 2016, Pineda 2013, Wei 2012(a), Wei 2013, Parker -Athill 2010 , Wei 2016 ). The IL -6 findings have been replicated by different researchers using a variety of experimental methods. For example, in an experiment with 3Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network poly -IC, abnormal behavior is almost complet ely prevented by simultaneous administration of IL -6-blocking antibody (Smith 2007, Pineda 2013). Injection of IL -6 by itself causes abnormal behavior that closely matches behavior resulting from poly -IC immune activation (Smith 2007). Inhibition of IL -6 signaling in a genetic autism model (BTBR mice) normalized social and repetitive behavior (Wei 2016). These results demonstrate that IL -6 is responsible for causing abnormal autism -like behavior. The Patterson laboratory at CalTech was the first to repo rt that IL -6 is responsible for causing the autism -like behavioral effects of immune activation (Smith 2007) . Two papers from this research group state: \"IL-6 is central to the process by which maternal immune activation causes long -term behavioral alter ations in the offspring.\" (Smith 2007) \"...blocking IL -6 prevents >90% of the changes seen in offspring of poly(I:C) - injected females, showing that gene expression changes, as well as behavioral changes, are normalized by eliminating IL -6 from the maternal immune response.\" (Smith 2007) \"IL-6 is necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects since the effects...are prevented by injection of pregnant mice with poly -IC combined with an anti -IL-6 antibody, and are mimicked by a single maternal injection of IL -6.\" (Garay 2013) Brain exposure to elevated IL -6 by engineered virus showed that IL -6 exposure, initiated after birth, caused autism -like behaviors (Wei 2012(a)). The Wei 2012(a) paper states: \"We demonstrated that IL -6 is an important mediator of autism -like behaviors. Mice with an elevated IL -6 in brain developed autism -like behaviors, including impaired cognition ability, deficits in learning, abnormal anxiety -like trait and habituation, as w ell as a decreased social interaction initiated at later stages. These findings suggest that an IL-6 elevation in the brain could modulate certain pathological alterations and contribute to the development of autism.\" (Wei 2012(a)) More recent evidence sh ows that IL -17 acts downstream of IL -6 to cause autism -like behavioral abnormalities and atypical cortical development in mice (Choi 2016). Blocking either IL -6 or IL -17 prevents the autism -like behavior; an injection of IL -17 by itself causes the autism -like behavior (Choi 2016). IL-6 is known to induce IL -17 by promoting the development of Th17 cells which produce IL - 17. Immune activation animal models appear to be valid models for human neurological/ psychiatric disorders, including autism (Estes 2016, Careaga 2017, Meyer 2014). The Estes 2016 review argues for the validity of the immune activation models to humans: \"These MIA (maternal immune activation) animal models meet all of the criteria required for validity for a disease model: They mimic a know n disease -related risk factor (construct validity), they exhibit a wide range of disease -related symptoms (face validity), and they can be used to predict the efficacy of treatments (predictive validity).\" (Estes 2016) Evidence suggests a mediating role f or IL-6 and IL -17 in human autism. For example, IL-6 is significantly elevated in the cerebellum in human autism (Wei 2011) and is highly elevated in some brain regions of some autistic individuals (Vargas 2005). Treatment of human autistics with the anti -inflammatory flavonoid luteolin improves autistic behaviors in the individuals that also experience a decline in IL -6 blood levels (Tsilioni 2015). This result is consistent with a causal role for IL-6 in human autism. Also, IL -17 is elevated in human auti sm (Akintunde 2015, Al -Ayadhi 4Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network 2012 , Suzuki 2011 ). Vitamin D reduces IL -17 production (Bruce 2011, Wobke 2014, Drozdenko 2014) and improves autistic behaviors in humans (Saad 2016, Jia 2015). The vitamin D findings are consistent with a causal role for IL -17 in human autism. IL-6 functioning appears to be similar or identical in mice and humans. No mouse - human differences in IL -6 functioning are described in a 2004 review (Mestas 2004). IL- 6 functioning is quite conserved across species (Brown 2014). Centra l nervous system development in rodents and humans is governed by the same principles (Brown 2014). Hence, the fact that IL -6 causes autism -like behavioral abnormalities in animal models deserves a presumption of validity to humans. Immune activation is a risk factor for autism, schizophrenia and other neurological/ psychiatric disorders. The cytokines IL-6 and IL -17 are responsible for mediating the autism -like behavioral effects of immune activation in the animal models. The available evidence supports a causal role for IL-6 and IL -17 in human autism. Maternal vs. Postnatal Immune Activation The timing of immune activation is an important factor influencing effects on the brain. The developing brain is vulnerable to immune activation injury; the mature , adult brain is apparently not nearly as vulnerable. Sensitivity to immune activation likely declines as the brain matures (Meyer 2014, Meyer 2007). In most immune activation experiments, the offspring are exposed to immune activation during gestation (b y stimulating the maternal immune system). In contrast, most vaccines are administered postnatally. This raises the question of whether postnatal immune activation can have similar effects on the brain as maternal immune activation. Diverse evidence indicates that the brain can be adversely affected by postnatal immune activation. Postnatal immune activation experiments, human case reports, and con sideration of brain development timelines suggest that the human brain is vulnerable to immune activation injury for years after birth. In the maternal immune activation experiments, inflammatory signaling and some cytokines (e.g. IL -6) traverse the plac enta into the fetus. Consequently, immune activation in the mother causes immune activa tion and elevated cytokines in the fetus, and in the fetal brain (Oskvig 2012, Ghiani 2011). Postnatal immune activation can have adverse neurological effects, including increased seizure susceptibility (Chen 2013, Galic 2008), learning and memory deficits (Harre 2008), and an increase in excitatory synapse formation (Shen 2016). Seizure disorders, learning and memory dysfunction , and elevated excitatory signalin g are associated with autism. Elevated IL -6 in the brain in the postnatal period causes neuronal c ircuitry imbalance and mediates autism -like behaviors in mice (Wei 2012(a)). The circuitry imbalance observed in Wei 2012(a) was an excess of excitatory syn apses and a deficit of inhibitory synapses . See Fig. 3. Excessive excitatory signaling is observed in human autism (Robertson 2016, Freyberg 2015). In fact, an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling (towards excess excitation) has been posit ed as a central characteristic of autism (Robertson 2016, Freyberg 2015). 5Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig 3: Elevation of IL -6 in the brains of mice (i nitiated shortly after birth ) caused an increase in excitatory synapses (VGLUT 1) decrease in inhibitory synapses (VGAT) . Excessive excitatory signaling from Wei et al 2 012(a). In a maternal immune activation experiment with mice (Coiro 2015), autism - relevant behavior and dendritic spine abnormalities (relevant to autism and schizophrenia) were ameliorated by administering an anti -inflammatory drug postnatally. The drug was started at birth and continued for 2 weeks, which roughly corresponds to age 2 in humans (Semple 2013). This result indicates that brain development is affected by postnatal inflammation , at times correspond ing to when vaccines are given to humans. Several case reports describe previously -healthy children that displayed sudden -onset autistic behavior during or subsequent to infection in the brain. All the cases had signs of intense brai n inflammation. Here are brief descriptions: Delong 1981 : describes 3 children, ages 5, 7 and 11 with full -blown autistic behavior associated with brain inflammation. Brain inflammation was presumed in two cases and confirmed in one. The 5 and 7 year olds recovered completely, and the 11 -year recovered partially. Marques 2014 : describes a previously healthy 32 -month -old girl that suffered autistic regression from a viral central nervous system infection with associated brain inflammation. Ghaziuddin 2 002: describes a previously healthy 11 -year -old boy that suffered permanent autistic regression after sudden onset herpes brain infection with associated brain inflammation. Gillberg 1986 : describes a previously healthy 14 -year -old girl with permanent autistic regression from herpes brain infection with associated brain inflammation. The most parsimonious explanation for these cases is that autistic behavior resulted from intense inflammation and cytokine production in the brain. Accordingly, these cases indicate that the human brain remains vulnerable to immune activation injury well into childhood, though the vulnerability almost certainly decreases with maturation. The susceptibility of older children to inflammation -induced autistic behavior strongly suggests that younger infants, of 0 -2 years of age, are also vulnerable. It is not reasonable to claim, and there is no evidence to suggest, that the age range of 0 -2 years (when most vaccines are given) is uniquely resistant to immune activation 6Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network injury. All the available evidence indicates the opposite. The immune activation experimen ts and case reports are consistent and indicate that immune activation and elevated cytokines in the postnatal period can cause brain injury. The next critical question to consider is whether vaccines can cause immune activation and elevated cytokines in the brain. Postnatal Vaccination Affects Brain Development in Animal Model The first study to test the effect of postnatal vaccination on brain development was published in 2015 (Li 2015). In this experiment, neonatal rats were administered bacillus cal mette -guerin (BCG) vaccine, hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine or a combination (BCG+HBV) timed to imitate human infant vaccination schedules . BCG and HBV vaccines produced opposite effects on the brain. Specifically, BCG enhanced synaptic plasticity and long -term potentiation (LTP, plasticity and LTP. BCG and HBV vaccines also caused opposite changes in some synapse protein levels. HBV vaccine (but not BCG vaccine) increased IL -6 gene expression in the bra in; increased gene expression likely indicates an elevation in brain IL -6. The HBV vaccine contains aluminum adjuvant, and the BCG does not contain aluminum adjuvant. Hence, the aluminum adjuvant may be the ingredient responsible for the elevated IL -6 gene expression. See Fig. 4. Fig. 4: Hepatitis B vaccine, but not BCG vaccine, increased IL -6 gene expression in the brain at 8 weeks after neonatal vaccination. Hepatitis B vaccine contains aluminum adjuvant; BCG vaccine does not. Elevated IL -6 causes autism -like behaviors in animal models. *P<0.05 Adapted from Li et al 2015. The Li et al study showed that the vaccines caused other changes in the brain, including 1) changes in long -term potentiation (LTP) (Hep B decreased LTP), 2) changes in dendritic spines, and 3) changes in synapse protein expression. Changes in synapse proteins and dendritic spines have been observed in human brain disorders. Li et al. attribute the brain effects to changes in cytokine levels and immune polarization (Th1/Th2 polarization) induced by the vaccines. Aluminum adjuvant s cause 7Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Th2 polarization. Li et al. state that the results suggest vaccines can interact by way of immune activation e ffects: \"...our data suggested that combinations of different vaccines can mutually interact (enhance or counteract). The mechanism of synaptic plasticity modulation through neonatal BCG/HBV vaccination may be via systemic Th1/Th2 bias accompanied by a spec ific profile of cytokines and neurotrophins in the brain.\" (Li 2015) Li 2015 demonstrates that vaccines affect brain development by an immune activation mechanism. Further, since aluminum adjuvant s induce Th2 activation and long term Th2 polarization, the Li 2015 results suggest that all aluminum -adjuvanted vaccines may cause adverse effects similar to the HBV vaccine. Accordingly, the Li 2015 results suggest that studies showing that immune activation causes neurological/psychiatric disorders are relevant to vaccine adverse effects. Vaccines Are Given During Synaptogenesis Another way to answer the question of brain vulnerability to immune activation is to consider the types of brain development processes occurring when vaccines are administered. Vaccines are given primarily in the first 18 months after birth. The human brain undergoes intense and rapid development during this period. Synaptogenesis (formation of synapse connections between neurons) is especially intense in this period. The vulnerability of the developing brain to immune activation is apparently related to the specific types of brain development processes occurring (Tau 2010, Meyer 2006, Meyer 2007). Such processes include migration (movement of neurons to final locations in the brain), adhesion (formation of chemical -mechanical attachments between brain cel ls), and synaptogenesis (formation of synapse connections between neurons), among others (neurogenesis, gliogenesis, myelination etc). Cytokines affect brain development processes. For example, elevated IL -6 affects migration, adhesion and synaptogenesis (Wei 2011). Elevated IL -6 in the postnatal period promotes an excess of excitatory synapses and a deficit of inhibitory synapses, and mediates autism -like behaviors (Wei 2012(a)). In humans, a dramatic increase in synaptogenesis begins around the time o f birth, and continues until about age 3 (Huttenlocher 1997, Tau 2010, Stiles 2010, Semple 2013). Vaccines are administered during this intense synaptogenesis. See Figs. 5-6. Elevated brain IL -6 induced by vaccination during synaptogenesis may cause an exc itatory -inhibitory imbalance, towards excitation. An excitatory imbalance has been observed in human autism (Robertson 2016, Freyberg 2015). Synaptogenesis tapers off through childhood and adolescence. This fact may explain why some older children and te ens can suffer autistic regression after intense brain inflammation, but apparently become less vulnerable to immune activation brain injury with age. Intense synaptogenesis occurs at ages 0-18 months, when many vaccines are administered. Consequently, va ccines may adversely impact synaptogenesis if they induce inflammation or IL -6 in the brain. The timing of brain development processes in humans supports the idea that the human brain is vulnerable to immune activation and cytokines in the first few year s after birth , when vaccines are administered. Disruption of synaptogenesis by vaccine - induced immune activation is a particular concern. 8Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig. 5: Timeline of specific brain developmental processes in humans.

Without Al adjuvant s, these vaccines would have greatly reduced efficacy . Alumin um adjuvant s comprise sub - micron particles (primary particles) of aluminum compounds, typically AlOH, AlPO4 , AlSO4 or mixtures. The primary particles are typically agglomerated into larger particles with sizes of about 2 -20 microns (Harris 2012). The Al adjuvant materials have low solubility in water and body fluids. Al adjuvant particles are biopersistent and can remain in the body for months or years (Flarend 1997, Khan 2013, Gherardi 2001). Aluminum ingested in the diet has low oral absorption (about 0.3%), is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, is (mostly) excluded from the brain by the blood -brain barrier , and is in a solubilized, Al3+ ionic form (not particulate) . These defenses are adequate for protecting the brain from natural levels of aluminum expo sure. These protective mechanisms are unable to protect the brain from injected aluminum adjuvant particles. Al adjuvant particles are too large to be removed by the kidneys, and are carried across the blood -brain barrier by macrophages. Dosages of alumi num adjuvant s received by infants according to the CDC vaccination schedule are: Birth (Hep B): 74 mcg/kg (250 mcg infant) 2 month: 245 mcg/kg (1225 mcg for 5 kg infant) 4 month: 150 mcg/kg (975 mcg for 6.5 kg infant) 6 month: 153 mcg/kg (1225 mcg for 8 kg infant) These are maximum -possible dosages (because different vaccine products have different a mounts ) for average -weight infants. Accumulating evidence shows that aluminum adjuvant s have adverse neurological effects at dosages lower than or approximately equal to dosages infants receive from vaccines. These effects appear to depend on the particulate nature and biopersistence of the aluminum adjuvant. Injected Al adjuvant has adverse effects that are apparently mediated by the particles and independent of solubilized Al3+ ions released by the slowly dissolving particles (Crepeaux 2017) . Al adjuvant injections in mice cause adverse effects at vaccine -relevant dosages of 100, 200, 300 and 550 mcg/Kg body weight (Crepeaux 2017, S haw 2009, Petrik 2007, Shaw 2013). These include deficits in learning and memory (Shaw 2009), deficits in neuromuscular strength/function (Petrik 2007), and changes in locomotor activity and/or gait (Shaw 2009, Shaw 2013). Autism is associated with gait an d movement abnormalities (Kindregan 2015) and memory dysfunction (Williams 2006). 10Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig. 7: Dosage of 300mcg/Kg A lOH adjuvant caused large and persistent changes in exploratory behavior and movement in open field tests. This is an indicator of neurotoxicity. Human autistics also display abnormal movemen t and exploratory behavior. Adapted f rom Shaw and Petrik 2009. 11Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Al adjuvant dosages of 200mcg/Kg (as 3 x 66mcg/Kg) (Crepeaux 2017) and 300mcg/Kg (as 6 x 50mcg/Kg) (Shaw increased microglial activation in the ventral forebrain and lumbar spinal cord, respective ly. The elevated microglial activation was measured about 6 months after Al adjuvant injection, which suggests that the microglial activation is chronic. Activated microglia indicate an ongoing inflammatory process and suggest the presence of elevated cyto kines. Human autistics have activated microglia and elevated cytokines throughout the brain (Vargas 2005, Suzuki 2013, Li 2009). Fig. 8: Al adjuvant (200mcg/Kg) caused an increase in microglial activation in the brain of mice. The protein iba1 indicate s activated microglia.

From Shaw and Petrik 2009. 12Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Activated microglia are implicated as a causal factor in autism, because microglia mediate inflammation in the brain. Microglia can produce IL -6 when in an activated state. A recent review on microglia and autism (Takano 2015) states: \"...any factors that alter the number or activation state of microglia either in utero or during the early postnatal period can profoundly affect neural development, thus resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism.\" (Takano 2015) Microglia appear to play an important role in the causation of autism (Takano 2015, Kneusel 2014) . Hence, the microglial activation caused by aluminum adjuvant s suggests a role in autism. Several studies show that Al ad juvant s increase brain aluminum content (Crepeaux 2017, Flarend 1997, Shaw 2009, Khan 2013 , Crepeaux 2015 ). A dosage of 200 mcg/Kg Al adjuvant caused a 50 -fold increase in brain aluminum content in mice, from 0.02 ug/g to 1.0 ug/g dry weight of brain (Crep eaux 2017). These measurements were performed 6 months after the final injection, indicating that the Al persists in the brain long -term (Crepeaux 2017). See Fig. 10 . Al adjuvants have been found to accumulate in the brain of mice up to one year after injection (Khan 2013). Crepeaux 2015 demonstrated persistence and increasing accumulation of Al adjuvant particles up to 270 days in spleen and lymph nodes of mice. Inc reasing accumulation of Al in distant organs over time suggests that toxic effects may increase with time, and may be delayed by months or years after exposure. The 400 and 800 mcg/Kg doses used in the Crepeaux 2017 study did not cause adverse effects or elevated brain aluminum. The authors attribute this surprising inverted dose -response relationship to granulomas induced by the higher dosages. Granulomas trap the Al adjuvant at the injection site, thereby preventing its transport into the brain and other sensitive tissues. Granulomas occur after about 1% of vaccinations (Bergfors 2014). This is cause for concern because it indicates that, for 99% of vaccinations, the Al adjuvant can be transported around the body. It is not confined to a granuloma. See Fi g. 11 . Fig. 10 : Dosage of 200 mcg/Kg Al adjuvant caused a 50 -fold increase in brain aluminum content, from 0.02 to 1.00 ug/g dry weight, in mice. Higher dosages (400 and 800 mcg/Kg) did not increase bra in Al content, presumably because the higher dosages caused a granuloma at the injection site. A granuloma traps the Al adjuvant at the injection site, thereby preventing systemic dispersal and transport into the brain. These measurements were performed 6 months after the final injection, indicating that the Al persists in the brain long -term. *P<0.05. From Crepeaux et al., 2017. 13Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig. 11 : High dose Al adjuvant injection into the muscle causes a granuloma, which traps the Al adjuvant and prevents it from traveling into the brain. Low dose does not form a granuloma. Hence, the low er dose is free to travel to th e brain. Consequently, the lower dose is more toxic than the higher dose. This mechanism explains th e surprising inverted dose - toxicity results of Crepeaux et al. 2017. Particle Transport and Macrophage Chemotactic Protein (MCP -1) Aluminum adjuvant s travel into the brain (Khan 2013, Crepeaux 2015, Crepeaux 2017, Shaw 2009, Flarend 1997) . Al adjuvant particles are carried through the blood -brain barrier and into the brain by macrophages (Khan 2013) . Transport is promoted by (Khan 2013). MCP -1 causes macrophages to travel around the body and into the brain. Particle transport into the brain by macrophages is well -established and has been investigated for therapeutic applications (Choi 2012, Pang 2016). MCP -1 is elevated in the brains of human autistics (Vargas 2005) and is elevated in the blood of neonates later d iagnosed with autism (Zerbo 2014). This suggests that neonates with high MCP -1 will experience elevated Al adjuvant transport into the brain when injected with Al adjuvanted vaccines. This is consistent with Al adjuvants causing autism by inducing immune activation and elevated cytokines in the brain. Aluminum Induces IL -6 Expression In The Brain Water -soluble aluminum salts (e.g. AlCl3, Al lactate) induce elevated IL -6 in the brain and other tissues . In fact, aluminum appears to selectively induce IL -6 (Viezeliene 2013). Studies of aluminum exposure and IL - 6 expression in the brain include: Cao 2016: Ingestion of 30 or 90 mg/kg/day aluminum ( as AlCl3) for 90 days significantly increased gene expression of IL -6 and other cytokines in the brai n (hippocampus) 2016: Ingestion of 3.4 mg/kg/day aluminum (as AlCl3) for 6 weeks caused a 4 -fold increase in IL -6 in the brain (hippocampus). This dosage is far lower than the outdated \"no observed adverse effects level\" (NOAEL) oral dosages (26 and 62 mg/kg/day) used as benchmarks for toxicity threshold (Mitkus 2011, Offit 2003). In fact, other experiments show that oral dosages of 3.4, 4, 5.6, 6, and 20.2 14Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network mg/Kg/day aluminum cause numerous adverse effects in mice or rats and hence the NOAEL for orally ingested Al is currently unknown (Alawdi 2016, Dera 2016, Sethi Sethi 2009, Bilkei -Gorzo 1993). The induction of IL-6 may occur because aluminum strongly induces oxidative stress (Exley 2003). Oxidative stress induces IL-6 expression (Viezeliene 2013) . CDC Website Cites Fatally Flawed Study Of Al Adjuvant s (Mitkus 2011) Dosages of Al adjuvant s received by infants increased dramatically as the vaccine schedule was expanded in the 1980s and 1990s. However, as the vacci ne schedule expanded, the increasing dosages of Al adjuvant s were not tested for safety. Government agencies (HHS, NIH, CDC, FDA) have not pursued any new experimental work on Al adjuvant toxicity. To support the safety of Al adjuvant s at today's higher dosages, the CDC cites a 2011 FDA study of aluminum exposure from vaccines (Mitkus 2011). This study is the only scientific evidence cited by the CDC and FDA website s to support the safety of Al adjuvant s. The Mitkus 2011 study is a th eoretical modeling study of Al adjuvant kinetics; it contains no new data concerning Al adjuvant toxicity (from animal models or epidemiology). Mitkus 2011 calculates a body burden of aluminum resulting from the slow dissolution of Al adjuvant particles, a nd compar es the dissolved -aluminum body burden to a \"minimal risk level\" (MRL). The MRL is derived from a study of ingested Al toxicity in mice (Golub 2001) . The Golub 2001 study provides the NOAEL (26 mg/kg/day ingested), which is converted into the MRL f or human infants (based on 1mg/kg/day ingested) by using a safety factor of about 30. The Mitkus study is fatally flawed for these reasons: 1) MITKUS ASSUMES AL ADJUVANT PARTICLES A RE HARMLESS Mitkus makes an unstated assumption that Al adjuvant s have zero toxicity while in particulate form. Mitkus only considers the potential toxicity of aluminum ions (Al3+) released by the slowly -dissolving Al adjuvant particles. Al adjuvant s comprise low-solubility and biologically -persistent microscopic particles. The Mitkus analysis assumes that the particles are absolutely nontoxic and perfectly harmless, even when present in the brain and other organs. Mitkus provides no justification for this unstated assumptio n. Further, the assumption is contradicted by recent findings on Al adjuvant toxicity (Crepeaux 2017) and particulate toxicity generally. Particles can have toxic effects mediated by surface chemistry (e.g. surface charge and surface catalytic activity) an d particle shape, among other characteristics of solid particles (Sharifi 2012, Podila 2013). Several studies show injected Al adjuvant s cause behavioral abnormalities, abnormal weight gain, learning and memory impairment, motor neuron death/apoptosis, neuromuscular strength deficits, chronic microglial activation/brain inflammation, and large (e.g. 50X) increases in brain and spinal cord aluminum content (Petrik 2007, Shaw 2009, Shaw 2013, Crepeaux 2017). These adverse effects occur at dosages less than or approximately equal to dosages received by infants according to the CDC vaccine schedule. 2) NEW RESEARCH SHOW S INGESTED AL HARMFUL AT DOSAGES LOWER THAN 26 MG/KG/ DAY Mitkus assumes that Al adjuvant toxicity is mediated exclusively by solubilized Al (Al3+ ions) released by the slowly - dissolving Al adjuvant particles. To establish a threshold toxicity level from the solubilized Al, Mitkus relies on a mouse feeding study (Golub 2001) reporting a \"no-observed adverse effect s level \" (NOAEL) oral dosage of 26 mg/Kg/day ingested aluminum. Mitkus 15Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network used a 30X safety factor for app lying this dosage to humans, which is reasonable . However, other experiments show that much lower oral dosages of 3.4, 4, 5.6, 6, and 20.2 mg/Kg/day aluminum cause adverse effects in mice or rats (Alawdi 2016, Dera 2016, Sethi 2008, Sethi 2009, Bilkei -Gorzo 1993). The adverse effects include chronic brain inflammation, learning and memory impairment, and kidney inflammation. So, the Mitkus analysis is wrong because 26 mg/kg/day is not a NOAEL. The \"minimal risk level\" (MRL) determined by Mitkus is too high by a factor of at least 26/3.4 = 7.6. Using a corrected NOAEL of 3.4 mg/Kg/day (based on Alawdi 2016) results in vaccine aluminum exposure exceeding the MRL for AlPO4 adjuvant, and ap proximately matching the MRL for AlOH adjuvant. The new, corrected MRL lines indicate that Al phosphate adjuvant (Fig. 12) and Al hydroxide adjuvant (Fig. 13) from the CDC vaccine schedule may cause toxicity from the solubilized Al per se. Since 3.4mg/ Kg/day is not a NOAEL (adverse effects were observed at this dosage) the true NOAEL is less than 3.4/mg/Kg/day. See Fig s. 12 -13. Fig. 12 : Body burden vs. MRL comparison chart for Al phosphate adjuva nt (AlPO4) corrected in accordance with the new discovery (Alawdi 2016) that ingestion of 3.4 mg/kg/day Al causes adverse effects. The body burden exceeds the corrected MRL curve for almost the entire first year of life, indicating toxicity. The toxicity o f Al adjuvant particles is a separate, additional issue. MRL 50 and MRL 5 refer to two different infant growth rates. Adapted from Mitkus et al., 2011. 16Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network Fig. 13 : Body burden vs. MRL comparison chart for Al hydroxide adjuvant (AlOH), corrected in accordan ce with the new discovery (Alawdi 2016) that ingestion of 3.4 mg/kg/day Al causes adverse effects. The body burden overlaps the new, corrected MRL, indicating borderline toxicity. The margin of safety is gone. MRL 50 and MRL 5 refer to two different infant growth rates. The toxicity of Al adjuvant particles is a separate, additional issue. Adapted from Mitkus et al., 2011. 3) NO AL ADJUVANT TO XICITY DATA CITED, DESPITE AVAILABILITY Mitkus does not cite any toxicity data for injected Al adjuvant s. Mitkus instead uses toxicity data for ingested, non -particulate, water -soluble Al ( Golub 2001, which used Al lactate) to derive the MRL. This data comes from a single study (Golub 2001). So, remarkably, Mitkus claims a safe level of injected Al adjuvant exposure, without citing any Al adjuvant toxicity data . The error is unnecessary and neglectful because at least two animal studies of injected Al adjuvant toxicity were available prior to the Mitkus publication in 2011 (Petrik 2007, Shaw 2009). These papers were not cited or mentioned by Mitkus 2011 . Each of these three flaws is fatal for the validity of the Mitkus study in establishing the safety of aluminum adjuvant s. Hence, the CDC is completely lacking valid evidence for the safety of Al adjuvant s. This is especially true for safety regarding neurological and long -term outcomes, because other available studies of Al adjuvant safety ( e.g., Jefferson 2004) do not consider (or are incapabl e of detecting) these outcomes. CDC Fails To Investigate Toxicity of Al Adjuvant s The CDC has conducted no epidemiological studies on long term safety (e.g. considering neurological outcomes) of Al adjuvant s. There is one ecological study of country -level data, which reported an association between Al adjuvant exposure and autism (Tomljenovic 2011). However, being an ecological study, it is highly susceptible to confounding and biases. Dr Frank DeStefano of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office is co -author of a 17Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network feasibility study (Glanz 2015) on using the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to investigate the safety of individual vaccine ingredients. The paper focuses on Al adjuvants . It acknowledges that thimerosal is the only vaccine ingredient studied for autism or neurological safety, and that a possible association between Al adjuvant s and autism has not been explored in epidemiological studies. Glanz 2015 states: \"To date, there have been no population -based studies specifically designed to evaluate associations between clinically meaningful outcomes and non -antigen ingredients, other than thimerosal.\" The CDC has not investigated Al adjuvant safety concerns, despite the accumulating scientific evidence of ha rm and evidence linking Al adjuvant s to immune activation mechanisms of brain injury.1 1 However, the Glanz paper notes that studies of aluminum adjuvants are problematic because of expected small differences in exposures in the low and high exposure groups. Glanz 2015 conc ludes: \" ...children below the 10th percentile would be exposed to between 0 mg and 3.1mg, while children above the 90th percentile would be exposed to between 4.8 mg and 5.3 mg of aluminum from vaccines. It is unclear if such differences in aluminum exposure would be biologically meaningful. \" (Glanz 2015). So, epidemiological studies may not provide reliable evidence for safety or harm. Controlled, prospective human trials of aluminum adjuvant exposure from vaccines will likely be prohibited for ethical reas ons. Also, Al adjuvants are essential ingredients for Al adjuvanted vaccines. Consequently, it will be Conclusion The science reviewed here tells a consistent and compelling story: that vaccines may cause autism by stimulating immune activation and elevated cytokines in the brain. Al adjuvant s are implicated as a cause of autism because they can be transported into the brain, because they cause microglial activation at vaccine -relevant dosages, and because aluminum induces IL -6 in the brain. In statements asserting no vaccine - autism link, the CDC cites scientific evidence that is not relevant to Al adjuvant safety or is incapable of disproving an Al adjuvant -autism link (Taylor 2014, DeStefano 2013 , Mitkus 2011 ). In support of claims for Al adjuvant safet y, the CDC r elies on a profoundly flawed theoretical modelling study (Mitkus 2011). There is little scientific evidence supporting the safety of Al adjuvants, especially in relation to autism and other long term neurological outcomes. challenging to design studies of long term adverse effects of Al adjuvants in humans. Experiments in animal models can provide valuable information. Al adjuvants should be tested for effects on: 1) excitatory/inhibitory imbalance; 2) core symptoms of autism (social, communicative and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors); 3) IL -6, IL -17, and other cytokine levels in the brain; 4) other physiological abnormali ties associated with autism (e.g. dysfunction, microbiome Purkinje cell loss, cerebellum abnormalities etc); and 5) microglial activation and immune activity in the brain. Investigating these outcomes can provide valuable informati on concerning the safety of Al adjuvants. 18Autism & Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Informed Consent Action Network References Akintunde et al., 2015 Increased production of IL -17 in children with autism spectrum disorders and co -morbid asthma, Journal of Neuroimmunology 286 (2015) 33 -41.

Consequently, they may be at increased risk of complications from infectious diseases and require additional precautions and treatments.Vaccines: What About Immunocompromised Schoolchildren? 1. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED? Immunocompromised schoolchildren have the option to receive all the vaccines licensed for children in the United States, except for the live virus vaccines (such as vaccines targeting measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella infections).2 Although vaccination often results in protective levels of antibodies in immunocompromised children,3-7 clinical vaccine safety trials typically exclude immunocompromised subjects.8 In addition, vaccines have not been The vaccination status of other schoolchildren does not pose a significant risk to immuno- compromised schoolchildren for the following reasons (Table 1): Some vaccines cannot prevent the spread of the bacteria or viruses they target. Immune globulin (plasma containing antibodies) is available for immunocompromised children exposed to certain infectious diseases. Some infectious diseases rarely cause complications in immunocompromised schoolchildren. Not all infectious diseases are contagious. Some infectious diseases are not spread in schools.evaluated for their potential to cause cancer, genetic mutations or impaired fertility in the general or immunocompromised population.9 Due to these limitations, it is not known whether the benefit of vaccinating an immunocompromised child outweighs the risk of vaccine injury to that child. 3. CAN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED SCHOOLCHILDREN BE VACCINATED?4. DOES THE VACCINATION STATUS OF OTHER SCHOOLCHILDREN POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO IMMUNO- COMPROMISED SCHOOLCHILDREN? The Immune Deficiency Foundation states, \"Years ago, a diagnosis of a PI [primary immune deficiency] meant extremely compromised lives... Today, with early diagnosis and appropriate therapies, many patients diagnosed with a PI can live healthy, productive lives. \" Modern treatments have reduced the risk of many immunocompromised children so that they are able to attend school.12. CAN IMMUNOCOMPROMISED CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL? Immunocompromised schoolchildren are not put at significant risk by the vaccination status of other schoolchildren.Children who are not severely immuno- compromised can attend school with the approval of their doctor.Delivering Data on Infectious Diseases & Vaccines IMMUNOCOMPROMISED SCHOOLCHILDREN - RISK GROUP INFORMATION STATEMENT (RGIS)\u00a9 2019 Physicians for Informed Consent, an independent 501(c)(3) nonpr ofit educational organization.

Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing, hugging, holding hands, coughing, sneezing, or sharing eating utensils,28 and the main routes of hepatitis B transmission (sexual contact, injection drug use, or being born to an infected mother)29 do not occur in school. Nearly all cases of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) occur among children younger than 5 years of age; therefore, nearly all Hib transmission does not occur in school.30 Human papillomavirus (HPV) is sexually trans- mitted and is therefore not spread in school.31 Some infectious diseases are not spread in schools.Children vaccinated with the diphtheria, teta- nus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (DTaP) or the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) can still be infected with diphtheria-causing bacteria, pertussis bacteria, or poliovirus and spread them to others, even with mild or no symptoms of their own.10-13 The influenza vaccines (TIV and LAIV) have not been observed to significantly reduce the spread of influenza.14,15 About half of schoolchildren vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can still be infected with measles virus and spread it to others, even with mild or no symptoms of their own.16-19Some vaccines cannot prevent the spread of the bacteria or viruses they target. Immune globulin (plasma con - taining antibodies) is available for immunocompromised children exposed to certain infectious diseases. Immune globulin (IG) is available for the prevention of severe symptoms in immuno- compromised children exposed to measles or rubella (IG does not provide protection for fetuses of expectant mothers infected with rubella).20,21 Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VIG) is available for the prevention of severe symptoms in immunocompromised children exposed to varicella (chickenpox).22 Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) are also available for immunocompro- mised children.2\u00a9 2019 Physicians for Informed Consent, an independent 501(c)(3) nonpr ofit educational organization.

Immunity from Liability for Vacc ine Harms . By the early 1980s, pharmaceutical companies were facing crippling liability for injuries to children caused by their vaccines.3 Instead of letting these market forces drive them to develop safer vaccines, Congress passed the National Childhoo d Vaccine Injury Act (the \" 1986 Act\") which eliminated pharmaceutical company liability for injuries caused by their vaccine products.4 2. Pharmaceutical Compan y Misconduct. Since 1986, Merck, GSK, Sanofi and Pfizer have paid billions of dollars for miscondu ct and injuries related to their drug products .5 These same companies manufacture almost all childhood vaccines, but because of the 1986 Act, cannot similarly be held accountable for misconduct and injuries related to their vaccine products. HHS CONFLICTED FROM ASSURING VACCINE SAFETY 3. HHS Must Defend Against Any Claim of Vaccine Injury . After eliminating liability for pharmaceutical companies, the 1986 Act established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (\" Vaccine Court \"), part of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, to compensate 1 https://ori.hhs.gov/chapter -3-The-Protection https://www.nap.edu/read/2138/chapter/2#2 (\"The litigation costs associated with claims of damage from vaccines had forced several companies [by 1986] to end their vaccine ... programs as well as to stop producing already licensed vaccines.\") 4 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -11 (\"No person may bring a civil action for damages in the amount greater than $1,000 or in an unspecified amount against a vaccine administrator or manufacturer in a State or Feder al court for damages arising from a vaccine -related injury or death.\"); Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.S. 223, 243 (2011) (\"the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act preempts all design -defect claims against vaccine manufacturers brought by plaintiffs who seek compensation for injury or death caused by vaccine side effects\") 5 https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/ 2408.pdf 6 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -12 (\"In all proceedings brought by the filing of a petition [in Vaccine Court] the Secretary [of HHS] shall be the respondent.\"); https:// www. congress. gov/ 106/crpt/hrpt977/CRPT -106hrpt977.pdf (HHS amended the Vaccine Court rules to make it extremely difficult to obtain compensation and \"DOJ attorneys make full use of the apparently limitless resources available to them,\" \"pursued people injured by vaccines.6 Under the 1986 Act, HHS is the defendant in Vaccine Court and is legally obligated to defend against any claim that a vaccine causes injury.7 There is no right to discovery in Vaccine Court a nd HHS is represented by the formidable resources of the U.S. Department of Justice (\" DOJ\").8 In nearly every case the injured person bears the burden to prove causation .9 Despite these hur dles, since 1986, HHS has paid over $4 billion for vaccine injuri es.10 4. HHS Incriminates Itself if it Publishes or Admits a Vaccine Can Cause a Harm. If HHS publishes any study supporting that a vaccine causes a harm, that study will then be used against HHS in Vaccine Court.11 This greatly limits HHS's incentive to publ ish safety studies . 5. CDC's Childhood Vaccine Schedule Was Created by Pharma Insiders. Congress has repeatedly found that the members of the FDA and CDC committees responsible for approving most of the currently licensed and recommended childhood vaccine s had serious conflicts of interests with pharmaceutical companies .12 VACCINE SAFETY : CONCERNS & LIMITATIONS 6. HHS Fails to Perform Basic Vaccine Safety Requirements . After eliminat ing the market forces that assure d vaccine safety, Congress made HHS directly responsible for vaccine safety pursuant to a section of the 1986 Act entitled the \"Mandate for safer childhood vaccines.\"13 As HHS recently aggressive defenses in compensation cases,\" \"establish[ed] a cadre of attorneys specializing in vaccine injury\" and \"an expert witness program to challenge claims.\") 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 9 The 1986 Act created a Vaccine Injury Table (the \" Table \") which was intended to permit the Vaccine Court to quickly compensate certain common vaccine injuries. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -12. For Table injuries, the burden shifts to HHS to prove the vaccine is not the cause. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -13. After passage of the 1986 Act, almost 90% of claims were Table claims and quick ly settled. Stevens v. Secretary of HHS, No. 99 -594V (Office of Special Masters 2001) . However, in the 1990s, HHS amended the Table such that now 98% of new claims are off-Table. http:// www. gao.gov/ assets/ 670/ 667136. pdf. As a result, injured children \"must prove that the vaccine was the cause\" in almost -Reform.pdf 13 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa -27 Page 2 of 4 conceded in federal court, it has not perform ed even the basic requirements of t his section , such as submit ting reports to Congress on how HHS has improved vaccine safety .14 7. Pediatric Vaccine Clinical Trials (i) Lack Placebos and (ii) Are Too Short . The pivotal clinical trials relied upon to license childhood vaccines do not include a placebo -control group and safety review period s in these clinical trials are typically only days or months.15 The safety profile for a pediatric vaccine is therefore not known before it is licensed and routinely used in children.16 8. Post-Licensure Safety . After licens ure and use by the public , federal law requires that the package insert for each vaccine include \" only those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.\"17 Inserts for childhood vaccines include over one hundred serious immune, neurological and other chronic conditions that their manufacturers had a basis to believe are caused by their vaccines.18 9. Prevalence of Vaccine Harm. The CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (\"VAERS \"), to which doctors and patients may voluntarily report adverse vaccine event s, received 58,381 reports in 2018 , including 412 deaths, 1,237 permanent disabilities, and 4,217 hospitalizations.19 An HHS - funded three -year review by Harvard Medical S chool of 715,000 patients stated that \"fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported\" to VAERS.20 This could mean there are a hundredfold more adverse vaccine events than are reported to VAERS . The CDC has nonetheless r efused to mandate or automate VAERS reporting.21 10. Children Susceptible to Vaccine Injury. While the Institute of Medicine (\" IOM \") has explained that 14 http://icandecide.org/government/ICAN -HHS-Stipulated -Order -July-2018.pdf 15 V) 23 https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/vaccines/approvedproducts/ ucm 0 93833.htm \"most individuals who experience an adverse reaction to vaccines have a preexisting susceptibility,\" HHS and CDC have failed to conduct studies to identify children susceptible to vaccine harms while at the same time recommending vaccines for all children .22 11. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity & Infertility. Most vaccines have never been evaluated for their potential to cause cancer, mutate gene s or cause infertility.23 12. Autism . Autism is the most controversial of the claimed vaccine injuries and the o ne HHS and CDC declare they have thoroughly studied. Most parents with autistic children claim vaccines (including DTaP, Hep B, Hib, PCV13, and IPV , each injected 3 times by 6 months ) are a cause of their child's autism .24 The CDC tells these parents that \"Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism.\"25 However, there is no science to support this claim for almost all vaccines. For example, reports from the IOM in 1991 and 2012 , and HHS in 2014 , tried but failed to identify any stud y to support that DTaP does not cause autism .26 The same is true for Hep B, Hib, PCV 13, and IPV.27 The only vaccine actually studied with regard to autism is MMR , and a Senior CDC Scien tist claims the CDC did find an increased rate of autism after MMR in the only MMR/autism study ever conducted by the CDC with American children.28 Moreover, HHS's primary autism expert in Vaccine Court recently provided an affidavit explaining that vaccin es can cause autism in some children.29 Given the lack of studies regarding vaccines and autism , it should come as no surprise that there is a dearth of scientific studies that support the CDC's other claims regarding vaccine safety . 13. HHS Refuses to Conduct Vaccinated Vs. Unvaccinated Stud ies of Vaccine Schedule. A true epidemic in the U.S. is the fact tha t 1 in 2 children have an autoimmune, developmental, neurological , or chronic disorder.30 These conditions have sharply Page 3 of 4 risen in lock -step with the increa ses in the CDC's recommended vaccine schedule .31 That schedule has risen from 7 injection s of just 2 vaccines in 1986 to the current total of 50 injections of 12 different vaccines .32 The need to compare health outcomes of vaccinated and unvaccinated child ren is urgent. In 2017, a seminal study found that babies receiving the DTP vaccine died at 10 times the rate of unvaccinated babies.33 In another study , children received influenza vaccine or a saline placebo ; while both groups had a similar rate of infl uenza, the vaccinated group had a 440% increased rate of non -influenza infections.34 A recent pilot study from the School of Public Health at Jackson State University found that 33% of vaccinated preterm babies had a neuro - developmental disorder compared t o 0% of the unvaccinated preterm babies ; and vaccinated children in this study had an increased risk of 290% for eczema, 390% for allergies, 420% for ADHD, 420% for autism, and 520% for learning disabilities .35 Nonetheless, HHS and CDC refuse to publish any studies comparing the health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.36 MMR VACCINE 14. Measles is a Mild Childhood Illness. The mortality rate from measles declined by over 98% between 1900 and 1962 as living conditions improved in this countr y.37 In 1962, a year before the first measles vaccine, the CDC reported a total of 408 deaths.38 That amounts to 1 in 500,000 Americans at a time when measles infected nearly every American.39 15. Eliminating Measles Has Increased Cancer Rates . Eliminating mea sles has increased cancer rates. For example, the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that individuals who never had measles had a 66% increased rate of Non -Hodgkin and a 233% increased rate of Hodgkin Lymphoma .40 Combined, these ca ncers killed 20,960 Americans in 2018.41 As another example, individuals who never had measles , mumps or rubella had a 50% increased rate of ovarian cancer.42 In 2018, ovarian cancer killed 14,070 Americans.43 Eliminating measles in this country has caused more deaths from cancer. 16. Eliminating Measles Has Increased Heart Disease . A 22 -year prospective study of over 100,000 individuals in Japan revealed that \"measles and mumps, especially in case of both infections, were associated with lower risks of mortal ity from atherosclerotic CVD [heart disease].\"44 Heart disease killed 610,000 Americans our ecological relationship with measles , mumps and rubella has had serious unintended consequences. 17. Side effects from MMR vaccine . The MMR vaccine has serious risks. For example, the MMR vaccine causes seizures in about 1 in 640 children, five times the rate from measles, as well as \"thrombocytopenic purpura,\" \"chronic arthritis,\" and \"brain damage.\"46 However, because the MMR was not licensed based on a placebo -controlled clinical trial and post -licensure studies are limited, there are many suspected harms the CDC has yet to confirm or rule out , such as those listed on Merck's package insert for the MMR .47 18. Waning Immunity . While the vaccinatio n rate for measles in the United States has been stable over the last 20 years, what has changed is that Americans who have had measles (which confers lifetime immunity) are being replaced by those vaccinated with MMR (which does not typically confer lifet ime immunity).48 MMR produces no immunity in 2 % to 10% of vaccinees ; and 22 years after two doses of MMR approximately 33% of vaccinees are again 42 death from 1959 to 1962 was appx. 400 per 4 million https:// www. cdc.gov/ vaccines/ pubs/ pinkbook/meas.html cases ). 47 https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/UCM123789.pdf 48 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/G/ coverage.pdf Page 4 of 4 potentially susceptible to measles .49 The proportion after 30 years is even higher.50 Yet the only focus is on children whose parents have reason to believe the MMR may cause them harm, while ignoring the efficacy issues with this vaccine. OTHER VACCINES 19. DTaP Vaccine . According to the FDA, those vaccinated with DTaP will have fewer symptoms of pertussis , but will become infected and transmit pertussis , and \"will be more susceptible to pertussis throughout their lifetimes.\"51 This means the children vaccinated for pertussis are more likely to catch and spread pertussis as asymptomatic carriers , while the unvaccinat ed are less likely to catch pertussis (and when they do will have symptoms and know to stay home ).52 Since p ertussis is very common and more of a concern than measles , as long as children vaccinated for pertussis are permitted to attend school, children no t vaccinated for measles should also be permitted to attend school. In any event, the immunity provided by DTaP for pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria wanes within a few years.53 20. Inactivated Polio Vaccine . For the last 20 years, the only polio vaccine use d in the U.S. is inactivated polio vaccine (\" IPV\"), which is injected intramuscularly, after it was determined that the oral polio vaccine can cause paralysis.54 Polio is spread through fecal to oral contamination, and IPV does not prevent colonization and transmission of polio; it only potentially prevents polio from traveling to the spinal column.55 Hence, those vaccinated or not vaccinated with IPV can equally become infected and transmit polio; but, it is the vaccinated who are considered less likely to have symptoms and thus more likely to spread polio. 21. Chicken Pox Vaccine . Children vaccinated for chicken pox can spread chicken pox virus for six weeks after vaccination.56 Moreover, t he immunity from this vaccine wanes and, absent natural boosting from exposure to chicken pox virus, can lead to shingles.57 The increased risk of shingles from use of this vaccine is why countries, such as the United Kingdom, have not added it to their routine vaccine schedule.58 22. Note . There are additional efficacy and safe ty issues with the above vaccines and other vaccines not addressed due to space constraints. For example, aluminum adjuvant particles in vaccines, which animal studies reveal deposit in brain and bones, or the millions of snippets of human DNA cultured fro m the cell lines of aborted fetuses in certain vaccines .59 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION The foregoing highlights a few of the vaccine safety and efficacy issues necessitating the need for informed consent for vaccination and the ability to openly criticize our vaccine policies . At the least, the following should occur before censoring concerns regarding vaccine safety: a. Vaccine safety duties should be removed entirely from HHS and placed into an independent board ; b. Pharmaceutical companies should be liable for injuries caused by their vaccine products ; and c. The childhood vaccine schedule and each vaccine should be safety tested in a properly sized long -term placebo -controlled clinical tria l.
