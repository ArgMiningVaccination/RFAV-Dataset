Overview for Biomedical Sciences BS - Recent biomedical sciences graduates are employed at American Medical Response, American Red Cross, IBM, KAPS Biotechnology, ScribeAmerica, SUNY Upstate Medical University, and more. - Graduates have pursued medical school and graduate degrees in the health sciences at universities such as Boston University School of Medicine, Cornell University, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York Chiropractic College, New York University School of Medicine, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, and more The biomedical sciences degree prepares students for advanced study in various areas of health care (e.g. medicine, dentistry, nursing, public health) or research. The diverse curriculum includes a broad array of elective courses and offers students career-relevant experiential learning opportunities where they can apply the knowledge they gain in the classroom to real-world experiences. Comprehensive academic and faculty advising is complemented by a pre-medical/pre-health professions advising system that provides guidance to students in their selection of course work and in completing the requirements necessary for admission to advanced degree programs. What is Biomedical Science? The field of biomedical science combines biology and medicine to maintain and promote the health of both humans and animals. It is also an investigative field in which you will conduct hands-on research in order to solve pressing health problems. The biomedical sciences will provide you with a solid foundation to pursue medicine, health care professions, and research in areas such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, nutrition, physiology and kinesiology, epidemiology, diseases, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacology, and more. RIT's Bachelor's in Biomedical Sciences The bachelor's in biomedical sciences is a comprehensive program of study that consists of a life sciences core combined with a broad range of flexible elective options that enable you to customize your education to pursue your professional areas of interest. The life sciences core provides students with a strong grounding in mathematics and science with a complement of liberal arts in preparation for entry into medical and dental schools, graduate studies in the health professions, or direct entry into a research position in an applied area of biomedical science. In consultation with an academic adviser, and using a basic course schedule as a guideline, you will select from elective courses relevant to one of these career paths or design your own set of science track electives. Biomedical sciences majors may also choose elective courses to engage in undergraduate research or independent study with a faculty mentor. These opportunities are not limited to the biomedical sciences faculty or their laboratories. Many of our students participate in highly interdisciplinary research with faculty from the [College of Science](https://www.rit.edu/science/), the [Kate Gleason College of Engineering](https://www.rit.edu/engineering/), the [Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.rit.edu/computing/), and other centers and colleges at RIT. We strongly encourage you to explore the world beyond RIT-through study abroad, community service, experiential learning, and summer research internships. In addition, a [minor](https://www.rit.edu/study/minors) in one of more than 100 areas of study allow you to pursue a secondary field of interest. The goal of the bachelor's in biomedical sciences is for you to develop the multidisciplinary skills, self-confidence, and cross-disciplinary literacy that allows you to thrive in the dynamic, rapidly changing world of biomedicine and biomedical sciences.

Careers in Biomedical Sciences Dynamic career opportunities in the biomedical sciences continue to grow. This increase in demand is due, in part, to advances in biotechnology, the need for more researchers studying health care problems, medical procedures, and diseases, better treatments for current and emerging health issues, and public policy challenges. With its grounding in the sciences and mathematics, along with a complement of liberal arts courses, the bachelor's in biomedical sciences is the perfect preparation for a range of career preparation. Medical School and Graduate Programs in the Health Sciences: The bachelor's in biomedical sciences offers excellent undergraduate preparation for careers in medicine (allopathic and osteopathic), biomedical research, exercise science, pathology, pharmacy, pharmacology and drug development, toxicology, neuroscience, and genetic counseling. Direct Entry Into Research Positions: Along with course work related to your curriculum, you will also have vast opportunities for hands-on research experiences in a range of areas. These opportunities will prepare you well for direct entry into research positions where you will investigate and explore solutions to a range of medical and health care problems. Premedical and Health Professions Advisory Program Medical schools and graduate programs in the health professions (e.g., physician assistant, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc.) welcome applications from students majoring in a wide range of academic programs. Acceptance into these programs requires the completion of pre-med requirements such as course work in biological and physical sciences, a strong academic record, pertinent experiences in the field, and key intrapersonal and interpersonal capabilities. RIT's [Premedical and Health Professions Advisory Program](https://www.rit.edu/study/pre-med-advising-program) can help you become a competitive candidate for admission to graduate programs in the medical and health professions. Pre-Vet Advising Program Being accepted into veterinary school requires a strong academic record, GRE preparation, and accruing hours of direct animal care under the supervision of a veterinarian (DVM), researcher (Ph.D.), or other animal health professional. RIT's [Pre-Vet Advising Program](https://www.rit.edu/study/pre-vet-advising-program) provides you with individual, personalized support to helps you fulfill the veterinary school requirements needed for you to become a competitive candidate for admission to veterinary school.
