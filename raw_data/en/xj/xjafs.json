If you're just jumping in, we're right in the middle of an 8 week series highlighting mind/body techniques that will help to optimize your hormones, improve your fertility health, decrease the negative impacts of stress, and strengthen your mind-body connection. We're exploring everything from Yoga to Hypnotherapy to Maya Abdominal Massage, and many others in between. While these therapy techniques are great to improve your chances of conception if you're trying to get pregnant, but they also ensure a healthier, happier pregnancy and postpartum experience! And they are truthfully wonderful practices to incorporate into your life no matter your what stage of life you're in. Remember that these practices can be incorporated into your life as frequently or as infrequently as you might prefer. Some of you may find more value incorporating these techniques into your life every day - for example, I meditate each morning before starting my day to settle and focus my mind - whereas some of the therapies (like acupuncture), I do on a weekly basis. As I've suggested each week, try each technique and see what speaks to you personally. What works for you will be completely different than what works for another woman. But I can almost promise that at least one of these mind/body techniques will speak to you and really help to calm your mind, ease your stress and improve your overall well-being. So far we've covered: These posts contain a TON of great information - free meditation resources, descriptions of every style of yoga, step-by-step details of what to expect in your acupuncture treatment, and plenty more. I HIGHLY recommend checking them out if you haven't done so already! This week we're covering an ancient Chinese treatment called Emotional Freedom Technique, more commonly known as \"EFT.\" EFT is a psychological acupressure technique that uses a similar methodology to [acupuncture](https://sarahjanesandy.com/mindbody-therapy-blog-series-acupuncture/) in that it is based on the idea that specific meridians of energy flow through the body. The big difference is that this practice does not include the use of needles, as is experienced in an acupuncture treatment. In an EFT session, specific meridian points are stimulated to assist in balancing the energy in our bodies. In this practice, it is believed that \"all negative emotions are caused by a disruption in the body's energy system.\" Thus by balancing our energy flows, negative emotions are resolved and change can be brought about in the psychological condition of the individual involved. Emotional Freedom Technique is especially beneficial in reducing stress and removing psychological blocks to conception, such as past traumas, memories, and negative beliefs about pregnancy, birth and parenthood. While I would typically recommend at least going to visit a professional for your first few appointments - acupuncturists are typically trained in Emotional Freedom Technique - EFT can also be completed anywhere, anytime on your own. All you need are your hands and knowledge of where the relevant meridian points are located! (Check out my favorite resource below to learn more.) At a high level, EFT is performed as a combination of tapping the energy meridian and voicing affirmations. When these two are combined together, they work to release the emotional block from the body's bioenergy system to restore a deeper mind / body balance. A typical session, whether completed by a professional or by yourself, usually goes something like this: Use your index and middle finger for tapping. There are a large number of acupuncture meridians in your fingertips, as well as in the acupressure points you are tapping. Ideally you want to use your fingertips, rather than your finger pads. (But don't stress too much about using your finger pads if you have long fingernails.) Tap solidly, but not hard enough to hurt or bruise yourself. Alternate your tapping at those few points that include both sides (chest & under your arms), rather than tapping them simultaneously. This will increase the impact on either side, rather than dividing your attention. Check out the resource ' [Overcoming Fertility with EFT](https://www.thetappingsolution.com/eft-articles/eft-for-coping-with-infertility-and-enhancing-fertility/)' if you are specifically interested in using EFT to improving fertility health. It gives clear EFT instruction in a practical, easy to use format that is suitable for all fertility-related issues. What's your experience with Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)? Have you tried it?
