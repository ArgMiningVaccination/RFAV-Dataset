Given the success of antibody-mediated immune checkpoint blockade inrelieving regulation of endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses in tumor-burdened hosts, we investigated whether checkpoint blockade could improve the ef cacy of responses induced with a whole tumor-cell vaccine. We show that administration of a single dose of blocking antibody was suf cient to signi cantly enhance antitumor activity of the vaccine, inducing complete radiological regression of establishedintracranial tumors. The antibody or vaccine alone were ineffective in this setting. The antibody had to be administered before, or close to, vaccine administration, suggesting CTLA-4 blockade had an impact on early priming events. The combined treatment resulted in enhanced trapping of leukocytes in thelymphoid tissues, including T cells that had undergone signi cant proliferation. There were no obvious changes in the stimulatory function of antigen-presenting cells or the number and function of regulatory T cells, suggesting T cells were the targets of the checkpoint blockade. While tumors regressing under combined treatment were highly in ltrated with a variety of leukocytes, tumor eradication was dependent on CD4 CT cells. Analysis of the TCR repertoire showed that the addition of anti-CTLA-4 at priming reshaped the repertoire of tumor in ltrating T cells. In particular, the oligoclonal populations became greater in magnitude and more diverse in speci city. Using anti-CTLA-4 in a restricted way to promote the priming phase of an anti-cancer vaccine may offer a useful way of harnessing clinical bene t from this powerful agent.KEYWORDS Vaccine; checkpoint blockade; anti-CTLA-4; glioma; TCR sequencing Introduction The quality of T cell responses is regulated by a balance of co- stimulatory and inhibitory signals received by T cells at differ- ent times during their differentiation into effector cells. Theinhibitory signals, which are mediated by a series of receptorson the T cell surface, are often referred to as immune check-points because they maintain self-tolerance and prevent auto-immunity by limiting the activity of self-reactive T cells.However, by in fluencing the expression of these receptors and their ligands, tumors exploit these same inhibitory pathways to limit the activity of endogenous anti-tumor T cells responses that are often induced in cancer patients. 1The development of monoclonal antibodies to block immune checkpoints is a newtreatment modality that is transforming cancer treatment,exempli ed by the recent regulatory approval of blocking anti- bodies against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) 2 and programmed death-1 (PD-1).3While these treatments have validated the concept of enhancing T cell-mediated immune responses for clinical impact, it is clear that not all patients respond. Given that checkpoint blockade relies onunleashing endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses, it ispossible that patients who fail to respond to treatment have not induced endogenous T cell responses of suf cient quality or quantity in the rst place. There is therefore considerable inter- est in using vaccines to initiate anti-tumor responses (or boostweak responses), which could then potentially be enhancedthrough checkpoint blockade. Despite the central nervous system (CNS) traditionally being considered an immune-privileged site, there is nowaccumulating evidence that malignant tissue in the CNS canbe targeted by T cells, 4giving impetus to develop vaccines for diseases like high-grade glioma for which current treatments are generally ineffective. However, the development of effec-tive cancer vaccines faces numerous challenges, including ahigh level of tumor heterogeneity and a paucity of de ned gli- oma-associated antigens. With surgery being a mainstay ofglioma treatment, it is possible to use resected tumor materialas a \"personalized \"source of tumor antigens. Indeed, intact irradiated tumor cells can provide a ready-made vehicle for delivery of these antigens to ant igen-presenting cells (APCs) within the host. However, to elic it an effective T cell response it is critical that these APCs a lso receive strong licensing CONTACT Ian F.

We have recently explored the potential of a vaccine comprised of irradiated glioma cells pulsed with the glyco-lipid a-galactosylceramide ( a-GalCer), a compound that stimulates type I natural kille r T cells (NKT cells). The glyco- lipid is acquired by host APCs and presented to NKT cells viathe MHC-I like molecule license APCs through CD40 signalin g to increase their stimula- tory function. Since CD1d is a non-polymorphic molecule and the transgenic T cell receptor (TCR) of NKT cells is largely invariant, the licensing afforded by NKT cells is inde-pendent of tissue type, making a-GalCer an attractive immune adjuvant with general utility. In an orthotopicmurine model of glioma we have demonstrated that sucha-GalCer-adjuvanted vaccines prevent the development of tumors in a challenge setting, 6but were insuf cient to bestow long-term survival in a therapeutic setting unless regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediated suppression was overcome. Here we investigated whether anti-tumor responses generated by an a-GalCer-adjuvanted glioma vaccine can bene- t from checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 ( a-CTLA-4). Because CTLA-4 is upregulated early after T cell activation, wereasoned that antibody administration close to vaccinationmay have most impact. We show that using a-CTLA-4 in this limited fashion to reduce regulation around the priming phase reshapes the size and diversity of T cell populations that in l- trate intracranial tumors. This was associated with long-termsurvival in the majority of treated animals. Results Therapeutic vaccination can be enhanced by CTLA-4blockade in an orthotopic murine model of glioma toinduce complete radiological regression Cells from the glioma cell line GL261 engraft and form solid tumors when injected subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Thistumor model was used to assess the ef cacy of a vaccine based on intravenous injection of a-GalCer-pulsed, irradiated GL261 cells. When the vaccine was administered seven days beforetumor challenge, signi cant protection was observed ( Fig. 1A , Left). However, when administered seven days after challenge, vaccination failed to eradicate the established tumors ( Fig. 1A , Right). To determine whether therapeutic outcomes could beimproved by checkpoint blockade, vaccination was combinedwith blocking antibodies for CTLA-4. A single dose ofa-CTLA-4 administered by intraperitoneal injection one day prior to vaccination (day 6 after tumor challenge), or threedays after vaccination (day 10) induced complete tumor regres- sion after an initial period of tumor growth ( Fig. 1B ), although reduced tumor growth was observed when a-CTLA-4 was delivered prior to vaccination. We next investigated whethe r anti-tumor vaccination could be improved by checkpoint blockade in an intracranialsetting. Neither vaccination or a-CTLA-4 alone had any impact on symptom-free survival in this setting. However, asingle dose of a-CTLA-4 prior to vaccin ), preventing onset of tumor-associated symptoms in the majority of mice. As wasobserved in the subcutaneous set ting, delaying administrationofa-CTLA-4 until after vaccine delivery reduced tumor-free survival, suggesting that blockade of CTLA-4 signaling wasmost relevant when applied close to immune priming(Fig. 1D ). No evidence of neurologic de cit was observed in any of the treated mice, and long-term survivors showedhealthy weight gain suggesting no obvious morbidity ( data not shown ). Also, mice that responded completely to the com- bined treatment were able to reject subcutaneous tumor chal- lenge 100 days after initial intracranial implantation, suggesting a response with immunological memory had beeninduced (Supplementary Fig. 1). We performed radiological and histopathological analysis of the tumors subjected to vaccination with or withoutprior a-CTLA-4 treatment to determine how combination therapy affected the rate of tumor progression. Analysis byMRI 20 days post tumor implantation revealed gadolinium enhanced regions in the brains of all challenged mice regardless of treatment. As expected, all untreated mice andthose that received monotherapy developed glioma-associ-ated symptoms and had to be culled within a few days ofthis analysis. In contrast, four of the ve mice that received the combination treatment remained symptom-free, andcould be scanned again at day 41. Of these, two nowshowed complete loss of the enhanced regions, another was substantially reduced in size, and the fourth increased in size only slightly. In a separate experiment, histopatholog- ical analysis of tumors on day 20 demonstrated that ani-mals that received the combined treatment had signi cantly reduced tumor size compared to untreated animals(Fig. 1E ,F). Mice treated with the vaccine or a-CTLA-4 alone had hypercellular tumors with a high mitotic rate(Fig. 1G , Supplementary Table 1), whereas mice treated with the combination had relatively hypocellular tumors with low mitotic activity. Thus, tumors were clearlyengrafted in all groups, but the combination treatmentalready showed some antitumor impact by day 20. It wasnotable that these tumors were more in ltrated with immune cells than tumors treated with either monotherapy(Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). The appar-ent discrepancy between tumors that appeared larger on MRI than by histology may be analogous to the phenome- non of pseudoprogression observed in human patientsundergoing treatment for glioma. 7Lymphocytes were more commonly seen in the peritumoral brain of the combinedtreatment group but it is unlikely this increased cellularityalone could account for the d iscrepancy between MRI and histology. A more likely explanation is that the abundantcellular in ltrate in the tumor is associated with greater capillary permeability, contributing to accumulation of gad- olinium and oedema fluid in perilesional tissues. Vaccine-induced activation of NKT cells is not affected by CTLA-4 blockade We next investigated how the combination of CTLA-4 block- ade and vaccination affected early immune events in lymphoid tissues. The combined therapy failed to prevent tumor growth in CD1d-de cient animals ( Fig. 2A ), suggesting that even in the presence of a-CTLA-4 the mode of activity of the vaccinee1376154-2 C. S.

It was possible that a-CTLA-4 enhanced NKT cell activation, improving their licensing function. To addressthis, we assessed the proportion, number and function ofCD1d-restricted NKT cells in the spleen following vaccinetreatment with or without prior a-CTLA-4 administration. Blocking CTLA-4 signaling had no impact on the percentage ofNKT cells detected in the spleen seven days after vaccination, nor did it have any impact on their capacity to produce IFN- g (Fig. 2B-D ). We have previously shown that the a-GalCer- adjuvanted vaccine triggers NKT cell-dependent release IFN- ginto the serum, aswell IL-12p70, which likely derives from the licensed APCs. 6 No differences in the kinetics or magnitude of cytokine accu- mulation in the serum were observed when a-CTLA-4 was combined with the vaccine ( Fig. 2E ), again suggesting blocking CTLA-4 signaling did not enhance NKT cell activation. Inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling does not enhance the stimulatory capacity of APCs Trogocytosis of CD80 and CD86 by CTLA-4 expressing cells has been reported to maintain low activation status ofAPCs. 8It was therefore possible that inhibition of CTLA-4 Figure 2. Improved therapeutic ef cacy of vaccine by CTLA-4 blockade is dependent on NKT cells, but is not due to enhanced NKT cell activity.

To explore this, the expression of CD86 wasexamined on splenocytes co-cultured with titrated doses ofvaccine in the presence or absence of a-CTLA-4 in vitro . While cultures containing the vaccine showed increasedexpression of CD86 on CD11c Cdendritic cells (DCs) in a dose-dependent manner, re flecting the adjuvant activity of a-GalCer, this was not affected by the presence of a-CTLA- 4(Fig. 3A ,B). No impact of combination with a-CTLA-4 w a ss e e no no t h e rA P C si n c l u d i n gp l a s m a c y t o i dD C sa n dBcells, nor were other markers of APC activation affected,including CD40 ( data not shown ). In a similar in vivo experiment, activation of splenic APCs was assessed at vari-ous times following vaccination with or without prioradministration of a-CTLA-4, or following administration of a-CTLA-4 alone. Peak expression of CD80 and CD86 onCD11c CDCs was observed 24 hours following vaccination, with the highest expression observed in vaccinated animalsthat did not receive a-CTLA-4 ( Fig. 3C ,D). To elucidate whether a-CTLA-4 administration imparted functional dif- ferences in APCs, we assessed the ability of APCs isolatedfrom treated mice to induce T cell proliferation in vitro . Splenocytes isolated from mice 18 hours after treatmentwere pulsed with peptide corresponding to the I-A b-binding epitope chicken ovalbumi n and cultured with CFSE- labelled CD4CT cells from OT-II mice. While splenocytes from vaccinated mice induced increased proliferation of thetransgenic CD4 CT cells relative to splenocytes from untreated controls, the proportion of proliferating cells wasnot affected by in vivo administration of a-CTLA-4 (Fig. 3E ). These data suggest that treatment with a-CTLA-4 prior to vaccination does not enhance the stimulatory func- tion of APCs in this model. Figure 3.

While a modest trend towards increased proliferation of T cells was observed with vaccine treatment, it was interesting that signi cant proliferation of both CD4 Cand CD8CT cells was observed in mice treated with a-CTLA-4 alone, suggesting inhibition of CTLA-4 signaling can unleash T cell proliferation in the absence of an obviouspriming signal in this model. The greatest proliferativeresponse, involving CD4 Cand CD8CT cells, was observed when mice were treated with vaccine and a-CTLA-4 (Fig. 4A ,B). To establish whether such enhanced proliferation corresponded with an augmented T cell response in the lym-phoid tissues of mice that received the combined treatment inthe absence of adoptive transfer, we next examined the numberand proportion of T cells in the spleen on different days aftervaccination. Signi cantly increased cellularity was observed after three days in mice administered the vaccine alone com-pared to untreated controls, which was reduced to normal levels by day 7. Increases were most pronounced in mice administered a-CTLA-4 and vaccine, with splenocyte numbers remaining high at day 7 ( Fig. 4C ). This increase in cellularity involved all cell-types examined ( data not shown ). However, signi cant changes in the T cell compartment were observed, with num-bers of CD4 CT cells and CD8CT cells increased with the com- bined therapy in the spleen ( Fig. 4E ,F), while no changes in the number of regulatory T cells (CD3CCD4CFoxP3Ccells; Tregs) were observed ( Fig. 4D ). The function of isolated Tregs was not altered by treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3) Interestingly,although signi cant proliferation of CFSE labelled cells had been observed in the earlier experiment in mice that receiveda-CTLA-4 alone, this observation was not re flected in increased T cell accumulation in the spleen. Vaccine-induced stimulationwas therefore required to drive the signi cant T cell accumula- tion seen with the combined treatment, and indeed was required for the phenomenon of increased cellularity. The phenotype of the CD4 Cand CD8CT cell population in the spleen was assessed at various times following the differenttreatment regimens based on expression of CD44 and CD62L(Fig. CT cells (CD44hiCD62Llo) was observed in the spleens of mice treated with a-CTLA-4 prior to vaccination, compared to vac- cine or a-CTLA-4 monotherapy, with peak expansion occur- ring at day 7 ( Fig. 5B ). Numbers of CD8Ceffector T cells were also increased, albeit to lower levels than CD4CT cells, and occurring earlier at day 3 ( Fig. 5C ,D). Similar results were observed in the mediastinal lymph nodes (SupplementaryFig. 4). Also, a greater proportion of splenic CD4 Cand CD8C T cells from mice subjected to TNF- afollowing re-stimulation in 5E ,F), suggesting tumor-speci c T cells were highly represented in the expanded population. Together thesedata suggest that the combined treatment creates an environ-ment in which leukocytes accumulate in the lymphoid tissues,with T cells highly represented. Neither treatment alone hadthis outcome. Therapeutic ef cacy of vaccine and a-CTLA-4 is CD4 C T cell dependent To explore the effector phase of the combined treatment strat- egy, immune in ltrates in the whole brain were analyzed seven days after therapy ( Fig. 6 ). No obvious increases in in ltration were observed with a-CTLA-4 treatment alone. A trend towards increased number of CD45Cimmune cells was observed in the brains of mice treated with vaccine alone com-pared to no treatment, but statistically signi cant increases were only seen when vaccination was combined with a-CTLA- 4, predominantly featuring T cell compart- ment, CD4CT cells were the most highly represented, remark- ably accounting for 60 -75% of CD3Ccells in the brain. In contrast, no differences in numbers of CD8Cor Tregs were seen with the different treatments ( Fig. 6D ,E). In MHC II-de - cient mice, which are unable to mount CD4CT cell responses, the combined therapy failed to control tumor growth, whereas this treatment was still effective in TAP1-de cient mice, despite the signi cantly reduced CD8CT in these ani- mals ( Fig. 6F ). These data suggest that CTLA-4 blockade can improve the outcome of vaccination by promoting potentCD4 CT cell-mediated responses that effectively marshal the elimination of established glioma. Mechanistically, this mayinvolve cytokine-mediated activation of myeloid cells, as mostactivity was lost when the combined treatment was used in ani- mals de cient in IFN- g, or when CD11b Ccells were depleted with diphtheria toxin (DT) in transgenic mice with humanDTR expressed from the CD11b promoter (SupplementaryFig. 5). To examine the impact of CTLA-4 blockade on vaccine- induced T cell responses, we sequenced TCR bCDR3 regions from tumor-bearing mice, taking samples from pre- and post-treatment blood and from post-treatment brain tissue to deter- mine whether antitumor ef cacy was associated with general changes in TCR diversity. Examining responses induced by thevaccine alone, there were no changes in overall richness (num-ber of unique productive rearrangements in test samples) orclonality of T cells in the blood after treatment, butlower richness and higher clonality of T cells in the brain. Thisindicates that the brain tissue (and likely the tumor) was in l- trated with a limited subset of T cells from the available reper- toire ( Fig. 7A ). When the vaccine was combined with CTLA-4 blockade, increased clonality could be seen in the blood post-treatment. Furthermore, there was increased richness and clon-ality in the brain compared to animals in the vaccine onlygroup, suggesting CTLA-4 blockade had provoked in ltration of a larger oligoclonal population. To emphasize this, heatmaps were prepared based on numbers of templates for the tope1376154-6 C. S. FIELD ET AL.500 rearrangements detected in any of the brain samples (Fig. 7B ); this analysis showed a clear increase in magnitude of inltrates in animals that received the combined treatment. Furthermore, these animals had greater numbers of oligoclonalpopulations, de ned as rearrangements that represented greater than 1 % of the sample ( Fig. 7C ). Also, these oligoclonal popu- lations were generally of greater magnitude than those seen in the vaccine only group, as de ned by mean number of tem- plates detected per clone ( Fig. 7D ). Tracking of the top 10 clones in the blood and brain samples from individual mice also revealed some signi cant differencesin response to the treatment strategies. In animals that received vaccine alone ( Fig. 7E ; left panels), the majority of high fre- quency clones in the brain had been at low frequency in thepre-treatment blood samples, and then increased in blood aftervaccination - a pro le that might intuitively be expected after a vaccine-induced T cell response. Nonetheless, this responsewas ineffective at limiting tumor growth. The brains of these mice also featured clones that had already been at a high fre- quency in the blood before treatment. These may have beenexpanded clonal populations triggered by initial tumor chal-lenge that homed to the brain, or, because some expanded Figure 4.

In animals that underwent the combined treatment (Fig. 7E ; right panels), high frequency clones in brain were also either undetectable or present at high frequency in pre-treatment blood. However , in striking contrast to mice treated with vaccine alone, these clones were not detectedin the blood after treatment. It is possible that these \"miss- ing\"clones had accumulated elsewhere at this time point as a consequence of trapping in lymphoid tissues, non-speci c homing to in flamed brain tissue, an d/or antigen-speci c accumulation within brain tumors. The post-treatment blood samples were instead dominated by clones that, although expanded relative to pre-treatment blood, werenot detected in the brain, and were therefore unlikely tohave participated in the antitumor response. These clonalpopulations likely account for the increased clonality observed in post-treatment blood samples ( Fig. 7A ). Overall, given the unique effects of combined treatment on proliferation and partitioning of T cells to blood or tissues, it ishard to draw conclusions on treatment-related TCR diversity based on analysis of post-treatment blood samples. However, in the brain, where the analysis is more clear-cut, the combina-tion of treatments was associated with increased in ltration of a broader range of oligoclonal T cell populations. Discussion Targeting of CTLA-4 and PD-1 with blocking monoclonal anti-bodies has resulted in unprecedented durable clinical responses in cancer patients, most notably in advanced melanoma. 11In contrast, the induction of anti-tumor T cells through vaccina-tion has been met with less clinical success, potentially because Figure 5.

To test the utility of combining vaccination with checkpoint block- ade to overcome these hurdles, we examined combined therapyin an orthotopic model of glioma.

S. FIELD ET AL.vaccination with a-CTLA-4 could not be attributed to improved responses to the adjuvant used, or obvious improve-ments in APC function. A notable feature of the combinedtreatment was accumulation of leukocytes in the spleen, a phe-nomenon likely to be due, at least in part, to trapping of circu-lating immune cells. It is important to note that while thespleen was a convenient lymphoid organ to extensively exam-ine the downstream consequences of treatment, we have previ- ously shown that the mediastinal lymph nodes are also important sites of T cell priming with this vaccine, 6and these lymph nodes were also enlarged with the combined treatment.This trapping may have been a consequence of the prolongedpresentation and stimulatory activity of the vaccine, which wehave previously shown can continue to provoke NKT cells inspleen to make cytokines a week after administration. 6It is pos- sible that enhanced leukocyte trapping in lymphoid tissues may improve responses to the vaccine by increasing the probability of APC:T cell contacts. A feature of the spleen (and mediastinallymph nodes) after the combined treatment was the signi cant accumulation of T cells. By monitoring proliferative responsesof transferred cells with treatment and assessing cytokine pro-duction after restimulation with tumor lysate in ex vivo assays, we attribute at least part of this accumulation to proliferationof tumor-speci c T cells. Interestingly, a-CTLA-4 treatment alone showed some activity in these assays, suggesting that the efcacy of the combined treatment may be the result of two activities; priming of a new cohort of antitumor T cells by thevaccine, or removal of CTLA-4-mediated checks on T cellswithin the endogenous repertoire that have antitumor activity. Immune in ltrates featuring large numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes were observed in intracranial tumors sevendays after treatment with vaccine and a-CTLA-4. Within the T cell compartment, CD4 CT cells were the most highly repre- sented, despite both CD4Cand CD8CT cell numbers being increased in the lymphoid tissues examined. This was not aresult of accumulation of CD4 CTregs; indeed, Treg numbers and function were unaffected by the combined treatment. Thisis notable because depletion of Tregs in the tumor environmenthas received recent attention as a potential mode of activity ofa-CTLA-4 therapy. 12The preferential accumulation of CD4C T cells in the tumor may re flect privileged access to the CNS due to expression of integrins important for transport acrossthe blood-brain barrier. 13Certainly, activation of CD4CT cells is critical to the success of the combined treatment, althoughthe mechanisms by which they mediate anti-tumor activityhave yet to be elucidated. We speculate that they may be actingon MHC II-expressing accessory cells, such as macrophagesand microglia that in ltrate the tumor, as antitumor activity was much reduced in animals depleted of CD11b Ccells, and also in animals de cient in IFN- g. However, in some models CD4CT cells have also been shown to have direct anti-tumor activity.14In this context, it is notable that GL261 tumors in culture are MHC-II negative, but can upregulate expression inresponse to IFN- g, and MHC-II can be observed on the tumor cells ex vivo . 6 We were unable to observe any survival bene t when a-CTLA-4 was used as a monotherapy against established tumors in the intracranial setting. In keeping with this, a previ-ous report showed that a-CTLA-4 alone could not provideprotection against intracranial GL261 tumors once established, but could induce limited protection when multiple treatmentswere started only three days after implantation. Establishedtumors could be effectively treated when a-CTLA-4 was com- bined with a vaccine comprised of GM-CSF-transfected gliomacells. 15However, another study showed that a-CTLA-4 alone could be used to treat SMA-560 glioma in VM/Dk mice.16The authors attributed the activity of a-CTLA-4 in this model to enhancement of T cell-proliferative capacity, which was other- wise severely reduced in the presence of this tumor. Analysis of TCR repertoire by sequencing of TCR bCDR3 regions showed that the effective combination was associatedwith in ltration of more oligoclonal T cell populations into the brain that were more diverse in speci city and greater in mag- nitude. While the speci city of the T cells is unknown, it can be speculated that this reshaping of the in ltrate re flects broaden- ing of the response within the in ltrate to target a wider range of tumor antigens. It remains unclear whether this was a conse-quence of checkpoint blockade raising the amplitude of weakresponses initiated by the vaccine, or whether checkpointblockade 'unleashed 'endogenous responses to an array of anti- gens unrelated to the vaccine that act cumulatively with thevaccine-induced response to eradicate the tumor. The TCR repertoire analysis also revealed a strikingly differ- ent pattern in the blood of mice receiving vaccine plus a-CTLA-4 compared with mice receiving vaccine alone. Fol- lowing vaccination alone there was clear evidence of clonalexpansion in the blood, and associated accumulation of theseclones at the tumor site. In contrast, in mice that received thecombination treatment, the post-treatment blood samples weredominated by clones that were not detectable either in pre-treatment blood or at the tumor site. The most prevalent clones at the tumor site in these mice, although often present in blood prior to treatment, were undetectable in post-treatment blood.A potential explanation for the apparent \"disappearance \"of these clones is that the addition of a-CTLA-4 in some way led to enhanced traf cking or retention of tumor-speci c clones at the tumor site. However, this explanation would require themajority of highest frequency clones present in blood prior totreatment to be tumor-speci c, which seems unlikely. The enhanced traf cking would therefore have to include move- ment of non-tumor-speci c T cells into the in flamed brain. Another possible explanation, not mutually exclusive, is thatthe missing clonal populations become trapped in the enlargedlymphoid tissues observed after combined treatment. However,neither of these explanations accounts for the correspondinginflux of clones that appear at high frequency in blood after the combined treatment, but are not detectable in brain. Experi- ments in which transferred CFSE labeled cells were monitored after treatment ( Fig. 4 ) showed that CTLA-4 blockade induces signicant proliferation. It is possible that CTLA-4 blockade, when combined with DC activation induced by the vaccine,induces expansion of clones that are not vaccine- or tumor-reactive. Under these conditions, but in the absence of a strongTCR signal, they are perhaps not conditioned to home to thetumor, or as susceptible to trapping in lymphoid tissues. Regardless of the processes that led to the TCR repertoire pro- les observed, overall these ndings suggest that when a vac- cine is combined with a-CTLA-4, assessment of T cellONCOIMMUNOLOGY e1376154-11specicity in blood samples may be of limited value because it does not necessarily re flect the more relevant repertoire at tumor. Discordance between the post-treatment repertoire inblood and in tumor after combined treatments that includeCTLA-4 blockade has been reported in a mouse model of mela-noma 17and in patients with breast cancer,18despite objective responses to treatment in both studies. This phenomenon doesnot appear to be particular to CTLA-4 blockade. In a recent study in renal cell cancer patients treated with a combination that included an anti-PD-L1 antibody, the dominant clones atthe tumor site after treatment were found at much lower levelsin blood while the dominant clones in post-treatment bloodwere not detected in tumors. 19 Auto-immune side effects are a major limitation of CTLA-4 blockade in cancer patients, lessening enthusiasm for investiga-tion in glioma patients in comparison with other checkpoint blockers. However, in the clinic, a-CTLA-4 antibody is typi- cally administered repeatedly over several months. 2Similarly, in previous studies investigating CTLA-4 blockade in mousemodels of glioma, multiple doses of a-CTLA-4 have been administered either as monotherapy 16or in combination with other treatments.15,20-23In contrast, when combined with a vac- cine at time of priming, a single dose was suf cient for thera- peutic bene t in our study. Using a-CTLA-4 in a restricted way to promote the priming phase of an anti-cancer vaccine could present a way of harnessing clinical bene t from this powerful agent while potentially avoiding the auto-immune side-effects. Materials and methods Mice Inbred C57BL/6 mice and the CD45.1 congenic strain B6.SJL- PtprcaPep3b/BoyJArc were purchased from Jackson Laborato- Bar Harbor, Maine. Also used were: CD1d-de cient mice;24an F1 cross of OT-II mice that express a TCR speci c for the latter was generated via BALB/c ES cells transfected with recombineered (BAC) clones (CD11b: RP23-373D19, BAC-PAC Resources Children 's Hospital Oakland, USA) carrying insertions of human DTR sequence with its polyadenylationsite in the initiation codons replacing the rst coding exons of the CD11b gene. Recombineering was performed using RED/ET recombination kits following the instructions of the manu- facturer (Gene Bridges GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Sce1 lin- earized were electroporated in cells and those ES cellclones containing intact BAC sequences (i.e. both vector endsand middle PCR) were selected Experiments were conducted in F1 crossesbetween CD11b-DTR and C57BL/6 mice. All animals weremaintained by the Biomedical Research Unit at the MalaghanInstitute of Medical Research. The Victoria University Animal Ethics Committee approved all experimental protocols (refer- ence 2012R15M). Mice were 6 -12 weeks of age and matched for age and gender.Cell lines and reagents The murine glioma cell line GL261 was obtained from the DCRD Tumor Repository (National Cancer Institute, Freder- ick, USA), authenticated genotypically by IDEXX BioResearch (Columbia, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco 's Modi Eagle 's Medium (DMEM) supplemented and 100 Carlsbad,USA). The NKT cell ligand a-GalCer was manufactured as pre- viously described. 29 Tumor implantation For intracranial implantation, mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. Lacrilube (Allergan, tothe cornea to prevent desiccation. Buprenorphine (RenckittBenckiser Pharmaceuticals, North Chester eld, USA) and Car- profen (Norbrook Laboratories, Corby, UK) were used as peri-operative analgesic. A total of 2.5 \u00a310 4GL261 cells in 2 mLo f phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected via a 32-gaugeneedle into the right striatum 2 mm lateral from the bregma and at a depth of 3 mm using a stereotactic frame (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, USA). Time to symptom appearance wasdened as time to 10% weight loss or overt behavioral symp- toms (hunching, reduced activity). The presence of tumors wasconrmed at necropsy. For subcutaneous implantation, mice were injected with 1 \u00a310 6GL261 cells in 100 mLD M E Mi n theflank. Mice were euthanized when tumor area (the product of two perpendicular diameters) was >150 mm2. Vaccine generation and administration GL261 cells were cultured in complete DMEM supplemented with 200 ng/mL a-GalCer for 24 hours at 37/C14C before being harvested and irradiated on ice to 150 cGy. Cells were frozen in10% DMSO, 90% complete DMEM until use. Prior to use, thevaccine was thawed by gentle agitation in incomplete DMEM,centrifuged and resuspended in PBS. Mice received 1 \u00a310 5 cells in 200 mL PBS, injected intravenously. Checkpoint blockade Blocking a-CTLA-4 (4F10, Armenian hamster IgG) nity umns, BioXCell (West USA).Control Armenian Hamster IgG was purchased from BioXCell.Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg of antibody. Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted on anaes- thetized animals using a clinical 1.5-T MR scanner (PhilipsMedical Systems) equipped with a wrist solenoid coil. T1weighted images were acquired with the following parameters: TED20 milliseconds; TR D800 milliseconds; thickness D 1 mm. was enhanced by intravenous administrationof 100 mL gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-e1376154-12 C. S. FIELD ET AL.DPTA; Magnevist, Bayer Schering Pharma). Image analysis was performed using Philips DICOM Viewer R2.5 Version 1. In vitro T cell proliferation assay Spleens were isolated from mice 18 hours following treatment and single-cell suspensions were prepared by ltering through a7 0mmlter, followed red blood Lysis Solu- tion, Qiagen). Cells were incubated with 10 mM OVA 323 -339 (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR) for 2 hours at 37/C14C and then xed for 10 minutes in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were quenchedwith 0.1 and 50 mM 2-ME (Sigma-Aldrich), and serially diluted across a 96-well plate. Cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens of OT-II mice, stained with 1 ester (CFSE), and 2 \u00a310 5cells were added to wells containing xed splenocytes. Preparations were cultured for 6 days and CFSE dilution of OT-II T cells, indica-tive of cell proliferation, was determined by flow cytometry. Assessment of T cell proliferation in vivo Cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of OT-II mice, stained with 1 mM CFSE and 1 \u00a310 7cells were adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 recipients intravenously. Mice weretreated the following day with a-CTLA-4 and/or vaccine and the CFSE dilution of OT-II T cells in the spleen was analyzed1 week later by flow cytometry. Analysis of lymphoid and brain tissues Single-cell suspensions from spleens were prepared as above. For analysis of brain tumor in ltrates, brains were collected and dissociated with a scalpel before digestion in incompleteIMDM, supplemented with mg/mL DNase I and 2.4 mg/mL II (Gibco, Life Technologies, NY, USA). Digestedtissue was homogenized by passage through an 18G needle. Fil-tered tissue was centrifuged on a 37% percoll gradient (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), with cells recovered from the bottom of the gradient. Flow Cytometry Antibody staining was conducted for 15 minutes at 4 /C14C in PBS supplemented with 1% FBS and 2 pared in-house). LIVE/DEAD/C210Fixable Dye (Life Technolo- gies) was used for CD1d tetramers Institutes of Health Tetramer CoreFacility, Atlanta, GA). Flow cytometry was conducted on a BDLSRII Flow Cytometer with data analyzed using FlowJo 9.7.5 software (TreeStar Inc). Doublets and dead cells were excludedfrom analysis. Histology Mice were perfused PBS through the left ventricle before brains were harvested. Tissue was xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours before dehydration in 70% ethanol. Brains were sagit-tally sectioned at 2 mm intervals and embedded in paraf n. Sections for microscopy were cut 10 mm thick and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were analyzed by a histopatholo-gist in de-identi ed treatment groups. Tumor area on sections at the tumor midpoint by was calculated by indicating the tumor perimeter for analysis by Cell^F Software (Olympus,Hamburg, Germany). TCR sequencing and repertoire analysis DNA was isolated from pre- and post-treatment blood and brain samples using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen).Ampli cation and sequencing of TCR bCDR3 regions was per- formed using ImmunoSeq assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies,Seattle, WA) at survey resolution, performed by Adaptive Bio-technologies as previously described. 30This multiplex PCR sys- tem ampli es rearranged TCR bCDR3 regions in a quantitative manner, with an ampli cation bias feature based on assessment of a synthetic repertoire of TCRs.31Data analysis was per- formed using the ImmunoSEQ Analyzer (Adaptive Biotechnol-ogies). Shannon 's entropy was used a measure of the richness and uniformity of TCR frequency distribution for each sample,calculated by summing the frequency of each clone times thelog 2of the same frequency over all productive reads in a sam- ple. Because sample size in fluences the number of unique sequences in a sample, this value was normalized based on the total number of productive unique sequences and subtractedfrom 1, to give 'clonality 'scores. Values ranged from 0 to 1, with values approaching 1 nearing monoclonality. Immuno-SEQ Analyzer also permitted identi cation and tracking of the top 10 clones in each sample from individual mice. Statistical Analysis Unless otherwise stated, statistical signi cance was determined by one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post-test.The log-rank test was used to determine signi cance between Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Analysis was performed using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.); Pvalues of <0.05 were considered signi cant. Potential con flicts of interest None. Disclosure of potential con flict of interest No potential con flicts of interest were disclosed.ONCOIMMUNOLOGY e1376154-13Acknowledgments We thank Gavin Painter (The Ferrier Research Institute) for providing a-GalCer, the personnel of the Biomedical Research Unit of the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research for animal husbandry, the Hugh GreenCytometry Core for flow cytometry support, Angela Slocombe (Depart- ment of Radiology, Wellington Hospital) for MR imaging, and Jane Ander- son (Wellington School of Medicine, University of Otago) for histology.
