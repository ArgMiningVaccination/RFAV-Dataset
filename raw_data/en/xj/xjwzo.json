Although calcium in dairy products can bind to some antibiotics - including [ciprofloxacin](http://www.livestrong.com/article/471907-what-is-a-safe-diet-while-taking-ciprofloxacin/) and quinolones - and interfere with absorption of the medication, you can consume milk and other dairy products when taking amoxicillin. In fact, the liquid form of amoxicillin for children can be mixed with milk or other liquids if doing so helps the child take the medicine. Amoxicillin, one of the most prescribed antibiotics, treats infections in the body caused by the common bacteria, staphylococcus and streptococcus. These two organisms can cause ear infections, skin infections, strep throat, pneumonia and sinusitis. Taking an antibiotic by mouth requires your stomach and intestines to absorb the medicine and get it into your bloodstream, which delivers the antibiotic to the part of your body where it's needed to fight an infection. Dairy foods can interfere with the absorption process for some antibiotics - mainly tetracyclines - but not amoxicillin.
