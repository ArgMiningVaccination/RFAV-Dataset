In Oriental Medicine or Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the 12 organs and the overall digestive tract produce and move all the blood and oxygen in the body. Physical, chemical, or emotional stressors can cause the blood to stagnate, resulting in a malfunction of the organs. The function and healing process of vital body parts are affected at this point. Once this takes place, extreme health problems can occur. However, more often than not, these changes go unnoticed. If the condition goes untreated, the body will attempt to support the affected area. As the problem increases, however, the area starts to degenerate and symptoms appear. The body is now in a state of dis \"ease.\" The longer the condition is allowed to go untreated, the less chance there is for recovery. What began as a minor problem or discomfort may lead to irreversible damage. However, if detected early, organ malfunction as well as blood stagnation can respond well to Chinese Medicine with an excellent chance for a complete and painless recovery. What can I expect during treatment with Acupuncture and TCM? Before you can be treated, your acupuncturist will first need to make a diagnosis. A diagnosis involves obtaining a complete health history, performing pulse and tongue diagnosis, and palpation to specific body areas and acupuncture points. These techniques allow your practitioner to determine exactly what imbalances are causing your particular health problem(s). Once the diagnosis is complete, a treatment plan can be outlined and discussed. The goal of this clinic is to remove the root of the problem, also known as corrective care, and not merely eliminate the symptoms. As treatment progresses, your acupuncturist will regularly check to see how your body is progressing. This will ensure that you remain firmly on the path toward correction. What happens during an acupuncture treatment? The purpose of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine is to return the flow of blood and oxygen to normal and to reinstate optimal organ function. This will in turn, awaken the body's natural self-healing abilities and catapult it into a greater state of ease, stability and harmony. [Your acupuncturist has many treatment modalities available to help you.](https://www.naturesbalanceacupuncture.com/our-services/) Which ones will be used depend on your unique diagnosis. Some of these treatments may include: - Acupuncture - Cupping - Gua Sha - Herbal Therapy - Tui Na - Diet Therapy Are acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine safe? The National Institutes of Health (NIH) points out that \"the occurrence of adverse events in the practice of acupuncture has been documented to be extremely low.\" Because the acupuncture needles are sterile and disposable, there is little risk of infection. Any minor soreness or redness resulting from other treatment modalities such as cupping, Gua Sha or Tui Na usually dissipates quickly. How many acupuncture treatments are needed? There really is no set number of treatments for specific issues. The number of treatments needed to remove the cause of the problem will depend on many factors, including the specific diagnosis, the severity of malfunction and your individual constitution. Once the root of the problem has been removed, patients can begin their ongoing maintenance care by regularly scheduling \"body tune-ups\", even though no specific illness is present.
