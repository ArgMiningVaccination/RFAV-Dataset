Common ocular pathogens, such as HSV-1, are increasingly recognized as major contributors to visual morbidity worldwide. Humoral immunity is an essential correlate of protection against HSV-1 pathogenesis and ocular pathology, yet the ability of Ab to protect against HSV-1 is deemed limited due to the slow IgG diffusion rate in the healthy cornea. We show that a live-attenuated HSV-1 vaccine elicits humoral immune responses that are unparalleled by a glycoprotein subunit vaccine vis-\u00e0-vis Ab persistence and host protection. The live-attenuated vaccine was used to assess the impact of the immunization route on vaccine efficacy. The hierarchical rankings of primary immunization route with respect to efficacy were s.c. mucosal > i.m. Prime-boost vaccination via sequential s.c. and i.m. administration yielded greater efficacy than any other primary immunization route alone. Moreover, our data support a role for complement in prophylactic protection, as evidenced by intracellular deposition of C3d in the corneal epithelium of vaccinated animals following challenge and delayed viral clearance in C3-deficient mice. We also identify that the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is upregulated in the cornea following infection or injury concomitant with increased Ab perfusion. Lastly, selective small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of FcRn in the cornea impeded protection against ocular HSV-1 challenge in vaccinated mice. Collectively, these findings establish a novel mechanism of humoral protection in the eye involving FcRn and may facilitate vaccine and therapeutic development for other ocular surface diseases. Introduction The mechanisms by which systemic vaccination strategies induce protective immunity against various mucosal pathogens are incompletely understood. However, the ability of systemic vaccines to protect against mucosal pathogen-associated diseases is contingent on vaccine composition, immunization route, and degree of immunologic or anatomic tissue compartmentalization ( [1](javascript:;)- [3](javascript:;)). Direct mucosal vaccination as an alternative means to elicit site-specific protection is an area of active research ( [4](javascript:;)). Accordingly, some investigators have suggested that immune responses elicited from systemic vaccination may not faithfully recapitulate protective immune responses generated in a mucosal microenvironment ( [5](javascript:;)). However, in the ocular surface mucosae, robust local immune responses to infection are often detrimental. Even transient inflammatory events in the eye can provoke devastating consequences resulting in permanent vision loss. Therefore, the ocular surface mucosa presents additional complexity to the equation of systemic vaccination. The cornea is unique among immune-privileged tissues because of its direct exposure to the external environment. However, the cornea remains vulnerable to immune-mediated pathological sequelae resulting from injury, toxicity, or infection. These sequelae include scarring, neovascularization, and desiccation. Moreover, select pathogens representing essentially every taxonomic classification ranging from bacteria and viruses to yeast, protozoa, and nematodes are associated with infections of the ocular surface mucosae ( [6](javascript:;)). The global burden of infectious external eye disease is formidable in terms of visual morbidity ( [7](javascript:;)). Despite this, no licensed vaccine capable of preventing a single ocular surface infection exists, excluding varicella zoster virus. Concern remains that boosting immunity by way of vaccination against a common ocular pathogen, such as HSV-1, may exacerbate the severity of ocular pathology ( [8](javascript:;)). Although the global incidence of HSV-1 keratitis is estimated at 1.5 million new cases annually, its economic burden in the United States alone is projected to exceed $23 million in treatment-associated costs in 2017 ( [9](javascript:;), [10](javascript:;)). Treatment cost projection is based upon consumer price index inflation calculations reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( [https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm)) relative to the original cost estimate reported in 2003 by Lairson et. al. ( [10](javascript:;)). Many experimental strategies and approaches have been applied in the preclinical development of prophylactic HSV-1 vaccines, with a specific focus on preventing ocular disease ( [11](javascript:;)- [17](javascript:;)). However, our recent findings comprehensively established that humoral immunity is a strong correlate of protection against HSV-1 pathogenesis and resultant ocular disease in mice using a live-attenuated vaccine that is avirulent and highly immunogenic due to deletion of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in the ICP0 gene ( HSV-specific recognized as a major correlate of protection against HSV-1-associated disease in humans ( [19](javascript:;)). Efficient humoral protection against mucosal infections requires a sufficient amount of pathogen-specific Ab at the site of infection to counter replication and dissemination ( [20](javascript:;)). Avascular tissues, such as the cornea, contain drastically less Ig during homeostatic conditions compared with other mucosal sites, although an upsurge in the concentration of IgG has been reported in the cornea and tear film during microbial keratitis ( [20](javascript:;)- [22](javascript:;)). Although humoral protection against HSV-1 pathogenesis and tissue pathology ( [17](javascript:;)), the mechanism facilitating humoral protection in the cornea remains vague. In this article, we explore the dynamics and mechanisms of prophylactic vaccine-mediated humoral protection against HSV-1 in the eye. First, we distinguish that the longevity of humoral protection elicited by a glycoprotein D subunit vaccine (glycoprotein D-2) is short-lived in mice live-attenuated HSV-1 0NLS vaccine ( [17](javascript:;), [18](javascript:;)). We compare various routes of immunization and identify that the efficacy of the HSV-1 0NLS vaccine is limited following classical i.m. injection alone. Furthermore, our data support a role for complement fixation in prophylactic protection, as evidenced by intracellular deposition of C3d in the corneas of vaccinated animals following ocular HSV-1 challenge. This finding was corroborated by delayed viral clearance in vaccinated C3-deficient animals relative to wild-type (WT) upon ocular challenge. We also investigate the dynamics of Ab perfusion in the corneas of immunologically naive mice during HSV-1 infection and uncover a novel role for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in regulating Ab transcytosis and host defense in the corneal epithelium. Although FcRn was first characterized for its role in transferring IgG from a mother's milk across the gut lumen in neonates, it plays many other important roles involving IgG transport and turnover across the lifespan ( [23](javascript:;)). We anticipate that these findings will influence future vaccination strategies targeted against mucosal pathogens at the ocular surface. Materials and Methods Mice Male and female outbred CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). The rationale for using an outbred mouse line for a majority of this vaccine study focuses on the genetic heterozygosity and immunologic diversity of CD-1 mice relative to [24](javascript:;)). Outbred \"Swiss\" mice, such as the CD-1 are also more susceptible to HSV-1 (FcRIII/) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) to clarify immunologic mechanisms of Ab-mediated protection. Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free vivarium at the Dean McGee Eye Institute on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Investigators adhered to procedures approved by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol # 16-087-SSIC-A), and animals were handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals were anesthetized for all procedures using an i.p. injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (6.6 mg/kg). For terminal experiments requiring tissue collection, mice were anesthetized and euthanized by exsanguination via intracardiac perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. Vaccines, immunization schemes, and ocular infection The HSV-1 0NLS vaccine was used for immunization, with each dose consisting of 5 \u00d7 104 PFU, as described previously ( [17](javascript:;)). Briefly, each dose of the glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine included 2.5 g of glycoprotein D-2 protein adjuvanted with 25 l of Imject alum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 10 g of monophosporyl lipid A from Salmonella (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The glycoprotein D-2 protein is a truncated form of HSV-2 glycoprotein D and was generated and purified as described previously ( [26](javascript:;)). This formulation has been used previously in animal models to mimic the GlaxoSmithKline Herpevac vaccine, which was 82% effective against HSV-1-associated genital clinical trials ( [17](javascript:;), [19](javascript:;), [26](javascript:;)). The glycoprotein D-2 vaccine was used as a control in these studies, because the HSV-2 glycoprotein D immunogen Animals were vaccinated using a two-dose prime-boost regimen in the footpad and flank, live-attenuated HSV-1 0NLS D-2 subunit vaccine, as previously ( [17](javascript:;)). The booster vaccination was given 3 wk after the primary vaccination. To evaluate the effect of the vaccination route on efficacy, animals were vaccinated in the hind footpad alone (s.c.), in the hind flank alone (i.m.), by single intranasal inoculation (mucosal), or with a footpad-flank boost combination regimen as a positive control. Outbred CD-1 mice were infected by applying 1 \u00d7 103 PFU HSV-1 McKrae to each cornea following partial epithelial debridement with a 25-gauge needle at the times indicated in each figure legend. Inbred C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 104 PFU HSV-1 McKrae per eye. Vaccinated animals were challenged 7 wk after the primary vaccination, unless indicated otherwise. When necessary, animals were subjected to partial epithelial debridement as a scratch-only mock-infection control. Serological and virological assays Peripheral blood was collected from the facial vein of anesthetized mice at the specified times postvaccination or challenge and fractionated using Microtainer serum separation tubes (Becton Dickinson, Serum titers were assessed for virus-neutralizing titers in the presence of guinea pig complement (Rockland, Limerick, PA) on confluent Vero cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), as previously described ( [17](javascript:;)). Virus-specific Ab subclass profiling was quantified by ELISA using immobilized HSV-1 virions as a target and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig detection Abs ( [18](javascript:;)). To quantify infectious virus, corneas were swabbed with cotton-tipped applicators to collect free virus shed in the tear film, and tissues were excised for downstream analysis by standard plaque assay on Vero cells ( [17](javascript:;)). For detection of latent virus, RNA was extracted from cornea-innervating trigeminal ganglia (TG) harvested from mice at day 30 postinfection (PI), RNA was converted into cDNA, and viral transcript expression was evaluated by PCR relative to -actin expression and normalized to uninfected control samples, as previously described ( [17](javascript:;)). Alternatively, direct quantification of viral genome copy number was performed by PCR on DNA isolated from the TG of challenged mice using a proprietary primer-probe mix, according to the manufacturer's directions (Primerdesign, Chandler's Ford, U.K.), as described ( coherence tomography Immunohistochemistry and Corneas were cut from enucleated eyes of euthanized animals, fixed in a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, and washed in 1\u00d7 PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Corneas were blocked using anti-CD16/32 Fc block overnight (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and immunolabeled, described previously, to quantify corneal neovascularization (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and DAPI staining were used to identify tissue layers and boundaries. Mast cell granules were stained with FITC-avidin, as described ( [31](javascript:;)). Unconjugated anti-mouse FcRn (cat. no. AF6775; both from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) primary Abs were used to label each respective protein in the cornea. Dako polyclonal rabbit anti-HSV-1 Ab was used for viral Ag detection (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary Abs were used for confocal imaging (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Images were acquired using an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope in sequential channel scanning mode (Center Valley, PA). Three-dimensional protein fluorescence colocalization analysis was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Concord, MA). Quantification of tissue Ab concentrations Corneas and TG from healthy, cornea-scratch control (24 h postinjury), and HSV-1-infected (24 and 48 h PI) mice were collected along with ear pinna specimens from healthy or ear-punched mice (24 h postinjury). Samples were placed in Next Advance GREEN bead lysis tubes (Averill Park, NY) containing 150 l of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer supplied with protease inhibitor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), homogenized in a Next Advance Bullet Blender Storm 24 homogenizer for 10 min, and subjected to sonication in a water bath for 10 min. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and used for downstream analysis. Tissue supernatants were surveyed for Ab content using a mouse Ab isotyping multiplex kit (eBioscience) on a Bio-Plex system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), according to the manufacturers' directions. Data are reported as picogram of Ig isotype per milligram tissue wet weight. Flow cytometry Single-cell suspensions were generated from all tissue collected for analysis by flow cytometry. Briefly, lymph nodes were macerated over 40-m mesh to generate a suspension. Individual corneas were digested in 0.25 W\u00fcnsch units of Liberase TL enzyme mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), suspended in 500 l of RPMI 1640 for 2 h, and exposed to mechanical trituration every 20 min. Corneal digests were filtered through 40-m mesh prior to labeling. Peripheral blood was collected from the facial vein, and erythrocytes were removed through two incubations in hypotonic lysing buffer, as described ( [32](javascript:;)). Cell suspensions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience), labeled with target-specific Abs for 20-30 min, in 1\u00d7 PBS containing 1% BSA. Intracellular FcRn labeling was performed with an unlabeled primary Ab (R&D Systems) and a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) using a saponin-based Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). All samples were analyzed on a MACSQuant 10 flow cytometer with MACSQuantify software (both from Miltenyi Bergisch Gladbach, Gating boundaries were established via isotype labeling and/or fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls to ensure Ab specificity and negate spectral overlap, respectively. Biological negative controls were also considered. Gating strategies are shown within this article or are based on those published previously ( [17](javascript:;), [31](javascript:;), [33](javascript:;)). Western blot Supernatants from cornea homogenates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, as described above. Sample protein concentrations were standardized using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were resolved electrophoresis on Novex Tris-glycine membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room in 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-buffered saline overnight anti-mouse FcRn Ab (cat. no. AF6775; 1:2000 dilution; R&D Systems) or for 90 min at room temperature in mouse anti-mouse -actin primary Ab (cat. no. ab6276; 1:10,000 dilution; Abcam, Blots were subsequently Amersham, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) for 1 h at room temperature and imaged using a Kodak in vivo imaging system F Pro (Rochester, NY) with MI SE version 4.4 software (Carestream Health, Rochester, NY). Chemiluminescent detection was achieved using SuperSignal extended duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Band intensity analysis was performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Small interfering RNA transfection For corneal FcRn-knockdown experiments, Ambion Silencer Select siRNA partially debrided to facilitate efficient transfection, and a drop containing 5 l of Lipofectamine and 3.33 nmol FcRn-specific or nonspecific scramble control small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in supplement-free DMEM was applied to each cornea. siRNA sequences were designed and validated by the manufacturer, although FcRn was targeted with two nonoverlapping siRNAs to enhance effectiveness ( [Supplemental Table I](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/pdf/ji_1700316_supplemental_material_1/)). Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by Western blot. Statistical analysis Prism 5 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis. Data reflect mean \u00b1 SEM unless indicated otherwise. The statistical tests used for analysis are described in each figure legend. Significance thresholds for comparisons are denoted as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p Humoral protection elicited by a glycoprotein is short-lived compared with the live-attenuated HSV-1 0NLS vaccine Clinical trials for HSV vaccines have favored subunit vaccines over live-attenuated viruses, with limited success reported to date ( [8](javascript:;)). Evidence from the GlaxoSmithKline Herpevac clinical trials using a glycoprotein D subunit vaccine from HSV-2 demonstrated that cross-protection against HSV-1 ( we previously used a similar glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine as a measure of comparison for the efficacy of HSV-1 0NLS against ocular challenge in CD-1 mice ( [17](javascript:;)). That study unequivocally demonstrated that HSV-1 0NLS was superior to a glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine in its capacity to elicit high-titer neutralizing Ab responses and prevent ocular pathology, but animals were challenged merely 1 mo after vaccination ( [17](javascript:;)). To assess the longevity of prophylactic CD-1 mice were vaccinated s.c. in the footpad, given an i.m. booster dose in the ipsilateral flank 21 d later, and subjected to blood collection at 30-d intervals over 3 mo were quantified by ELISA on at below the limit of detection at day 90 postboost in glycoprotein D-2-immunized animals ( [Fig. 1B](javascript:;)). In detected in all mice immunized with titers of HSV-1-specific IgA IgM were not detected in either group. Virus-neutralization titers were also evaluated in sera collected serially at days 30, 60, and 90 postboost. As previously demonstrated ( [17](javascript:;)), by day 30 with glycoprotein D-2 was short-lived and declined nearly to the limit of detection (1:25) by day 90 postboost ( [Fig. 1C](javascript:;)). A modest longitudinal decrease from the peak serum neutralization titer was also observed in HSV-1 0NLS-vaccinated mice, but the titers at days 60 and 90 postboost remained substantially higher than even the peak titer measured in glycoprotein D-2-vaccinated animals ( [Fig. 0NLS vaccine elicits a sustained high-titer neutralizing Ab response that is unparalleled by a subunit vaccine, as reported for other common vaccines ( [34](javascript:;)). Vaccinated animals were subsequently subjected to a deferred challenge at day 90 postboost to investigate whether the discrepancy in Ab titers between mice immunized with HSV-1 0NLS and the glycoprotein D-2 subunit appreciable impact on vaccine efficacy ( [Fig. 1A](javascript:;)). Animals were challenged bilaterally with an inoculum of 1 \u00d7 103 PFU HSV-1 McKrae per eye. Survival proportions for CD-1 mice infected 90 d following the boost vaccination were three of six naive, four of five glycoprotein D-2 vaccinated, and six of six HSV-1 0NLS vaccinated ( [Fig. 1D](javascript:;)). Acute viral shedding in the tear film was equal among all groups at day 2 PI, but it dropped precipitously in animals vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS by day 5 PI ( [Fig. 1E](javascript:;)). Although glycoprotein D-2 subunit-vaccinated animals exhibited less viral shedding than naive animals by day 7 PI ( [Fig. 1E](javascript:;)), they were not spared from or hydrocephalus ( [Fig. 1F](javascript:;)), a pathognomonic viral encephalitis. Likewise, naive animals developed edematous periocular lesions and hydrocephalus by day 8 PI ( [Fig. 1F](javascript:;)). Animals infected at day 90 postboost were subsequently assessed for latent viral burden, serology, and tissue pathology at day 30 PI. Although glycoprotein D-2 subunit-vaccinated animals had less latent virus in the TG than naive animals, prophylactic vaccination with HSV-1 0NLS diminished the establishment of viral titers for HSV-1 were equivalent among experimental groups by day 30 PI ( [Fig. 2B](javascript:;)), indicating that the humoral immune response to HSV-1 is not directly governed by the quantity or persistence of viral Ag. Moreover, these levels were similar to serum titers observed in HSV-1 [Fig. modal](javascript:;) The extent of corneal pathology following ocular challenge was evaluated by assessing corneal sensation, neovascularization, and structural integrity. Corneal sensation loss is a highly sensitive pathological outcome of ocular HSV-1 infection and is useful as a measurement of vaccine efficacy against HSV-associated ocular disease ( [35](javascript:;), [36](javascript:;)). Corneal sensation was HSV-1 0NLS-vaccinated mice, partially lost in glycoprotein D-2-immunized mice, and severely diminished in naive mice at day 30 PI ( [Fig. 2C](javascript:;)). Corneal Lyve-1 to visualize corneal blood and lymphatic vessels, respectively. The corneas of animals vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS remained avascular at day 30 PI ( however, corneal neovascularization was moderate in glycoprotein D-2-vaccinated animals and severe in naive animals, such that the vessels covered the entire cornea ( [Fig. 2D](javascript:;)). SD-OCT was used to assess the structural integrity of the anterior eye in vivo at day 30 PI. Corneal SD-OCT imaging in mice immunized with HSV-1 0NLS revealed healthy optically clear corneas with normal light reflexes ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), upper left panel), although a pronounced hyperintensity consistent with leukocyte infiltrate was observed in the central corneas ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), lower left panel). In contrast, corneas of mice immunized with glycoprotein D-2 exhibited moderate corneal opacity ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), upper middle panel), consistent with alterations in the corneal structure ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), lower middle panel). Cellular infiltrate was also observed in the lens of glycoprotein D-2-immunized mice ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), lower middle panel). Moreover, postinfectious mydriasis (dilated pupil) was observed in half of the eyes of glycoprotein D-2-immunized mice ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), middle panels). Stark corneal opacity ( [Fig. upper right panel) and lens infiltrate ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), lower right panel) were detected in the eyes of naive animals. In contrast to the other groups, adhesions formed between the iris and cornea and/or iris and lens (designated clinically as anterior and posterior synechiae, respectively) of naive animals ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), lower right panel). Postinfectious mydriasis and development of iris adhesions are consistent with the development of anterior uveitis during acute HSV-1 infection ( [37](javascript:;)). Taken together, the data confirm our previous finding that the HSV-1 0NLS vaccine is superior to a glycoprotein D-2 subunit in terms of enabling acute viral clearance, limiting latent infection, and preventing ocular pathology ( [17](javascript:;)). However, data from this study using a delayed challenge model show that the humoral immune response elicited by HSV-1 0NLS sustains its protective effect over time, whereas humoral immunity elicited by glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccination wanes quickly. Routes of immunization influence IgG subclass profiles and vaccine efficacy Routes of immunization are known to distinctively influence vaccine responsiveness, despite the routine clinical use of i.m. injection. Mice were immunized with HSV-1 0NLS in various sites to assess how unique tissue microenvironments impact immunogenicity and efficacy. Intramuscular, mucosal, and s.c. routes of immunization were modeled by administering equivalent titers of HSV-1 0NLS in the hind leg flank, intranasally, or in the footpad of CD-1 mice, respectively. Postvaccination serum-neutralizing Ab titers were lowest in the flank-only immunization group and were similar between intranasal and footpad vaccination groups, but no single vaccination site generated as strong of a neutralizing Ab response as was observed using a dual prime-boost immunization strategy in the footpad and flank ( [Fig. [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)), ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). The titers were not statistically different among groups following primary vaccination alone. [Close modal](javascript:;) The route of immunization had a clear impact on the efficacy of protection following HSV-1 challenge. It was suspected that intranasal vaccination could have an advantage for ocular protection relative to the other sites by establishing a population of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells within the cornea-innervating TG. However, no increase in the number of CD69+ CD103+ CD8+ T cells was observed in TG from intranasally immunized mice at 30 d postvaccination relative to healthy nonvaccinated controls (data not shown). Viral shedding in the ocular tear film was sustained for a longer period of time in mice immunized in the flank only (i.m.) relative to other vaccination sites ( [Fig. 4A](javascript:;)). However, virus was largely cleared from the corneas of all vaccinated mice by day 7 PI ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). A higher tendency toward viral trafficking to the TG and brainstem was observed in mice immunized in the flank or intranasally relative to the other sites in which neurodissemination was absent ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)). Trends in delayed viral clearance in the cornea or nervous system ( [Fig. 4B](javascript:;)) correlated with amplified adaptive immune responses in the cornea-draining mandibular lymph nodes (MLNs) at day 7 PI ( [Fig. 4C](javascript:;), [4D](javascript:;)). Therefore, the lack of lymphocyte expansion in the MLNs upon ocular challenge is a useful prognostic correlate of vaccine efficacy in terms of acute viral clearance, as reported previously ( [17](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) Efficient viral clearance is a goal of prophylactic HSV-1 vaccination, but the ultimate measure of vaccine efficacy is its ability to reduce the amount of latent virus in the TG and prevent ocular disease. All routes of immunization reduced the total amount of latent HSV-1 in the TG, as assessed by latency-associated transcript (LAT) RNA expression levels ( [Fig. 5A](javascript:;)), relative to levels previously reported in naive control CD-1 mice infected with a 200-PFU challenge inoculum ( [17](javascript:;)). However, animals that received the two-dose prime-boost vaccination had the lowest levels of latent HSV-1 in the TG after a high-titer ocular 1 \u00d7 103-PFU challenge in terms of mice were evaluated for corneal neovascularization at day 30 PI. Corneas from mice vaccinated intranasally or by prime-boost footpad-flank vaccination maintained a healthy avascular appearance ( [Fig. 5C-E](javascript:;)). Although mice vaccinated in the alone spared from corneal hemangiogenesis lymphangiogenesis was observed ( [Fig. 5E](javascript:;)). Mice vaccinated in the flank only developed corneal neovascularization involving lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis ( of leukocytes in the corneas of each group was assessed at day 30 PI ( [Fig. 5F](javascript:;)). No differences in cell numbers were observed that correlated with the tissue neovascularization status aside from a tendency toward elevated numbers of CD45+ leukocytes within vascularized corneas ( [Fig. viral clearance, viral latency, and ocular pathology data, it is apparent that i.m. vaccination alone is not suitable for eliciting the full protective efficacy of the HSV-1 0NLS vaccine. Ab biodistribution and effector function in herpetic keratitis Paracellular diffusion of large macromolecules, including Igs and many therapeutic drugs, is restricted in the cornea under homeostatic conditions because of the densely organized tissue architecture and physiological mechanisms that maintain transparency ( [38](javascript:;)- [40](javascript:;)). However, the dynamics of humoral immunity in the cornea during inflammation or infection is not well characterized. To address Ab biodistribution in inflamed corneas, we measured Ig concentrations using a bead-based multiplex array in tissue homogenates from immunologically naive CD-1 mice following infection or mock infection. Concentrations of virtually all Ig subclasses broadly increased 2-fold in corneal buttons within 24-48 h after scratching the corneal epithelium (mock infection) or HSV-1 infection ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)). Increases were statistically significant in HSV-1-infected corneas at 48 h PI for IgA, IgG2a, and IgG3 ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)). Notably, Ig concentrations in the avascular cornea prior to trauma or infection were an order of magnitude lower than the levels observed in healthy vascularized tissues, including the TG and ear pinna, after exsanguination ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/pdf/ji_1700316_supplemental_material_1/)). Moreover, elevations in total Ab concentration in the TG following HSV-1 infection ( [Supplemental Fig. 1A](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/pdf/ji_1700316_supplemental_material_1/)) or following a hole-punch injury ( [Supplemental Fig. 1B](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/pdf/ji_1700316_supplemental_material_1/)) were subdued relative to the fluctuations observed in the cornea. [Close modal](javascript:;) Sharp increases in total Ig within the cornea are consistent with our previous observations of transient edema following ocular HSV-1 infection by ultrasound pachymetry ( [17](javascript:;), [31](javascript:;)). In this study, we show that edema is prevalent within the corneal stroma at 24 h PI using in vivo SD-OCT imaging ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). pericorneal vasculature ( [Fig. 6C](javascript:;)) and contribute to through degranulation of potent vasoactive mediators, such in increased perfusion ( [31](javascript:;), [41](javascript:;)). Therefore, we evaluated the pericorneal mast cell activation status, as evidenced by degranulation in naive CD-1 mice, via confocal microscopy. Few degranulated mast cells were observed in healthy corneas, and intermittent degranulation was noted in mock-infected corneas; however, mast cell degranulation was widespread in HSV-1-infected corneas by 48 h PI ( [Fig. 6D](javascript:;)), as previously reported in C57BL/6 mice ( [31](javascript:;)). We interpret these observations to suggest that the increased perfusion of Ab in the cornea following infection is an active physiological response to ocular surface injury or infection. Although Ab has been identified as a correlate of protection against HSV-1, the mechanism of the Ab effector function contributing to virus neutralization and clearance is not established for ocular infection. To further dissect this mechanism, we evaluated the relative contributions of complement fixation and Ab-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) with respect to viral clearance in vaccinated animals. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize complement activation in the corneas of CD-1 mice by colocalization of viral Ag and C3d, the final cleavage product of the complement cascade. C3d deposition is an established indicator of complement activation associated with Ab-mediated pathogen neutralization or opsonization ( [42](javascript:;), [43](javascript:;)). Fewer viral lesions were observed in corneas from vaccinated animals compared with naive at 48 h PI (data not shown). Moreover, viral lesions were smaller in the corneas of HSV-1 0NLS-vaccinated mice compared with ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;), [7B](javascript:;)). Although the immunofluorescence signal of viral Ag was also diminished in vaccinated animals, this likely reflects epitope masking by endogenous HSV-specific Abs ( C3d labeling was evident in corneas from vaccinated mice, labeling was absent in healthy corneas and sparse in corneas from naive mice at 48 h PI ( [Fig. 7A](javascript:;), [7B](javascript:;)). Extensive colocalization between viral Ag and C3d was observed exclusively in corneas from animals vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS ( [Fig. 7B](javascript:;)). Contrary to our expectations of finding typical surface-bound deposits of C3d, the C3d signal clustered within cytometry was used to assess cornea-infiltrating and tissue-resident leukocyte populations because of their potential to mediate ADCC. Limited differences were observed in leukocyte populations in the corneas of naive and immunized mice at 48 h PI ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). Fewer CD11b+ myeloid cells and, were detected in corneas from HSV-1 0NLS-immunized mice, although no differences were observed in the total number of macrophages, Langerhans cells, dendritic cells, or NK cells ( [Fig. 7C](javascript:;)). Given the apparent complement activation and presence of ADCC effector cells in the corneas of CD-1 mice vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS, we used C57BL/6 mice to further dissect the mechanism of protection. For these studies, WT, C3/, and FcRIII/ mice were vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS using a prime-boost immunization scheme in the footpad and flank, respectively, and subsequently challenged with 1 \u00d7 104 PFU HSV-1 strain McKrae per eye at were equivalent between sex-matched WT and C3/ or FcRIII/ mice prior to ocular challenge (data not shown). Viral shedding in the tear film was assessed following HSV-1 challenge. A substantial delay in viral clearance was observed in vaccinated C3/ mice relative to WT ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;)). Viral clearance and FcRIII/ mice ( [Fig. 7E](javascript:;)), ADCC effector cells in prophylactic protection against HSV-1 in the cornea. Likewise, shedding was equivalent between immunologically naive WT and knockout mice, albeit at higher titers than observed in their respective vaccinated counterparts ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;), [7E](javascript:;)). Although the contributions of vaccine-induced humoral in host defense against HSV-1 in the ocular mucosae are undoubtedly multifactorial, our data support a prominent role for the complement pathway in efficient prophylactic protection against HSV-1. FcRn augments vaccine efficacy through IgG transport in the corneal epithelium The barrier integrity of the cornea is maintained, in part, through tight junctional complexes between epithelial cells ( [39](javascript:;), [44](javascript:;)). Although the intrinsic barrier property of the corneal epithelium protects the eye from the external environment, it concomitantly impedes macromolecule diffusion. Thus, the ability of Ab to passively diffuse into the corneal epithelium is restricted. Given the importance of maintaining the barrier integrity of the ocular surface, we explored the hypothesis that FcRn mediates Ab transcytosis within the corneal epithelium to facilitate humoral protection against HSV-1. Although FcRn is reportedly expressed at low levels in the cornea, its function remains enigmatic ( [45](javascript:;), [46](javascript:;)). The expression profile of FcRn was first evaluated by confocal microscopy in cornea whole mounts from naive CD-1 mice before and after infection. FcRn expression was detected in the epithelium of healthy corneas, although expression was more conspicuous following HSV-1 infection ( [Fig. 8A](javascript:;)). Intracellular FcRn expression was confirmed based on localization relative to actin filaments and nuclei in the corneal epithelium ( [Fig. 8A](javascript:;)). Low-magnification imaging revealed that FcRn expression the epithelium of healthy corneas decreased in a centripetal fashion from the periphery toward the center ( [Fig. 8B](javascript:;), top panels). In contrast, robust FcRn immunoreactivity was noted across the entire corneal epithelium in scratch-control and HSV-1-infected corneas at 24 h PI ( [Fig. 8B](javascript:;)). Similar patterns of FcRn expression were corneal stroma ( [Fig. 8C](javascript:;)). Strong colocalization of FcRn and HSV-1 Ag was observed within viral lesions on corneas from naive animals ( [Fig. 8D](javascript:;)), suggesting that HSV-1 does not inhibit murine FcRn expression within infected cells. The specificity of the FcRn Ab for the p51 subunit was confirmed by Western blot ( modal](javascript:;) expression profiles were evaluated quantitatively by flow cytometry in epithelial cells, Langerhans cells, and other leukocytes in cornea digests at 48 h PI ( [Fig. 8F](javascript:;)). Basal FcRn was detected in CD45 epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)+ corneal epithelial cells in uninfected mice based on median fluorescence intensity (MFI) relative to FMO background control levels 8F](javascript:;), [8G](javascript:;)). Consistent with the confocal data, FcRn expression levels increased by 30% in epithelial cells following ocular surface injury (mock infection scratch control) or HSV-1 infection ( [Fig. 8G](javascript:;)). In addition, the total number of epithelial cells expressing FcRn increased nearly 2-fold infection ( [Fig. 8G](javascript:;)). Increases in also noted in the CD45+ EpCAM+ Langerhans cell population following corneal surface injury or infection ( [Fig. 8H](javascript:;)). The observed FcRn MFI was comparatively negligible in the CD45+ EpCAM population composed of resident and infiltrating leukocytes ( [Fig. 8I](javascript:;)). This finding contrasts with the observation myeloid lineage leukocytes in circulation express FcRn ( [48](javascript:;)). To address these divergent findings, we evaluated FcRn expression with the same instrument settings in peripheral blood ( [Fig. 8J](javascript:;), [8K](javascript:;)). Indeed, CD11b+ myeloid cells higher levels of FcRn ( [Fig. 8J](javascript:;)) than were population ( [Fig. 8I](javascript:;)). PBLs were evaluated in parallel and found to express insignificant levels of FcRn ( [Fig. 8K](javascript:;)). Peripheral blood CD11b+ myeloid cells were further profiled using Ly6C and Ly6G Ags to specifically confirm FcRn expression in circulating monocytes and neutrophils ( [Supplemental Fig. 2](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/pdf/ji_1700316_supplemental_material_1/)), the major cornea-infiltrating cells during acute HSV-1 infection ( [49](javascript:;)). Collectively, the confirmed upregulation of FcRn in the corneal epithelium provides a plausible mechanism to explain the protective capacity of Ab against HSV-1 in the cornea. The protective contributions of FcRn were investigated by using siRNA to specifically target FcRn in the cornea. First, the knockdown efficiency of the topical FcRn siRNA treatment was confirmed in the corneas of naive CD-1 mice at 48 h PI relative to scramble control-treated animals by Western blot ( [Fig. 9A](javascript:;)). Densitometry analysis indicated that FcRn protein levels were reduced in corneas treated with siRNA targeting FcRn compared with 9B](javascript:;)). Local siRNA-mediated FcRn knockdown did not have an appreciable impact on total Ig concentrations within the corneas of naive mice following HSV-1 infection ( [Fig. 9C](javascript:;)). However, FcRn of mice vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS severely compromised the protective efficacy of the vaccine compared with the scramble control group ( [Fig. 9D](javascript:;)). Explicitly, virus was detected in corneal homogenates by plaque assay in 100% of the FcRn siRNA-treated mice and of the scramble siRNA-treated mice ( [Fig. 9D](javascript:;)). Nevertheless, the level of protection afforded to mice vaccinated with HSV-1 0NLS after FcRn knockdown remained comparatively better than naive mice receiving either siRNA treatment, in terms of viral titer in the cornea at 48 h PI ( [Fig. 9D](javascript:;)). Taken together, our data reveal a novel mechanism of vaccine-mediated protection against viral infection at the ocular surface involving FcRn. Although FcRn does not appear to be directly responsible for the observed influx of IgG into the cornea as a whole, its established role in Ab transcytosis is now appreciated to be a major factor in humoral immunity against infection within the mucosal epithelium of the ocular surface. [Close modal](javascript:;) Discussion Vaccine composition strongly influences the longevity of protection elicited by immunization, and this is likely dependent upon how a given vaccine \"imprints\" the immune system during the initial encounter to support plasma cell generation or memory B cell development ( [50](javascript:;)). Epidemiological studies evaluating the kinetics of humoral responses to common vaccines in humans indicate that live-attenuated vaccines often offer life-long humoral protection against infection, whereas humoral responses elicited by subunit vaccines generally decay over time ( [34](javascript:;)). Our recent work highlights that HSV-1 0NLS was much more efficacious than a glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine, similar to that used in multiple clinical trials, in limiting viral pathogenesis and preventing HSV-1-associated ocular disease in vaccinated mice challenged with HSV-1 ( [17](javascript:;)); however, the kinetics of the humoral immune response was not evaluated in our previous study. In this article, we show that Ab titers elicited by a glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine decay substantially within 3 mo in mice, but HSV-1 0NLS elicits sustained high titers of HSV-specific-neutralizing Ab. Interestingly, data from multiple clinical trials with glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccines show that the cumulative mean HSV-specific and neutralizing Ab concentrations decay by 85 and 77%, respectively, from peak titers within 1 y of the last dose ( [51](javascript:;)). Furthermore, even with a live-attenuated virus, the site of vaccination has an important effect on the induction of humoral immunity and efficacy ( [Figs. 3](javascript:;)- [5](javascript:;)). Despite i.m. injection being the most common route of vaccination clinically, HSV-1 0NLS was least effective following i.m. vaccination alone. In contrast, near-complete protection against acute disease and viral latency was achieved with HSV-1 0NLS following s.c. primary immunization with an i.m. boost; however, vaccine efficacy and safety must be weighed in light of the status of the recipient's immune system. Subunit vaccines may be preferred over attenuated vaccines for immunocompromised patients because of safety concerns. Additionally, immunosenescence is documented to limit the efficacy of ZOSTAVAX, a therapeutic live-attenuated shingles vaccine, relative to a novel subunit vaccine in older adults ( [52](javascript:;)). In addition to their limited antigenic breadth, the ephemeral nature of humoral responses elicited by past HSV subunit vaccines is a likely reason for the widespread failure of such vaccines in multiple clinical trials ( [8](javascript:;), [53](javascript:;)). Subunit vaccines, such as the alum-adjuvanted hepatitis B surface Ag vaccine, can be highly effective against disease, despite waning or undetectable Ab titers through anamnestic responses. A meta-analysis of subjects vaccinated with hepatitis B surface Ag clearly links anamnestic responses to protection against disease in patients who seroconvert for other hepatitis B Ags ( [54](javascript:;)). The partial, yet incomplete, protective effect elicited by a glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine presumably functions through an anamnestic response; however, anamnestic responses are likely too little too late in the case of HSV-1 infection, because the virus can quickly transfer from mucosal epithelial cells to nerve ganglia, where the virus persists indefinitely. Moreover, anamnestic responses against the glycoprotein D-2 subunit reflect 1% of the HSV-1 proteome, whereas the antigenic coverage of the hepatitis B surface Ag is 12% ( [53](javascript:;)). In contrast, the HSV-1 0NLS vaccine of the native viral proteome and elicits humoral immune responses similar to those observed during natural infection ( [17](javascript:;), [18](javascript:;)). Results in this article from a delayed challenge model mirror previous data showing that the HSV-1 0NLS vaccine can prevent corneal sensation loss and neovascularization; however, our data show that the immune response elicited by HSV-1 0NLS sustains its protective effect over time ( [Fig. 1C](javascript:;)). Although IgG is found throughout the cornea, the distribution of IgM and IgA is restricted to the corneal periphery and apical surface epithelium, respectively ( [21](javascript:;), [55](javascript:;)). Concentrations of IgG in the central region of healthy corneas are approximately two thirds of those found in the periphery, but the basal diffusion rate of IgG in the cornea is low ( [40](javascript:;), [56](javascript:;), [57](javascript:;)). This is evidenced by the limited clinical success of IgG-based therapeutics in the cornea. Although the general mechanisms of ocular surface protection have been reviewed elsewhere ( [58](javascript:;)- [60](javascript:;)), secretory IgA is commonly associated with humoral protection against microbial infection in the tear film and in other mucosal sites ( [61](javascript:;), [62](javascript:;)). Clinical and basic research data confirm that serum titers of HSV-specific IgA do not correlate with susceptibility to primary HSV infection after vaccination or viral reactivation in latently infected hosts ( [63](javascript:;)- [65](javascript:;)). Protein diffusion in the cornea has largely been calculated experimentally using IgG and albumin ( [56](javascript:;), transport of both proteins ( [68](javascript:;), [69](javascript:;)). Coupling the results from the current study identifying FcRn expression changes during viral infection or surface injury, we postulate that FcRn expression levels largely regulate IgG (and albumin) diffusion in the corneal epithelium. This insight into the kinetics of IgG perfusion in the cornea may enhance the usefulness of Ab-based therapies that normally have low corneal penetration and efficacy if combined with neoadjuvant therapy to modulate FcRn expression in the surface epithelium barrier. Furthermore, this approach could enhance the \"depot effect\" of IgG-based therapeutics in the cornea described by Osusky et al. ( [57](javascript:;)) to increase drug half-life and local efficacy. The pericorneal limbal vasculature is well documented as the source of Ab within the cornea, given the comparatively low concentrations of IgG in the adjacent tear film and aqueous humor ( [40](javascript:;), [70](javascript:;)). It is estimated that it takes 50-70 d for serum IgG to establish a concentration equilibrium with IgG in the cornea under normal homeostatic conditions ( [40](javascript:;), [57](javascript:;)). Given this low basal rate of diffusion, it is clear that a prophylactic HSV-1 vaccine must elicit and sustain high serum concentrations of protective IgG to provide a tenable level of protection in the cornea. However, this limitation may be partially overcome by physiological mechanisms that enhance IgG diffusion in the cornea during infection, particularly upregulation of FcRn in the epithelium. In this article, we demonstrate that the Ab concentration in the cornea rises sharply following corneal infection or injury and that this phenomenon is concomitant with FcRn upregulation in various cornea-resident cell Indeed, local FcRn knockdown elicited by 0NLS ( [Fig. 9](javascript:;)). Previous studies showed that FcRn facilitates intracellular neutralization of viruses within mucosal epithelial cells in passively immunized animals ( [71](javascript:;)). FcRn expression has also been correlated with passive humoral protection against HSV-2 infection in the vaginal mucosae ( [72](javascript:;)). However, there are caveats to using global FcRn-deficient mice for passive-immunization studies, because Ab half-life is severely impacted ( [23](javascript:;)). Accordingly, our studies used localized FcRn knockdown to determine the effect of FcRn on viral clearance ( [Fig. 9](javascript:;)). It remains unclear why cornea-infiltrating leukocytes express much lower levels of FcRn than are observed in circulating leukocytes ( [Fig. 8I](javascript:;), [8J](javascript:;)); it is tempting to speculate that leukocytes store Ab in circulation via FcRn-mediated retention for discharge upon activation and extravasation into inflamed tissues, as they are proposed to do with soluble complement components ( [73](javascript:;)). Consistent with the role of FcRn in intracellular trafficking of IgG, we also observed intracellular deposition of C3d in the corneal epithelium 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109796/mpg/ji_1700316_supplemental_video_1/)). Although complement deposition classically occurs on the cell surface, evidence is mounting that intracellular complement signaling (dubbed the \"complosome\") serves multiple functions ( [74](javascript:;)- [77](javascript:;)). Our data also show that prophylactic protection against HSV-1 is compromised in the absence of a functional complement pathway in the cornea ( [Fig. 7D](javascript:;)). Although the complement pathway reportedly enhances humoral immunity during primary HSV-1 infection, the role of complement in prophylactic protection against HSV-1 infection in the eye has not been previously reported ( [78](javascript:;)- [81](javascript:;)). The ability of complement to enhance neutralization of HSV-1 virions is thought to be limited by the viral glycoproteins that mimic the IgG Fc receptor and interact with C3 to modulate complement activation ( [81](javascript:;), [82](javascript:;)). Despite these viral immune-evasion mechanisms, Ab retains its capacity to neutralize HSV-1 in patients vaccinated with a glycoprotein D-2 subunit vaccine ( [27](javascript:;)); however, the role of complement may be dependent upon the site of virus entry, because other investigators have demonstrated that ADCC is central to protection against HSV-1, using a skin infection model ( [83](javascript:;)). Recent findings demonstrate that intracellular Ab-bound viral components are shuttled to the proteasome by the intracellular effector tripartite motif-containing 21 for noncytolytic clearance ( [84](javascript:;)). FcRn recycling may enable sufficient internalization of Ab within mucosal epithelial cells to facilitate targeting and degradation of diverse viral proteins. This concept challenges the dogma that Ab mediates protective effects exclusively in the extracellular space. Additionally, the concept of Ab actively targeting viral proteins intracellularly also begs the question of whether intracellular epitopes should be targeted in vaccine development against other mucosal pathogens to enhance humoral protection. These questions will need to be addressed in future studies. Although Ab mediates prophylactic protection against primary ocular HSV-1 infection, it remains unknown why Ab responses fail to protect patients who experience frequent HSV-1 reactivation in the eye. Uncovering the central role of FcRn in Ab-mediated protection against HSV-1 may provide insight into this conundrum. Ocular immunopathology associated with recurrent corneal HSV-1 reactivation in humans is driven primarily by TLR signaling and CD4 T cells ( [9](javascript:;)). In vitro studies have demonstrated that FcRn expression is upregulated by TNF- and repressed by IFN- in polarized epithelial cells ( [85](javascript:;), [86](javascript:;)). Therefore, the establishment of tissue-resident CD4 T cells in the corneas of patients with frequent HSV-1 reactivation may, in fact, limit the expression of FcRn via IFN- expression and consequently usurp the local protective functions of Ab. Although HSV-1 0NLS has strong translational potential, diverse vaccine strategies will undoubtedly emerge and continue to augment HSV-1 vaccine development. It is now evident that a successful prophylactic HSV-1 vaccine must be capable of eliciting a long-lived, high-titer humoral immune response to effectively combat ocular disease and limit neuroinvasion. Irrespective of whether the Ab-mediated effector function protects via complement, ADCC, intracellular targeting, or a combination thereof, Ab persistence following vaccination is a critical limiting factor of prophylactic vaccine efficacy against HSV-1 infection ( [87](javascript:;)).
