Herbs and their drinks are an ideal method of hydration in autumn and winter, at a time when water consumption is significantly reduced. But in addition to hydration, some of them can offer various health benefits, including boosting our immune system. Table of Contents 5 herbs that can stimulate the immune system: Echinacea Echinacea (or echinacea) is known for its species, especially Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea pallida and Echinacea augustifolia, as well as the different parts of the plant, have different uses and varied benefits. Some research shows that the herb can reduce the duration of colds and flu. According to a review of 14 studies, taking echinacea can reduce the risk of catching a common cold by more than 50% [1]. It should be noted, however, that many studies on herbs are not well-planned, and this makes it somewhat difficult to know whether the benefits actually come from echinacea or may simply be due to luck. Thyme [Thyme](https://www.vita4you.gr/blog-vita4you/en/item/thyme-a-powerful-herb-for-health.html) is considered one of the most tonic herbs for the immune system. Among the chemicals it contains, research focuses on thymol and carvacrol, two substances that are chemically very similar. Thymol supports the immune system and acts against bacteria while carvacrol is a powerful antibacterial and antifungal substance. A test tube study compared the antimicrobial activity of thyme, oregano and sage essential oils. Thyme essential oil was the most effective against bacteria and second came that of oregano [3]. Oregano Oregano not only offers flavor but also strengthens the immune system. Traditionally, people make oregano decoction and drink it to soothe various health problems. It is used for coughs, colds, sore throats, nausea, stomach upsets and phlegms. Oregano contains some compounds that have strong antibacterial properties such as carvacrol and thymol. One study found that oregano was effective against 23 species of bacteria [4]. Note, however, that current research is limited to test tube studies that have used relatively large amounts of the herb. Sage Sage is a member of the mint family, along with thyme and oregano. It is an aromatic herb used in traditional medicine to treat viral infections. Its antiviral properties are mainly attributed to compounds found in the leaves and stem of the plant [5]. One of its components, salvine, has antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that has antibiotic-resistant strains. In one study, sage reduced the bacteria thought to be responsible for caries. In another study, sage extract significantly inhibited the activity of the HIV virus that causes AIDS, preventing the virus from entering target cells [6]. Ginger Ginger has been used in Eastern cuisine for thousands of years. The drink and other herbal products such as e.g. lozenges are a popular natural remedy. Its active ingredient, gingerol is what gives it its spicy taste. In addition, ginger can reduce the risk of infections. Ginger extract can inhibit the growth of many different types of bacteria [7]. According to a 2008 study, the herb is effective against oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis. Fresh ginger can also be effective against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common cause of respiratory infections [8].
