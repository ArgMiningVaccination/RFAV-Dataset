These include \"nature cures\", which were the use of light, food, air, water and herbs (developed in Austria), and hydrotherapy (popular in Germany), which was the use of water to treat illness.

The naturopathy techniques undertaken to treat clients can differ depending on the modalities they've studied, as well as their healing philosophy.
