Thousands of acclaimed physicians.The Partnership for Breast Care, Hartford Hospital's comprehensive breast care program, has been awarded a three-year accreditation by the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers (NAPBC). Receiving a perfect compliance score in 27 categories of breast care and program organization, this accreditation recognizes our commitment to providing the highest level of quality breast care. Administered by the American College of Surgeons, the NAPBC is a consor - tium of professional organizations dedicated to the improvement of the qual - ity of care and monitoring of outcomes of patients with diseases of the breast. The accreditation process includes a detailed application and full-day onsite visit. Hartford Hospital's breast care program, established in 2001, provides a single comprehensive resource for individuals with breast health issues. Patricia A. DeFusco, MD, medical oncologist, newly appointed medical director for the Partnership for Breast Care said, \"I attribute our highly successful accreditation survey to the efforts of the entire breast disease team, the Cancer Registry staff, and to the excellent work of my predecessor, Dr. Andrew Ricci, and to Karen Weingrod, the program manager.\" Hartford Hospital Designated \"Comprehensive Stroke Center\" Hartford Hospital has been recognized by The Joint Commission and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association with Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC) Certification. We are the first such program in all of New England. Certification means we are part of an elite group focused on complex stroke care. Comprehensive stroke centers are recognized as industry leaders and are responsible for setting the national agenda in specialized stroke care. \"Hartford Hospital is thoroughly committed to providing our patients with the highest qual - ity stroke care based on current scientific research to ensure continuous improve - ment in care,\" said Isaac E. Silverman, MD, the Stroke Center's co-medical director and vascular neurologist. \"Comprehensive Stroke Center Certification has con - firmed what we know. We offer exceptional, cutting edge stroke care to our pa - tients, as we improve care overall for our community.\" \"By achieving this advanced certification, Hartford Hospital has thoroughly dem - onstrated the greatest level of commitment to the care of its patients with a com - plex stroke condition,\" said Mark R. Chassin, MD, FACP, MPP, MPH, president, The Joint Commission. \"Certification is a voluntary process and The Joint Commission commends Hartford Hospital for successfully undertaking this challenge to elevate the standard of its care for the community it serves.\" Hartford Hospital's Partnership for Breast Care Receives National Accreditation as a Breast Center 2Numerous Hartford Hospital physicians, nurses, dentists, physician assistants and other health care professionals have provided care in other parts of the U.S. and internationally throughout the years. Countries benefitting include Cape Verde, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guadalupe, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Switzerland, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Zambia. The volunteering of these services has been through various organizations and charities rather than through one centralized effort. Many Hartford Hospital medical providers responded to a survey indicating that they would be interested in providing medical care in other geographies and joining a plan - ning group for developing a global health program. Hartford Hospital will now begin to integrate and coordinate these global health initiatives via an advi - sory group. The goal is to promote collaboration across disciplines and improve cost-effectiveness and ulti - mate sustainability, both domestically and abroad.

The specialties are cardiology and heart surgery; diabetes urology.The U.S. News & World Report hospital rankings are extremely competitive, and our performance attests to the truly beyond-advanced care and services that Hartford Hospital provides. It is an honor to be ranked among U.S. News' Best Hospitals. Only about 15 per - cent of hospitals in the country are recognized for high performance and as among their region's best. 3Beyond Advanced 4The guiding principle of an \"institute model\" in medicine is to provide an exceptional patient experience by ensuring timely coordinated care that involves all pertinent specialties to address all medical needs. In 2012, Hartford Hospital received an anonymous gift of $5 million to create the Tallwood Urology and Kidney Institute, joining cancer and transplant services as the third institute at Hartford Hospital. The donor's generosity was integral to supporting the hospital's vision: to provide excellence in clinical outcomes, research and the patient experience while being a national leader for compre - hensive state-of-the-art urologic and kidney care. The Institute handles all diagnoses associated with kidney and urologic function. Steven J. Shichman, MD, chair of the Tallwood Urology and Kidney Institute explained, \"There are currently six interdisciplinary teams provid - ing evidence-based care. Each team has a physician champion with all of the appropriate specialties participating to produce the best possible outcome for the patient.\" Richard P. Garmany, another grateful patient of Hartford Hospital, made a gift to the Tallwood Institute via the Richard P. Garmany Fund at the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving. A portion of this gift will assist the teams by funding programming and patient and community education for disease management; community-based lectures will inform the general public with symptom awareness and prevention strategies for kidney, bladder and prostate cancers. This team structure has had an immediate positive impact on patient care, as evidenced by the number of surgeries, length of stay, complication and readmission rates for patients of the Tallwood Institute surpassing nationally benchmarked data.

The Chronic Kidney Disease Team , led by Terrance Oder, MD, includes the services of endocrinology, dialysis, nephrology, medicine, nutrition, interven - tional radiology, and transplant surgery services. The team has two essential goals. First, patients treated early in their kidney failure or disease process have better outcomes, so the team is developing plans to navigate patients be - fore they need dialysis. \"Fostering a link with Hartford Hospital's Transplant Institute's team is paramount because if patients can receive a kidney trans - plant instead of life long dialysis, quality of life and survival rates improve dramatically,\" said Jan Ruderman, MBA, director of the Tallwood Urology and Kidney Institute. Second, patients who do require dialysis benefit from the work of this team. Because dialysis involves three times per week treatment, usually on a long term basis, complications for these patients can include failure of the access site (the way the patient is connected to the dialysis equipment) and infection. Team members explore ways in which certain materials and tech - niques will minimize these problems. Stone disease is a condition that has been on the rise over the last two de - cades\u2014approximately 8.8% of the population will have a kidney stone \u2014fre - quently attributed to changes in diet and lifestyle. The Stone Disease Team , led by Jeffrey Morgenstern, MD, includes the disciplines of nephrology, urology and nutrition. In addition to treating patients with procedures such as litho - tripsy, ureteroscopic stone removal and percutaneous nephrostomy, patients participate in a comprehensive approach to manage their stone disease. An example of how the Institute develops pathways that set standards of care reflecting evidence-based medicine is a patient under the age of 25 years with a stone: not only is the stone treated, but because of the patient's young age, this patient automatically becomes a candidate for a work-up that includes a specific set of tests and is then educated about controlling stone formation. The National Overactive Bladder Evaluation program (NOBLE) estimated that 16.5 percent of its interviewed subjects have OAB\u2014overactive bladder. Because accurately diagnosing the cause of incontinence is vital to effective treatment, the Pelvic Health Team , co-led by Richard Kershen, MD, from urol - ogy, and Christine LaSala, MD, from urogynecology, was developed. Urinary incontinence and bladder dysfunction are treated in conjunction with urol - ogy, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, physical rehabilitation and psychol - ogy services. Whether it's an advancement in robotic surgery, reconstruction or another treatment technique, this team's goal is to promote overall pelvic health with individualized comprehensive treatment plans. Men are 24 percent less likely than women to visit a doctor annually ac- cording to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) data. In order to identify the health needs of men and get them to appropriate resources, the Men's Health Team was developed. The team, led by James Graydon, MD, includes endocrinology, cardiology, urology and psychology. It is developing programs to maintain prostate health, assess endocrine and cardiac function as well as address infertility and erectile dysfunction. Stuart S. Kesler, MD, who serves as the site director for the Urology Residency Program, leads the Minimally Invasive Urologic Surgery Team . These surgeons advance patient care through the use of innovative laparoscopic and robotic procedures, education and research. Experience Matters Hartford Hospital was recognized by U.S. News & World Report as being the Number One hospital in the Hartford region and among the best hospitals in Connecticut in nine specialties, two of which are urology and nephrology. In 2012 Number 1 in volume in the state for inpatients with a primary diagnosis of bladder, kidney or prostate cancer (Source: CHIME) 854 patients with stone dis - ease treated; 1,010 patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (stage 1-6) treated (Source: Hartford Hospital) In 2013, compared to all hospitals Patient Satisfaction for Patients under the Care of a Urologist: 97th percentile in satisfaction with \"communication with doctors\" 97th in with \"doctors of nephrec- tomies at Hartford Hospital were partial nephrectomies (mean - ing only a portion of the kidney was removed) compared to 32% nationwide. (Source: The Journal of Urology , August 2013, 2010 data, the last year that data was benchmarked.) 5Beyond Advanced Urological Oncology , part of both Tallwood and the Cancer Institute, led by Anoop Meraney, MD, treats patients who have cancer of the kidney, bladder, prostate or testes at the Helen and Harry Gray Cancer Center. Many of this team's surgeries are performed robotically to spare as much of the organ as possible, minimize blood loss and chance of infection and promote a quicker recovery via smaller incisions. To support the coordination of care, oncology patients have a \"naviga - tor\" assigned, a liaison who works with the patient to identify services and resources. \"If the patient has questions or needs information, the naviga - tor is the single point of contact for all of his or her needs,\" according to Ms. Ruderman. \"This concept is being developed for all programs.\" Case conferences are of vital importance in the Institute. They are espe - cially beneficial for cases involving cancer care where complexity precludes the use of a specific treatment pathway. All specialties are represented when the case is presented and all disciplines confer so that there is a consensus on a plan of care. Recently, conferences have been set up so that all hospitals within the Hartford HealthCare system can be linked in. Physician Education and Skill Enhancement is a Priority In addition to outcomes surpassing national data, the setting of new standards in care is occurring through the strong educational initiatives of the Institute. In the past year, Tallwood surgeons and physicians have presented at multiple national conferences, such as the American Urologic Association, and trained physicians from around the world in robotic surgery. The Tallwood team has also developed high-tech interventions at Hartford Hospital's Center for Education, Simulation and Innovation (CESI). In addition to enhancing the knowledge and skills of experienced urolo - gists, the Tallwood teams feel that interacting with the pipeline of new physi - cians during their residencies is critical. Dr. Shichman explained, \"Hartford Hospital is a primary training site for the University of Connecticut's urology residents and oversees laparoscopic and robotic surgery for all of UConn's urology residents. Residents train every week at CESI.\" Dr. Shichman con - tinued, \"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is mandating new milestones (competency-based developmental outcome (Top photo) Jan Ruderman, MBA, director, and Steven Shichman, MD, chair, Tallwood Urology and Kidney Institute. (Bottom photo) The Urology Oncology Team conducts an interdisciplinary case conference. 6expectations), for resident performance; at Hartford Hospital we put those mandates in place on July 1, 2013, six months ahead of schedule.\" Tallwood physicians are dedicated to providing knowledge of best practic- es with primary care practitioners. A portion of the Richard P. Garmany Fund is earmarked for this initiative. \"The Richard P. Garmany Lecture Series for Primary Care Physicians will provide updates on standards of care and increase primary care practitioners' understanding of when a referral to a higher level of care should be made,\" said Ms. Ruderman. Examples of the 3-D images that the magnetic resonance imaging ultrasound fusion equipment will provide for prostate biopsies. Hartford Hospital's Tallwood Urology & Kidney Institute and the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center invite you to a series of free educational programs. For details, see Special Events listings on page 23.State-of-the-Art Equipment for Prostate Cancer In prostate cancer care, the ability to make decisions about care is enhanced with state-of-the-art equipment. The latest addition to the Institute will be MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) US (ultrasound - high frequency sound waves) fusion equipment which will more accurately biopsy areas of the prostate suspi - cious for prostate cancer and identify disease progression. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are approximately one million prostate biopsies done in the U.S. every year, with 240,000 men being told they have prostate cancer. Because current traditional techniques of biopsy don't involve full \"sight,\" meaning there is some uncertainty as to exactly what tissue is being extracted, 23% of men with a negative biopsy actually have cancer. \"This new imaging equipment will allow a precise diagnosis as it fuses ultrasound with MRI to create a 3-D image allowing the physician to see the entire biopsy area,\" said Dr. Merany. \" Active surveillance is for patients who have prostate cancer that is being monitored and have not yet received treatment. Use of this equipment will increase the confidence of treatment decisions for these patients.\" 7Hartford Hospital continues to set the pace for advance - ments in cardiac care. Just last year the hospital introduced transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which gives patients too frail for open heart surgery new hope for longer, healthier lives. Then it became the first in the United States\u2014and only the eighth in the world\u2014to implant a new device to support the right ventricle of a patient's heart. Now the hospital has expanded its com - prehensive cardiac care even further by adding two new therapies that offer critical options for certain patients. ECMO: Advanced Care for the Gravely Ill Multidisciplinary collaboration is a hallmark of cardiac care at Hartford Hospital and this certainly applies to the new therapy known as ECMO, extracorporeal mem - brane oxygenation. The therapy is designed to temporar - ily relieve the burden on a gravely ill patient's heart and lungs. The patient's blood is pumped from the body to an oxygenator, which adds oxygen and removes carbon diox - ide. Blood is then pumped back to the body. It is similar to heart-lung bypass, but can be used for hours to days. Jason Gluck, DO, director of Emergency Cardiac Care and a heart failure and transplant specialist, introduced ECMO at Hartford Hospital. He said the treatment is used when \"the patient has a life-threatening condition where the chance of dying is 80 percent or more; has an acute, reversible problem; and we need to stabilize them for hours or days until they can heal through medication or surgery.\" Examples include patients with acute complica - tions from heart attack, those with a blood clot in the lung or patients who have had bypass surgery or heart transplant. Patients receiving ECMO require constant, complex care. Hartford Hospital has an entire multidisciplinary team specially trained in caring for these very sick pa - tients. Team members include physicians specializing in heart failure, heart surgery, cardiac critical care and clini - cal cardiology; perfusionists; cardiac critical care nurses; advanced practice clinicians; and respiratory therapists. Those on ECMO \"are our sickest patients,\" said Cardiac Critical Care Nurse Educator Karen Freed, MSN, APRN. \"The ICU staff and perfusionists have to manage and monitor carefully all aspects of patient care 24 hours a day.\" The entire health care team rounds on ECMO pa - tients daily. \"The likelihood is that all of the body systems end up being supported in these patients because they are so sick,\" said Michele Kolios, BSN, MS, nurse manager of the Cardiothoracic ICU and Coronary Care Unit. There are multiple assessments that need to be performed to assure there's no compromise to the patient's circulation while these measures are in place.\" Dr. Gluck stresses that while ECMO doesn't cure any condition, \"It buys us some time\u2014hours or days\u2014in which we can try to fix the problem.\" He notes that a minority of hospitals nationwide offer adult ECMO and that Hartford Hospital is the only facility in northern Connecticut and western Massachusetts to offer it. \"Hartford Hospital has gone to great lengths to make sure we provide the full spectrum of care for patients with cardiovascular compromise, extending from mini - mally invasive care to the most extreme and extensive form of support, which is ECMO therapy,\" said Ms. Kolios. \"I feel it completes an extensive list of offerings we can bring to the people of this region.\" The \"Mini Maze\": Surgical Treatment for Abnormal Heartbeat The American Heart Association estimates that 2.7 million people in the U.S. have a condition called atrial fibrillation, or A-fib. The condition occurs when the electri - cal impulses that control the heart become erratic, causing the heart to beat abnormally. This \"arrhythmia\" can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, dizzi - ness and fatigue. But that's not all. Because it allows blood to pool in the heart's left atrial appendage, clots can form and eventually cause stroke, which can lead to serious dis - ability or death. Treatment for A-fib can vary, depending on the indi - vidual case. For some people, medication is the solution. For others, a minimally invasive, catheter-based proce -More New Options in Cardiac Care Physicians monitor ECMO equipment while in use on a patient. 8Tailoring Treatment to Each Patient Massachusetts resident Daniel Driscoll had a problem. He had atrial fibrillation, but wasn't able to tolerate blood-thinning medications. That not only put him at risk of stroke, but prevented him from having catheter-based ablation, which requires blood-thinners. His Boston electrophysiologist, Peter Zimetbaum, MD, recommended surgery and referred Danny to Dr. Robert Hagberg. Danny and his wife, Pauline, were glad to travel to Hartford Hospital. Pauline had known Dr. Hagberg at the Boston hos - pital where she is a cardiac catheterization nurse and where Dr. Hagberg pioneered the mini maze. It seemed Danny was a good candidate for the mini - mally invasive procedure, and now it was available only at Hartford Hospital. Dr. Hagberg reviewed Danny's case, decided mini maze was right for him, and performed the surgery in April 2013. Danny and Pauline went home to Massachusetts five days after surgery, with Danny's A-fib eliminated. The Rev. William Veinot, of Rocky Hill, Conn., learned about the mini maze from Hartford Hospital electrophysiologist Eric Crespo, MD. Bill had gone to see Dr. Crespo because he continued to have debili - tating A-fib, despite having had three catheter abla - tions. He was deeply disappointed when Dr. Hagberg explained that, because of very rare complications from the previous ablations, Bill was not a candidate for the mini maze. However, Dr. Hagberg assured Bill that the open, Cox maze IV procedure would resolve the A-fib and give him back the high quality of life he hadn't enjoyed in years. Drs. Hagberg and Crespo col - laborated on the procedure, which was done on Dec. 28, 2012. By Jan. 1, 2013, Bill was recovering at home, and he knew immediately that the A-fib he'd endured for 12 years was completely gone. \"I almost wish I'd had this surgery years ago,\" Bill said. \"I'm arrhyth - mia-free, and I feel like I have my life back.\" Referring to his lighthearted nickname as an Episcopal priest, Bill said \"I'm 'Father Joyful' again!\" dure can correct the problem. Now, under the leadership of Robert Hagberg, MD, chief of Cardiac Surgery, Hartford Hospital is offering a minimally invasive surgical treat - ment for A-fib called the \"mini maze\" procedure. The mini maze is a team-based procedure performed by both a cardiac surgeon and an electrophysiologist. The surgeon makes small incisions on both sides of the patient's chest and inserts a tiny camera and instru - ments. Because atrial fibrillation often originates in the pulmonary veins that lead from the lungs to the heart, Dr. Hagberg explained, \"We deliver bipolar radiofrequency ablation to make a circular 'burn' where the vein meets the heart. The electrophysiologist is in the operating room and tests to be sure the block is present, just as they do with the catheter-based approach.\" The team also locates and ablates ganglia\u2014nerve bundles on the heart's surface that can trigger atrial fibrillation\u2014and surgically removes the left atrial appendage to reduce stroke risk. Patients who have had the mini maze procedure typi - cally spend two to four days in the hospital and are feeling back to normal within two to four weeks, usually with normal heart rhythm restored. \"Depending on the type of atrial fibrillation, success rates vary,\" Dr. Hagberg said. \"But it is highly successful in patients with paroxysmal (in - termittent) atrial fibrillation.\" It's also an excellent option for patients who can't take the anticoagulant medications necessary for the catheter-based procedure. \"The focus of atrial fibrillation management is preven - tion of stroke, which often requires blood thinners,\" said Jeffrey Kluger, MD, associate director of Cardiology and director of Heart Rhythm Management. \"For people who have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, but for whom medica - tion is not working, mini maze is potentially a procedure that can be curative in a large number of people.\" The mini maze builds on an earlier surgical treat - ment called the Cox maze IV procedure. This procedure is performed by opening the patient's chest, just as in open- heart surgery. Once the heart is exposed, doctors take the same steps as in mini maze. While highly successful, Cox maze IV is major surgery, with associated blood loss, risk of complications and lengthy recovery. Today, with the mini maze and catheter-based procedures available, Cox maze IV is used only when the patient needs open-heart surgery for some other reason or has certain other condi - tions. The original maze procedure, which predates the Cox maze IV, was open surgery in which surgeons actually cut and re-sewed the heart's surface to create a \"maze\" of scar tissue to block abnormal electrical impulses. Dr. Hagberg, who introduced the mini maze at Hartford Hospital, has performed approximately 60 such proce - dures in his career. Hartford Hospital is the only center in the region offering this advanced treatment. \"I think the mini maze is an important option we have for pa - tients,\" said Steven Zweibel, MD, director of Cardiac Electrophysiology. \"It's outstanding that electrophysiolo - gists and Dr. Hagberg work together as a team to be sure we're doing it the right way and that the electrophysiology service follows up with patients postoperatively to be sure they get state-of-the-art arrhythmia care.\" 9HARTFORD HOSPITAL NEWS Hartford Hospital Continues to Go Green Light and heat for Hartford Hospital is going to be supplied by a new 1.4-megawatt alternative-energy power generator that will operate on natural gas. Any excess steam not used by the hospital will be piped to the nearby Learning Corridor magnet school in the city's South End. In one year, the fuel cell is expected to prevent the emission of more than 57,000 pounds of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that causes smog. Additionally, the generator will offset the emission of more than 128,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, more than 3,000 pounds of particulate matter from conventional power plants and prevent the emission of more than 6,700 tons of carbon dioxide. The new employee parking garage on Hudson Street, which opened last winter, was built to be one of the greenest buildings in Hartford. The structure was made largely of recycled content. Currently, additional green projects are underway including the availability of electric charging stations, the restoration of green space and the addition of rain gardens which will sur - round the building for storm water management to ease the demand on municipal systems and restore natural aquifers.Research \"Cancer Avatars\" to Assist in Developing Personalized Patient Treatment Research mice called \"cancer avatars\" (patient stand-ins) may be tiny, but they will be a huge help to doctors and scientists working to treat and one day cure cancer. Doctors from Hartford Hospital and Connecticut Children's Medical Center will work with scientists from the world famous Jackson Laboratory in their new JAX Genomic Medicine facility in Farmington. In a new project, these avatars will help doctors customize care for individual cancer patients. \"Together, we can take the patient's own tumor cells, study them in the lab, and ultimately translate those findings into a per - sonalized and effective treatment approach. It will be a giant leap forward in developing safe and effective cancer therapies,\" said Andrew Salner, MD, director of Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. The cancers to be studied are those with high risk of recurrence, including certain types of pediatric cancer and adult colon cancer. Patient participation will be voluntary. Over time, the study will establish a database that correlates cancer treatment results with the specific genomic variations observed in tumors. Using advanced tools to analyze the data, researchers expect to develop the ability to quickly and accurately predict the most ef - fective treatment for each patient. The Jackson Lab was established in 1929 as a nonprofit medical research institution and has been exploring the genetic basis of human diseases such as cancer, diabe - tes and neurological disorders such as autism, epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, muscular dystrophy and ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). In 2012 the lab founded the JAX Genomic Medicine facility in Farmington to discover pre - cise genomic solutions for disease and develop individu - alized therapies for cancer and other diseases. The new 250,000 square foot facility is being built on the lower campus of the UConn Health Center and is expected to be completed in 2014.

Randy has worked at Hartford Hospital since 2005. Born in Trinidad, he at - tended Fatima College in the Caribbean, and came to the United States in 1998. Randy asked to learn the routines in all the differ - ent areas of Environmental Services so he can fill in anywhere he is needed. \"I love my job because I can do a lot of different tasks,\" he said. Randy has been on the HCAHPS Committee (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) for two years, where he works to improve patient satisfaction by promoting employee friendliness, institutional cleanliness, and Hartford Hospital, a level one trauma center and the center for disaster preparedness for north - ern Connecticut, hosted a one-day meeting in the spring known as Hartford Consensus. The program is designed to help cities deploy resources during active shooter and mass casualty events. The goal is to employ common terminol - ogy and coordinated responses to increase the number of survivors. Lenworth Jacobs, MD, vice presi - dent of Academic Affairs and chief academic officer, chaired the pro - gram which included physicians from the FBI, the Navy, the Dallas SWAT team and the New Orleans Police Department. Hartford Consensus was borne out of tragedies such as Newtown by the American College of Surgeons. Dr. Jacobs was the lead author of the Consensus' paper that was pub - lished in the Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons. The paper will be discussed with the Officer Safety and Wellness Working Group, an organization that is part of the U.S. Department of Justice. In July, the follow-up Hartford Consensus II was held to bring the concepts to fruition. The focus was on policies and procedures, procurement of tourniquets and hemo - static dressings, education, and evaluation. The document prepared from the meeting will be given to each partici - pant and then shared with each constituent's organization. improved bed turnaround time. He believes all staff members can have a positive effect on patient satisfaction. \"What I like most about our department is that we have a great diversity of people who speak a lot of different lan - guages. We are often called to translate for patients who speak Russian or Polish or Greek.\" As Employee of the Year, Randy received a $2,000 check, recognition in the Hartford Courant, and a reserved parking space for one year. Randy is married and has a 10-year-old son. Other staff members selected as finalists for Employee of the Year honors included: Jerry Belanger, Web Manager; Marie APRN; Linda Kingsbury, PCA; Kevin O'Shea, Parent, Mechanic; Angel Rentas, APRN; Hattie Roberts, Administrative Associate; Young, RN CB6. Congratulations to Randy and all of the finalists who live our values every day! Randy Baggoo Named Employee of the Year Volunteers Build a Better World Hartford Hospital has great reason to celebrate our volunteers and the difference they make for our patients, families, staff and community. During the past year, 1,380 volunteers contributed 150,533 hours of service to more than 200 different areas of Hartford Hospital. The total monetary value of this donated time is more than $4 million. Thank you volunteers!The Hartford Consensus Randy BaggooLenworth Jacobs, MD, vice president of Academic Affairs and chief academic officer, 4th from left, and the Hartford Consensus team. 11It's probably fair to say that no one really likes going to the hospital. Unless it's to welcome a new baby, anyone who's admitted to the hospital is having health problems, and that means probably feeling anxious and stressed, as well as physically uncomfortable. Hartford Hospital recognizes this and is determined to make each patient's experience the best it can possibly be. The hospital recently ramped up its efforts by creating a new position, director of patient experience, and appointing a sea - soned professional to the post. David Fichandler, MSPT, CLT, has co-led the hospital's Patient Experience Team since it was created in 2009. The team's initial charge was to improve the hospi - tal's performance on the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey, which measures patients' perceptions of hospital care. They implemented innovations such as hourly rounding and trained more than 2,300 staff members in key points to remember when providing patient care. The team soon realized that much more could be done to improve the patient experience, and the award-winning Team EXCEED was born. Co-led by Mr. Fichandler and Lynn Deasy, RN, BSN, MPH, the 24-member Team EXCEED was dedicated to an all-out effort to ensure that every encoun - ter patients have with the hospital meets or exceeds their expectations. Today, evidence of Team EXCEED's efforts can be seen and experienced inside and outside the hospital. They cover a broad range of areas, including hospital security, patient relations, valet operations, patient satisfaction ini - tiatives and the on-campus accommodations for patients and families. Creating the position of director of patient experience, Mr. Fichandler said, reflects the understanding of \"the patient experience as something that happens before the patient even arrives on campus. When patients are com - ing in for care, their first impressions are not of the doctor, but of the garage, the valet parking person, security. We Enhancing the Patient Experience In response to patient feedback, a redesigned food service system was one of the innovations implemented. 12What's Going Around...

The CDC states that 35.7% of U.S. adults are obese; the rate is 22.5% in CT. This highlights the challenges of confronting and revers - ing this health care crisis. Visit www.cdc.gov/obesity for additional information. Take Concussions Seriously Fall involves scholastic football and soccer, two sports that have their share of concussions. The CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) has toolkits for health care professionals, coaches, parents and athletes. Visit www.cdc.gov/concussion . For concussion evaluation and treatment within Hartford HealthCare contact the Concussion Clinic at 860.545.5107. NAFLD a Growing Problem The NIH (National Institutes of Health) re - ports that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is on the rise, becoming the most chronic liver con - dition in the western world. Usually without symp - toms, NAFLD is seen more frequently with diabetes and obesity. The good news is that NAFLD responds to weight loss, exercise and control of any other meta - bolic risk factors.want first and last impressions to set the tone, so when you come here for care, we're meeting or exceeding your expectations.\" Mr. Fichandler points out that there's a clinical component to these efforts. \"Our goal is to reduce anxiety for patients and families. Patients with reduced anxiety and stress levels get better outcomes.\" Highlights So Far The hospital has made numerous innovations with an eye to creating a better patient experience. Campus facilities, including the public garage, were redesigned and refurbished. A new Professional Image Policy intro - duced color-coded uniforms and large-type name badges so patients and families could easily identify staff members' roles. Whiteboards were installed in patient rooms to enhance communication. Every patient who is admitted now receives a Hartford Hospital Healthcare Guide and Journal . The guide allows patients to understand their rights and responsibilities and what they can expect during their stay. The journal allows patients to better participate in their own care by writing down questions and concerns. Nine Patient Advisory Boards\u2014one overall and one for each of eight specific areas\u2014have been instituted to help Team EXCEED make plans and monitor perfor - mance. \"As we continue to evolve our culture and get better, we can't do it by ourselves,\" Mr. Fichandler said. \"We need feedback from users to make sure we meet or exceed our customers' expectations while providing the highest quality care.\" One aspect of the hospital experience that patients said needed improvement was the food\u2014not that it wasn't nutritious or hot, but that it lacked flavor. In response, this spring the hospital completely rede - signed the food service system. Patient feedback in the first month was \"incredibly positive,\" according to Mr. Fichandler.Statistics show that the team's efforts over the past several years are making a difference in patients' per - ceptions. The percentage of patients rating their experi - ence as the \"best possible\" has grown from 54 percent in 2008 to 70 percent in 2012, putting Hartford Hospital's score above the national average. \"For a hospital to get 16 percent improvement over four years is almost unheard of nationally,\" Mr. Fichandler said. \"Other organizations are reaching out to us to see how we're doing it.\" Looking Ahead Team EXCEED currently has 17 initiatives on the drawing board. A major one focuses on communication. The hospital is using a methodology from a national health care consulting firm to train all physicians and staff in techniques aimed at ensuring clear, complete communication among providers, patients and fami - lies. Training is led by Team EXCEED members and staff from the hospital's Center for Education, Simulation and Innovation. The team will soon launch a \"Quiet at Night\" cam - paign. This aims to reduce noise during nighttime hours to allow patients the restful sleep they need in order to heal. Also on the horizon are innovations in patient edu - cation. The team is exploring ways to use web-based technology to engage and educate patients. This might be a web-based personal assistant who would allow patients to ask questions. Or it might allow a doctor to direct a patient to an educational module on, say, diabe - tes self-care, that he or she could do at home. \"We're also looking to bring additional technology to the bedside,\" Mr. Fichandler said. \"Imagine a future when the TV has a portal to allow patients to see lab results, X-rays or CT scans or Skype with their doctors or family. Only about 10 percent of hospitals nationally have this. We hope to pilot it at the end of 2013.\" Car Seat Safety The American Academy of Pediatrics is recommend - ing that children should be in rear-facing car seats until at least two years of age. Additionally, children should remain in a car seat with a five-point safety harness as long as possible; a booster seat using the car's adult seat belts should be used after children ex - ceed the height and weight limit for the five-point harness. 13Depression Have you been diagnosed with major depression? Has your depression not improved with your current medica - tion? John Goethe, MD, is offering screenings for partici - pation in a clinical research study to assess whether an investigational drug may be useful, safe and well-tolerated for the treatment of major depression. Participants will re - ceive a study-related psychiatric evaluation and the study drug at no cost. Dr. Goethe is also conducting a trial using a new, non- invasive medical device for the treatment of depression known as transcranial magnetic stimulation. Inclusion criteria for the trial include a diagnosis of major depres - sive disorder with postpartum onset.Dr. Schwartz Attends President's Conference Hank Schwartz, MD, psychiatrist-in-chief at the Institute of Living and vice president of Behavioral Health at Hartford Hospital, represented Hartford Hospital at the White House's one-day mental health conference in June. President Barack Obama delivered the opening remarks and Vice President Joe Biden delivered the closing remarks. The event was the kickoff for the president's \"national dialogue on mental health,\" which was in response to gun violence and featured the topic of mental health. Health care and mental health professionals, patients, educa - tors, and legislators were among the 150 invited attend - ees. Actors Bradley Cooper and Glenn Close were also in attendance. Bradley Cooper has become an advocate for mental health since his performance as a man with a bi - polar disorder in the movie Silver Linings Playbook. Glenn Close spoke about the mental health challenges faced by her sister and nephew. Have you ever wondered if your mobile devices are carrying dangerous germs? Jack Ross, MD, chief of Infectious Disease/Epidemiology, wondered, so he did some tests. His conclusion: the flat screens of our current smartphones and tablets are surprisingly clean. (Dr. Ross notes that this was not the case with old cellphones with key pads!) Dr. Ross and his team, which included Jabar Aslanzadeh, PhD, director of Microbiology, and student fellows, performed cultures on the smartphones of 100 caregivers last summer, and found that none grew MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). They then inoculated six iPhones/smartphones with MRSA, and found that none supported growth after several hours. The team also cultured the touch plates on approximate - ly 50 Purell\u00ae dispensers on four intensive care units and nine nursing units, looking for VRE (vancomycin-resis - tant enterococci) and MRSA. All were negative.Clinical Studies at the Institute of Living A study from Sanford Health in North Dakota looked at 20 iPads. They showed none grew C. diff (Clostridium difficile), none grew gram negative rods (bacteria that have developed resistance to common antibiotics), and only three grew the bacteria Staph (Staphylococcus). Further testing showed that moist microfiber wipes removed the Staph effectively. The take-away message? It's a good idea to wipe your mobile devices like smartphones and tablets with a moist cloth, as well as perform proper hand hygiene.Does Your Mobile Device Carry Germs? Schizophrenia Have you been diagnosed with schizophrenia? If your symptoms have not improved with your current medica - tion, you may want to consider this research study. We are currently enrolling patients for a clinical research study to assess whether a new drug in combination with your present medication may be useful for the treatment of schizophrenia. Bipolar Disorder The purpose of this study is to test the effective - ness of an investigational add-on medication to treat bipolar disorder in people who already take prescribed medication. All participants will be seen by a doctor and receive the study medication and all study related procedures at no cost. For more information, please contact: Sherri L.
