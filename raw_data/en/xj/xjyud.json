Angela is a California Board Licensed Acupuncturist who received her Master's degree in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from Yo San University. Her appreciation of her chosen profession is due to her very early exposure to its benefits in her native South Korea. She was born prematurely and had serious health complications. Her parents turned to TCM which resulted in her successful recovery. This initial exposure was the genesis of her path to pursue a profession in acupuncture and TCM so that she can share the life-changing benefits of this ancient medical tradition with others. After completing intensive clinical training at Yo San Community Clinic, Venice Family Clinic, and Wise and Healthy Aging Center in Los Angeles, Angela pursued advanced acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine training at the China Beijing International Acupuncture Training Center and completed residencies at Beijing Hospital, Tongrentang Hospital, and Dongzhimen Hospital in Beijing, China.

Her ultimate goal is to provide the best treatments possible together with encouraging a balanced and happy lifestyle. Dr. Shannon Lawrence, DAOM Dr. Shannon Lawrence is a California Board Licensed Acupuncturist and a nationally certified Diplomate. She received her Master's and Doctorate degrees in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine from Yo San University. Her interest in pursuing Chinese medicine was discovered while working as a professional ballerina and dealing with multiple foot and ankle injuries. Working with an acupuncturist and physical therapist, during her ballet career, Dr. Shannon realized these practitioners genuinely cared for her. They taught her to embrace overcoming her injuries and live a healthy lifestyle. They educated her and taught her that health wasn't just about showing up for appointments, but their belief in wanting her to heal and the belief in herself, as well as committing to healing were all factors. Dr. Shannon is dedicated to giving patients that experience and a space to feel safe and empowered. Growing up on the East Coast, near the Chesapeake Bay, Shannon spent a lot of time fishing, swimming, and caring for farm animals. Her father and grandmothers' taught her to use the earth's natural resources for nutrition and healing. This way of life prepared her greatly for the medicine she has chosen as a profession. She has extensively studied orthopedics, pediatrics, internal medicine, and, most recently, psycho-emotional conditions and women's health. Dr. Shannon firmly believes that the integration of Western and Eastern medicines is key to the health preservation and longevity of all ages. Her goal for Tao of Wellness patients is to provide them with the ability to heal, find community support, educate them, and allow them to bring empowerment into their lives. Our Mission Traditional Chinese Medicine has its origin in ancient Taoist philosophy which views a person as an energy system in which body and mind are unified, each influencing and balancing the other. Unlike allopathic medicine which attempts to isolate and separate a disease from a person, Chinese medicine emphasizes a holistic approach that treats the whole body. We believe that acupuncture, along with herbal therapy, tuina massage and nutrition are the key tools to wellness. Many people have found Traditional Chinese methods of healing to be excellent tools for maintaining optimum health and preventing illness. Traditional Chinese Medicine is effective for physical, psychological and emotional conditions. One of the Ni family's strongest beliefs is: to be a good practitioner, one must also be a good teacher. Hence, Master Ni, Drs. Dao & Mao Ni also founded a school of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yo San University in Marina del Rey where the doctors teach and continue to transmit this ancient knowledge of healing. Drs. Daoshing and Mao Shing Ni are also well published authors. Between the three of them, including Master Ni, they have published over 70 books in Chinese Health and Fitness, Chinese Classics, Taoist Philosophy, Tai Chi and Qi Gong. These are great resources for patients to promote their own wellness. Even though Tao of Wellness has received accolades such as, \"Best of L.A.\", we strive to continue improving and providing the best possible service. Our History Master Ni, Hua-Ching has been teaching and practicing in the United States since 1976. Master Ni is fully acknowledged and empowered as a true Master of Tao. He is heir to the wisdom transmitted through an unbroken succession of 74 generations of masters dating back to the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). As a young boy, he was educated within his family in the spiritual foundation of Tao, and trained in mainland China by Taoist masters in healing, T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Kung Fu, Internal Alchemy, Chinese Medicine and Herbology. Later, he studied for more than 31 years in the high mountains of China, fully achieving all aspects of Taoist science and metaphysics. Throughout his life, Master Ni has supported himself through his work as a physician. Tao of Wellness and its predecessor clinic were established by Master Ni in 1976. He retired in 1985 and his two sons, Drs. Daoshing Ni and Mao Shing Ni took over and have since expanded the medical center by bringing in additional associates. All doctors and associates at Tao of Wellness treat various conditions, such as infertility, gynecological disorders, immunology, gastrointestinal, pain disorders, pain management and healthy aging medicine.
