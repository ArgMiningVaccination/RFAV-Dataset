INTRODUCTION Clinical issues in allergic disease are partia lly addressed by the 'Guideline on the Clinical Development of Medicinal Products for the Tr eatment of Allergic Rhino-Conjunctivitis (CPMP/EWP/2455/02)1' and the 'Note for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Asthma (CPMP/EWP/2922/01)2. However, both documents focus exclusively on the development of medicinal products to treat allergic symptoms. They do not include specific immunotherapy (SIT); a treatment which a lters the course of allergic diseases. Moreover, there are additional indications where SIT is used as first line treatment to prevent anaphylactic reactions (e.g. insect venom allergy) or is curren tly under investigation e.g. for atopic dermatitis or food allergies; these allergic conditions are not cons idered in the existing guidelines. Taken together, there is a need to draft a new guideline rather than revising the existing ones. As no common agreement exists on clinical trials with SIT, guidance is required to harmonise the requirements for such clinical trials within the Europe an Union. This is particularly important in light of the fact that several Phase II and III clinical trials are ongoing with both natural and recombinant allergen products. 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND DISCUSSION Up to now, no common agreement exists on the perform ance of clinical trials in SIT. The application of existing guidelines is not sufficient to solve sp ecific problems in the design of such studies and to facilitate a robust design of clinical trials which are accepted by all member states of the European Union. In addition, no consensus view exists on th e evaluation and interpretation of results of SIT studies. Although the term \"Allergy Vaccinati on\" is frequently used for SIT, it is an immunomodulatory treatment for diseased individuals. The therapy is pe rformed by administering the allergen to which the patient is sensitised and which elicits allerg ic symptoms. These allergens are mostly naturally occurring (glyco)-proteins which are not harmful to healthy individuals. They originate e.g. from seasonal allergen sources (e.g. tree, grass or weed pollen), perennial allergen sources (e.g. animal epithelia, moulds, mites) and venoms (e.g. bee and wasp venom). Although used for several decades, the complex immunological mechanisms of SIT are not completely understood. Moreover, the amount of allergen administered is relatively low (in th e range of 5-20 \u00b5g of major allergen per single administration for subcutaneous immunotherapy (WHO Position paper3)) making its detection in organs and body fluids rather difficult. In addition, the use of the principle of \"allergen families\" (i.e. a representative allergen for a group of allergens) in the clinical eval uation has not been defined. Thus, guidance is required in relation to whether and to what extent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are needed, the relevance of structurally rela ted (cross-reacting) allergens for performing SIT and specific issues concerning seasonal and perennial allergens. Most adverse events related to SIT are allergic reactions. Thus, adver se events, in addition to clinical efficacy have to be assessed in allergic subjects. Moreover, clinical efficacy cannot be determined in poly-sensitised subjects allergic to different alle rgens with overlapping seasons. Taken together, these factors limit the number of study subjects available fo r clinical trials. Guidance is needed on general requirements for the development and performance of c linical studies and criteria for patient inclusion. Moreover, there is limited consensus on multiple issues such as primary and secondary endpoints, minimum required clinical efficacy, duration of studies, measurement of long-term efficacy, and calculation of the minimum number of study subject s required to adequately determine safety and efficacy. SIT can be administered by different routes whic h may have different paths and mechanisms of modulating the immune system. While experience (inc luding long term) exists for the subcutaneous route of allergen administration, the sublingual ro ute is currently under extensive investigation in Page 3/4 \u00a9EMEA 2006 clinical trials. Only few data on its mechanism of action are available to date. The transferability of data between both application routes is the subject of ongoing debate. In summary, detailed guidance on the planning and desi gn of clinical trials in SIT is necessary to harmonise the marketing authorisation process for me dicinal products for SIT within the European Union. 3. RECOMMENDATION It is proposed that a CHMP guidance document on th e clinical development of medicinal products for specific immunotherapy with protein allergens be prepared. This document should address the appropriate and correct planning of clinical trials in SIT. The following topics were regarded as particularly important: Requirements regarding pharma cokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (generally and with regard to different SIT application routes) Role, relevance and timing of provocation tests and laboratory parameters as efficacy markers Study design aspects: o inclusion / exclusion criteria, o choice of endpoints, o study duration, o dose regimen and dose-response studies, o comparator, o measurement of long-term efficacy (preventive effects), o safety data Specific aspects of seasonal versus perennial allergens Define qualitatively and quantitatively beneficial effects in patients which are considered clinically relevant Relevance of cross-reacting allergens and of th e principle of \"allergen families\" in clinical trials Specific aspects regarding natural allergen extr acts versus recombinant allergens or allergen peptides Extrapolation of study results between different routes of application Special issues regarding SIT trials in children 4. PROPOSED TIMETABLE It is anticipated that draft CHMP guidance documen ts be available 12 months after adoption of the Concept Paper. 5. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION The preparation of this Guideline will involve the EWP only. 6. IMPACT ASSESSMENT (ANTICIPATED) The guidance document will provide guidance to bo th Industry and Regulatory Authorities regarding the clinical development and assessment of allergen products for specific immunotherapy. This should result in a more consistent approach and contri bute to improved harmoni sation and consequently Page 4/4 \u00a9EMEA 2006 increased availability of allergen products with e nhanced clinical efficacy and safety, thereby providing public health benefits. 7.
