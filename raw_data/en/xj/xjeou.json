This age-old Ayurvedic system of medicine dates back centuries. Additionally, it emphasises on using medicines of herbal or herbo-mineral origin, many a times using plants which are available in one's backyard, to prevent and treat diseases. India, with its rich cultural heritage, has a long and illustrious history of using these very properties of Ayurveda to treat various ailments, in both curative and preventative capacities. Dr Harshad Jain, B.A.M.S, M.D (Ayu.), Ayurvedic Medical Practitioner, BOHECO says, \"In today's age, many people might know of the herbs that are used in Ayurveda, but they lack the knowledge about their many properties and the dosage in which they should be consumed. The pandemic led to a perceptible shift in people's behaviours and lifestyles. People have started following daily regimens as outlined in Ayurvedic texts and consuming products and medicines that use Ayurvedic herbs. The great thing about this system of medicine which also sets it apart from other medical sciences is that these medicines don't have any side effects if taken under proper guidance. They are non-toxic and organic, making them easy and safe to incorporate in one's daily life.\" Below are 5 miraculous herbs that are an intrinsic part of Ayurveda classics and are used regularly for treating many disease conditions: [readmore](javascript://) 02/6Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus) English Name: Asparagus A very potent Ayurvedic drug, Shatavari is sweet in taste and has a cold potency of action.

Ayurveda mentions various uses of this herb to treat diseases such as Prameha (Diabetes), Pandu (Anaemia), Kamala (Jaundice), Kushta (Skin disease), Jwara (Fever), among others.\"Giloy is bitter in taste and has a hot potency which helps in reducing toxins (Ama) present in our bodies.
