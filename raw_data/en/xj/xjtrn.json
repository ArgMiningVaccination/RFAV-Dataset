This study aimed to determine whether acupuncture could decrease the risk of hypertension in patients with CSU. We enrolled patients newly diagnosed with CSU between 1 January 2008, and 31 December 2018, from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. The claims data were assessed from the index date to 31 December 2019. A Cox regression model was used to compare the hazard ratios (HRs) of the two cohorts. The cumulative incidence of hypertension was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. After propensity score matching with a 1:1 ratio, 43,547 patients with CSU who received acupuncture were matched with 43,547 patients with CSU who did not receive acupuncture in this study. After considering potential confounding factors, patients who received acupuncture had a significantly lower risk of hypertension than those in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% confidence interval = 0.54-0.58). Patients who received medications combined with acupuncture tended to have the lowest risk of hypertension. This study revealed that acupuncture decreases the risk of hypertension in patients with CSU in Taiwan. The detailed mechanisms can be further clarified through prospective studies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-22", "cleaned_text": "Acupuncture Decreases Risk of Hypertension in Patients with Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria in Taiwan: A Nationwide Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11101510](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11101510) [International Dermatology: Prevention and Treatment of Skin Diseases /journal/healthcare/special_issues/7IOZ586789 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-11-01510), [2](#B2-healthcare-11-01510), [3](#B3-healthcare-11-01510)]. Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, even when compared to cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, and diabetes [ [4](#B4-healthcare-11-01510)]. The exact etiology and mechanism of primary hypertension remain unclear, but the risk factors, such as age, obesity, family history, race, and a high-sodium diet, are well-known [ [5](#B5-healthcare-11-01510)]. The more risk factors we become aware of, the better we can prevent or control hypertension. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01510)]. This study reminded us that patients with CIU may be considered for the evaluation of masked hypertension. CIU is an intractable skin disease characterized by persistent intense itching, wheals, and/or angioedema lasting for six weeks or longer, as opposed to acute urticaria, which does not have any specific identifiable triggers. The terms \"chronic urticaria,\" \"chronic idiopathic urticaria,\" but \"chronic spontaneous urticaria,\" or CSU, has been most widely used by specialists [ [7](#B7-healthcare-11-01510)], as it emphasizes an endogenous cause and non-inducible nature. Another study reported that hypertension is associated with an extended duration of CSU [ [8](#B8-healthcare-11-01510)]. However, CSU and hypertension, which belong to different medical specialties, have rarely been discussed together in modern medicine. [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01510), [10](#B10-healthcare-11-01510), [11](#B11-healthcare-11-01510)] and Western countries [ [12](#B12-healthcare-11-01510), [13](#B13-healthcare-11-01510), [14](#B14-healthcare-11-01510), [15](#B15-healthcare-11-01510)]. In Taiwan, the National Health Insurance (NHI) program provides coverage for more than 23 million residents. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) services, including acupuncture, have been reimbursed since 1996 [ [16](#B16-healthcare-11-01510)]. The Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) includes demographic, diagnostic, interventional, and long-term follow-up data on more than 99% of the population in Taiwan [ [17](#B17-healthcare-11-01510)]. A study found that 23% of people in Taiwan used acupuncture from 1996 to 2002 [ [9](#B9-healthcare-11-01510)]. Another study revealed that acupuncture was increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011 [ [18](#B18-healthcare-11-01510)]. Acupuncture is often used in combination with Western medications. To determine whether acupuncture could decrease the risk of hypertension in patients with CSU, we used the NHIRD to conduct a population-based cohort study. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Source 2.2. Study Population [Supplementary Materials](#app1-healthcare-11-01510)( [Figure S1](#app1-healthcare-11-01510)). 2.3. Primary Endpoint and Confounding Variables 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Demographic Characteristics of Study Population [Table 1](#healthcare-11-01510-t001)shows the 43,547 patients with CSU receiving acupuncture matched with 43,547 patients with CSU who did not receive acupuncture in this study. The average ages of the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts were 40.1 \u00b1 13.0 years and 40.2 \u00b1 13.2 years, respectively. Approximately 68% of patients with CSU were female. The majority of patients had white-collar occupations and lived in areas of urbanization level 1. The number of patients with diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia did not differ between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). The proportions of patients with CSU, with and without acupuncture, who were on medication were as follows: vs. 65.3%). 3.2. Risk of Hypertension According to Whether the CSU Patients Underwent Acupuncture and Other Covariates [Table 2](#healthcare-11-01510-t002). The results showed that patients treated with acupuncture had a significantly lower risk of hypertension than those in the control group (adjusted HR = 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.55-0.60). The Kaplan-Meier curves in [Figure 1](#healthcare-11-01510-f001)shows a visual picture of the cumulative incidence of hypertension. Patients with comorbidities had a significantly higher risk of hypertension (adjusted HR = 1.15 and 1.51 for type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, respectively, both p < 0.001). In contrast, patients receiving medication had a significantly lower risk of hypertension (adjusted HRs < 1, p < 0.001). Compared to white-collar occupation patients, blue-collar occupation patients had a significantly higher risk of hypertension (adjusted HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.17-1.28, p < 0.001), while other patients had a significantly lower risk of hypertension (adjusted HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.62-0.99). Patients who lived in urbanization level 2 (adjusted HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03-1.46, p = 0.02) and level 3 (adjusted HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.09-1.58, p = 0.004) areas had a greater risk of hypertension than those who lived in urbanization level 4 areas. Moreover, patients with a monthly income lower than NTD 20,000 had a higher risk than those with a monthly income greater than NTD 40,000 (adjusted HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.13-1.79, p = 0.001). 3.3. Risk of Hypertension among Patients with CSU Who Received and Did Not Receive Acupuncture [Table 3](#healthcare-11-01510-t003)shows that regardless of sex, age, comorbidities, and medications, acupuncture users tended to have a lower risk of hypertension than non-acupuncture users (all adjusted HRs < 1, p <0.001). The results showed that patients treated with acupuncture had a significantly lower risk of hypertension than those without acupuncture treatment (adjusted HR = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.55 for female and adjusted HR = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.60 for male). [Table 4](#healthcare-11-01510-t004)shows the SHRs of hypertension in the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts. Patients receiving acupuncture had a lower risk of hypertension than those in the control group (adjusted SHR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.54-0.58) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. 3.4. The Interaction EFFECT of Medication and Acupuncture on Hypertension [Table 5](#healthcare-11-01510-t005)shows that patients who received medications, acupuncture, or combined therapy, tended to have a lower risk of hypertension compared to the nontherapy group. The group taking medications combined with acupuncture showed the lowest risk of hypertension (adjusted HR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.09-0.12, p-value < 0.001). 4. Discussion [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01510)]. Recent studies have reported that systemic hypertension is commonly associated with a procoagulant state [ [19](#B19-healthcare-11-01510)]. Other studies have suggested that the coagulation cascade pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of CSU. A recent study by Yuhki et al. suggested that medications targeting activated coagulation factors and/or complement components may represent new and effective treatments for patients with severe and refractory CSU [ [20](#B20-healthcare-11-01510)]. A double-blind placebo-controlled study by Parslew et al. showed a response of CSU to warfarin [ [21](#B21-healthcare-11-01510)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01510)]. Recent studies have found an association between inflammation markers and hypertension, and a study by Wang et al. found that biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly related to incident hypertension [ [22](#B22-healthcare-11-01510)]. Studies have suggested that inflammation markers such as pentraxin-3 and CRP may be useful for the assessment of CSU disease activity [ [23](#B23-healthcare-11-01510), [24](#B24-healthcare-11-01510)]. [6](#B6-healthcare-11-01510)]. Mathis et al. suggested that the presence of self-antigens and the subsequent activation of the adaptive immune system against them may promote the development of hypertension [ [25](#B25-healthcare-11-01510)]. Several studies have reported that oral cyclosporine and omalizumab are effective in treating patients with CSU, and the results provide further evidence supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune pathogenesis of CSU [ [26](#B26-healthcare-11-01510), [27](#B27-healthcare-11-01510), [28](#B28-healthcare-11-01510)]. [29](#B29-healthcare-11-01510)], suggesting that the improvement of coagulation/fibrinolysis is a possible mechanism; second, the World Health Organization recommends acupuncture for the treatment of 16 types of inflammatory diseases [ [30](#B30-healthcare-11-01510)], and several clinical studies have investigated whether acupuncture could treat inflammatory diseases and decrease CRP levels [ [31](#B31-healthcare-11-01510), [32](#B32-healthcare-11-01510)], suggesting an anti-inflammatory mechanism; and third, a study by Wang et al. suggested that acupuncture therapy has had promising results in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, irritable bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis [ [33](#B33-healthcare-11-01510)]. Another study by Sun Kwang Kim suggested that acupuncture enhances natural killer cell activity and can have dual immunomodulatory effects on either Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions to maintain homeostasis [ an mechanism. [35](#B35-healthcare-11-01510), [36](#B36-healthcare-11-01510), [37](#B37-healthcare-11-01510), [38](#B38-healthcare-11-01510)]. A study by Hamam suggested that physicians treating patients with hypertension should be aware of the role that anxiety and depression play in treatment efficacy and compliance [ [39](#B39-healthcare-11-01510)]. Several studies have revealed that patients with CSU frequently have anxiety and depression, which are probably exacerbated by the symptoms of itching and sleep disturbance [ [40](#B40-healthcare-11-01510), [41](#B41-healthcare-11-01510), [42](#B42-healthcare-11-01510), [43](#B43-healthcare-11-01510)]. Studies have suggested that acupuncture treatment can alleviate anxiety and depression [ [44](#B44-healthcare-11-01510), [45](#B45-healthcare-11-01510), [46](#B46-healthcare-11-01510), [47](#B47-healthcare-11-01510)], which may benefit patients with CSU by decreasing the risk of hypertension. 5.
