According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, allopathic physicians diagnose and care for people who are ill or have been injured; take medical histories, perform physical examinations, conduct diagnostic tests, recommend and provide treatment, and advise patients on their overall health and well-being. There are several different types of physicians that fall into three categories. Primary care physicians are the doctors patients usually visit most frequently; they treat a wide range of illnesses and regularly provide preventive care. Surgeons perform operations to treat diseases and repair injuries. Lastly, specialists have expertise related to specific diseases as well as body parts, organs, and systems. NOTE: Pre-med is not a major or a program, and The University of Tampa does not have a medical school. Pre-med is an interest or path students choose that advisors help guide them on their journey towards applying to medical school. Preparing for Medical School Earn a bachelor's degree Medical school is a graduate program; to become eligible to apply to medical school you need to earn a bachelor's degree and take specific pre-requisites (classes that medical schools require). At UT, students can earn a bachelor's degree and take pre-requisite courses. Then they will need to choose a major as pre-med is not a major or a program at UT. Students who are interested in going to medical school typically major in biology, chemistry, or biochemistry. These majors include most of the required courses for entrance into medical programs and will help prepare students for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). However, other degrees can also prepare students for health professions; thus students are encouraged to major in the field where they excel and should consult the pre-health professions advisor about course work. Basic pre-requisite* (Each medical school has its own set of pre-requisites and suggested courses and students need to research the admission requirements of each school they are intending to apply to.) courses required for medical school: - Biology I (1) and II (2) with labs - General Chemistry I (1) and II (2) with labs - Organic Chemistry I (1) and II (2) with labs - Physics I (1) and II (2) with labs - Biochemistry - Calculus and/or Statistics - Intro to Psychology and Intro to Sociology: these behavioral sciences are needed for the MCAT - Most medical schools prefer students to have additional upper-level biology courses *Each medical school has its own set of pre-requisites and suggested courses and students need to research the admission requirements of each school they are intending to apply to.
