ADHD, where there is excess physical and mental activity, is a Vata imbalance disorder. Read - [Immunity In Ayurveda: Concept, Diet, Herbs, Medicines, Exercise](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2018/09/06/immunity-in-ayurveda/) Vata dosha governs the functions involving movement, activity, thinking process, speech, perceiving the sense objects etc. The things perceived by sense organs should be differentiated between the beneficial or harmful, good or bad and this is possible by proper functioning of [mind](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/09/20/mind-qualities-functions-per-ayurveda/). Dhi (intelligence, power of gaining knowledge), Druti (retention of knowledge) and Smriti (memory) are the normal functions of mind. Coordination of these mind functions determines the behaviour of the person. Mind controls Jnanendriya - the sense organs and Karmendriyas - mainly hands and legs. In ADHD, the child's mind is unable to have good control over these two sets of sense organs, under the influence of aggravated Vata Dosha. Hence, it becomes hyperactive.

Dr JV Hebbar ADHD is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Usually found in children but not uncommon in adults. Here, attention, focus and concentration is less and the child is hyperactive. Does not sit at one place, moving here and there, restless, edgy, forgetful, speaking out of turn, etc. Mind is not calm, there is no rest given to the mind, the mind is engaged with one or the other activities. In a person with lack of focus and concentration, similar observations can be made. Let us discuss some ideal herb qualities required in these conditions. Hotness vs. Coldness Coldness tends to settle you down, coldness - water, is nourishing, calming, soothing. When you are anxious, cold water is more useful to calm you down than hot water. Hotness is stimulating and activating. Probably not the quality needed here, in this case. Brahmi is considered as a coolant by many Ayurvedic masters (though a few consider it as hot). Ashwagandha is hot. Read: [Brahmi (Bacopa Monnieri) Benefits, Dose, Side Effects, Research](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/07/20/brahmi-benefits-dose-side-effects-research/) Heaviness vs. lightness You would need something which is heavy to make the brain well-nourished, to make the mind satiated, so that it can focus on lesser things than moving all around. Brahmi, being coolant, is slightly heavier compared to Ashwagandha. Read: [Ashwagandha Withania somnifera Uses, Dose, Side Effects, Research](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2014/06/22/ashwagandha-withania-somnifera-benefits-dose-side-effects/) Oiliness vs. Dryness You would need oiliness to nourish the brain. As per research, ghee is one of the very ideal lipid mediums to deliver medicinal principles to the brain, as it can cross the blood-brain barrier. So, an herbal ghee medium is ideal to deliver the required medicinal principles to the brain. Brahmi, along with a few other ingredients is made into herbal ghee, called Brahmi Ghritha. In its description, Brahmi Ghritha intelligence Smruti krut - improves memory Read: [Brahmi Ghrita Benefits, Dosage, How To Use, Side Effects](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/02/25/brahmi-ghrita-benefits-dosage-how-to-use-side-effects-ingredients-reference/) Whereas, Ashwagandha ghrita is explained as useful in aphrodisiac therapy, to improve muscle, bone power in children etc. Read: [Brihat Ashwagandha Ghrita Benefits, Dosage, Ingredients ](https://www.ayurmedinfo.com/2012/07/21/brihat-ashwagandha-ghrita-benefits-dosage-ingredients-side-effects/) Medhya = promoting intelligence Brahmi has been attributed with medhya quality by numerous Acharyas, whereas Ashwagandha is not directly explained so, though it is used widely in many psychiatric disorders. Ayushya, Rasayani - Anti-aging, brain tissue rebuilding You would need anti-aging effects profusely filled up in the herb to build back brain better. Brahmi is explained as Ayushya and Rasayani. It is widely used in the treatment of dementia in elders. Ashwagandha, though not directly explained as anti-aging in Samhita textbooks, possesses anti-aging properties as explained by Acharyas of recent centuries. Kapha promoting vs. Kapha decreasing Kapha is a combination of earth and water elements. There is calmness, there is firmness, there is stability, focus and calmness. For the brain to be calm, for the activities to reduce, for the focus to improve, you would want something which nourishes and promotes Kapha Dosha. Brahmi, being a balances Vata and Kapha Doshas. With all this evidence, the verdict is in favor of Brahmi for the treatment of ADHD.

If anxiety, lack of courage, lack of motivation, dull mood, weak body, lack of self confidence etc. are causing one to be hyperactive or lose focus, then Ashwagandha has a definitive role to play.
