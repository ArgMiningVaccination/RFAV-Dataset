In a healthy environment an organism continues to exit in perfect balance and remains in harmony within itself and its environment as long as the current is resonating according to its original design and blueprint. As humans we are multi-dimensional in the way we interact with life experiences. The physical body, our emotions and the thinking process are all influences by our environment and how we interact with family and society in general. As we are normally resilient by nature and busy with modern day consumerism, we often override subtle clues which keeps us updated regarding our physical health, emotional balance and mental state. On average we rarely take the time to think clearly, debrief and give ourselves the opportunity for time out to fully rejuvenate whereby the body and mind can recharge and recalibrate naturally as nature intended. Unprocessed emotional interaction, mental and physical activity often lingers in a loop within the mind and drain our protective electromagnetic energy field leaving us vulnerable. When our energy levels are not regularly rejuvenated, recharged and in harmony with its environment, it has a counterproductive effect upon our entire mind and body. In other words when your energy levels are out of balance and depleted you often feel drained, tired, moody and physically more susceptible to re occurring ailments and psychic attacks etc.. Energy balance and healing is a modality whereby a trained healing practitioner during a session acts as a conduit, a mediator to assist another person in recharging their depleted reserve. During the healing natures life giving vitality is accessed from the universal life reservoir by the mediator and passes on to the receiver whereby it can be used to assist in restoring balanced rejuvenation and healing equilibrium where needed. Throughout history nature's revitalizing life force has being known by many names such as: Akasha, Awen, Chi, Devine energy, Eather, Teoli, Theta, Wod Etc.. Over the centuries within each culture certain individuals and groups have refined techniques to harness this life force and have passed it on to others assisting in healing when needed as well as using natures vitality for themselves to deepen clarity and internal guidance in spiritual pursuit. Which healing modality does the practitioner normally use for the energy balance and healing session? The preferred techniques are: Body balance, Reiki & Spiritual healing. What is the common feedback after a healing session? The experience is normally well received with feedback such as feeling soothing heat coming from the healer's hands that is very relaxing and rejuvenating. It is not uncommon during the healing that the receiver becomes so relaxed that they drift into a comfortable light relaxation sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. Duration and cost of one healing session? The session is normally one hour in duration costing $100. The healing is conducted in a comfortable room and the receiver experiences the healing usually in a lying position on a massage table covered with a blanket or if preferred seated on a comfortable chair.
