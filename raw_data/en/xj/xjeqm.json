Wistar has an exceptional track record of success in the areas of vaccine development as well as immunotherapy. Wistar scientists created the standard-of-care protections against rubella, rabies, and rotavirus, the type 1 attenuated polio strain, the diploid cells lines that allow production of MMR vaccine among other. More than 3 billion children have been protected by Wistar's vaccines. Top Wistar scientists lead the center's efforts, working in collaboration with prominent institutions in the Philadelphia region as well as major research organizations around the country and the world. Research areas include: - VIRUSES, including SARS-CoV-2, Zika, HIV, HPV, MERS, Ebola, Influenza, rabies, and other emerging viral infections - MICROORGANISMS, addressing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Pseudomonas and MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), and protozoan diseases, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis - CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY, for prevention and treatment. The Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center brings together cross disciplinary expertise within the Institute to focus on new immune-based approaches to use humoral and cellular immunity to control or eliminate cancer.
