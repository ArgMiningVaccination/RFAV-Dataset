It is recommended to ask all patients who may be indicated for this test about biotin supplementation. Patients should be cautioned to stop biotin consumption at least 72 hours prior to the collection of a sample. 1 - 2 days Turnaround time is defined as the usual number of days from the date of pickup of a specimen for testing to when the result is released to the ordering provider. In some cases, additional time should be allowed for additional confirmatory or additional reflex tests. Testing schedules may vary.

Room temperature Temperature Period Room temperature 14 days Refrigerated 14 days Frozen 14 days Freeze/thaw cycles Stable x3 Non-EDTA plasma specimen; PST gel-barrier tube; grossly hemolyzed specimens This assay is used to detect total antibodies (IgG and IgM) against Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and may be helpful when assessing HAV immunity. The detection of total antibodies cannot differentiate between vaccination, previously resolved infection, or active infection. If active hepatitis A infection is suspected, HAV IgM testing should be performed. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease of the liver caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV). HAV is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, usually from direct person-to-person contact or consumption of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A is an acute, self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection. HAV IgG antibodies produced in response to vaccination and/or HAV infection persist for life and protect against reinfection. | | This a | | This a.
