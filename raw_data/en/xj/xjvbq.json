They may attract bad luck, cursed, envy, evil eye, or have problems in relationships or money; some may contract entities attachments, possession or other misfortunes. It is a simple yet powerful physical, emotional and spiritual purification process that can rebalance the energy field, by removing or extracting stall and negative energies and replace them with positive vibrations, renewed vigor, and optimism. For millennia's La Limpia, is practiced by the Yachaks-birdmen and women-curanderos, shamans, and healers-to ensure the well being of their communities. It is a multi-component physical and spiritual energy purification system. Limpias are also used to cleanse participants of shamanic ceremonies before entering a ceremonial space to maintain the purity of the sacred space and to rebalance homes and land. Each of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) and tools (Trago-sugarcane rum, eggs, candles, smoke, flowers, herbs, plants, perfume, spears, and stones) used throughout the ceremony carries a spiritual symbolism and scientific reasoning. La Limpia transforms the egg-shaped electromagnetic field -the illuminating body-surrounding our physical body, which gets contaminated by our life's bad energies such as traumas, memories, attachments, connection to ancestors, and other negative energies. It removes anger, curses, envy, bad air, energy attachments, and spirit possession. Hence, it creates a new surge of upbeat, positive energy, which allows for new clarity, better sleep and for true healing to take place. The La Limpia ceremony can be performed indoors or outdoors in nature. The client undresses typically, either wholly or to their comfort level and stands in the middle of the room. Although it can also be done lying or sitting down if one is unable to stand for the duration of the ceremony, the more the body is exposed, the more the shaman is free to use all the elements from his toolbox. The ceremony-as practiced in the Ecuadorian Andes- consists typically of five distinct sections: 1. Diagnostic - Energy gazing, candle, palm, egg and guinea pig reading 2. Negative energy removal -plants, fire, smoke, eggs, feathers, spears 3. Positive energy installation - Agua de Florida, perfumes, flowers, aromatic oils 4. Protection - healing stones, spears 5. Sound harmonizing - bells, cymbals, ukulele, flutes While they are all part of the Ceremony that I've learned from my teachers, some sections can be used on a standalone basis like the Egg Cleansing or the Energy Removal. Different shamans may use different techniques, objects, tools, and ingredients depending on their geographical areas, availability and family traditions, although the principals are similar. The twelve steps of a full La Limpia Ceremony are: 1. Arranging, consecrating and invocating of the Mesa (Altar) The mesa acts as an anchor and is the source of the personal power of the Shaman. On the altar, the shaman arranges his Huchas-those sacred objects, either natural or human-made objects, that contain sacred spirit-energies. The deep connection to those objects amplifies the power of the Shaman. Shamans invoke the help of compassionate and benevolent spirits to assist them in the ceremony. The altar must be treated repeatedly by praying over it, smudge, fed, sprayed upon, decorated with flowers and cleared. 2. The Shaman's Soul Song Healing songs-Icaros-are sung or whistled throughout the ceremony. The chant transports the Shaman into an altered stated of consciousness and helps to focus on the intention of the ceremony. The chants can be either passed down from a teacher, received in a shamanic journey or during by spirits during a vision quest. 3. Diagnostic Reading To realize the client's root causes of his maladies the Shaman use variety of divination techniques like a candle, palm, and egg readings. The Shaman must withhold any judgment or preconceived ideas about the client and become a hollow bone to receive the right guidance to proceed in the healing ceremony. 4. Platica (The Talk Consultation) The consultation allows a meaningful dialogue between the shaman and the client. They create intimate rapport between them and explore cultural beliefs, life experiences, and learn the client's life narrative. 5. Camay -The blowing of Trago To clear negative energy enclosed in the orb or sphere around the client, the Shaman blows Trago-Sugarcane Rum-through his mouth, with concentration and intention, a powerful cloud of mist over the client entire body. The tiny alcohol molecules neutralized the positive ions surrounding the client's body thus creating a more balanced electromagnetic field. 6. Energy Removal By brushing or tapping the client's body with particular dried or green leaves, herbs, feathers, etc. the Shaman removes the residue of bad energy. 7. Fire Through the use of fire, either by Focay-fire blowing-or by smudging with smoke, the Shaman cleans the client's energetic and physical body, to remove negative energies. Smudge removes airborne bacteria and purifies the energy body. 8. Activating the Body's Energy Centers The Shaman choose to activate or deactivate the client's energy centers through specific clock or counter clock circular movements by the Shaman's hand or by using copal, sage, or other incense sticks at the specific blockages points the shaman identify in his reading, on the client's body. 9. Body cleansing with Eggs Eggs are absorbing energy through thousands of pores in their shell. The Shaman either softly rolls or vigorously shakes the eggs all over the client's body. 10. Restoring positive energy First, the Shaman will Camay-blow-Agua de Florida-Flower Water-on the entire person. Then he will use flowers vibrations to restore the specific areas where negative energy has been removed with that positive, harmonious energy. Red (feminine) and white (masculine) carnations and roses are usually used, although yellow (new) beginning and pink (youthfulness) also can be used on special situations. 11. Protective shield with healing stones Healing stones, usually smooth volcanic rocks help to ground the client after the ceremony. They also create a protective energy shield around the person, preparing the client to go back to his life. 12. Sound harmonizing Ringing high pitch bell and small cymbals the shaman play over and around the client. Starting with the crown of the head downward. The vibrations, calm, harmonize and balance the energy field around the client. The entire ceremony can last between 30 to 90min, depending on the consultation time and the complexity of the case. It can also be combined with other variety of Shamanic techniques and tools base on the client reaction, like soul retrieval, de-possession or cord cutting. Each of the twelve sections contains a specific body of knowledge. Take for example the usage of flowers during the La Limpia Ceremony. The color and fragrance of every flower have unique vibrations and frequencies, which can interact with the body's vibrations for healing. The Shaman therefore intentionally has to choose the type and color of flowers used during the ceremony. If the evocation of male energy (ideas, spirituality, upper world) is needed, the Shaman would use white carnations whereas red carnations represent feminine energy (passion, blood, lower world). In most cases, the Shaman use red and white flowers to bring balance between the two energies. Pink and yellow colors also have distinct symbolism. The flowers can be used in two ways during the ceremony - by blowing or tapping. For blowing the plants the Shamans collects a bunch of carnation petals from the altar and chews them. He then fills his mouth with Aqua de Florida and then blows the mixture forcefully over the client's body. Alternatively - especially when the client remained fully clothed - the Shaman can take a bouquet of flowers - either mono-colored or mixed colored - and tap rapidly on the body, starting with the head and then moving down to the feet. Apart from the knowledge required to choose the right ingredients for the Ceremony, some parts also required the learning of specific techniques, like the blowing if Trago. The goal here is to blow out a soft mist with strong force on all sides of the client. Years of training are required until a Shaman can really forcefully blow on the client without spitting larger quantities of liquid at once. In the Andes, the blowing of Trago is also used for fire cleansing. Here, the shaman blows steam of high proof Trago through the flame of a candle in the client's direction. The flames are blown client's front and back body. One can easily imagine why it is important to have a forceful blow when working with fire. Although the La Limpia Ceremony is a highly effective healing tool, it is rarely taught or used in Western Shamanism. One reason for that might be that it strenuous work. It challenges the Shaman to devote a lot of emotional, spiritual and physically energies during the ceremony. The usage of all the described tools, elements and techniques may not keep the working space too immaculate. But those points should not hinder interested healers and Shamanic Practitioners to learn this ancient healing ceremony. Following the Limpia ceremony Traditionally, the Yachaks recommend that following the powerful La Limpia Ceremony it is important (But not mandatory) that you observe these few points to maximize the results of the healing session. I will attempt to list and describe them with some explanations to make it clearer and accessible to western minds. It is not a bad idea to adopt those recommendations to the rest of your life. Rest After la Limpia ceremony, you might feel shifting energies within and outside of your physical and emotional bodies. Some people feel very grounded and joyful, but it could also make you feel tired and sometimes disoriented. That is why you should not schedule any big social activities or interact with other people's energies for that day. Take some time to rest, especially before driving home. Walk for 20 minutes or spend a quiet time in a park to ground yourself, meditate, and process the visions and feelings that aroused throughout the ceremony. No hand shaking Shamans recommend not shake hands on the day of your session to prevent the transfer or absorption of negative or bad energy from others into your cleared body. What can you do instead if you find yourself in a social situation? You can hug, or press on the arms. The palm of our hands is super sensitive instrument. They contain one of the highest concentrations of thousands of sensory nerve endings in our bodies. No shower or bath Washing and removing the energies and essences blown and put on you by the shaman will weaken the healing results and protection that was created around you. Do not take a shower or a bath the same day of the healing session. Wait until the following day. Three days of no sexual release Sometime, we use sexual activity and release as a way to avoid facing our inner difficulties and to be liked. To let our physical, emotional and spiritual energy bodies recover shamans' recommend avoiding any sexual relations or ejaculation-release of sexual life energy-for at least three days following the session. It is not a unique request by shamans; many spiritual traditions and religions forbid or limit those who practice for the same reason. For the next two weeks and beyond: Fire in your Gut. Oxidant in your blood. Because most physical and mental health problems start in our gut we must learn to make our gut less acidic and more alkali (basic). In other word, we need to cool off our digestive system. Our gut is one of the seven 'brains' in our body-or central nervous systems that inform our behavior and emotions. In our gut, we have about 3-4 trillion bacteria and viruses-about 3-4 lb. in weight. In order to avoid increase excess heat in our stomach, which results in fast multiplications of the bad bacteria and viruses' population-which they need to survive on. Cancer cell, and other diseases multiply faster in high temperatures and low-level oxidant blood environment. We need to enrich our blood by increase intake of pure oxidant and at the same time lower the temperatures of our digestive system.
