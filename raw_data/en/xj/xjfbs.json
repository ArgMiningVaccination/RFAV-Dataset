In ancient times, sages would watch animals and humans who got sick, take note of what worked and didn't work in their healing processes, and then experiment with different plant medicine in their own bodies. In the Ayurvedic tradition, this knowledge was collected in the Charaka Samhita, one of Ayurveda's principle texts. This text classifies hundreds of herbs, including which parts of the plant to use and for what, as well how the time of day and season relate to when to harvest and ingest the plant. In modern times, more and more scientific studies are confirming what these ancient seers already knew. We are grateful for the people and systems that kept this wisdom alive throughout the ages, and we are humbled to be a part of the lineage carrying it forward. We honor and appreciate our teacher, Alakananda Ma, and her teacher Dr. Vasant Lad, as well as the other contemporary practitioners who have informed our work, namely Maya Tiwari and Acharya Shunya. These teachers have inspired many of the remedies included in this guide. A final note Medicinal and culinary plants have been a coveted resource for thousands of years, yet exploitation driven by global capitalism has resulted in deeper and deeper inequality among those who produce and those who benefit from these plants. In this guide, we will invite you to think critically about your role in sourcing herbs and working with plant medicine. "}
