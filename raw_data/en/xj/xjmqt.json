TO ARRANGE FOR A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION, PLEASE CONTACT ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AT (800) 274-7767. USC's Pref erred Provider Organization P rogram USC Networ k Provide rs are comprised of two tiers of Pa rticipat ing Providers, Tier 1 a nd Tier 2. Tier 1 consists of Keck Medicine of USC Physicians , Keck Hospital of USC Hills Hospita l. Tier 2 consis ts of all Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer providers in California , partici pating BlueCard \u00ae providers in ot her parts of the United States ( with the exception of vision and dental providers ) and participating Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core providers out side of th e United States. You may also obta in Medic ally Necessary Covered Services from N on-Network (Tier 3) Providers ; however, the rate of Plan payment under your medical expense benefit is much greater for services furnished by USC Netw ork Providers. If your Net work Physician refers you to anot her Phys ician or provider, it i s your responsibility to verify that the Phys ician/provider is also a Participating Network Provider. If the Physician/provider is not a Participating Network Provide r, Benefits wil l be paid a t the out -of-Network rate and you will be responsible for the r emainder of the charges. If you seek treatment at a Network facility (e.g., hospital or outpatient surgery center) and a Non -Network Provider (e.g., a Non -Network Physician, ent, the Non -Network Provider's cl aim will be p aid at 80% of Usual, Customary and Reasonable (UCR) Charges , the Tier 2 deductible will a pply and the Tier 3 annual out -of-pocket maxi mum will apply in accordance with applicable law, exc ept wh ere noted under Covered Services section for speci fic services. You will always be responsible for all billed charges w hich exceed the Usual, Customary and Reasonable (UCR) charge s, in addition to your responsi bility for any applicable C opayments a nd Coinsurance amount s. USC is not responsible for the qua lity and exte nt of care you may receive at any of the Network Hospitals or from any specific Network Provider. The Plan does not assur e that all services will b e available from Tier 1 provi ders and will not extend Tier 1 cove rage to Tier 2 or 3 providers. It is importa nt that you request information on proposed medical treatment directly from the Hospita l and your Physician. Designating a Primary C are Physician ( PCP) While you are not requir ed to de signate a Primary Care Physi cian (PCP), your Tier 1 and Tie r 2 non- speci alty Physician office visit copayments will be reduced by $10 after you do designate o ne. You must have designated a PCP before your visit in order for the $10 reduction in your offic e visit co pay to apply. To de signate a Primary Care Physicia n for you and each of your covered dependents, register at hconline.healthcomp.com /usc. Your PCP de signation must also remain in effec t in order for all future PCP office visits to receive the $10 copay reduction. You may cha nge your PCP designation at any time. Change s made on or before the 15th day of the month will be effective on the first day of th e following month. - 6 - PROVISIONS APPL YING TO THE PLAN \u2014 Continu ed Rate o f Payment Adjustmen t You generally pay lowe r Coin surance and Copayment s when Medically Necessary Cov ered Services are provided by Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers. If you obtain Medically Nec essary Covered Services from N on-Network Providers (Tier 3), the Plan will pay up to 50% of Usua l Customary and Reasona ble (UCR) charges for Physician and an cillary servi ces and you will be responsible for the remainder of the charges. For inpatient Medi cally Necessary Covered Services pro vided by a Non -Network Hospital, you will pay a $600 Copaymen t per admission plus a t least 50% of the charges made by the Hospital, subj ect to the a pplicable out -of-pocket maximum . For Medically Necessary outpatient surgeries provided by a Non- Network Hospital or N on-Network outpat ient facility, the Plan wil l pay up to 50% of Usual Custo mary and Reasonable (UCR) charges, not to exceed a P lan payment of $2,700. You will pay a $600 Copayment, plus the remainder of all charg es made by the Non- Network Hospital or Non -Network outpatient facility. Special Benefit for Cove red Persons Under Age 19 The PPO Plan pays the Tier 1 B enefit s to Tier 2 p roviders , when services are rendered to Covered Persons under age 19. The Deductible The Plan ha s a Calendar Year deducti ble that will apply to Eligible Expenses which do not have a flat dollar copay. You must meet your annual deductible befor e the Plan wi ll pay Benefits. The deductible is waived for Medically Necessary screening and testi ng of COVID -19 Year deductible does a pply ( count toward) to your annual med ical out -of-pocket limit. Individual The ind ividual Calendar Year deductible is the first $1 25 of Eligible Expenses for services provided by Tier 1 providers , $275 with Tier 2 and $600 with T ier 3 providers . Family Each indivi dual deduct ible incurr ed (met) is applied to the family deduc tible. The fa mily deductible does not have to be met before Plan Benefits are paid for a single Co vered Person in a family. The family Calendar Year deductible is met collectively when three or m ore Covered Persons in a famil y have Eligible Expenses where the deductibl e applies (not counting more than the individual deductible for any one person) . Once your family deductible is met, the Plan will pay Benefits for all members in the family, regardl ess of whet her each mem ber has met their individual deductibl e. Deductible Cross Accumulates for Tier 1 and Tier 2 When a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 provi ders are used, the deductible will accumulat e across Tiers 1 and 2 . The deductible for T ier 3 is stand -alone and does not cros s accumulate with Tiers 1 and 2 . - 7 - PROVISIO NS APPLYING TO THE PLAN \u2014 Continued TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 Network Providers (see \"D efinitions - Tier 1\") (includes Tier 2 Providers for Covered P ersons < 19 years of age) Anthem Bl ue Cross Pr udent Buyer /BlueCar D eductible or more persons) $825 $1,800 Note: The individual deductible for Covered Pers ons less than 19 years of age is $1 25 for Co vered Se rvices rendered by bot h Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers. Therefor e, if a famil y is comprised of one adult and two children under age 19, all of whom seek services o nly from Tier 2 providers, the annual family deductible will be $525 ($275 for the adult + $125 for each ch ild = $ 525). Carryo ver of Expenses Year-to -Year There is no car ryover of expense from one year to another. Limits on Benefits start anew each Januar y 1. Out-Of-Pocket Limits The USC PPO Plan li mits your expense s each year. Once a Covered Person has met the out-of-pocket maxim um(s) in one Calendar Year, th e percentage c overed by the PPO Plan increases for that year . If you receive all of your care through Tier 1 providers, your annual medical out-of-pocket maximum will be $1, 500 per person or a ma ximum of th ree individ uals wit hin a family ($1,500 x 3 people ). If you rec eive your care from Tier 2 providers ( Anthem Blue Cross Prudent Buyer , BlueCard\u00ae and/or Blue Cross Blue Shield Global \u00ae Core progra m providers ), you r annual medical out-of-pocket maxi mum will be $2,500 per person or a maximum of three individua ls within a f amily ($ 2,500 x 3 people). If you receive your care from Non-Network Providers (Tier 3) your annual medical out of pocket maximum will be $12,500 per person or $ 37,500 within a family ($12,5 00 x 3 people ) and the n the rate of payment for Eligi ble Expenses w ill be increased to 100% of UCR . Once you have reached the Tier 3 medical out of pocket maximum, you will still be respo nsible f or any amount over 100% of UCR. In other words, you r emain respo nsible for all char ges in excess of UCR even after you reac h tho se out -of-pocket maximums. Medical o ut-of-pocket limits are cumulative per person and transferable between Tiers 1 and 2. For example, if yo u accumulate $500 towards your T ier 1 me dical out-of-pocket li mit, that $500 will also be considered a s applying towards your Tier 2 medical out-of-pocket limit. If you accumulate $2,000 towards your Tier 2 medical out-of- pocket limit, your Tie r 1 medical out-of-pocket limit will be sati sfied an d the $2,000 would als o apply t o your Tier 2 limit. The out -of-pocket presc ription Copay/ Coinsurance maximums for the Plan are $4,850 maximum for an individual and $7,200 maximum for a Family (2 o r more p ersons). This is a separate out -of-pocket maximum from the Plan' s medical out -of-pocket maximum in a Calendar Year . This means that after a single person meets the prescription out - of-pocket maximum of $4, 850 in a Calendar Year, he/she will be cove red at 1 00% for covered pr escriptions filled at Network phar macies for t he remaind er of the Calendar Year. For an employee covering one or more dependents, when the covered persons cumulatively reach the $ 7,200 prescrip tion out -of-pocket maxim um, all cover ed membe rs of the F amily w ill be covered at 100% for cove red prescriptio ns filled a t Networ k pharmacies for the remainder of the Calend ar Year. This does not imply coverage in excess of limits expressed elsewhere. - 8 - PRO VISIONS APPLYING TO THE PLAN \u2014 Contin ued TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 Network Providers (see \"Definitio ns - Tier 1 \") (includ es Tier 2 Providers for Covered Persons < 19 years of age) Anthem Blue Cr oss Prudent Buyer/BlueCard\u00ae Providers Non-Network Providers Med ical Out-of- Pocket Limits (Per Calen dar Year ) $1,500/person (m aximum of 3 individuals wi thin a There cov erage inc reases to 100% $2,500/person (m aximum of 3 individuals within a family) Thereafter, coverage increases to 100% $12,500/person (m aximum of 3 individuals within a family) Ther eafter, coverage i ncreases to 100% of UCR.

When you submit a claim , please comp lete the follow ing steps: Complete the \"Patie nt and Employee Information\" s ectio n of the claim fo rm.

If any Benefits are pa yable to your estate or to a person not competent to give valid rele ase, the Plan may pay up to $1,000 t o any person related to you or to your benefici ary whom it deems t o be entitled; USC will then be di scharged to the extent of the p ayment due. - 65 - HOW TO USE THE PLAN \u2014 Continued What to Expect Each time a bill is submitted to Heal thCo mp by either the pa tient or the provider of servi ces, an explana tion of benefits (EOB) is s ent to the insured . If payment is ass igned to the provider of ser vice, then an E OB is sent to the provider as wel l. If you obtain care from a USC Network Provide r (Tier 1 or 2), please wait f or th e EOB before you p ay the pro vider . You an d the Pla n are ent itled to special di scounts which wi ll be indica ted on the EOB. The EOB describes how He althComp adjudicated the cl aim. It indicates the names of the insure d, pati ent, and provider as we ll as t he de tails of the charge and the payme nt calcu lation. I t will li st the billed amoun t, allowed amoun t (either co ntract rate or UCR) , Copay amount, % Ben efit (percentage paid by th e Plan), Plan payment and patient responsibility (Copayme nt and Coinsur ance co mbine d). The EOB will indi cate to whom payment was made. If the bill indicates that the patient has assigned Be nefits, then the ch eck will be iss ued to the provider. Sometimes yo u will receive two or more bills for the same tr ansaction from different provi ders. This is particula rly true f or lab and x- ray servi ces. For outpatient lab and X -ray charges, y ou will ofte n be charged both a facility charg e (a bill from the Hospital, imag ing center or lab wher e the test/X -ray wa s perfo rmed ) and a bill from the Phy sician who read the X -ray or inter prete d the la b results. When you have surgery, there will often be a bill from the facility, the surgeon, the as sistan t surgeon (if one was prese nt) and the anesthesio logis t. You can exp ect to receive E OBs for each o ne of t he bi lls. If you have a ny questions af ter you receive y our EOB o r if you do not rec eive the EOB in a timely fashio n, you may call the customer se rvice representative at HealthCom p at (855) SC -PLANS (8 55-727-5267). - 66 - GENERAL INFORMATION Coord ination Of Benefits Our Plan contains the provision s for coordinating with oth er similar health plans when Covered Persons are covered by mor e than one plan. This allows com bining coverage to bene fit the Covered Per son, but not to permit reimbur sement s to be made which would exceed th e actual Eligible Expe nses incu rred. For instance , if you are cove red under tw o plans because you r spouse lists you as a dependent under a group plan where he/she is e mplo yed, this will apply. If both, husband and wi fe are cove red under the USC P lan as emp loyees, each may be c onsidered an eligible depend ent of the other except that bot h may not enroll in the USC PPO Plan and be covered as employee s and dependents at the same time. When a claim is ma de, the primary plan pays its ben efits without re gard to any ot her plan. A secon dary plan adjusts its benefi ts to pay the bal ance of the remaining Eligible Expenses, if an y, up to its maximum responsibil ity as set forth in thi s booklet . No plan pays m ore than it would with out the c oordination provision. Example: Primary Plan ( other th an the USC PPO Plan) has a m aximum allowable charge of $1 ,000 with 20% coins urance for the service in question, so the Prim ary Plan pays $800 for that service, leavi ng the cove red person with a liabilit y of $200. The USC PPO Plan is th e seco ndary plan for t hat servi ce and the maximum allowable rate for that ser vice under the U SC PPO Plan is also $1,000. Therefore, for this service the USC PPO Plan w ill reimburse the covered person in t he amount of $200. All applicable Copayme nts and Coinsur ance will remain the Co vered Person's resp onsibility. When the Benefit payable under the primary plan is reduced or denied as a result o f the Covered Person's fail ure to comply w ith th e provisi ons of the primary pl an (e.g. prior authoriza tion, seco nd surgi cal o pinion, etc. ) the USC PPO Plan will n ot consider such non-payment s or penalties to b e Eligible Expe nses and will not cover such pen alties or non-payments by t he primary plan . Exam ple: Prim ary pla n requires p rior au thorization for Medica lly Nec essary o utpatient ent fails to obtain prior authoriza tion. Primar y plan would have paid 80% of a con tracted rate of $1,000 or $800 with prior authorization. W ithout it, primary pl an pays only 50% of the cont racted rate or $500. The 30% or $300 differe nce is a penalty assesse d by the primary p lan for failure to comply with its requirements. P rovider is a lso a participating provider under the USC PPO Plan with th e same contract rate. USC PPO Plan will subtract an y penalty from the remai ning balance after prim ary plan paym ent, and pay up to its c ontractual amoun t. $1,000 Contr act rate of prim ary plan and US C PPO - $500 Only 50% of contra ct rate (penalty for non- authorization) $500 Re maining b alance - $300 Penal ty asse ssed by primary pla n (paid by the pat ient) $200 maxi mum th at USC PPO pays as sec ondary plan Any health pl an that does not contain a Coordin ation of Benefits provision will be considered primary.

In addition, the Covered Pe rson will do nothing to prejudice the Plan's ri ght to Subrogation and Reimbursement and acknowledges that the Pl an precludes operat ion of the ma de-whole and common -fund doctrines. The Plan Adm inistrator has maximum disc retion to int erpret the terms of this prov ision and to make c hanges, as it deems necessary. Any amounts recovered will b e subject to Subr ogati on or R eimbursement. In no case will th e amount subject to Subrogation or Reimbursement exceed th e amount of medic al or othe r Benefits pa id for the inj uries or illness under the Plan an d the expense s incur red by the P lan in collecting this amount. The Plan has a rig ht to recover in full, out of any Recovery without reduction for attorneys' f ees, costs, c omparative neg ligence, l imits of coll ectability or responsibility, or other wise, even if the Cover ed Perso n does not receive full comp ensation for all of hi s charg es and expenses. \"Covered Person \" means a nyone covered under the Plan, including minor D ependents. \"Another Party\" sh all mean any individual or organ ization, other than the Plan, who is liabl e or le gally respons ible (or who is alleged or claimed to be liab le or legally responsi ble) to pa y expenses , compensation or dama ges in connection with a C overed Person's i njuries or illness. \"Another Party\" s hall incl ude the party o r parties who caused th e injur ies or illne ss (or are allege d or claimed to h ave caused t he injuries or illn ess); the ins urer, guarantor or other indemni fier of the part y or parti es who caused the injuries or illness; a Covered Perso n's o wn insurer, such as uninsured , underinsure d, medi cal payments , no-fault, - 69 - GEN ERAL INFORMATION \u2014 Continued homeowner's, renter 's or any othe r liability insurer; a workers' compensation in surer ; and any other indivi dual or organization that is liable o r legally responsible (or is alleg ed or claimed to be l iable or le gally responsible ) for payment in conne ction w ith the injuries or illness. \"Recover y\" shall mean the specific fund of any and all monies paid to the Cove red Person by way of judgment, settlem ent or o therwise (no ma tter how t hose monies m ay be c haracterized , designated or alloc ated) to comp ensat e for a ny losses caused by , or in conne ction with, the injuries or illn ess.

If the Covere d Person retains an attorney, that attorney mus t sign th e Subrogati on and Reimbursem ent Agre ement as a condi tion to an y payment of Benefi ts and as a condition to any p ayme nt of future Benef its for other illnesses or injuries. A dditionally, the Covered Person' s attorney must recognize and consent to the fact tha t the Plan precludes the ope ration o f the \"made -whol e\" and \"co mmon fund\" do ctrine s, torney must agree not to assert ei ther doctrin e in his pursuit of Recovery. The Plan will neither pay the Covered Person's at torneys' f ees and costs associated wi th the reco very of funds, no r reduce its reimbur seme nt pro rat a for the pay ment o f the Covered Person's attorne ys' fees and cost s. At torneys ' fees will be paya ble from the Recovery only after the Plan ha s received full Reimbursem ent. A Covered Per son or hi s attorney who receives any R ecovery (whether by judgment, set tleme nt, compromise , or otherwis e) has an absolut e obligation to i mmedi ately t ende r the Recovery to the Plan under the terms of this provision. Furthermore, a Covered Person agrees to d irect his or her attorney who receive s any Re covery (whet her by judgmen t, settlement, comp romise, or ot herwise) that he or she has an absolute obliga tion to immediately tender the Recovery to the Plan under the t erms of this pro vision. A Covered Person or his attor ney who rec eives any such Recovery a nd does not imme diately te nder the Reco very t o the Plan wi ll be deemed to h old the Recovery in construct ive trust for the P lan, because the Covered Person or his attor ney is not the r ightful ow ner of the Recover y and sho uld no t be in possession of the Reco very until t he Plan has be en fully reim bursed out of the R ecovery. These pr ovisions apply to the parents , trustee, guardian or other re presentative of a minor Covered Person and to th e heir or personal represent ative of the estate of a deceased Cov ered Per son, regardl ess of applica ble law and w hether or not the m inor's representative has access o r con trol of the Recovery. When a Covered P erson does not comply with the provisions of thi s section, the Plan Administra tor sha ll have the authority, in it s sole d iscretion, t o deny payment of any claim s for Benefits by t he Covered Person and to deny or reduce future Benefits payable ( including pa yment of future Benefits for other injuries or i llnesses) under the Plan by the amoun t due as Re imbursement to the Plan. T he Plan Adm inistrator may also, in its sole di scretion, d eny or reduce future Benefits (includin g futur e Benefits for othe r injuries o r illnesses) under any other group benefits plan maintaine d by the Plan Sponso r. The red uctions will equal the am ount of t he required Reimbursement . If the Plan must bring an acti on against a Cove red Person to enf orce this pr ovision, then that Covered Person agrees to pay the Plan's atto rneys' fees and costs, reg ardless of the act ion's out come. In ce rtain circumstanc es, a Co vered Person may receive a Reco very tha t incl udes amounts intended to be compen sation for pa st an d futur e expenses for trea tment of the illness or injury, which is the cause of the Recovery. This Plan will not c over any expe nses fo r which compensat ion was pr ovided thr ough a previou s Recovery. T his exclusion will a pply to the full extent of such R ecovery or t he amount of the expenses submi tted to the Plan for payment, wh ichever is less. The Plan also precludes ope ration of the made-whole and common -fund doct rines in applyin g this pro visio n. It is the responsibility of the Covered P erson to inform t he Pl an Admi nistrator when expe nses are incur red related to an illness or i njury for which a Recovery has been made. Th e Covered Person is required to submi t full a nd complete docu mentation o f any such R ecovery in order for the Plan to con sider eligible ex penses tha t exc eed the Recovery . - 70 - GENERAL IN FOR MATION \u2014 Continued Medicare Pro gram Benefici aries who are covered under Me dicare will be subj ect to coordination of B enefits with the USC PPO Plan assuming primar y payor status to the extent required by appli cable law.

Q. What is the difference between a Copayment and C oinsur ance? A. A Copayment is a fixed d ollar amount, li ke $ 200.00 for an Emerg ency Ro om visit. Coinsurance is a percen tage of the cost of t he visit, such as a 10% co- insurance for an x- ray or lab test d one at the Ke ck Hospital of USC . 2. Q. I was treated by a provider wh o agr eed to accept \"what ever my insuranc e covers\" as payment in full and not bill me for my Coinsurance . Why is the Plan ref using to pay for my treatme nt? A. Under the terms of the USC PPO Plan you ha ve a legal obl igation t o pay you r Coinsura nce o r Copayme nt.

This me ans that if a provide r releases yo u from your oblig ation to pay the applicable Copay ment and/or Coins urance am ounts, the Plan will not pay any a mount for any Covered Service fro m that provider r elated to those w aived Copaym ent or Coinsurance amo unts. Howev er, if a pr ovider rel eases you fro m the a mounts you must pay in excess of the lifeti me limits for infertility B enefits, that rele ase will not affect the Plan' s payment for those Benefits up to those limits. 3. Q. Where ca n I go to get 100% coverage for medical se rvices? A. There is no provider or faci lity that the Pla n autom atically or ne cessarily cover s at 100% .

In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible. What is \"balance billing\" ( sometimes cal led \" surpris e billing\")? When you see a doctor or ot her health care provi der, you ma y owe certain out -of-pocket costs, like a copayment, coinsurance, o r deductible. You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bil l if you see a provider or visit a health care facil ity that isn't in your hea lth pla n's network. \"Out -of-netw ork\" means providers and facilities that haven't sig ned a contract with your health plan to provide services. Out -of-network providers may be allowe d to bill you for the difference between what your plan pay s and the full amount ch arged for a service. This is called \" balance billing \". This amount is likely more than in -network costs for the same service and m ay not count toward your pla n's deduc tible or annual out-of-pocket limit. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected bala nce bill. This can happen when you don't have control over who is involved in your care \u2014like when you have an emergency or when you sche dule a visit at an in-network facility but are unexpectedly treated by an out -of-network provi der. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service. You are protected fro m balance billing for: Emergency services If you have an em ergency medical condition and receive emergency services from an ou t-of-network provider or facility, the most the y can bill you is your plan's in- network cost -sharing amoun tibles). An out -of-network r cannot balance bill you for these emerg ency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condi tion, unless you give written c onsent and give up your pr otections not to be balanced bil led for these pos t-stabilizat ion services. Cert ain services at an in -network hospital or ambulatory surgica l center When you receive services from an in -network hospit al or ambulatory surgical c enter, certain providers t here may be out-of-network. In t hese cases, the most those providers can bill y ou is your plan's in- network cost -sharing amount. This applies t o emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, labo ratory, neonatology, assist ant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services. These p roviders cannot balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed. If you recei ve other types of services at these in -network facil ities, out -of- network provide rs cannot balance bill yo u, unless you give written conse nt and give up your prote ctions. You are never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You are also not required to get out-of- network care . You can ch oose a provider or fa cility in your plan's netw ork. When balance billing is not allowed, you also have th e following protect ions: You are only responsible for paying your share of the cost ( such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was in- network). Your health plan will pay any additional c osts to out- of-network provide rs and facili ties directly. Your health plan generally must: Cover emergency services without requiring you to get appro val for services in advance ( also know n as \"prior authorization\" ). Cover emergency services b y out -of-netw ork provider s. Base what you ow e the provider or facility (cost -shari ng) on what it would pay an in- network provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits . Count any amount you pay for emergency services and certain out-of-network provide r services perform ed at an in- network hospital or ambula tory surgical center toward any in-network deductible and out of pocket .

There are still some benefits of using in-network providers and facilities whenever reasonably possible and medically a ppropriat e. For example, if you intend on voluntarily seeing a network provider after stabilizatio n of your em ergency for that c ondition, in some cases it may be a sm oother transition if the emergency care was also provided by an in-network provider or fa cility.
