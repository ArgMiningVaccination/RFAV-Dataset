AN ONLINE COMMUNITY SURVEY OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2017 AND FEBRUARY 2018. THE SURVEY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH RISK AND BEHAVIORS, PREVENTATIVE HEALTH PRACTICES, AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CHRONIC DISEASE AND INJURY. A TOTAL OF 1,741 RESIDENT SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED, REPRESENTING THE GEOGRAPHICAL, GENDER, AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY.

Return Reference - Identifier Explanation SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - HOW HOSPITAL FACILITY IS ADDRESSING NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN CHNAFACILITY NAME: HARFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, INC. DESCRIPTION: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UPPER CHESAPEAKE HEALTH (UM UCH) HAVE PRIORITIZED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONCERNS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, AND FAMILY HEALTH AND RESILIENCY. KEY FINDINGS REGARDING THE PRIORITIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, AND FAMILY HEALTH AND RESILIENCY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (MENTAL HEALTH/ADDICTIONS): THE SUICIDE RATE OF A COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE A KEY INDICATOR OF ITS MENTAL HEALTH STATUS. HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE OF 12.3 PER 100,000 POPULATION FAR EXCEEDS THE 9.2 RATE FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS) FOR 2013-2015, 21% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, COMPARED TO 16.1% FOR THE STATE. IN ADDITION, 18.2% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. WHILE APPROXIMATELY 96% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE INSURED, THERE IS A NOTABLE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS. AS SUCH, THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICE ADMINISTRATION HAS DESIGNATED ALL OF HARFORD COUNTY AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SINCE 2007, THE NUMBER OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL RELATED INTOXICATION DEATHS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN BOTH MARYLAND AND HARFORD COUNTY. THE NUMBERS OF DRUG RELATED LAW ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS AND OVERDOSE CALLS HAVE ALSO INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 2011, BY 57% AND 95% RESPECTIVELY. ANOTHER INDICATOR OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ADDICTION PROBLEM IN HARFORD COUNTY IS THE NUMBER OF SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORNS (SEN) BORN IN THE COMMUNITY. BETWEEN 2000 AND 2016, HARFORD COUNTY HAS EXPERIENCED AN EIGHT-FOLD INCREASE IN THE RATE OF HOSPITAL ENCOUNTERS FOR NEWBORNS WITH MATERNAL DRUG/ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. THIS NOT ONLY INDICATES AN INCREASE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE, BUT ALSO A LACK OF TREATMENT ACCESS. IN RESPONSE TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN: *OPEN OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC *OPEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH URGENT CARE CENTER *OPEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEDS *WELLNESS ACTION TEAMS OF CECIL AND HARFORD COUNTY (WATCH PROGRAM) TO SCREEN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MAKE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS. *DEVELOP CLINICAL PATHWAYS FOR PATIENTS ENTERING CRISIS CENTER *PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORT GROUPS AND CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASSES *PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INTERNAL TEAM AND ASHLEY ADDICTION TREATMENT ON LATERAL VIOLENCE (ABUSE IN WORKPLACE BY ONE EMPLOYEE TO ANOTHER, IT INCLUDES BOTH OVERT AND COVERT ACTS OF VERBAL AND NON-VERBAL AGGRESSION). *PROVIDE EDUCATION ON CO-OCCURRING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH/SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. *PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL CLASSES SPECIFIC TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID, QUESTION, PERSUADE, REFER (QPR) *WORK WITH THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE AS PART OF THEIR CRISIS INTERVENTION AND CRISIS NEGOTIATION TEAMS. *PARTICIPATE ON THE SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORN (SEN) TASKFORCE TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO LINK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TO TREATMENT. *PROVIDE DEPRESSION SCREENINGS (PHQ-9) AT CERTAIN HEALTH EVENTS. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS: AS A WHOLE, HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A BETTER FOOD ENVIRONMENT AND GREATER ACCESS TO EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. DESPITE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN HEALTHY BEHAVIORS REGARDING NUTRITION AND EXERCISE, HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS ARE JUST AS LIKELY OR MORE LIKELY TO BE OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT (72.4%) AND PHYSICALLY INACTIVE (26.3%) AS THE REST OF THE STATE. IN ADDITION, TOBACCO USE IS HIGH AMONG BOTH ADULTS (20.7%) AND YOUTH (16.9%) WHICH CORRELATES WITH HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) AND LUNG CANCER. EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE HIGH RATE OF STUDENTS REPORTING THEY CURRENTLY USE ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS (24.6%), AND THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS (32.1%) USING ANY TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCT (BURNED, SMOKELESS, OR ELECTRONIC). OBESITY, INSUFFICIENT PHYSICAL EXERCISE, AND TOBACCO USE ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES AND INCREASED RISK FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBESITY, OFTEN A SYMPTOM OF DIET AND EXERCISE, CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING. BLACK ADULTS WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN WHITE ADULTS, AND ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATE COUNTERPARTS. AS SUCH, MINORITY AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. THE TOP FIVE CAUSES OF DEATH IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, STROKE, AND ACCIDENTS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE AND THE NATION. THE ROLE OF ACCIDENTS AS THE FIFTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON THAT COULD LIKELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWING OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES, AS WELL AS AN AGING POPULATION. IN RESPONSE TO CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN: GENERAL: *WATCH PROGRAM TO PROVIDE PSYCHO/SOCIAL AND CLINICAL SUPPORT FOR HIGH UTILIZER MEDICARE PATIENTS POST DISCHARGE AND VIA REFERRAL. *COMPREHENSIVE CARE CENTER (CCC): TRANSITION NURSE NAVIGATION AND SOCIAL WORKER - TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE THROUGH EDUCATION, DISEASE MANAGEMENT, MEDICATION AND SYMPTOM REVIEW, AND COORDINATE CARE WITH APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES INCLUDING ARRANGEMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.

FAMILY HEALTH AND RESILIENCY: WHILE THE MAJORITY OF BABIES IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE BORN INTO MARRIED FAMILIES (69.4%) TO MOTHERS OVER THE AGE OF 20 (96.5%), THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ETHNIC AND RACIAL DISPARITIES. MOST CONCERNING IS THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES BORN TO BLACK WOMEN (12.1%) AS COMPARED TO WHITE (7.6%), AND THE 2.5 TIMES HIGHER RATE OF INFANT MORTALITY FOR BLACK BABIES (14.4 PER 1,000 BIRTHS) AS COMPARED TO WHITE (4.8 PER 1,000 BIRTHS). THE PERCENTAGE OF MOTHERS RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER IN HARFORD COUNTY IS 71.%, HOWEVER WHEN BROKEN DOWN ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES THE PERCENTAGE OF NON-WHITE MOTHERS RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. ACCORDING TO 2016 MARYLAND VITAL STATISTICS, 74.8% OF WHITE WOMEN RECEIVED PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER, WHILE ONLY 59.7% OF BLACK WOMEN AND 60.3% OF HISPANIC WOMEN DID. THE LACK OF PRENATAL CARE AND THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR NEWBORNS CAN HAVE LONG LASTING DETRIMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS, INCLUDING SCHOOL READINESS AND LONG-TERM HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. WHILE HARFORD COUNTY'S VIOLENT CRIME AND PROPERTY CRIME RATE ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THE STATE RATE, CRIME AND THE RESULTING INCARCERATION DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECT LOW-INCOME AREAS.

THE HEALTH SERVICES COST REVIEW COMMISSION, (HSCRC) DETERMINES PAYMENT THROUGH A RATE SETTING PROCESS AND ALL PAYORS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL PAYORS, PAY THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THE SAME SERVICES DELIVERED AT THE SAME HOSPITAL. MARYLAND'S UNIQUE ALL PAYOR SYSTEM INCLUDES A METHOD FOR REFERENCING UNCOMPENSATED CARE IN EACH PAYORS RATES, WHICH DOES NOT ENABLE MARYLAND HOSPITALS TO BREAKOUT ANY OFFSETTING REVENUE RELATED TO UNCOMPENSATED CARE.

HEALTHY HARFORD'S MISSION IS TO INSPIRE AND EMPOWER HEALTHY PEOPLE, HEALTHY FAMILIES, AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IN MIND, BODY, AND SPIRIT, WITH A FOCUS OF IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELLNESS IN THE HARFORD COUNTY REGION BY PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, BUILDING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, AND PROVING CARE COORDINATION. THE HARFORD COUNTY LOCAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COALITION (LHIC) - JOINTLY LED BY THE HARFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND UMUCH. THIS COALITION BRINGS TOGETHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COMMUNITY EVERY OCTOBER TO EXAMINE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND DETERMINE A PLAN FOR MOVING FORWARD. PRIMARY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES FOR THIS COALITION INCLUDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION & WELLNESS AND FAMILY HEALTH & RESILIENCY.

AT THAT TIME, THE HSCRC APPROVED RATES APPLIED ONLY TO COMMERCIAL INSURERS. IN 1977, THE HSCRC NEGOTIATED A WAIVER FROM MEDICARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RULES FOR MARYLAND HOSPITALS TO BRING THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PAYMENTS UNDER HSCRC CONTROL. IN 2014, MARYLAND'S WAIVER WITH MEDICARE WAS RENEGOTIATED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. UNDER THIS NEW WAIVER, SEVERAL CRITERIA WERE ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SYSTEM IN CONTROLLING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WAIVER ITSELF: 1. REVENUE GROWTH PER CAPITA 2. MEDICARE HOSPITAL REVENUE PER BENEFICIARY 3. MEDICARE ALL PROVIDER REVENUE GROWTH PER BENEFICIARY 4. MEDICARE READMISSION RATES 5.

REVENUE IS REDUCED FOR ANTICIPATED DISCOUNTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS AND FOR CHARITY CARE. AN ESTIMATED PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BASED UPON ANTICIPATED UNCOMPENSATED CARE, AND IS ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING HISTORICAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY PAYOR CATEGORY. THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW ARE THEN USED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS AND TO ESTABLISH AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. AFTER COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM INSURERS, THE CORPORATION FOLLOWS INTERNAL GUIDELINES FOR PLACING CERTAIN PAST DUE BALANCES WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE CORPORATION ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS, ALLOWANCE FOR CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, AND CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS OR WITH BALANCES REMAINING AFTER THE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE HAD ALREADY PAID, THE CORPORATION RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS HISTOICAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ULTIMATELY DO NOT PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNTED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.

A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION, INCLUDING MAPS AND DATA TABLES, CAN BE FOUND IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AVAILABLE AT: HTTPS://WWW.UMMS.ORG/UCH/COMMUNITY/ASSESSMENT- AND-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN IN 2017, THE TOTAL POPULATION OF HARFORD COUNTY WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 250,132, WHICH WAS AN INCREASE OF 2.16% FROM 2010 (244,826). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE, WITH THE TOWNS AND CITIES OF VARYING SIZES, WEALTH, AND DIVERSITY. BEL AIR IS HARFORD'S COUNTY SEAT, HOME TO ROUGHLY 10,139 RESIDENTS, OR 4% OF THE COUNTY'S POPULATION. THE CITIES OF ABERDEEN AND HAVRE DE GRACE EACH MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY 9% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING 80% OF THE COUNTY'S POPULATION IS MOSTLY DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE ROUTE 40 CORRIDOR AND IN RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTY. THE MEDIAN AGE IN HARFORD COUNTY IS 40.6 OVERALL, WITH THE AGE CATEGORY CONTAINING THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION BEING ADULTS AGES 50-54. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION IS CLOSE TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGE AND SEX IN THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH THE COUNTY HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER PERCENTAGE OF YOUNGER PEOPLE AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN THE LEVELS OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY ACROSS HARFORD COUNTY. WHILE WHITES MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF HARFORD COUNTY'S POPULATION, THE PERCENTAGES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HISPANIC/LATINO RESIDENTS ARE INCREASING IN BOTH EDGEWOOD AND ABERDEEN. SINCE 2010, THE POPULATIONS OF THESE TWO ZIP CODES HAVE STARTED TO MORE CLOSELY REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS FOUND ACROSS THE STATE OF MARYLAND, WHILE THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF HAVRE DE GRACE HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER TIME. SEVEN PERCENT OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORTED SPEAKING A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. WHEN COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, MARYLAND IS A WEALTHY STATE, WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME ($78,916), WELL ABOVE THE NATION'S ($61,372). HARFORD COUNTY IS ONE OF MARYLAND'S WEALTHIER JURISDICTIONS, WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $83,445. HOWEVER, THE COUNTY'S HIGHER INCOME IS NOT DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTY: THE THREE MUNICIPALITIES IN HARFORD COUNTY HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT MEDIAN INCOMES, WITH THE CITY OF ABERDEEN HAVING THE LOWEST ($60,489), FOLLOWED BY HAVRE DE GRACE ($76,416) AND BEL AIR ($85,798) (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2017 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). PERCENTAGES PROVIDED IN THE 2008-2010 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, 3-YEAR ESTIMATES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) INDICATE THAT THE POVERTY RATE IN HARFORD COUNTY FAMILIES HAS INCREASED, CLIMBING FROM 4% TO 5.4%, IN LINE WITH AN INCREASE IN MARYLAND'S POVERTY RATE (5.7% TO THE RECENT ESTIMATE OF 6.6%) (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2017 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). HARFORD COUNTY POVERTY RATES FOR WHITE AND BLACK FAMILIES ARE STARKLY DIFFERENT: THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES WITH A HOUSEHOLDER WHO IS WHITE HAS AN ESTIMATED POVERTY LEVEL OF 5.1% WHILE FAMILIES WITH A BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDER HAS A POVERTY LEVEL OF 14.3% (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, 2011-2015 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES). THE DISPARITY IN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THE CITIES OF ABERDEEN AND HAVRE DE GRACE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. BOTH IN MARYLAND AND IN HARFORD COUNTY, POVERTY RATES ARE HIGHEST IN FAMILIES HEADED BY A FEMALE AND FOR FAMILIES WITH RELATED CHILDREN UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE. HARFORD COUNTY HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER POVERTY RATE AMONG FAMILIES WITH A FEMALE HEAD WHEN COMPARED TO MARYLAND, AND A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE FOR PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER. POVERTY RATES FOR FAMILIES ARE DISTRIBUTED UNEQUALLY ACROSS THE COUNTY, WITH ALMOST A THIRD OF FAMILIES WITH A FEMALE HEAD AND CLOSE TO ONE QUARTER OF RELATED CHILDREN BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL IN ABERDEEN. THE POVERTY RATES IN HARFORD COUNTY ARE REFLECTED IN THE PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS, WITH ABERDEEN HAVING THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF FAMILIES AND THE TOWN OF BEL AIR HAVING THE LOWEST. THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS IN HARFORD COUNTY RECEIVING FOOD STAMPS HAS INCREASED BY 3% SINCE THE 2008-2010 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY; 3-YEAR ESTIMATES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) REPORTED THAT 5% OF HARFORD COUNTY HOUSEHOLDS WERE FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN THE POVERTY LEVEL IN THE COUNTY. HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS 54 SCHOOLS, INCLUDING SEVEN TITLE I ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR AT-RISK STUDENTS ATTENDING SCHOOLS IN HIGH POVERTY AREAS. ALL SEVEN ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY: THREE IN ABERDEEN, AND ONE EACH IN EDGEWOOD, HAVRE DE GRACE, JOPPA, AND ABINGDON (HTTP://WWW.HCPS.ORG/SCHOOLS/). HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAD A TOTAL OF 37,780 STUDENTS IN THE 2017-2018 SCHOOL YEAR. THE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE WAS 88.94%, SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 87.12% (HTTP://REPORTCARD.MSDE.MARYLAND.GOV/). ACCORDING TO SCHOOLDIGGER, AN ORGANIZATION THAT CALCULATES SCHOOL RANKINGS BASED ON TEST SCORES RELEASED BY THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, HARFORD COUNTY PUBLIC SCHOOLS RANKED 11TH BEST OUT OF THE 24 PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN MARYLAND IN 2017. THIS WAS A DROP FROM 5TH BEST IN 2015 (HTTPS://WWW.SCHOOLDIGGER.COM/GO/MD/DISTRICTRANK.ASPX). IN 2017, 92.9% OF PEOPLE 25 YEARS AND OVER IN HARFORD COUNTY HAD AT LEAST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND 35.2% HAD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. AN ESTIMATED 7.1% DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL. IN COMPARISON, IN THE TOWN WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF POVERTY, ABERDEEN, AN ESTIMATED 11.9% DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL, AND ONLY 14.2% HAD BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN HARFORD COUNTY, 200,369 (68.8%) OF THE POPULATION IS AGE 16 AND OVER. OF THAT 68.8% EMPLOYABLE POPULATION, 64.4% WAS EMPLOYED. AN ESTIMATED 74.9% OF THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED WERE PRIVATE WAGE AND SALARY WORKERS; 20.9% WERE FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS; AND 2.7% WERE SELF-EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN (NOT INCORPORATED) BUSINESS (U.S. CENSUSReturn Reference - Identifier Explanation BUREAU, 2013-2017 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). WHILE THE MEDIAN VALUE OF HOMES IN HARFORD COUNTY ($281,400) IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN MARYLAND'S ($296,500), THE DIFFERENCE WHEN CONSIDERING HOUSING PRICES BY ZIP CODE IS DRAMATIC. PRICES RANGE FROM BELOW THE STATE VALUE IN THE EDGEWOOD AREA, WHERE THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE IS $163,300, TO WELL ABOVE THE STATE IN THE MONKTON AREA, WHERE THE MEDIAN HOME COSTS $517,400. SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4 - COMMUNITY INFORMATIONTRANSPORTATION IS ALSO A CONCERN IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTY, ESPECIALLY FOR SENIORS, YOUTH, AND LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE RURAL AREAS OF NORTHERN HARFORD COUNTY. AMENITIES SUCH AS SHOPPING, ENTERTAINMENT, AND HEALTH SERVICES ARE OFTEN FAR AWAY, AND THERE ARE FEW PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS. THE BUS SERVICE HAS LIMITED HOURS AND ROUTES MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THOSE WITHOUT CARS TO ACCESS THEM. DATA SHOW THAT 1.6% OF RESIDENTS IN THE COUNTY HAVE NO ACCESS TO A VEHICLE, WITH THAT NUMBER REACHING 3.4% IN HAVRE DE GRACE. IN 2015, HARFORD COUNTY HAD AN ANNUAL VIOLENT CRIME RATE OF 239 PER 100,000 PEOPLE, WHICH IS MUCH LOWER THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 471. SIMILARLY, THE RATE OF PROPERTY CRIME IN HARFORD COUNTY WAS LOWER THAN THE STATE'S AT 1,257 PER 100,000 WHEN COMPARED TO MARYLAND'S RATE OF 2,395. WHILE THE OVERALL CRIMES RATES IN BOTH HARFORD COUNTY AND MARYLAND HAVE DECREASED SINCE 2011, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE VIOLENT CRIME RATE IN ABERDEEN (503.1) IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE COUNTY'S AS A WHOLE, ILLUSTRATING THE INEQUITY IN LIVING CONDITIONS FOR FAMILIES RESIDING IN THIS AREA. (MARYLAND CRIME DATA FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF CRIME CONTROL & PREVENTION) DESPITE THE DECREASE IN BOTH VIOLENT CRIME AND PROPERTY CRIME IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE, THE NUMBER OF DRUG-RELATED INCIDENTS REPORTED BY THE HARFORD COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE HAS INCREASED BY 80% FROM 2011 TO 2017. THIS GROWING TREND HAS SHIFTED THE FOCUS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COMBAT THE DRUG CRISIS IN HARFORD COUNTY. IN HARFORD COUNTY, MOST RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES WHERE HEALTHY FOODS ARE AVAILABLE. ACCORDING TO THE 2017 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, WHICH PROVIDES A MEASURE OF \"LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS,\" 97% OF RESIDENTS LIVE CLOSE TO A GROCERY STORE, WITH ONLY 4% OR AN ESTIMATED 10,041 PEOPLE HAVING LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. THIS MEASURE IS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS LOW INCOME AND DOES NOT LIVE CLOSE TO A GROCERY STORE. WHILE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR MOST HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS, MANY FAMILIES REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN PURCHASING FOODS: 8.3 % OR 20,760 OF HOUSEHOLDS IN HARFORD COUNTY RECEIVED FOOD STAMPS FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN 2017 (U.S. CENSUS, FACT FINDER). A MORE PRESSING ISSUE FOR A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS IS HAVING AN INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF FOOD OR \"FOOD INSECURITY\" AT SOME TIME DURING EACH YEAR. FOOD INSECURITY IS THE USDA'S MEASURE OF LACK OF ACCESS, AT TIMES, TO ENOUGH FOOD FOR AN ACTIVE, HEALTHY LIFE FOR ALL HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND LIMITED OR UNCERTAIN AVAILABILITY OF NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE FOODS. PER THE USDA FOOD ENVIRONMENT ATLAS, HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE THIS CONDITION, ON AVERAGE, IN SEVEN MONTHS OF THE YEAR. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN 2017 THE FOOD INSECURITY RATE FOR THE HARFORD COUNTY POPULATION WAS 8% OR 20,082 PEOPLE. THIS IS LESS THAN MARYLAND'S RATE OF 11%. IN HARFORD COUNTY, THE WEEKLY FOOD BUDGET SHORTFALL FOR FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE WAS $17.38 PER PERSON, PER WEEK IN 2015. IN SUMMARY, MOST HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO GROCERY STORES TO PURCHASE HEALTHY FOODS. HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF THESE RESIDENTS FACE FOOD INSECURITY AT SOME TIME DURING THE YEAR, WITH HEALTHY FOODS OUT OF REACH. ACCORDING TO THE 2014-2016 BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY (BRFSS), 17.3% OF HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS REPORTED THAT THEY CURRENTLY SMOKED CIGARETTES EVERY DAY OR SOME DAYS. ADULTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES LESS THAN $15,000 WERE 5.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE THAN THOSE WITH INCOME AT OR ABOVE $75,000 IN 2014. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ALSO CORRELATED TO SMOKING RATES: ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE 9.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE THAN COLLEGE GRADUATES ACCORDING TO THE 2014 BRFSS. SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS WERE CONSIDERED SMOKERS IF THEY SMOKED AT LEAST 1 CIGARETTE OR CIGAR IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. THE 2016 YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM SURVEY (YRBS) FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CURRENT SMOKERS IN HARFORD COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS WAS 9.3% WHEN COMPARED TO 16.9% IN 2014. WHILE THIS RATE HAS DECREASED OVER TIME, THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS REPORTING THAT THEY CURRENTLY USE ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF CURRENT SMOKERS AT 14.3% ACCORDING TO THE 2016 YRBS. THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS USING ANY TYPE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS (CIGARETTE, SMOKELESS TOBACCO, CIGAR, OR ELECTRONIC VAPOR PRODUCTS) WAS 21.9% (2016 YRBS). IN BRFSS DATA FOR 2014-2016, 15.04% OF HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS REPORTED BINGE DRINKING IN THE PAST MONTH AND 4.0% REPORTED BEING CHRONIC DRINKERS (1-2 OR MORE DRINKS PER DAY), BOTH OF WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE STATE PERCENTAGES. THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTING BINGE DRINKING WAS HIGHER THAN THE ADULT'S: 15.6% OF HARFORD COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED BEING BINGE DRINKERS IN 2016. ACCORDING TO THE 2016 BRFSS, HARFORD COUNTY'S OBESITY RATE WAS 34.9%, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATE'S (28.6%). SEVERAL FACTORS WERE SHOWN TO INCREASE A PERSON'S CHANCE OF OBESITY INCLUDING INCOME, RACE, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. BLACK ADULTS WERE ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE WHEN COMPARED TO WHITE ADULTS, A DISPARITY THAT IS MUCH MORE EVIDENT IN HARFORD COUNTY THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE IN THE 2015 BRFSS, BUT THIS GAP HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE 2016 ASSESSMENT. IN THE 2015 BRFF ASSESSMENT, ADULTS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA WERE ALSO ALMOST TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN THEIR COLLEGE GRADUATE COUNTERPARTS. ADULTS MAKING OVER $75,000 ANNUALLY WERE SLIGHTLY LESS LIKELY TO BE OBESE THAN ADULTS MAKING LESS THAN $15,000.Return Reference - Identifier Explanation SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4 - COMMUNITY INFORMATIONDATA FROM THE MARYLAND VITAL STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION INDICATE THAT THE TOP THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN MARYLAND INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE (STROKE). THE ROLE OF ACCIDENTS AS THE FOURTH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON THAT COULD LIKELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWING OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSES. HARFORD COUNTY'S LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH DO NOT MIRROR THE STATE'S. THE COUNTY'S THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). THE STATE'S THREE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH INCLUDE HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 2014 AND 2016 THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF POTENTIAL LIFE LOST IN HARFORD COUNTY WAS 5,800 PER 100,000 POPULATION WHEN COMPARED TO 6,500 FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IN HARFORD COUNTY, THAT NUMBER INCREASED TO 7,600 YEARS OF LIFE LOST. THE RATE FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS IN MARYLAND WAS 353.2 PER 1,000 RESIDENTS IN 2016. HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER AT 316.1. WHEN EACH ZIP CODE WAS EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST ED VISIT RATES WERE ABERDEEN (580), EDGEWOOD (502), AND HAVRE DE GRACE (460), ALL OF WHICH WERE WELL ABOVE THE STATE AND COUNTY AVERAGES. USING THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICE'S DEFINITION OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS, 2016 DATA FOR HARFORD COUNTY INDICATED THAT THE THREE MOST COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ED VISITS WERE HYPERTENSION, TOBACCO USE, AND HYPERLIPIDEMIA (HIGH CONCENTRATION OF FATS OR LIPIDS IN A PATIENT'S BLOOD). HAVRE DE GRACE'S TOP THREE CHRONIC DISEASE INDICATORS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE RECORDED FOR THE COUNTY. HOWEVER, WHILE ABERDEEN AND EDGEWOOD HAD TOBACCO USE AND HYPERTENSION AS THEIR LEADING INDICATORS, THE THIRD AND FOURTH HIGHEST INDICATORS WERE DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AND ASTHMA, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH SUGGEST THAT THESE CONDITIONS WERE NOT BEING SUCCESSFULLY TREATED ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS. CANCER MORTALITY RATES ARE ALSO WORSE IN HARFORD COUNTY THAN FOR THE STATE OF MARYLAND. WHILE THE STATE'S MORTALITY RATES HAVE STEADILY DECLINED OVER TIME, HARFORD COUNTY'S RATE HAS ONLY SLIGHTLY DECREASED. HARFORD COUNTY RATES ARE THE SAME OR WORSE FOR EVERY CANCER TYPE WHEN COMPARED BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. IN ADDITION TO HIGHER RATES OF CANCER IN THE COUNTY, RACIAL DISPARITIES AMONG WHITES AND BLACKS EXIST FOR THREE TYPES OF CANCERS; LUNG CANCER, COLORECTAL CANCER, AND PROSTATE CANCER THAT HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES WHEN SCREENING OCCURS REGULARLY. HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SEVERAL VASCULAR DISEASES WHEN COMPARED TO MARYLAND ADULTS. THE PERCENTAGE OF HARFORD COUNTY ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH STROKE IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE STATE'S PERCENTAGE. FOR OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS DIABETES, ASTHMA, CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), HYPERTENSION, AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL, THE PREVALENCE OF EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS IS HIGHER IN HARFORD COUNTY THAN IN THE STATE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DIABETES. A NOTIFIABLE DISEASE IS ANY CONDITION THAT, WHEN IDENTIFIED IN A PATIENT, IS REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED TO THE GOVERNMENT SO THAT ITS INCIDENCE CAN BE MONITORED FOR POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS AND CLUSTERING. IN MARYLAND, THERE ARE 86 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES THAT ARE REPORTED TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC). OF THOSE DISEASES, THE HIGHEST CASE RATES IN HARFORD COUNTY WERE OBSERVED FOR CHLAMYDIA, LYME DISEASE, GONORRHEA, SALMONELLOSIS (SALMONELLA), AND ASEPTIC MENINGITIS. HARFORD COUNTY'S LYME DISEASE RATE IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE STATE RATE. IN ADDITION, 24 HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS WERE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV IN 2017. IN 2017 THERE WERE 2,623 LIVE BIRTHS IN HARFORD COUNTY. MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BIRTH OUTCOMES IN HARFORD COUNTY VARY BY RACE, INDICATING HEALTH DISPARITIES EXIST FOR MOTHERS AND BABIES FOR RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES.

WHILE INJURY DEATHS FROM MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, DEATHS FROM INTENTIONAL SELF-HARM (SUICIDE), POISONING, AND FALLS HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE MARYLAND BRFSS DATA FOR 2014-2016 INDICATES THAT 21.4% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, COMPARED TO 15.6% FOR THE STATE. IN ADDITION, HOSPITAL DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY THE CHESAPEAKE REGIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR OUR PATIENTS (CRISP) REPORTING SYSTEM, WHICH SERVES AS A REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE FOR MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, WEST VIRGINIA, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, INDICATES THAT THE RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED CONDITIONS ARE SIMILAR IN HARFORD COUNTY AND THE STATE OF MARYLAND, BUT GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES APPEAR IN THE THREE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST NEED INDEX FOR THE COUNTY. THE NEED INDEX IS BASED ON THE COMMUNITY NEED INDEX DEVELOPED BY DIGNITY HEALTH IN 2004.Return Reference - Identifier Explanation SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4 - COMMUNITY INFORMATIONACCORDING TO THE 2014 AND 2016 MARYLAND YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY, THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO REPORTED FEELING SAD OR HOPELESS FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS IN A ROW CLIMBED 33.3% BETWEEN THE FIRST YEAR OF MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THE SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.

IN 2017, THE PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED ADULTS WAS JUST 3.9% COMPARED TO MARYLAND'S 9% ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING DISPARITIES ARISE BY ZIP CODE, AGE, SEX, RACE, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. NOTICE THAT THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS MAKE ADULTS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE: 18 TO 24 YEARS OF AGE, MALE, HISPANIC, AND LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. POPULATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST UNINSURED RATES LIVE IN ABERDEEN (21001) AND EDGEWOOD (21040).

HOWEVER, IN THE 2014-2016 BRFSS, 9.1% OF HARFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORTED NEEDING TO SEE A DOCTOR BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BECAUSE OF A COST BARRIER. IN 2014 THE TWO MOST REPORTED REASONS FOR DELAYING MEDICAL CARE INCLUDED NOT BEING ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT SOON ENOUGH (9.1%) AND NOT HAVING TRANSPORTATION TO REACH AN APPOINTMENT (8.3%), ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND BRFSS.

ACCORDING TO THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, A PORTION IN EDGEWOOD, HARFORD COUNTY IS CONSIDERED A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSA) FOR PRIMARY CARE. WHILE MOST MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CAN BE TREATED SUCCESSFULLY, MANY WHO SUFFER FROM THESE DISEASES DO NOT RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED. THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION DESIGNATED ALL OF HARFORD COUNTY AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THIS DESIGNATION MEANS THAT THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FAR OUTWEIGHS THEIR AVAILABILITY. THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATION COMPARES EACH MARYLAND COUNTY'S OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM (OTP) CAPACITY TO THE ESTIMATED NEED IN THAT COUNTY. IN 2015 HARFORD COUNTY'S ESTIMATED NEED WAS 2,570 PATIENTS. IN COMPARISON, EXISTING CAPACITY COULD ONLY SERVE 1,687 PATIENTS, LEAVING ABOUT 883 PERSONS IN NEED. IN ADDITION, DATA FROM COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS SHOW THAT IN 2016, HARFORD COUNTY'S MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER RATIO WAS 740:1. THIS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN MARYLAND'S RATIO OF 490:1. UNITED STATES COUNTIES IN THE 90TH PERCENTILE FOR THIS MEASURE REPORT RATIOS CLOSER TO 360:1 FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. ANOTHER INDICATOR THAT SUGGESTS LIMITED ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT IS THE RATE OF SUBSTANCE-EXPOSED NEWBORNS. DATA SHOWS A 677% INCREASE IN THE RATE OF HOSPITAL ENCOUNTERS FOR NEWBORNS WITH MATERNAL DRUG/ALCOHOL EXPOSURE FOR HARFORD COUNTY AND MARYLAND BETWEEN 2000 AND 2017.

DATA FOR 2014-2016 FROM THE MARYLAND BRFSS SHOWED THAT 70.6% OF ADULTS IN HARFORD COUNTY REPORTED VISITING THE DENTIST IN THE PAST YEAR, A FIGURE THAT WAS IN LINE WITH THE STATE (70.3%). IN ADDITION, 6.7% REPORTED THAT THEIR LAST DENTAL VISIT WAS OVER 5 YEARS AGO.Return Reference - Identifier Explanation SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 5 - PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTHUM UCH AIMS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELLNESS WITH OUR OUTREACH PROGRAM, COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

TRAGICALLY, THOUSANDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN ARE KILLED OR INJURED EVERY YEAR IN CAR ACCIDENTS. PROPER USE OF CAR SAFETY SEATS CAN HELP KEEP CHILDREN SAFE - BUT WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT CAR SEAT OPTIONS ON THE MARKET, PARENTS CAN QUICKLY BECOME OVERWHELMED.

Management hs Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors h Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors t judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity ts preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity ts internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations, changes in net assets and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership and the U.S. member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to these matters. Other Matter Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The accompanying supplementary information in Schedules 1-8 is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.

UMMS was created in 1984 when its founding hospital was privatized by the State of Maryland. Prior to that time, the founding hospital was state-owned, operated and financed as part of the University of Maryland, now a part of the University System. As part of the privatization process, the Maryland General Assembly and the University of Maryland ts Board of Regents adopted legislation (the rGovernance Legislation s) separating the major health care delivery components from the University System to UMMS. This Governance Legislation provides for certain level of oversight by the State of Maryland to ensure UMMS t founding purposes are consistently set forth in its functions and operating practices. The Corporation monitors compliance with all requirements of the Governance Legislation. Over its 35-year history, UMMS evolved into a multi-hospital system with academic, community and specialty service missions reaching primarily across Maryland. In continuing partnership with the University of Maryland School of Medicine, UMMS operates healthcare programs that improve the physical and mental health of thousands of people each day. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiaries, and entities controlled by the Corporation. In addition, the Corporation maintains equity interests in various unconsolidated joint ventures, which are described in note 4. The significant operating divisions of the Corporation are described in further detail below. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (i) Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures During the year ended June 30, 2019, the Corporation approved a plan to sell the assets and liabilities of University of Maryland Medical System Health Plans, Inc. The sale, which will include both the Medicaid Plan and Medicare Advantage Plan, is expected to be completed within the next 12 months. Based on the criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 205, Discontinued Operations , it was determined that the pending sale met the criteria for discontinued operations treatment. The carrying amount of the assets and liabilities held for sale are stated at their net realizable value as of June 30, 2019 and any gain or loss on the sale is considered to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, assets held for sale were approximately $116,800 and $139,100 and liabilities held for sale were approximately $60,800 and $86,800, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, operating revenues from discontinued operations were approximately $379,630 and $357,099, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, operating expenses from discontinued operations were approximately $406,593 and $388,693, respectively. Effective September 1, 2017, the Corporation entered into an affiliation agreement with Dimensions Healthcare System and Subsidiaries (DHS) whereby the Corporation became the sole corporate member of DHS. DHS has changed its trade name to University of Maryland Capital Region Health (Capital Region) located in Prince George ts County, Maryland, and includes one acute care UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 9 (Continued) hospitals, one free standing medical facility (FMF), ambulatory and outpatient facilities, and other subsidiaries.

(ii) University of Maryland Medical Center (Medical Center) The Medical Center, which is a major component of UMMS, is a 767-bed academic medical center located in Baltimore. The Medical Center has served as the teaching hospital of the School of Medicine of the University System of Maryland, Baltimore since 1823. As part of the privatization in 1984, only clinical faculty members of the School of Medicine may serve as medical staff of the Medical Center. The Medical Center is comprised of two operating divisions: University Hospital, which includes the Greenebaum Cancer Center, and Shock Trauma Center. University Hospital, which generates approximately 80% of the Medical Center ts admissions and patient days, is a tertiary teaching hospital providing over 70 clinical services and programs. The Greenebaum Cancer Center specializes in the treatment of cancer patients and is a site for clinical cancer research. The Shock Trauma Center, which specializes in emergency treatment of patients suffering severe trauma, generates approximately 20% of admissions and patient days. The Medical Center ts operations include UniversityCARE, LLC (UCARE), a physician hospital organization of which the Corporation owns a majority ownership interest and therefore consolidates, and 36 South Paca Street, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation that operates a residential apartment building. The Corporation has certain agreements with various departments of the University of Maryland School of Medicine concerning the provision of professional and administrative services to the Corporation and its patients. Total expense under these agreements in the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $159,043 and $163,321, respectively. (iii) University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Institute (ROI) ROI is comprised of a medical/surgical and rehabilitation hospital in Baltimore with 137 licensed beds, which includes rehabilitation beds, chronic care beds, medical/surgical beds, and off-site physical therapy facilities. A related corporation, The James Lawrence Kernan Endowment Fund, Inc.

(b) Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 14 (Continued) (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, excluding amounts shown within investments and assets limited as to use, consist of cash and interest bearing deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalent balances may exceed amounts insured by federal agencies and, therefore, bear a risk of loss. The Corporation has not experienced such losses on these funds. (d) Investments and Assets Limited as to Use The Corporation ts investment portfolios are classified as trading and are reported in the consolidated balance sheets, as long-term assets, at their fair value based on quoted market prices at June 30, 2019 and 2018. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities with readily determinable market values are included in nonoperating income. Investment income, including realized gains and losses, is included in nonoperating income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. Assets limited as to use include investments set aside at the discretion of the board of directors for the replacement or acquisition of property and equipment, investments held by trustees under bond indenture agreements and self-insurance trust arrangements, and assets whose use is restricted by donors. Such investments are stated at fair value. Amounts required to meet current liabilities have been included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair values of donor-restricted investments are recorded in net assets with donor restrictions unless otherwise required by the donor or state law. Assets limited as to use also include the Corporation ts economic interests in financially interrelated organizations (note 12). Alternative investments, which the Corporation defines to include multi-strategy commingled funds, hedge funds, hedge fund-of-funds, and private equity investments, are recorded under the equity method of accounting. Underlying securities of these alternative investments may include certain debt and equity securities that are not readily marketable. Because certain investments are not readily marketable, their fair value is subject to additional uncertainty, and therefore, values realized upon disposition may vary significantly from current reported values. Investments are exposed to certain risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, changes in the value of investment securities could occur in the near term, and these changes could materially differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (e) Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of drugs and medical/surgical supplies, are carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 15 (Continued) (f) Economic Interests in Financially Interrelated Organizations The Corporation recognizes its rights to assets held by recipient organizations, which accept cash or other financial assets from a donor and agree to use those assets on behalf of or transfer those assets, the return on investment of those assets, or both, to the Corporation. Changes in the Corporation ts economic interests in these financially interrelated organizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of changes in net assets. (g) Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost or estimated fair value at date of contribution, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets using the half-year convention. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Buildings 20 to 40 years Building and leasehold improvements 5 to 15 years Equipment 3 to 15 years Interest costs incurred on borrowed funds less interest income earned on the unexpended bond proceeds during the period of construction are capitalized as a component of the cost of acquiring those assets. Gifts of long-lived assets, such as land, buildings, or equipment are reported as unrestricted support unless explicit donor stipulations specify how the donated assets must be used. Gifts of long-lived assets with explicit restrictions that specify how the assets are to be used and gifts of cash or other assets that must be used to acquire long-lived assets are reported as restricted support. Absent explicit donor stipulations about how long those long-lived assets must be maintained, expirations of donor restrictions are reported when the donated or acquired long-lived assets are placed in service. (h) Deferred Financing Costs Costs incurred related to the issuance of long-term debt, which are included in long-term debt, are deferred and are amortized over the life of the related debt agreements or the related letter-of-credit agreements using the effective-interest method. (i) Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with acquisitions. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets. Intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. The Corporation adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , for the year ended June 30, 2018. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 16 (Continued) on June 30, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles g Goodwill and Other , using a qualitative assessment (Step 0) to determine whether there are events or circumstances that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, which determines whether a quantitative (Step 1) goodwill impairment test is necessary. Under the quantitative assessment, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must record an impairment loss. The Corporation has two reporting units, one of which includes all health care delivery assets and the other that includes UM Health Plan assets. Based on the Corporation ts qualitative assessment, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying value for the year ended June 30, 2019. Based on the Corporation ts qualitative assessment, it was determined that the fair value of the health care delivery reporting unit was more likely than not greater than its carrying value for the year ended June 30, 2018. The Health Plans reporting unit experienced increasing losses in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 primarily related to medical claims expenses in excess of premium revenues for its Medicare Advantage Plan, and as a result, the Corporation engaged a third party to perform the Step 1 impairment test using the income approach. The income approach provides an estimation of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations about the cash flows that asset would generate over its remaining useful life. The cash flow models were developed using projected revenues and expenses based on historical data, industry projections as well as management expectations. Based on the results of the impairment test, the Corporation recognized a loss on impairment of $12,794 related to goodwill and $33,000 related to an intangible asset (Medicaid Contract) for the year ended June 30, 2018, and these were recorded in loss on discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. There was no impairment loss recognized for the year ended June 30, 2019. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: Health Care Delivery Health Plans Goodwill at June 30, 2017 $ 48,810 42,019 Acquisitions q q Write-downs q (12,794) Goodwill at June 30, 2018 48,810 29,225 Acquisitions q q Write-downs q q Goodwill at June 30, 2019 $ 48,810 29,225 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 17 (Continued) (j) Contingent Consideration for Business Acquisitions Acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future financial measures of an acquired company. Contingent consideration is required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these liabilities is estimated based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement and discount the liabilities to present value using a weighted average cost of capital. Contingent consideration is valued using significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which are defined as Level 3 inputs pursuant to fair value measurement accounting. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition are reflected in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates, and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. The Corporation recorded a contingent liability of $35,700 related to an earn-out clause in connection with the August 15, 2015 acquisition of UM Health Plans. This earn-out could result in an undiscounted payment ranging from $0 to $106,500 depending on the performance and membership of both plans. The final computation of the earn-out is not to be determined until March 31, 2020. Based on the earn-out calculation, the Corporation determined that the fair value of the contingent liability was $0 at both June 30, 2019 and 2018. As such, the Corporation recognized a gain of $0 and $35,700 related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The gain is included in the loss on discontinued operations in the 2018 consolidated statement of operations and changes in net assets. (k) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets. No impairment losses were recorded for the years ended June 30, 2019 or 2018. (l) Investments in Joint Ventures When the Corporation does not have a controlling interest in an entity, but exerts a significant influence over the entity, the Corporation applies the equity method of accounting. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 18 (Continued) (m) Self-Insurance Under the Corporation ts self-insurance programs (general and professional liability, workers t compensation, and employee health and long-term disability benefits), claims are reflected as a present-value liability based upon actuarial estimates and reported and incurred but not reported claims analysis, taking into consideration the severity of incidents and the expected timing of claim payments. (n) Net Assets The Corporation classifies net assets based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. Net assets without donor restrictions represent contributions, gifts, and grants, which have no donor-imposed restrictions or which arise as a result of operations. Net assets with donor restrictions are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that must or will be met either by satisfying a specific purpose and/or passage of time. Generally, the donors of these assets permit the use of all or part of the income earned on related investments for specific purposes. The restrictions associated with these net assets generally pertain to patient care, specific capital projects, and funding of specific hospital operations and community outreach programs. (o) Net Patient Service Revenue and Patient Accounts Receivable In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , net patient service revenue, which includes hospital inpatient services, hospital outpatient services, physician services, and other patient services revenue, is recorded at the transaction price estimated by the Corporation to reflect the total consideration due from patients and third-party payors (including commercial payers and government programs) and others. Revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are satisfied in exchange for providing goods and services in patient care. Revenue is recorded as these goods and services are provided. The services provided to a patient during an inpatient stay or outpatient visit represent a bundle of goods and services that are distinct and accounted for as a single performance obligation. The Corporation ts estimate of the transaction price includes the Corporation ts standard charges for the goods and services provided with a reduction recorded related to price concessions for such items as contractual allowances, charity care, potential adjustments that may arise from payment and other reviews, and uncollectible amounts. The price concessions are determined using the portfolio approach as a practical expedient to account for patient contracts as collective groups rather than individually. Estimates for uncollectible amounts are based on the aging of the accounts receivable, historical collections experience for similar payors and patients, current market conditions, and other relevant factors. The Corporation recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered even though they do not assess the patient ts ability to pay. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the self pay population will be unable or unwilling to pay for services which is estimated in the transaction price. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustment to net patient service revenue in the period of change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor ts or patient ts ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense. Bad debt expense for the year ended June 30, 2019 was not significant to the consolidated financial statements. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 19 (Continued) The standard charges for goods and services for the Medical Center, ROI, Midtown, Baltimore Washington, Shore Regional, Charles Regional, St. Joseph, Upper Chesapeake, and Capital Region reflects actual charges to patients based on rates established by the State of Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) in effect during the period in which the services are rendered. See note 18 for further discussion on the HSCRC and regulated rates. Patient accounts are recorded at the net realizable value based on certain assumptions determined by each payor. For third-party payors, including Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance, the net realizable value is based on the estimated contractual adjustments, which is based on approved discounts on charges as permitted by the HSCRC. For self-pay accounts, which includes patients who are uninsured and the patient responsibility portion for patients with insurance, the net realizable value is determined using estimates of historical collection experience. Net patient accounts receivable shown on the consolidated balance sheet for June 30, 2018 is net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $219,769. Net patient service revenue shown on the consolidated statement of operations and changes in net assets for June 30, 2018 are net of provision for bad debts of $174,137. With the adoption of ASC Topic 606, all revenue and related accounts receivable are recorded at the net expected transaction price, therefore, there is no material allowance for doubtful accounts or provision for bad debts for the year ended June 30, 2019. The Corporation has elected to apply the optional exemption in ASC Paragraph 606-10-50-14a as all performance obligations relate to contracts with duration of less than one year. Under this exemption, the Corporation was not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. Any unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the year are completed within days or weeks of the end of the year. Net patient service revenue by line of business are as follows for the years ended June 30: 2019 2018 Hospital inpatient and outpatient services $ 3,734,201 Physician patient service revenue $ 4,017,054 3,877,341 (p) Premium Revenue and Medical Claims Expense Premium revenue consists of amounts received from the state of Maryland and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) by the Corporation ts managed care organization for providing medical services to subscribing participants, regardless of services actually performed, and is accounted for under ASC Topic 944, Financial Services g Insurance . The managed care organization provides services primarily to enrolled Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. This revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period for the provision of services. Medical expenses of the managed care organization include actuarially determined estimates of the ultimate costs for both UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 20 (Continued) reported claims and claims incurred but unreported and are included in medical claims expense on the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. These accounts are included within loss on discontinued operations. See note 1(a)(i). (q) Charity Care The Corporation is committed to providing quality healthcare to all, regardless of one ts ability to pay. Patients who meet the criteria of its charity care policy receive services without charge or at amounts less than its established rates. The criteria for charity care consider the household income in relation to the federal poverty guidelines. The Corporation provides services at no charge for patients with adjusted gross income equal to or less than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. For uninsured patients with adjusted gross income greater than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, a sliding scale discount is applied. Income and asset information obtained from patient credit reporting data are used to determine patients t ability to pay. The Corporation maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care it furnished under its charity care policy. The charity care policies of the new affiliates are generally consistent with that of the Corporation ts policy. Due to the complexity of the eligibility process, the Corporation provides eligibility services to patients free of charge to assist in the qualification process. These eligibility services include, but are not limited to, the following: \u0099 Financial assistance brochures and other information are posted at each point of service. When patients have questions or concerns, they are encouraged to call a toll-free number to reach customer service representatives during the business day. Financial assistance programs are published on the Corporation ts website and included on the statements provided to patients. \u0099 The Corporation offers assistance to patients in completing the applications for Medicaid or other government payment assistance programs, or applying for care under the Corporation ts charity care policy, if applicable. The Corporation also employs an external firm to assist in the eligibility process. \u0099 Any patient, whether covered by insurance or not, may meet with a UMMS representative and receive financial counseling from UMMS t dedicated financial assistance unit. The Corporation recognizes that a large number of uninsured and insured patients meet the charity care guidelines but do not respond to the Corporation ts attempts to obtain necessary financial information. In these instances, the Corporation uses credit reporting data to properly classify these unpaid balances as charity care as opposed to bad debt expense. Utilization of income and asset information and credit reporting data indicate the vast majority of amounts reported as provision for bad debts represent amounts due from patients that would otherwise qualify for charity benefits but do not respond to the Corporation ts attempts to obtain the necessary financial information. In these cases, reasonable collection efforts are pursued, but yield few collections. Amounts determined to meet the criteria under the charity care policy are not reported as net patient service revenue. The amounts reported as charity care represent the cost of rendering such services. Costs incurred are estimated based on the cost-to-charge ratio for each hospital and applied to charity care charges. The Corporation estimates the total direct and indirect costs to provide charity care were $48,821 and $48,479 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 21 (Continued) (r) Nonoperating Income and Expenses, Net Other activities that are only indirectly related to the Corporation ts primary business of delivering healthcare services are recorded as nonoperating income and expenses and include investment income, equity in the net income of joint ventures, general donations and fund-raising activities, inherent contributions, changes in fair value of investments, changes in fair value of undesignated interest rate swaps, and settlement payments on interest rate swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Settlement payments on interest rate swaps were approximately $15,124 and $19,227 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reported within other nonoperating losses, net. (s) Derivative Financial Instruments The Corporation records derivative and hedging activities on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values. The Corporation utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with long-term tax-exempt debt. The Corporation does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Corporation ts specific goals are to (a) manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the reprising or maturity characteristics of some of its tax-exempt debt and (b) lower unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the market value of the Corporation ts fixed-rate tax-exempt debt when that market value is compared with the cost of the borrowed funds. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation in market value, however, will generally be offset by the income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the debt. The Corporation formally documents all hedge relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Corporation may designate the derivative as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized or forecasted liability (fair value hedge) or a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized liability (cash flow hedge), provided the derivative instrument meets certain criteria related to its effectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation also formally assesses, both at the hedge ts inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. All derivative instruments are reported as other assets or interest rate swap liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value. Derivatives not designated as hedges or not meeting effectiveness criteria are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in other nonoperating income and expenses. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, none of the Corporation ts derivatives qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are included in or excluded from the excess of revenues over expenses depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 22 (Continued) value hedge, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the risk being hedged, are included in the excess of revenues over expenses. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge are excluded from the excess of revenues over expenses to the extent that the hedge is effective until the excess of revenues over expenses is affected by the variability of cash flows in the hedged transaction. Changes in the fair value that relate to ineffectiveness are included in the excess of revenues over expenses as interest expense. (t) Excess of Revenue over Expenses from continuing operations The consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets includes a performance indicator, excess of revenues over expenses from continuing operations. Changes in net assets without donor restrictions that are excluded from the performance indicator, consistent with industry practice, include contributions of long-lived assets (including assets acquired using contributions, which, by donor restrictions, were to be used for the purpose of acquiring such assets), changes in the funded status of defined benefit pension plans, amortization of accumulated loss of discontinued designated interest rate swaps, loss on discontinued operations, and other items that are required by generally accepted accounting principles to be reported separately. (u) Income Taxes The Corporation and most of its subsidiaries are not-for-profit corporations formed under the laws of the State of Maryland, organized for charitable purposes and recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. The effect of the taxable status of its for-profit subsidiaries is not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards on for-profit and unrelated business activities of approximately $103,627 and $89,890 as of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, which expire at various dates through 2032. The Corporation ts deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of the net operating loss carryforwards, are approximately $25,598 at June 30, 2019, and $22,345 at June 30, 2018, were fully reserved as they are not expected to be utilized. The Corporation had a deferred tax liability in the amount of $3,027 and $3,027 related to indefinite-lived intangibles at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in liabilities held for sale on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation follows a threshold of more likely than not for recognition and derecognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax liabilities or benefits that should be recognized. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law H.R.1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as such the Corporation ts effective tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% during the fiscal year 2018. The new law includes several provisions that result in substantial changes to the tax treatment of tax-exempt organizations and their donors. The Company has reviewed these provisions and the potential impact and has concluded the enactment of H.R.1 did not have a material effect on the operations of the organization. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 23 (Continued) (v) Donor-Restricted Gifts Unconditional promises to give cash and other assets to the Corporation are reported at fair value at the date the promise is received. Conditional promises to give and indications of intentions to give are reported at fair value at the date the promise becomes unconditional. Contributions are reported as net assets with donor restrictions if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction is satisfied, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified as net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets as net assets released from restrictions. Such amounts are classified as other revenue or transfers and additions to property and equipment. Contributions to be received after one year are discounted at an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. An allowance for uncollectible contributions receivable is provided based upon management ts judgment, including such factors as prior collection history, type of contributions, and nature of fund-raising activity. The Corporation follows accounting guidance for classifying the net assets associated with donor-restricted endowment funds held by organizations that are subject to an enacted version of the Uniform Prudent Management Institutional Funds Act of 2006 (UPMIFA). (w) Fair Value Measurements The following methods and assumptions were used by the Corporation in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments: Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, assets limited as to use, investments, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll and benefits, other accrued expenses, and advances from third-party payors p The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the related fair values. Pension plan assets p The Corporation applies ASU No. 2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset per Share (or Its Equivalent) , to its pension plan assets. The guidance permits, as a practical expedient, fair value of investments within its scope to be estimated using the net asset value (NAV) or its equivalent. The alternative investments classified within the fair value hierarchy have been recorded using the NAV. The Corporation discloses its financial assets, financial liabilities, and fair value measurements of nonfinancial items according to the fair value hierarchy required by generally accepted accounting principles that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: \u0099 Level 1 inputs are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 24 (Continued) \u0099 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices including within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \u0099 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The Corporation uses techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach for measuring fair value of its Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities. The market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach generally converts future amounts (cash flows or earnings) to a single present value amount (discounted). The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Level 2 assets and liabilities listed in the fair value hierarchy tables presented in notes 2 and 10 utilize the following valuation techniques and inputs: (i) Cash Equivalents The fair value of investments in cash equivalent securities, with maturities within three months of the date of purchase, is determined using techniques that are consistent with the market approach. Significant observable inputs include reported trades and observable broker-dealer quotes. (ii) U.S. Government and Agency Securities The fair value of investments in U.S. government, state, and municipal obligations is primarily determined using techniques consistent with the income approach. Significant observable inputs to the income approach include data points for benchmark constant maturity curves and spreads. (iii) Corporate Bonds The fair value of investments in U.S. and international corporate bonds, including commingled funds that invest primarily in such bonds and foreign government bonds, is primarily determined using techniques that are consistent with the market approach. Significant observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, observable broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, and security specific characteristics, such as early redemption options. (iv) Collateralized Corporate Obligations The fair value of collateralized corporate obligations is primarily determined using techniques consistent with the income approach, such as a discounted cash flow model. Significant observable inputs include prepayment speeds and spreads, benchmark yield curves, volatility measures, and quotes. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 25 (Continued) (v) Derivative Liabilities The fair value of derivative contracts is primarily determined using techniques consistent with the market approach. Derivative contracts include interest rate, credit default, and total return swaps. Significant observable inputs to valuation models include interest rates, treasury yields, volatilities, credit spreads, maturity, and recovery rates. (x) Commitments and Contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. (y) Going Concern Management evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Corporation ts ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. As of the date of this report, there are no conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Corporation ts ability to continue as a going concern. (z) Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (aa) New Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity ts contracts with customers. The ASU requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU was adopted on July 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for those contracts that were not substantially completed as of July 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the net presentation of a single net patient service revenue total. The adoption of the ASU primarily changes the Corporation ts presentation of revenue and the provision and allowance for bad debts. The ASU requires revenue to be recognized based on the Corporation ts estimate of the transaction price the Corporation expects to collects as a result of satisfying its performance obligations. Accordingly, for performance obligations satisfied after July 1, 2018, the Corporation no longer separately presents a provision for bad debts on the consolidated statement of operations and changes in net assets or the related allowance for bad debts on the consolidated balance sheets and these are included as price concessions and a reduction to net patient service revenue and net accounts receivable, respectively. Net patient accounts receivable shown on the consolidated balance sheet for June 30, 2018 are net of UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 26 (Continued) allowance for doubtful accounts of $219,769. Net patient service revenue shown on the consolidated statement of operations and changes in net assets for June 30, 2018 is net of provision for bad debts of $174,137. Changes to the allowance for bad debts, other than the write-offs of uncollectible accounts, are recorded through the provision for bad debts on the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets in accordance with Topic 605. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have significant impact on the recognition of net patient service revenues for any periods prior to adoption. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a significant impact on any financial statement line items when compared to Topic 605. The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-14, Presentation of Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Entities , to improve the current net asset classification requirements and information presented in financial statements and notes about a not-for-profit entity ts liquidity, financial performance, and cash flows. This update requires not-for-profit entities to present two classes of net assets (net assets with donor restrictions and net assets without donor restrictions), requires the presentation of expenses in both natural and functional classification, and other quantitative information regarding the entity ts liquidity. UMMS adopted ASU No. 2016-14 with a retrospective approach as of July 1, 2018. There were no material changes to the consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and changes in net assets or cash flows because of the adoption. Periods prior to adoption, which previously presented temporarily restricted of $698,458 and permanently restricted net assets of $44,209, have been revised to conform to the new presentation of a single classification of net assets with donor restrictions. The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which will require lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, increasing their reported assets and liabilities. This update was developed to provide financial statement users with more information about an entity ts leasing activities and will require changes in processes and internal controls. The Corporation will adopt Topic 842 effective July 1, 2019, applying the modified retrospective approach in which the Corporation will not adjust comparable prior period information and disclosures. The Corporation expects to utilize the practical expedients being made available, including the package of practical expedients to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease classification and initial direct costs. The Corporation estimates the amount of right-of-use assets and obligations resulting from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to be within a range of $75,000 to $125,000. From time to time, new accounting guidance is issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that is adopted by the Corporation as of the effective date or, in some cases where early adoption is permitted, in advance of the effective date. The Corporation has assessed the recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and, unless otherwise indicated above, believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on the Corporation ts consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As security for the performance of the bond obligation under the UMMS Master Loan Agreement, the Authority maintains a security interest in the revenue of the obligors. The UMMS Master Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants. These covenants require that rates and charges be set at certain levels, limit incurrence of additional debt, require compliance with certain operating ratios and restrict the disposition of assets. The Obligated Group under the UMMS Master Loan Agreement includes the Medical Center, ROI, UM Midtown, UM Baltimore Washington, Shore Health (UM Memorial and UM Dorchester), UM Chester River, UM Charles Regional, UM St. Joseph, UM Upper Chesapeake, UM Harford Memorial, UM Laurel, UM Prince George ts, Bowie Health Center (Bowie), and the UMMS Foundation.

To provide liquidity support for the timely payment of any bonds that are not successfully remarketed, the Corporation has entered into letter-of-credit agreements with three banking institutions. These agreements have terms that expire in 2021 through 2022. If the bonds are not successfully remarketed, the Corporation is required to pay an interest rate specified in the letter-of-credit agreement, and the principal repayment of bonds may be accelerated to require repayment in periods ranging from 20 to 60 months from the date of the failed remarketing. The Corporation has reflected the amount of its long-term debt that is subject to these short-term remarketing arrangements as a separate component of current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. In the event that bonds are not remarketed, the Corporation maintains available letters of credit and has the ability to access other sources to obtain the necessary liquidity to comply with accelerated repayment terms.

The Corporation is subject to a collateral posting requirement with two of its swap counterparties. Collateral posting requirements are based on the Corporation ts long-term debt credit ratings, as well as the net liability position of total interest rate swap agreements outstanding with that counterparty. The amount of such posted collateral was $109,934 and $80,480 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation met its collateral posting requirement through the use of collateralized investments, which were selected and purchased by the Corporation and subsequently transferred to the custody of the swap counterparty. The amount of posted investments that is required to meet the collateral requirement is computed daily and is accounted for as a component of the Corporation ts assets limited as to use on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of that date. Any excess investment value is considered a component of the Corporation ts unrestricted investment portfolio and is included in investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of that date.

For employees represented by the 1199 SEIU Health Care Workers East p Registered Nurses Chapter union (formerly Professional Staff Nurses Association union), benefits are based on years of service and average final compensation. On December 31, 2007, the Capital Region Pension Plan was frozen. No further benefit accruals will be made to the plan. The plan freeze substantially reduces annual funding obligations beginning with plan year 2008. The Corporation ts funding policy is to contribute such actuarially determined amounts as necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to the plan participants and to meet the funding requirements of the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Dimensions Health Corporation Post Retirement Benefit Plans (Capital Region Post Retirement Benefit Plans) p A postretirement health care plan is provided to both salaried and nonsalaried employees who UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 45 (Continued) have retired and certain other employees who were eligible to retire prior to July 1, 1995. The plan is contributory for those who retired prior to July 1, 1995, with retiree contributions adjusted annually. Employees who retired on July 1, 1995 and later are eligible to participate in the plan by paying 100% of the premiums without corporate contributions. The Corporation ts policy has been to fund this plan on an as needed basis. A defined postretirement life insurance plan is a noncontributory plan for all eligible retirees prior to July 1, 2001. For employees represented by the 1199 SEIU Health Care Workers East p Registered Nurses Chapter union, the plan was no longer offered to new retirees as of July 1, 1999. Effective July 1, 2001, the plan was modified to become contributory for the nonunion employees and employees represented by the 1199 SEIU Health Care Workers East p Health Care Workers union who retired prior to July 1, 2001 and for the employees represented by the 1199 SEIU Health Care Workers East p Registered Nurses Chapter union who retired prior to July 1, 1999. The Corporation ts policy has been to fund its share of these benefits as they are incurred. The Corporation recognizes the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations) of its defined benefit pension plans as an asset or liability in its consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur as changes in unrestricted net assets. All defined benefit pension plans use a June 30 measurement date. The following tables set forth the combined benefit obligations and assets of the defined benefit plans at June 30: 2019 2018 Change in projected benefit obligations: Benefit obligations at beginning of year $ 431,340 182,024 Benefit obligations, Capital Region q 278,165 Settlements (37,686) (11,747) Curtailments and plan amendments Interest cost 30,783 (13,064) Benefit payments (19,633) (22,045) Projected benefit obligations at end of year $ 425,709 431,340 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 46 (Continued) 2019 2018 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 340,130 155,602 Fair value of plan assets, Capital Region q 187,164 Actual return on plan assets 16,354 16,182 Settlements Employer contributions 18,869 14,974 Benefit payments (19,633) (22,045) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 317,176 340,130 The funded status of the plans and amounts recognized as accrued payroll and benefits and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30 are as follows: 2019 2018 Funded status, end of period: Fair value of plan assets $ 317,176 340,130 Projected benefit obligations 425,709 431,340 Net funded status $ (108,533) (91,210) Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 423,017 428,509 Amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets at June 30: Accrued payroll and benefits $ q q Accrued pension obligation (108,533) (91,210) $ (108,533) (91,210) Amounts recognized in net assets without donor restrictions at June 30: Net actuarial gain (loss) $ (71,177) 44,165 Prior service cost (159) 284 $ (71,336) 44,449 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 47 (Continued) The estimated amounts that will be amortized from net assets without donor restrictions into net periodic pension cost in fiscal year 2020 are as follows: Net actuarial loss $ 3,974 Prior service cost 72 $ 4,046 The components of net periodic pension cost for the years ended June 30 are as follows: 2019 2018 Service cost $ 3,093 3,093 Interest cost 17,812 17,120 Expected return on plan assets (19,849) (22,636) Prior service cost recognized 76 464 Recognized gains or losses 8,173 8,990 Net periodic pension cost $ 9,305 7,031 Components of net benefit cost other than the service cost of $3,093 were recorded in other nonoperating losses, net in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.

Investments are diversified across classes, sectors, and manager style to minimize the risk of loss. The Corporation uses investment managers specializing in each asset category and regularly monitors performance and compliance with investment guidelines. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Corporation considers the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The Corporation ts pension plans t target allocation and weighted average asset allocations at the measurement date of June 30, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, are as follows: Percentage of plan assets Target as of June 30 Asset category allocation 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents 0&p10& 4 % 2 % Fixed income securities 20&p40& 28 30 Equity securities 30&p50& 41 39 Global asset allocation 10&p20& 17 17 Hedge funds 5&p15& 10 12 100 % 100 % Equity and fixed income securities include investments in hedge fund of funds that are categorized in accordance with each fund ts respective investment holdings.

UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 52 (Continued) (11) Net Assets with Donor Restrictions Net assets are restricted primarily for the following purposes at June 30: 2019 2018 Facility construction and renovations, research, education, and other: Capital region $ 424,034 424,034 All others 142,084 122,514 Economic and beneficial interests in the net assets of related organizations 198,101 196,119 $ 764,219 742,667 Net assets were released from donor restrictions during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 by expending funds satisfying the restricted purposes or by occurrence of other events specified by donors as follows: 2019 2018 Purchases of equipment and construction costs $ 14,130 3,484 Research, education, uncompensated care, and other 4,279 3,956 $ 18,409 7,440 The Corporation ts endowments consist of donor-restricted funds established for a variety of purposes. Net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. (a) Interpretation of Relevant Law The Corporation has interpreted the Maryland Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (MUPMIFA) as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Corporation classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund are classified in net assets with donor restrictions until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the organization in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by MUPMIFA. In accordance with MUPMIFA, the Corporation considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: (1) The duration and preservation of the fund UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 53 (Continued) (2) The purposes of the Corporation and the donor-restricted endowment fund (3) General economic conditions (4) The possible effect of inflation and deflation (5) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments (6) Other resources of the Corporation (7) The investment policies of the Corporation. Endowment net assets are as follows: June 30, 2019 Without donor With donor restrictions restrictions Total Donor-restricted endowment funds $ 39 65,433 65,472 June 30, 2018 Without donor With donor restrictions restrictions Total Donor-restricted endowment funds $ 38 60,333 60,371 Donor restricted endowment funds within net assets with donor restrictions whose use is restricted in perpetuity were $48,826 and $44,209 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (b) Funds with Deficiencies From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor-restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor or MUPMIFA requires the Corporation to retain as a fund of perpetual duration. The Corporation does not have any donor-restricted endowment funds that are below the level that the donor or MUPMIFA requires. (c) Investment Strategies The Corporation has adopted policies for corporate investments, including endowment assets that seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns with preservation of principal. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the Corporation must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s).The endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to hold a mix of investment assets designed to meet the objectives of the account. The Corporation expects its endowment funds, over time, to provide an average rate of return that generates earnings to achieve the endowment purpose. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 54 (Continued) To satisfy its long-term rate-of-return objectives, the Corporation relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The Corporation employs a diversified asset allocation structure to achieve its long-term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. The Corporation monitors the endowment funds t returns and appropriates average returns for use. In establishing this practice, the Corporation considered the long-term expected return on its endowment. This is consistent with the Corporation ts objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term, as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return. (12) Economic and Beneficial Interests in the Net Assets of Related Organizations The Corporation is supported by several related organizations that were formed to raise funds on behalf of the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. These interests are accounted for as either economic or beneficial interests in the net assets of such organizations. The following is a summary of economic and beneficial interests in the net assets of financially interrelated organizations as of June 30: 2019 2018 Economic interests in: UCH Legacy Funding Corporation $ 150,000 150,000 The James Lawrence Kernan Hospital Endowment Fund, Incorporated 33,099 31,804 Baltimore Washington Medical Center Foundation, Inc. 10,337 9,862 Total economic interests 193,436 191,666 Beneficial interest in the net assets of: AdjcYVi^dc, DcX. 894 496 Laurel Regional Hospital Auxiliary, Inc. 62 170 Laurel Regional Hospital Foundation, Inc. q 76 $ 198,101 196,119 The UCH Legacy Funding Corporation was formed in December 2013 to hold funds restricted for the benefit of Upper Chesapeake.

Estimated liabilities have been recorded based on actuarial estimation of reported and incurred but not reported claims. The accrued liabilities for these programs as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2019 2018 Professional and general malpractice liabilities $ 313,136 290,306 Employee health (73,226) $ 302,878 279,117 The Corporation provides for and funds the present value of the costs for professional and general liability claims and insurance coverage related to the projected liability from asserted and unasserted incidents, which the Corporation believes may ultimately result in a loss. In management ts opinion, these accruals provide an adequate and appropriate loss reserve. The professional and general malpractice liabilities presented above include $202,779 and $168,452 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which related insurance receivables have been recorded within other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation and each of its affiliates are self-insured for professional and general liability claims up to the limits of $1,000 on individual claims and $3,000 in the aggregate on an annual basis. For amounts in excess of these limits, the risk of loss has been transferred to Terrapin, an unconsolidated joint venture. Terrapin provides insurance for claims in excess of $1,000 individually and $3,000 in the aggregate, up to $150,000 individually and $150,000 in the aggregate, under claims made policies between the Corporation and Terrapin. For claims in excess of Terrapin ts coverage limits, if any, the Corporation retains the risk of loss. As discussed in note 4, Terrapin is a joint venture corporation in which a 50% equity interest is owned by the Corporation and a 50% equity interest is owned by Faculty Physicians, Inc. Total malpractice insurance expense for the Corporation during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $60,654 and $52,652, respectively. (17) Business and Credit Concentrations The Corporation provides healthcare services through its inpatient and outpatient care facilities located in the State of Maryland. The Corporation generally does not require collateral or other security in extending credit; however, it routinely obtains assignment of (or is otherwise entitled to receive) patients t benefits UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 59 (Continued) receivable under their health insurance programs, plans, or policies (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, workers t compensation, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and commercial insurance policies). The Corporation maintains cash accounts with highly rated financial institutions, which generally exceed federally insured limits. The Corporation has not experienced any losses from maintaining cash accounts in excess of federally insured limits, and as such, management does not believe the Corporation is subject to any significant credit risks related to this practice. The Corporation had receivables from patients and third-party payors as follows at June 30: 2019 2018 Medicare 23 % 23 % Medicaid 21 23 Commercial insurance and HMOs 17 18 Blue Cross 10 10 Self-pay and others 29 26 100 % 100 % The Corporation recorded revenues from patients and third-party payors for the years ended June 30 as follows: 2019 2018 Medicare 37 % 38 % Medicaid 24 24 Commercial insurance and HMOs 24 22 Blue Cross 10 11 Self-pay and others 5 5 100 % 100 % (18) Certain Significant Risks and Uncertainties The Corporation provides general acute healthcare services in the state of Maryland. The Corporation and other healthcare providers in Maryland are subject to certain inherent risks, including the following: \u0099 Dependence on revenues derived from reimbursement by the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs; \u0099 Regulation of hospital rates by the State of Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission; \u0099 Government regulation, government budgetary constraints, and proposed legislative and regulatory changes; and \u0099 Lawsuits alleging malpractice and related claims. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 60 (Continued) Such inherent risks require the use of certain management estimates in the preparation of the Corporation ts consolidated financial statements, and it is reasonably possible that a change in such estimates may occur. The Medicare and state Medicaid reimbursement programs represent a substantial portion of the Corporation ts revenues, and the Corporation ts operations are subject to a variety of other federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Failure to maintain required regulatory approvals and licenses and/or changes in such regulatory requirements could have a significant adverse effect on the Corporation. Changes in federal and state reimbursement funding mechanisms and related government budgetary constraints could have a significant adverse effect on the Corporation. The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations from federal, state, and local governments. The Corporation ts compliance with these laws and regulations can be subject to periodic governmental review and interpretation, which can result in regulatory action unknown or unasserted at this time. Management is aware of certain asserted and unasserted legal claims and regulatory matters arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which, in the opinion of management, are expected to result in losses in excess of insurance limits or have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation ts financial position. The federal government and many states have aggressively increased enforcement under Medicare and Medicaid antifraud and abuse laws and physician self-referral laws (STARK law and regulation). Recent federal initiatives have prompted a national review of federally funded healthcare programs. In addition, the federal government and many states have implemented programs to audit and recover potential overpayments to providers from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Corporation has implemented a compliance program to monitor conformance with applicable laws and regulations, but the possibility of future government review and enforcement action exists. (19) Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission Effective July 1, 2013, the Health System and the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) agreed to implement the Global Budget Revenue (GBR) methodology for the following hospitals: Medical Center, ROI, UM Midtown, UM Baltimore Washington, UM Charles Regional, UM St. Joseph, UM Memorial, UM Dorchester, UM Chester River, Shore Emergency Center, UM Upper Chesapeake, UM Harford Memorial, UM Prince George ts, and UM Laurel. The agreements will continue each year and on July 1 of each year thereafter; the agreements will renew for a one-year period unless it is canceled by the HSCRC or by the Corporation. The agreements were in place for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The GBR model is a revenue constraint and quality improvement system designed by the HSCRC to provide hospitals with strong financial incentives to manage their resources efficiently and effectively in order to slow the rate of increase in healthcare costs and improve healthcare delivery processes and outcomes. The GBR model is consistent with the Corporation ts mission to provide the highest value of care possible to its patients and the communities it serves. UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements June 30, 2019 and 2018 61 The GBR agreements establish a prospective, fixed revenue base rGBR cap s for the upcoming year. This includes both inpatient and outpatient regulated services. Under GBR, a hospital ts revenue for all HSCRC regulated services is predetermined for the upcoming year, regardless of changes in volume, service mix intensity, or mix of inpatient or outpatient services that occurred during the year. The GBR agreement allows the Corporation to adjust unit rates, within certain limits, to achieve the overall revenue base for the Corporation at year-end. Any overcharge or undercharge versus the GBR cap is prospectively subtracted from the subsequent year ts GBR cap. Although the GBR cap is fixed each year, it does not adjust for changes in volume or service mix. The GBR cap is also adjusted annually for inflation, and for changes in payor mix and uncompensated care. The Corporation will receive an annual adjustment to its cap for the change in population in the Corporation ts service areas. GBR is designed to encourage hospitals to operate efficiently by reducing excess utilization and managing patients in the appropriate care delivery setting. The HSCRC also may impose various other revenue adjustments, which could be significant in the future. The HSCRC utilizes a bad debt pool into which each of the regulated hospitals in Maryland participates. The funds in the bad debt pool are distributed to the hospitals that exceed the state average based upon the amount of uncompensated care delivered to patients during the year. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Corporation recognized a net distribution from the pool of approximately $23,974 and $14,015, respectively, which is recorded as net patient service revenue. (20) Subsequent Events The Corporation evaluated all events and transactions that occurred after June 30, 2019 and through October 28, 2019, the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. Other than described in note 5, the Corporation did not have any material recognizable subsequent events during the period. 62 (Continued)Schedule 1 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidating Balance Sheet Information by Division June 30, 2019 (In thousands) University of Maryland Baltimore Medical Rehabilitation Washington Center & Orthopaedic Medical Shore Charles St. Joseph Upper Capital UM Health UMMS Consolidated Assets & Affiliates Institute Midtown System Regional Regional Health Chesapeake Region Plans Foundation Other Eliminations total Current assets: Cash and current portion 59,693 \u2014 497 1,484 1,020 529 1,281 \u2014 406 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 70,478 Assets held for sale \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 116,828 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 116,828 Prepaid expenses and other \u2014 \u2014 885,640 Assets limited as to use, less current portion: Investments held for collateral 94,786 1,115 1,721 8,929 4,313 2,722 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 113,586 Debt service funds 29,550 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 29,550 Construction funds 374,671 19,573 1,931 19,023 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 463,122 Board designated and escrow funds \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 76,564 (181) \u2014 43,985 \u2014 \u2014 20,321 \u2014 36,486 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 204,081 Funds restricted by donor \u2014 \u2014 1,093 \u2014 34,384 \u2014 11,989 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 30,789 \u2014 \u2014 78,255 Economic and beneficial interests in the net assets of related organizations 215,768 36,950 531 10,337 3,709 OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidating Balance Sheet Information by Division June 30, 2019 (In thousands) University of Maryland Baltimore Medical Rehabilitation Washington Center & Orthopaedic Medical Shore Charles St. Joseph Upper Capital UM Health UMMS Consolidated Liabilities and Net Assets & Affiliates Institute Midtown System Regional Regional Health Chesapeake Region Plans Foundation Other Eliminations total Current liabilities: Trade \u2014 139,163 Lines of credit 130,000 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 31,300 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 161,300 Short-term financing 150,000 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 150,000 Other current held for sale \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 60,830 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 60,830 Long-term debt subject to short-term remarketing arrangements 18,895 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 18,895 Current portion of long-term debt 14,724 551 852 4,642 3,226 15,043 5,418 Interest rate swap liabilities 196,174 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 196,174 1-a UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MEDICAL SYSTEM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Consolidating Balance Sheet Information by Division -
