ICH domainsSocial practices, knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe 2. Short description PROMETRA is an international organisation that was established in 1971. With 28 national chapters \u2014 mostly in Africa \u2014 dedicated to the safeguarding of African traditional medicine and indigenous science through research, training and advocacy. PROMETRA-Uganda has mobilised traditional health practitioners into groups and associations and brings them together to share, learn and improve their healing practices. Hundreds of traditional health practitioners converge weekly at its training centre to, among other things, study the causes and symptoms of illnesses such as HIV / AIDS or malaria. The centre and its approach has not only strengthened the sustainability of the work of traditional health practitioners, but has also increased public awareness of traditional medicine in Uganda. Further information: More information on PROMETRA-Uganda and their work can be found in the following resources (all in English), as well as two examples of their work in fighting HIV and malaria: [http://prometra.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PROMETRA-Uganda-profile-2010.pdf](http://prometra.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PROMETRA-Uganda-profile-2010.pdf) The 30-hectare plot of land set in a forest which acts as a natural pharmacy and a library of raw materials: [https://unitedplantsavers.org/forest-school-for-traditional-health-practitioners-prometra-uganda/](https://unitedplantsavers.org/forest-school-for-traditional-health-practitioners-prometra-uganda/) 'Drawing on culture to fight HIV/AIDS - six stories - 2008' [http://crossculturalfoundation.or.ug/Downloads/drawing_on_culture_to_fight_hivaids.pdf](http://crossculturalfoundation.or.ug/Downloads/drawing_on_culture_to_fight_hivaids.pdf) Medicinal plants used in malaria treatment by PROMETRA herbalists in Uganda [http://prometra.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Medicinal-Plants-Used-in-Malaria-Treatment-by-PROMETRA-herbalists-in-Uganda-2014.pdf](http://prometra.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Medicinal-Plants-Used-in-Malaria-Treatment-by-PROMETRA-herbalists-in-Uganda-2014.pdf) See also the African Union's guidelines on managing traditional knowledge and biological diversity: [https://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/user_upload/campaigns/Treaty_and_Nagoya_Workshop_2015/AU_Practical_Guidelines_on_ABS-English.pdf](https://www.bioversityinternational.org/fileadmin/user_upload/campaigns/Treaty_and_Nagoya_Workshop_2015/AU_Practical_Guidelines_on_ABS-English.pdf) 3.
