A former market gardener with no medical qualifications, Temple offered an idiosyncratic New Age blend of crystal dowsing, energy-enhancing neolithic circles, oriental medicine, Hebrew teaching, homeopathy and herbalism. His ministry was based on the idea that each of us has a given energy level at conception which is eroded over time by illness, stress, unnatural foodstuffs, vaccinations and bottle feeding (a practice that disconnects a baby from its birth sign). Eventually the point is reached at which we can no longer absorb minerals, vitamins and other nutrients, causing gaps in our energy levels. Central to Temple's therapy was dowsing or divination, in which a pendulum is used to detect weak spots in the body's electromagnetic field. \"Every part of the body has its own resonating frequency,\" Temple explained, \"and if there's any aberration in the availability of nutrients, then the resonance of that part of the body is changed.\" Using his crystal dowsing pendulum (and for a \u00a340 consultation fee), Temple claimed he could home in on the weak areas, harness power from heavenly bodies and supply (for a consideration) a remedy from a vast collection of exotic pills and potions with names such as Volcanic Memory, Rancid Butter, Monkey Sticks, Banana Stem and Sphincter. These were not ingested, but strapped to the body along meridian energy lines. If these failed to do the trick, patients could boost their self-restorative powers by sitting in a special vibrating chair, or capture the healing power of the sun and moon in Temple's neolithic circle - an arrangement of boulders, garden seats and crop circle-style engravings on the lawn beside his Surrey bungalow. After the Duchess of York consulted Temple in 1995 for her \"energy blockages\", Temple told her to walk in circles to restore her health and helped \"defog her brain\" and shake off her reliance on slimming pills. She described him as \"an amazing man\". Jerry Hall, who consulted him about her bad back, called Temple a \"genius miracle-worker\" and increased the frequency of her visits to him to combat the stress of her divorce from Mick Jagger. With Diana, the problem was lead poisoning, a condition Temple diagnosed by dowsing while watching her give a television interview, during which he noticed her tendency to bow her head. He immediately informed the Duchess of York and, shortly afterwards, took a call from the princess herself. He was absolutely right, she told him. As a schoolgirl she had \"pierced her right cheek with a pencil, the point had broken off into her face\". During their subsequent consultation, Temple was able to extract the poison and help the Princess to hold her head up properly again. It was said that Cherie Booth, QC, consulted Temple for swollen legs on the recommendation of her \"lifestyle guru\", Carole Caplin. He treated her by swinging his pendulum over the affected areas and feeding her strawberry leaves grown within the elecromagnetic field of his neolithic circle. In his autobiography, Medicine Man, Temple claimed to have \"helped the lame to walk, the barren to conceive and the sad to smile\". But his appetite for publicity was not always appreciated by his celebrity clients. When he told an interviewer on Carlton Television about the Duchess of York's use of slimming pills, friends of the Duchess were quoted as saying that, while she had given him permission to talk about her \"in general terms\", she had not expected him to go into quite so much detail. The fourth of six sons of a Polish-Jewish refugee, Jack Temple was born Jack Templiski in the East End of London. He claimed he had lived 120 previous lives and could trace his origins back 97,000 years. A sickly child, he suffered from rickets and recurrent digestive problems, which he would later attribute to a \"blockage\" inherited from a wound sustained by his father, who had been shot in the leg during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1905. When World War II broke out, Temple was deemed unfit for military service. Instead he became a farm labourer in Surrey. This led him to take an interest in agriculture, diet and nutrition, and, with his wife Blanche, he set himself up as an organic market gardener. He followed the Hay diet as part of a cure for his recurrent health problems, and claimed to have lived for a whole year on swedes, nettles and cheese. In the early 1970s he exhibited his organic catalogue at a mind and body festival in London, where he met someone who practised dowsing using a pendulum. He decided to have a go himself and found he had the gift. His first patient was his wife, who had lost the use of her limbs after being struck by lightning in a field near Bath. He dowsed and treated her with plant-based remedies to \"pull out\" the lightning and she recovered. Eventually he went into practice as an alternative therapist, opening his clinic, the Temple Healing Centre, in a prefabricated hut at Pyrford, near West Byfleet. By the 1990s, he was seeing about 50 patients a week, although regular visits were not a necessity. Patients were asked to hand over a lock of hair and fingernail clippings, which Temple kept on his shelves in jars of alcohol preservative. By swinging his pendulum over the relevant jar, Temple claimed to be able to connect to the individual's electromagnetic fields to tell if they were healthy or ill without seeing them. Away from the clinic, Temple used his dowsing pendulum to help him choose foods when visiting his local supermarket. Among his many other achievements, Temple claimed to have \"seen the bald pates of middle-aged and elderly men begin to spring hair again\". The therapy appears not to have worked in his case, but that may have been a matter of personal choice. He also discovered the cause of an inherited weakness in his family in toxins that had entered the family system through a black clothing dye commonly used in the 19th century. He devised a remedy consisting of \"the distilled essence of 21 flowers dowsed for on the Isle of Skye\" and confidently expected to live until he was 140. He married, in 1940, Blanche Vyze, who survives him with their son and two daughters. The Telegraph, London "}
