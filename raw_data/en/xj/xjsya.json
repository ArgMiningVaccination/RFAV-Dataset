Unique in its holistic, natural approach to health and healing, naturopathic medicine is patient-centered and offers tailored treatments to help patients obtain optimal wellness on all levels - physical, emotional, chemical. Wellness means more than the absence of pain and disease. It is having the energy to work and enjoy life to its fullest potential. Naturopathic practitioners help restore health by supporting the body's inherent healing mechanisms using minimally invasive, natural methods. The Philosophy of Naturopathic Medicine is founded on the following principles: - The healing power of nature - Find and treat the cause - First, do no harm - Treat the whole person - Doctor as teacher - Prevention A naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year, graduate-level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD, but also studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum, the naturopathic physician also studies clinical nutrition, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine and counseling. A naturopathic physician takes rigorous professional national board exams.
