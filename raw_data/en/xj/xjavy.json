Introduction Your health Plan is an Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) which is a comprehensive Network Plan. If You choose a Network Provider, You will receive Network benefits. Out of Network is covered f or emergency care only . Providers are compensated using a variety of payment arrangements, including fee for service, per diem, discounted fees, and global reimbursement. All Covered Services must be Medically Necessary, and coverage or certification of services that are not Medically Necessary may be denied. Copayment Certain Network services may be subject to a Copayment amount which is a flat -dollar amount You will be charged at the time services are rendered. Copayments are the responsibility of the Member . Any Copayment amounts required are shown in the Schedule of Benefits. 20 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT - PRECERTIFICATION Your Plan includes the processes of Precertification, Predetermination and Post Service Clinical Claims Review to determine when services should be covered by Your Plan. Their purpose is to promote the delivery of cost -effective medical care by reviewing the use of procedures and, where appropriate, the setting or place of service that they are performed. Your Plan requires that Covered Services be Medically Necessary for benefits to be provided. When setting or place of service is part of the review, services that can be safely provided to you in a lower cost setting will not be Medically Necessary if they are performed in a hig her cost setting. Prior Authorization : Network Providers are required to obtain prior authorization in order for You to receive benefits for certain services. The Claims Administrator may determine that a service that was initially prescribed or request ed is not Medically Necessary if You have not previously tried alternative treatments which are more cost effective. The Claims Administrator will utilize its clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy and other internally developed clinical guidelines, and preventive care clinical coverage guidelines, to assist in making Medical Necessity decisions. The Claims Administrator reserves the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically. Your Employer's Group Health P lan Document takes precedence over these guidelines. If You have any questions regarding the information contained in this section, You may call the Customer Service telephone number on Your Identific ation Card or visit www.anthem. com. Types of Requests: Precertification - A required review of a service, treatment or admission for a benefit coverage determination which must be obtained prior to the service, treatment or admission start date. For emergency admissions, You , Your authorized representative or Physician must notify the Claims Administrator within 2 business days after the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertification is not required unless there is a complication and/or the m other and baby are not discharged at the same time. There are no retro-authorizations on this plan. Predetermination - An optional, voluntary Prospective or Concurrent request for a benefit coverage determination for a service or treatment. The Claims Administrator will review Your Plan to determine if there is an exclusion for the service or treatment. If there is a related clinical coverage guideline, the benefit coverage review will include a review to determine whether the service meets the definit ion of Medical Necessity under this Plan or is Experimental/Investigative as that term is defined in this Plan. Post Service Clinical Claims Review - A Retrospective review for a benefit coverage determination to determine the Medical Necessity or Experim ental/Investigative nature of a service, treatment or admission that did not require Precertification and did not have a Predetermination review performed. Retrospective r eviews occur for a service, treatment or admission in which the Claims Administrator has a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by the Claims Administrator. Failure to Obtain Precertification Penalty : There is a 100% penalty for failure to obtain precertification on this plan. IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU OR YOUR PROVIDER DO NOT OBTAIN THE REQUIRED PRECERTIFICATION, A PENALTY WILL APPLY AND YOUR OUT OF POCKET COSTS MAY INCREASE . 21 The following list is not all inclusive and is subject to change; please call the Customer Service telephone number on Your Identifica tion Card to confirm the most current list and requirements for Your Plan .

In addition, the Claims Administrator may select certain qualifying Providers to participate in a program that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. The Claims Administrator may also exempt Your claim from medical revie w if certain conditions apply. Just because the Claims Administrator exempts a process, Provider or claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that the Claims Administrator will do so in the future, or will do so in the fut ure for any other Provider, claim or Member. The Claims Administrator may stop or modify any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may determine whether a Provider is participating in certain programs by contacting the customer service num ber on the back of your ID card.

Applying these rules may affect Claims Administrator's determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. The Claims Administrator's application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services You received were not Medically Necessary. It means the Claims Administrator has determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, Your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the singl e procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other healthcare professional, the Plan may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts f or those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provi der Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or an Out-of-Network Provider. A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specific product or in a special Center of Excellence or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with the Claims Administrator. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this/ Your Plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with the Claims Administrator to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send You a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, You may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent You have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Customer Service for help in finding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem. com. Providers who have not signed any contract with the Claims Administrator and are not in any of the Claims Administrator's networks are Out -of-Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governi ng claims filed by certain ancillary providers. For Covered Services You receive from an Out -of-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Plan will be one of the following as determined by the Claims Administrator: 1. An amount based on the Clai ms Administrator's Out -of-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which the Claims Administrator has established in its' discretion, and which the Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the followi ng: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with the Claims Administrator, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 48 2. An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, the Administrator will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3. An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable providers' fees and costs to deliver care; or 4. An amount negotiated by the Claims Administrator or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provid er. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management ; or 5. An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Out -of-Network Provider. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but contracted for other products with the Claims Administrator are also considered Out -of-Network . For this/ Your Plan, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the five methods shown above unless the contract between the Claims Administrator and t hat Provider specifies a different amount. Unlike Network Providers, Out-of-Network Providers may send You a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be significant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower Out of Pocket costs to You. Please call Customer Service for help in finding a Network Pr ovider or visit the Claims Administ rator's website at www.anthem. com. Customer Service is also available to assist You in determining this/ Your Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from an Out -of-Network Provider. In order for the Clai ms Administrator to assist You, You will need to obtain from Your Provider the specific procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate Your Out of Pocket responsibility. Although Customer Service can assist You with this pre- service information, the final Maximum Allowed Amount for Your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on Your plan design, You may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as Your cost share amount (for example Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost share amount and Out -of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether You received s ervices from a Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Specifically, You may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on Your benefits when using Out -of-Network Providers. Please see the Schedule of Benefits in this Benefit Booklet for Your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call Customer Service to learn how this Plan's benefits or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider You use. The Plan will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You ma y be responsible for the total amount billed by Your Provider for non- Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by a Network or Out -of-Network Provider. Non- Covered Services include services specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of this Benefit Booklet and services received after benefits have been exhausted. Benefits may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benefit caps or day/visit limits. In some instances You may only be asked to pay the lower Network cost s haring amount when You use an Out-of-Network Provider. For example, if You go to a Network Hospital or Provider facility and receive Covered Services from an Out -of-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist 49 who is employed by or contracted with a Network Hospital or facility, You will pay the Network cost share amounts for those Covered Services. However, You also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge. Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, the Plan may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service You rec eive from an Out -of-Network Provider. In such circumstance, You must contact the Claims Administrator in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. The Plan also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if You r eceive Emergency services from an Out -of-Network Provider and are not able to contact the Claims Administrator until after the Covered Service is rendered. If the Plan authorizes a Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from an O ut-of-Network Provider, You also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Out -of-Network Provider's charge. Please contact Customer Service for Authorized Services information or to request authorization. Servi ces Performed During Same Session The Plan may combine the reimbursement of Covered Services when more than one service is performed during the same session. Reimbursement is limited to the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount . If services are performed by Out- of-Network Providers, then You are responsible for any amounts charged in excess of the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount with or without a referral or regardless if allowed as an Authorized Service . Contact the Claims Administrator for more information. Processing Your Claim You are responsible for submitting Your claims for expenses not normally billed by and payable to a Hospital or Physician. Always make certain You have Your Identification Card with You. Be sure the Hospital or Physician's office personnel copy Your name, and identification numbers (including the 3- letter prefix) accurately when completing forms relating to Your coverage. Timeliness of Fili ng for Member Submitted Claims To receive benefits, a properly completed claim form with any necessary reports and records must be filed by You within 12 months of the date of service. Payment of claims will be made as soon as possible following receipt of the claim, unless more time is required because of incomplete or missing information. In thi s case, You will be notified of the reason for the delay and will receive a list of all information needed to continue processing Your claim. After this data is received, the Claims Administrator will complete claims processing. No request for an adjustment of a claim can be submitted later than 12 months after the claim has been paid. Necessary Information In order to process Your claim, the Claims Administrator may need information from the provider of the service. As a Member , You agree to authorize t he Physician, Hospital, or other provider to release necessary information. The Claims Administrator will consider such information confidential. However, the Plan and the Claims Administrator have the right to use this information to defend or explain a denied claim. Explanation of Benefits After You receive medical care, You will generally receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). The EOB is a summary of the coverage You receive. The EOB is not a bill, but a statement sent by the Claims Administrator , to help You understand the coverage You are receiving. The EOB shows: total amounts charged for services/supplies received; the amount of the charges satisfied by Your coverage; 50 the amount for whi ch You are responsible (if any); and general information about Your Appeals rights and for ERISA plans, information regarding the right to bring an action after the Appeals process. Unauthorized Use of Identification Card If You permit Your Identification Card to be used by someone else or if You use the card before coverage is in effect or after coverage has ended, You will be liable for payment of any expenses incurred resulting from the unauthorized use. Fraudulent misuse could also result in termination of the coverage. Fraudulent statements on enrollment forms and/or claims for services or payment involving all media (paper or electronic) may invalidate any payment or claims for services and be grounds for voiding the Member 's coverage. This includes fraudulent acts to obtain medical services and/or Pr escription Drugs. Assignment You authorize the Claims Administrator , on behalf of the Employer, to make payments directly to Providers for Covered Services. The Claims Administrator also reserves the right to make payments directly to You. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims, an Alternate Recipient, or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by the Claims Administrator will dis charge the Employer's obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign Your right to receive payment to anyone else, except as required by a \"Qualified Medical Child Support O rder\" as defined by ERISA or any applicable Federal law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Claims Administrator will not honor a request to withhold payment of the claims submitted. The coverage and any benefits under the Plan are not assignable by any Member without the written consent of the Plan, except as provided above. Questions About Coverage or Claims If You have questions about Your coverage, contact Your Plan Administrator or the Claims Administrator's Customer Service Department. Be sure to always give Your Member Identification number. When asking about a claim, give the f ollowing information: identification number; patient's name and address; date of service and type of service received; and provider name and address (Hospital or Physician). To find out if a Hospital or Physician is a Network Provider, call them directly or call the Claims Administrator. The Plan does not supply You with a Hospital or Physician. In addition, neither the Plan nor the Claims Administrator is responsible for any Injuries or damages You may suffer due to actions of any Hospital, Physician or other person. In order to process Your claims, the Claims Administrator or the Plan Administrator may request additional information about the medical treatment You received and/or other group health insurance You may have. This information will be treated confidentially. An oral explanation of Your benefits by an employee of the Claims Administrator, Plan Administrator or Plan Sponsor is not legally binding. Any correspondence mailed to You will be sent to Your most current address. You are responsible for notifying the Plan Administrator or the Claims Administrator of Your new address. 51 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL For purposes of these Appeal provisions, \"claim for benefits\" means a request for benefits under the plan. The term includes both pre- service and post -service claims. A pre -service claim is a claim for benefits under the plan for which You have not received the benefit or for which You may need to obtain approval in advance. A post -service claim is any other claim for benefits under the pla n for which You have received the service. If Your claim is denied or if Your coverage is rescinded: You will be provided with a written notice of the denial or rescission; and You are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial or rescission. The procedure the Claims Administrator will follow will satisfy the requirements for a full and fair review under applicable federal regulations . Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination If Your claim is denied, the Claims Administrator's notice of the adver se benefit determination (denial) will include: information sufficient to identify the claim involved ; the specific reason(s) for the denial; a reference to the specific plan provision(s) on which the Claims Administrator's determination is based; a descri ption of any additional material or information needed to perfect Your claim; an explanation of why the additional material or information is needed; a description of the plan's review procedures and the time limits that apply to them, including a statement of Your right to bring a civil action under ERISA if You appeal and the claim denial is upheld; information about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the claim determination and about Your right to request a copy of it free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision; and information about the scientific or clinical judgment for any determination based on medical necessity or experimental treatment, or about Your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision. the availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman who may assist You For claims involving urg ent/concurrent care: the Claims Administrator's notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent review process; and the Claims Administrator may notify You or Your authorized representative within 72 hours orally and then furnish a written notification. Appeals You have the right to appeal an adverse benefit determination (claim denial or rescission of coverage). You or Your authorized representative must file Your appeal within 180 calendar days after You are notified of the denial or rescission. You will have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting Your claim. The Claims Administrator's review of Your claim will take into account all information You submit, regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. The Claims Administrator shall offer a single mandatory level of appeal and an additional voluntary second level of appeal which may be a panel review, independent review, or other process consistent 52 with the entity reviewing the appeal. The time frame allowed for the Claims Administrator to complete its review is dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g. , pre-service, concurrent, post -service, urgent, etc.). For pre -service claims involving urgent/concurrent care , You may obtain an expedited appeal. You or Your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator and You by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To file an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, You or Your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at the number shown on Your ident ification card and provide at least the following information: the identity of the claimant; the date (s) of the medical service; the specific medical condition or symptom; the provider's name; the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. All other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the Member or the Member's authorized representative , except where the acceptance of oral appeals is otherwis e required by the nature of the appeal (e.g., urgent care). You or Your authorized representative must submit a request for review to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, P.O. Box 105568, Atlanta, Georgia 30348 You must include Your Member Identification Number when submitting an appeal. Upon request, the Claims Administrator will provide, without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to Your claim. \"Relevant\" means that the document, record, or other information: was relied on in making the benefit determination; or was submitted, considered, or produced in the course of making the benefit determination; or demonstrates compliance with processes and safeguards to ensure that cl aim determinations are made in accordance with the terms of the plan, applied consistently for similarly -situated claimants; or is a statement of the plan's policy or guidance about the treatment or benefit relative to Your diagnosis. The Claims Administr ator will also provide You, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated in connection with Your claim. In addition, before You receive an adverse benefit determination on review based on a new or additional rationale, the Claims Administrator will provide You, free of charge, with the rationale. For Out of State Appeals You have to file Provider appeals with the Host Plan. This means Providers must file appeals w ith the same plan to which the claim was filed. How Your Appeal will be Decided When the Claims Administrator considers Your appeal, the Claims Administrator will not rely upon the initial benefit determination or, for voluntary second- level appeals, to the earlier appeal determination. The review wi ll be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination. A voluntary second- level review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination or the first -level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination or first - level appeal determination. 53 If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whet her the treatment is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical field involved in making the judgment. This health car e professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier determination or who works for one who was consulted in making an earlier determination. Notification of the Outcome of the Appeal If You appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent car e, the Claims Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of Your request for appeal. If You appeal any other pre -service claim , the Claims Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of Your request for appeal . If You appeal a post- service claim , the Claims Administrator will notify You of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of Your request for appeal. Appeal De nial If Your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benefit determination. The notification from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above section entitled \"Notice of Adverse Benefit Determinat ion.\" Voluntary Second Level Appeals If You are dissatisfied with the Plan's mandatory first level appeal decision, a voluntary second level appeal may be available. If You would like to initiate a second level appeal, please write to the address listed above. Voluntary ap peals must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the denial of the first level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appeal prior to submitting a request for an independent External Review. Voluntary Th ird Level Appeals After you have received a voluntary second level appeal, you have the right to request in writing, a voluntary third level appeal through the University of Kentucky. You have 30 days to submit a request for a third level of review. Send a written request to: The Associate Vice President, Human Resource Services, The University of Kentucky, 101 Scovell Hall, Lexington, KY 40506. Include any additional information you have that supports the request. You don't have to send the information fr om the first or second level appeal. External Review If the outcome of the mandatory first level appeal is adverse to You and it was based on medical judgment, You may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to federal law. You must subm it Your request for External Review to the Claims Administrator within 45 days the notice of Your final internal adverse determination. A request for a External Review must be in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re- send the information that You submitted for internal appeal. However, You are encouraged to submit any additional information that You think is important for review. For pre -service claims involv ing urgent/concurrent care, You may proceed with an Expedited External Review without filing an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the Claims Administrator's internal appeal process. You or Your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Claims Administrator and You by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To proceed with an Expedited Exter nal Review, You or Your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at the number shown on Your identification card and provide at least the following 54 information: the identity of the claimant; the date (s) of the medical service; the s pecific medical condition or symptom; the provider's name; the service or supply for which approval of benefits was sought; and any reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. All other requests for External Review should be subm itted in writing unless the Claims Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement . Such requests should be submitted by You or Your authorized representative to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, P.O. Bo x 105568, Atlanta, Georgia 30348 You must include Your Member Identification Number when submitting an appeal. This is not an additional step that You must take in order to fulfill Your appeal procedure obligations described above. Your decision to seek External Review will not affect Your rights to any other benefits under this health care plan. There is no charge for You to initiate an independent External Review. The External Review decision is final and binding on all parties except for any relief av ailable through applicable state laws or ERISA. Requirement to file an Appeal before filing a lawsuit No lawsuit or legal action of any kind related to a benefit decision may be filed by You in a court of law or in any other forum, unless it is commenced within three years of the Plan's final decision on the claim or other request for benefits. If the Plan decides an appeal is untimely, the Plan's latest decision on the merits of the underlying claim or benefit request is the final decision date. You mus t exhaust the Plan's internal Appeals Procedure but not including any voluntary level of appeal, before filing a lawsuit or taking other legal action of any kind against the Plan. If Your health benefit plan is sponsored by Your employer and subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and Your appeal as described above results in an adverse benefit determination, You have a right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Claims Administrator reserves the right to modify the policies, procedures and timeframes in this section upon further clarification from Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Labor. 55 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies when You have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Please note that several terms specific to this provision are listed below. Some of these terms have different meanings in other parts of the Benefit Booklet, e.g., Plan. For this provision onl y, \"Plan\" will have the meanings as specified below. In the rest of the Benefit Booklet, Plan has the meaning listed in the Definitions section. The order of benefit determination rules determine the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benefits . The Plan that pays first is called the Primary Plan . The Primary Plan must pay benefits according to its policy terms regardless of the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan . The Secondary Plan may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense . The Allowable expense under COB is generally the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts. A Network Provider can bill You for any remaining Coinsurance and/or Copayment under the higher of the Plans' allowable amounts. This higher allowable amount may be more than the Plan's Maximum Allowable Amount. COB DEFINITIONS Plan is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. 1. Plan includes: Group and non group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts; Health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts; Uninsured arrangements of group or group- type coverage; Coverage under group or non group closed panel plans; Group- type contracts; Medical care components of long term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benefits under group or individual automobile contracts (whether \"fault\" or \"no fault\"); Other governmental benefits, except for Medic are, Medicaid or a government plan that, by law, provides benefits that are in excess of those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan. 2. Plan does not include: Accident only coverage; Specified disease or specified accident coverage; Limited health benefit coverage; Benefits for non-medical components of long term care policies; Hospital indemnity coverage benefits or other fixed indemnity coverage; School accident -type coverages covering grammar, high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a twenty -four (24) hour or \"to and from school\" basis; and Medicare supplement policies . Each contract for coverage under items 1. or 2. above is a separate Plan . If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing health care benefits that the COB provision applies to and which may be reduced because of the benefits of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benefits is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benefits, such as dental benefits, coordinating only with similar benefits, and may apply another COB provision to coor dinate other benefits. The order of benefit determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when You have health care coverage under more than one Plan . 56 When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benef its first before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benefits. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benefits after those of another Plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that all Plan benefits do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering You. When a Plan provides benefits in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering You is not an Allowable expense . In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is p rohibited from charging You is not an Allowable expense; however, if a Provider has a contractual agreement with both the Primary and Secondary Plans, then the higher of the contracted fees is the Allowable expense, and the Provider may charge up to the hi gher contracted fee. The following are non Allowable expenses : 1. The difference between the cost of a semi -private Hospital room and a private Hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private Hospital room expenses. 2. If You are covered by 2 or more Plans that calculate their benefit payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement methods, any amount in excess of the highest reimbur sement amount for a specific benefit is not an Allowable expense. 3. If You are covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense. 4. If You are covered by one Plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method and another Plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement will be the Allowable expense for all Plans . However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benefit or service for a specific negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the Provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment will be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benefits. 5. The amount that is subject to the Primary high- Deductible health plan's Deductible , if the Claims Administrator has been advised by You that all Plans covering You are high- Deductible health plans and You intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with S ection 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Closed panel plan is a Plan that provides health care benefits primarily in the form of services through a panel of Providers that contract with or are employed by the Plan , and that excludes coverage for services provided by other Providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than on e half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION RULES When You are covered by two or more Plans , the rules for determining the order of benefit payments are: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benefits according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits under any other Plan . 1. Except as provided in Paragraph 2. below, a Plan that does not contain a Coordination of Benefits provision that is consistent with this COB provision is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. 2. Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benefits and provides that this supplementary cov erage will be excess to any 57 other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are placed over base plan Hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are writ ten in connection with a Closed panel plan to provide Out -of- Network benefits. A Plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benefits only when it is secondary to that other Plan . Each Plan determines i ts order of benefits using the first of the following rules that apply: Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent. The Plan that covers You other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan, and the Plan that covers You as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if You are a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering You as a Dependent and primary to the Plan covering You as other than a Dependent (e.g. , a retired employee), then the order of benefits between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering You as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan covering You as a Dependent is the Primary Plan . Rule 2 - Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benefits is determined as follows: 1. For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan ; or if both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan . 2. For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: If a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; If a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits; If a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benefits; or If there is no court decree assigning responsibility for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: - The Plan covering the Custodial parent ; - The Plan covering the Spouse of the Custodial parent ; - The Plan covering the non- custodial parent ; and then - The Plan covering the Spouse of the non-custodial parent . 3. For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of item 1. above will determine the order of benefits as if those individuals were the parents of the child. Rule 3 - Active Employee or Retired or Laid -off Employee . The Plan that covers You as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan . The Plan also covering You as a retired or laid- off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if You are a Dependent of an active employee and You are a Dependent of a retired or laid- off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result , the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this 58 rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. Rule 4 - COBRA. If You are covered under COBRA or under a right of continuat ion provided by other federal law and are covered under another Plan , the Plan covering You as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering You as a Dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan . If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benefits. This rule does not apply when the person is covered either: (a) as a non- Dependent under both Plans (i.e. the person is covered under a right of continuation as a qualified beneficiary who, on the day before a qualifying event, was covered under the group health plan as an employee or as a retired employee and is covered under his or her own Plan as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree); or (b) as a Dependent under both plans (i.e. the person is covered under a right of continuation as a qualified beneficiary who, on the day before a qualifying event, was covered under the group health plan as a Dependent of an employee, member or subscriber or retired employee and is covered under the other plan as a Dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree). Rule 5 - Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage. The Plan that covered You longer is the Primar y Plan and the Plan that covered You the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. Rule 6 - If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benefits, the Allowable expenses will be shared equally between the Plans meeting the definition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan . EFFECT ON THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLAN When a Member is covered under two or more Plans which together pay more than this Plan's benefits, the Plan will pay this Plan's benefits according to the Order of Benefit Determination Rules. This Plan's benefit payments will not be affec ted when it is Primary. However, when this Plan is Secondary under the Order of Benefit Determination Rules, benefits payable by this Plan will be reduced by the combined benefits of all other Plans covering You or Your Dependent. When the benefits of th is Plan are reduced, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this Plan. If this Plan is secondary, the combined benefits of this Plan and the other Plan will never exceed what would have been prov ided by this Plan if primary. No benefits will be provided by this Plan when the amount paid by the other Plan is equal to or greater than the amount this Plan would have paid if Primary. If You are enrolled in two or more Closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non- panel Provider, benefits are not payable by one Closed panel plan, COB will not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel plans . RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND RELEASE NEEDED INFORMATION Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans . The Claims Administrator may get the facts it needs from or give them to other organizations or persons for the pur pose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benefits. The Claims Administrator need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under T his Plan must give the Claims Administrator any facts the Claims Administrator need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. 59 FACILITY OF PAYMENT A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, This Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under This Plan. This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. RIGHT OF RECOVERY If the amount of the payments made by This Plan is more than should have paid under this COB provision, the Plan may recover the excess from one or more of the persons: 1. the Plan has paid or for whom the Plan have paid; or 2. any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benefits or services provided for the Member. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. When a Covered Person Qualifies for Medicare Determining Which Plan is Primary To the extent permitted by law, this Plan will pay Benefi ts second to Medicare when You become eligible for Medicare, even if You don't elect it. There are, however, Medicare- eligible individuals for whom the Plan pays Benefits first and Medicare pays benefits second: Subscriber s with active current employment s tatus age 65 or older and their Spouses age 65 or older; and individuals with end -stage renal disease, for a limited period of time. Determining the Allowable Expense When This Plan is Secondary to Medicare If this Plan is secondary to Medicare, the Medic are approved amount is the Allowable Expense, as long as the Provider accepts Medicare. If the Provider does not accept Medicare, the Medicare limiting charge (the most a Provider can charge You if they don't accept Medicare) will be the A llowable Expense. Medicare payments, combined with Plan Benefits, will not exceed 100% of the total Allowable Expense. If You are eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicare, and this Plan is secondary to Medicare, Benefits payable under this Plan will be reduced by the amount that would have been paid if You had been enrolled in Medicare. 60 SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT These provisions apply when the Plan pays benefits as a result of injuries or illnesses You sustained and You have a right to a Recovery or have rec eived a Recovery from any source. Recovery A \"Recovery\" includes, but is not limited to, monies received from any person or party, any person's or party's liability insurance, uninsured/underinsured motorist proceeds, workers' compensation insurance or fund, \"no- fault\" insurance and/or automobile medical payments coverage, whether by lawsuit, settlement or otherwise. Regardless of how You or Your representative or any agreements characterize the money You receive as a Recovery, it shall be subject to these provisions. Subrogation The Plan has the right to recover payments it makes on Your behalf from any party responsible for compensating You for Your illnesses or injuries. The following apply: The Plan has first priority from any Recovery for the full amount of benefits it has paid regardless of whether You are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments You receive make You whole for Your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. You and Your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise the Plan's rights and do nothing to prejudice those rights. In the event that You or Your legal representative fail to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation rights, the Plan shall be entitled t o deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan. The Plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees fit against any person, party or entity to recover the benefits paid under the Plan. To the extent that the total asset s from which a Recovery is available are insufficient to satisfy in full the Plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by You, the Plan's subrogation claim shall be first satisfied before any part of a Recovery is applied to Your claim, Your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The Plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses or costs You incur without the Plan's prior written consent. The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney You hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan. Reimbursement If You obtain a Recovery and the Plan has not been repaid for the benefits the Plan paid on Your behalf, the Plan shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benefits paid on Your behalf and the following provisions will apply: You must reimburse the Plan from any Recovery to the extent of benefits the Plan paid on Your behalf regardless of whether the payments You receive mak e You whole for Your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. Notwithstanding any allocation or designation of Your Recovery (e.g., pain and suffering) made in a settlement agreement or court order, the Plan shall have a right of full recovery, in first priority , against any Recovery. Further, the Plan's rights will not be reduced due to Your negligence. You and Your legal representative must hold in trust for the Plan the proceeds of the gross Recovery (i.e., the total amount of Your Recovery before attorney fe es, other expenses or costs) to be paid to the Plan immediately upon Your receipt of the Recovery. You must reimburse the Plan, in first priority and without any set -off or reduction for attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The ''common fund'' doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney You hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benefits paid by the Plan. If You fail to repay the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatisfied portion of the amount of benefits the Plan has paid or the amount of Your Recovery whichever is less, from any future benefit under the Plan if: 61 1. the amount the Plan paid on Your behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by the Plan; or 2. You fail to cooperate. In the event t hat You fail to disclose the amount of Your settlement to the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount of the Plan's lien from any future benefit under the Plan. The Plan shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatisfied portions of the amount the Plan has paid or the amount of Your Recovery, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom the Plan has made payments on Your behalf. In such a circumstance, it may then be Your obligation to pay the Provider the full billed amount, and the Plan will not have any obligation to pay the Provider or reimburse You. The Plan is entitled to reimbursement from any Recovery, in first priority, even if the Recovery does not fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages or fully compensate You or make You whole. Your Duties You must notify the Plan promptly of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal Injury or illness to You occurred and all information regarding the parties involved. You must cooperate with the Plan in the investigation, settlement and protection of the Plan's rights. In the event that You or Your legal representative fail to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benefits under the Plan. You must not do anything to prejudice the Plan's rights. You must send the Plan copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal Injury or illness to You. You must promptly notify the Plan if You retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is filed on Your behalf. The Plan Sponsor has sole discretion to interpret the terms of the Subrogation and Reimbursement provision of this Plan in its entirety and reserves the right to make changes as it deems necessary. If the covered person is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor's trustee, guardian, parent, or other representative, shal l be subject to this provision. Likewise, if the covered person's relatives, heirs, and/or assignees make any Recovery because of injuries s ustained by the covered person, that Recovery shall be subject to this provision. The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no- fault automobile insurance policy or personal Injury protection policy regardless of any election made by You to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. The Plan is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing this provision. 62 GENERAL INFORMATION Entire Agreement This Benefit Booklet, the Administrative Services Agreement, t he Employer's application, any Riders, Endorsements or attachments, and the individual applications of the Subscribers and Members, if any, constitute the entire agreement between the Claims Administrator and the Employer and as of the Effective Date, supersede all other agreements between the parties. Any and all statements made to the Claims Administrator by the Employer, and any and all statements made to the Employer by the Claims Administrator , are representations and not warranties, and no such statement unless it is contained in a written application for coverage under the Plan, shall be used in defense to a claim under the Plan. Form or Content of Benefit Booklet No agent or employee of the Claims Administrator is authorized to change the form or c ontent of this Benefit Booklet. Such changes can be made only through an endorsement authorized and signed by an officer of the Employer. Circumstances Beyond the Control of the Plan The Claims Administrator shall make a good- faith effort to arrange for an alternative method of administering benefits. In the event of circumstances not within the control of the Claims Administrator or Employer, including but not limited to: a major disaster, epidemic, the complete or partial destruction of facilities, riot, civil insurrection, labor disputes not within the control of the Claims Administrator , disability of a significant part of a Network Provider's personnel or similar causes, or the rendering of health care services provided by the Plan is delayed or rendered impractical the Claims Administrator shall make a good- faith effort to arrange for an alternative method of administering benefits. In such event, the Claims Administrator and Network Providers shall administer and render services under the Plan ins ofar as practical, and according to their best judgment; but the Claims Administrator and Network Providers shall incur no liability or obligation for delay, or failure to administer or arrange for services if such failure or delay is caused by such an event. Protected Health Information Under HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Privacy Regulations issued under HIPAA, contain provisions designed to protect the privacy of certain individually identifiable health information. Your Employer's Group Health Plan has a responsibility under the HIPAA Privacy Regulations to provide You with a Notice of Privacy Practices. This notice sets forth the Employer's rules regarding the disclosure of Your information and details about a number of individual rights You have under the Privacy Regulations. As the Claims Administrator of Your Employer's Plan, Anthem has also adopted a number of privacy practices and has described those in its Privacy Notice. If You would like a copy of Anthem's Notice, contact the customer service number on Your Identification Card. Workers' Compensation The benefits under the Plan are not designed to duplicate any benefit for which Members are eligible under the Workers' Compensation Law. All sums paid or payable by Workers' Compensation for services provided to a Member shall be reimbursed by, or on behalf of, the Member to the Plan to the extent the Plan has made or makes payment for such services. It is understood that coverage hereunder is not in lieu of, and shall not affect, any requirements for coverage under Workers' Compensation or equivalent employer liability or indemnification law . Other Government Programs Except insofar as applicable law would require the Plan to be the prim ary payor, the benefits under the Plan shall not duplicate any benefits to which Members are entitled, or for which they are eligible under 63 any other governmental program. To the extent the Plan has duplicated such benefits, all sums payable under such pr ograms for services to Members shall be paid by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan. Medicare Program When You are eligible for the Medicare program and Medicare is allowed by federal law to be the primary payor, the benefits described in this Benefit Description will be reduced by the amount of benefits allowed under Medicare for the same Covered Services . This reduction will be made whether or not You actually receive the benefits from Medicare. For the purposes of the calculation of benefits, if the Member has not enrolled in Medicare Part B, the Plan will calculate benefits as if they had enrolled. If You Are Under Age 65 With End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) If You are under age 65 and eligible for Medicare only because of ESRD (permanent kidney fail ure), the Plan will provide the benefits described in this Benefit Description before Medicare benefits. This includes the Medicare \"three month waiting period\" and the additional 30 months after the Medicare effective date. After 33 months, the benefits described in this Benefit Description will be reduced by the amount that Medicare allows for the same Covered Services . If You Are Under Age 65 With Other Disability If You are under age 65 and eligible for Medicare only because of a disability other than E SRD, the Plan will provide the benefits described in this Benefit Description before Medicare benefits. This is the case only if You are the actively employed Subscriber or the enrolled S pouse or child of the actively employed S ubscriber. If You Are Age 6 5 or Older If You are age 65 or older and eligible for Medicare only because of age, the Plan will provide the benefits described in this Benefit Description before Medicare. This can be the case only if You are an actively employed Subscriber or the enrol led Spouse of the actively employed S ubscriber. Right of Recovery Whenever payment has been made in error, the Plan will have the right to recover such payment from You or, if applicable, the Provider. In the event the Plan recovers a payment made in err or from the Provider, except in cases of fraud, the Plan will only recover such payment from the Provider during the 24 months after the date the Plan made the payment on a claim submitted by the Provider. The Plan reserves the right to deduct or offset an y amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. The cost share amount shown in Your Explanation of Benefits is the final determination and You will not receive notice of an adjusted cost share amount as a result of such recovery activity. The C laims Administrator has oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor and Subcontractor contracts. The Claims Administrator may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider, Vendor, or Subcontractor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. The Claims Administrator has established recovery policies to determine which recoveries are to be pursued, when to incur costs a nd expenses and settle or compromise recovery amounts. The Claims Administrator will not pursue recoveries for overpayments if the cost of collection exceeds the overpayment amount. The Claims Administrator may not provide You with notice of overpayments made by the Plan or You if the recovery method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. Relationship of Parties (Employer -Member -Claims Administrator ) Neither the Employer nor any Member is the agent or representative of the Claims Administrator . The Employer is fiduciary agent of the Member. The Claims Administrator 's notice to the Employer will constitute effective notice to the Member. It is the Employer's duty to notify the Claims Administrator of eligibility data in a timely manner. The Claims Administrator is not responsible for payment of Covered Services of Members if the Employer fails to provide the Claims Administrator with timely notification of Member enrollments or terminations. 64 Anthem Note The Employer, on behalf of itself and its Member s, hereby expressly acknowledges its understanding that the Administrative Services Agreement (which includes this Benefit Booklet) constitutes a contract solely between the Employer and Anthem and that Anthem is an independent corpor ation licensed to use the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in the State of Kentucky . The Blue Cross and Blue Shield marks are registered by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an association of independently licensed Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Washington, D.C. and in other countries. Further, Anthem is not contracting as the agent of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association or any other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan or licensee. This paragraph shall not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of Anthem other than those obligations created under other provisions of the Administrative Services Agreement or this Benefit Booklet. Notice Any notice given under the Pl an shall be in writing. The notices shall be sent to: The Employer at its principal place of business; to You at the Subscriber's address as it appears on the records or in care of the Employer. Modifications or Changes in Coverage The Plan Sponsor may change the benefits described in this Benefit Booklet and the Member will be informed of such changes as required by law. This Benefit Booklet shall be subject to amendment, modification, and termination in accordance with any of its provisions by the Em ployer, or by mutual agreement between the Claims Administrator and the Employer without the consent or concurrence of any Member. By electing medical and Hospital benefits under the Plan or accepting the Plan benefits, all Members legally capable of cont racting, and the legal representatives of all Members incapable of contracting, agree to all terms, conditions, and provisions hereof. Fraud Fraudulent statements on Plan enrollment forms or on electronic submissions will invalidate any payment or claims for services and be grounds for voiding the Member 's coverage. Acts Beyond Reasonable Control (Force Majeure) Should the performance of any act required by this coverage be prevented or delayed by reason of any act of God, strike, lock -out, labor troubles, restrictive government laws or regulations, or any other cause beyond a party's control, the time for the performance of the act will be extended for a period equivalent to the period of delay, and non- performance of the act during the period of delay w ill be excused. In such an event, however, all parties shall use reasonable efforts to perform their respective obligations. The Claims Administrator will adhere to the Plan Sponsor's instructions and allow the Plan Sponsor to meet all of the Plan Spons or's responsibilities under applicable state and federal law. It is the Plan Sponsor's responsibility to adhere to all applicable state and federal laws and the Claims Administrator does not assume any responsibility for compliance. Conformity with Law Any provision of the Plan which is in conflict with the applicable federal laws and regulations is hereby amended to conform with the minimum requirements of such laws. Clerical Error Clerical error, whether of the Claims Administrator or the Employer, in keeping any record pertaining to this coverage will not invalidate coverage otherwise validly in force or continue benefits otherwise validly terminated. 65 Policies and Procedures The Claims Administrator , on behalf of the Employer, may adopt reasonable p olicies, procedures, rules and interpretations to promote the orderly and efficient administration of the Plan with which a Member shall comply. Under the terms of the Administrative Service Agreement with Your Employer , the Claims Administrator has the authority, in its discretion, to institute from time to time, utilization management, car e management, disease management or wellness pilot initiatives in certain designated geographic areas. These pilot initiatives are part of the Claims Administrator's ongoing effort to find innovative ways to make available high quality and more affordable healthcare. A pilot initiative may affect some, but not all Members under the Plan. These programs will not result in the payment of benefits which are not provided i n the Employer's Group Health Plan, unless otherwise agreed to by the Employer. The Claim's Administrator reserves the right to discontinue a pilot initiative at any time without advance notice to Employer. Value -Added Programs The Claims Administrator m ay offer health or fitness related programs to Members, through which You may access discounted rates from certain vendors for products and services available to the general public. Products and services available under this program are not Covered Servic es under the Plan but are in addition to plan benefits. As such, program features are not guaranteed under Your Employer's Group health Plan and could be discontinued at any time. The Claims Administrator does not endorse any vendor, product or service ass ociated with this program. Program vendors are solely responsible for the products and services You receive. Waiver No agent or other person, except an authorized officer of the Employer, has authority to waive any conditions or restrictions of the Plan, to extend the time for making a payment to the Plan, or to bind the Plan by making any promise or representation or by giving or receiving any information. Employer's Sole Discretion The Employer may, in its sole discretion, cover services and supplies not specifically covered by the Plan. This applies if the Employer, with advice from the Claims Administrator , determines such services and supplies are in lieu of more expensive services and supplies which would otherwise be required for the care and treatment of a Member. Reservation of Discretionary Authority The Claims Administrator shall have all the powers necessary or appropriate to enable it to carry out its duties in connection with the operation of the Plan and interpretation of the Benefit Bookl et. This includes, without limitation, the power to construe the Administrative Services Agreement, to determine all questions arising under the Plan, to resolve Member Appeals and to make, establish and amend the rules, regulations and procedures with re gard to the interpretation of the Benefit Booklet of the Plan. A specific limitation or exclusion will override more general benefit language. Anthem has complete discretion to interpret the Benefit Booklet. The Claims Administrator 's determination shall be final and conclusive and may include, without limitation, determination of whether the services, treatment, or supplies are Medically Necessary, Experimental/Investigative, whether surgery is cosmetic, and whether charges are consistent with the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount . A Member may utilize all applicable Appeals procedures. Care Received Outside the United States You will receive Plan benefits for emergency care and treatment received outside the United States. Plan provisions will apply. An y care received must be a Covered Service. Please pay the provider of service at the time You receive treatment and obtain appropriate documentation of services received including bills, receipts, letters and medical narrative. This information should be submitted with Your claim. All 66 services will be subject to appropriateness of care. The Plan will reimburse You directly. Payment will be based on the Maximum Allowed Amount . Assignments of benefits to foreign providers or facilities cannot be honored. You may be required to complete an authorization form in order to have Your claims and other personal information sent to the Claims Administrator when You receive care in foreign countries. Failure to submit such authorizations may prevent foreign provi ders from sending Your claims and other personal information to the Claims Administrator . Governmental Health Care Programs Under federal law, for groups with 20 or more Employees, all active Employees (regardless of age) can remain on the G roup's Health Plan and receive group benefits as primary coverage. Also, Spouses (regardless of age) of active Employees can remain on the G roup's Health Plan and receive group benefits as primary coverage. Direct any questions about Medicare eligibility and enrollm ent to Your local Social Security Administration office. 67 WHEN COVERAGE TERMINATES Termination of Coverage (Individual) Membership for You and Your enrolled family members may be continued as long as You are employed by the Employer and meet eligibil ity requirements. It ceases if Your employment ends, if You no longer meet eligibility requirements, if the Plan ceases, or if You fail to make any required contribution toward the cost of Your coverage. In any case, Your coverage would end at the expiration of the period covered by Your last contribution. Coverage of an enrolled child ceases at the end of the month when the child attains the age 26 . Coverage of a disabled child over age 26 ceases if the child is found to be no longer totally or permanently disabled. Should You or any family Members be receiving covered care in the Hospital at the time Your membership terminates for reasons other than Your Employer's cancellation of this Plan, or failure to pay the required Premiums, benefits for Hospital Inpatient care will be provided until the date You are discharged from the Hospital. Certification of Prior Creditable Coverage If Your coverage under this Plan is terminated, You and Your covered Dependents will receive a certification that shows Your period of coverage under this health benefit plan. You may need to furnish the certification if You become eligible under another group health plan. You may also need the certification to buy, for yourself or Your family, an individual policy that does not exclude coverage for medical conditions that were present before Your enrollment. You and Your Dependents may request a certification within 24 months of losing coverage under this health benefit plan. You may also request a certification be provided to You at any other time, even if You have not lost coverage under this plan. If You have any questions, contact the customer service telephone number listed on Your Identification Card. Continuation of Coverage (Federal Law -COBRA) If Your coverage ends under the Plan, You may be entitled to elect continuation coverage in accordance with federal law. If Your employer normally employs 20 or more people, and Your employment is terminated for any reason other than gross misconduct You may elect from 18- 36 months of continuation benefits. You should contact Your Employer if You have any questions about Your COBRA rights. Qualifying events for Continuation Coverage under Federal Law (COBRA ) COBRA continuation coverage is available when Your group coverage would otherwise end because of certain \"qualifying events.\" After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, Your Spouse and Your Dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if covered on the day before the qualifying event and group coverage would be lost because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA must pay for this COBRA continuation coverage. This benefit entitles each member of Your fami ly who is enrolled in the company's e mployee welfare benefit plan to elect continuation independently. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to make independent benefit elections at the time of annual enrollment. Covered Subscriber s may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their Spouses, and parents or legal guardians may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. A child born to, or placed for adoption with, a covered Subscriber during the period of continuation coverage is also eligible for election of continuation coverage. 68 Initial Qualifying Event Length of Availability of Coverage For Employees: Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Reduction In Hours Worked 18 months For Spouses/ Dependents: A Covered Employee's Voluntary or Involuntary Termination (other than gross misconduct) or Reduction In Hours Worked Covered Employee's Entitlement to Medicare Divorce or Legal Separation Death of a Covered Employee 18 months 36 months 36 months 36 months For Dependents: Loss of Dependent Child Status 36 months Continuation coverage stops before the end of the maximum continuation period if the Member becomes entitled to Medicare benefits. If a continuing beneficiar y becomes entitled to Medicare benefits, then a qualified beneficiary - other than the Medicare beneficiary - is entitled to continuation coverage for no more than a total of 36 months. (For example, if You become entitled to Medicare prior to termination of employment or reduction in hours, COBRA continuation coverage for Your Spouse and children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement.) Second qualifying event If Your family has another qualifying event (such as a legal separation, divorce, etc.) during the initial 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, Your Spouse and Dependent children can receive up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months from the original qualifying event. Such additional coverage is only available if the second qualifying event would have caused Your Spouse or Dependent children to lose coverage under the Plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. A qualified beneficiary must give timely notice to the Plan Administrator in such a situation. Notification Requirements In the event of Your termination, lay -off, reduction in work hours or Medicare entitlement, Your Employer must notify the company's benefit Plan Administrator within 30 days. You must notify the company's benefit Plan Administrator within 60 days of Your divorce, legal separation or the failure of Your enrolled Dependents to meet the program's definition of Dependent. This notice must be provided in writing to the Plan Administrator. Thereafter, the Plan Administrator will notify qualified beneficiaries of their rights within 14 days. To continue enrollment, You or an eligible family member must make an election within 60 days of the date Your coverage would otherwise end, or the date the company's benefit Plan Administrator notifies You or Your family member of this right, whichever is later. You must pay the total Premium appropriate for the type of benefit coverage You choose to continue. If the Premium rate changes for active associates, Your monthly Premium will also change. The Premium You must pay cannot be more than 102% of the Premium charged for Employees with similar coverage, and it must be paid to the company's benefit Plan Administrator within 30 days of the date due, except that the initial Premium payment must 69 be made before 45 days after the initial election for continuation coverage, or Your continuation rights will be forfeited. For Employees who are determined, at the time of the qualifying event, to be disabled under Tit le II (OASDI) or Title XVI (SSI) of the Social Security Act, and Employees who become disabled during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage, coverage may continue from 18 to 29 months. These Employees' Dependents are also eligible for the 18 to 29-month disability extension. (This provision also applies if any covered family member is found to be disabled.) This provision would only apply if the qualified beneficiary provides notice of disability status within 60 days of the disabling determination. In these cases, the Employer can charge 150% of Premium for months 19 through 29. This would allow health coverage to be provided in the period between the end of 18 months and the time that Medicare begins coverage for the disabled at 29 months. (If a qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to no longer be disabled, such qualified beneficiary must notify the Plan Administrator of that fact in writing within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determ ination.) Trade Adjustment Act Eligible Individual If You don't initially elect COBRA coverage and later become eligible for trade adjustment assistance under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 due to the same event which caused You to be eligible initially for COBRA coverage under this Plan, You will be entitled to another 60- day period in which to elect COBRA coverage. This second 60- day period will commence on the first day of the month on which You become eligible for trade adjustment assistance. COBRA coverage elected during this second election period will be effective on the first day of the election period. You may also be eligible to receive a tax credit equal to 72.5% of the cost for health coverage for You and Your Dependents charged by the Plan. This tax credit also may be paid in advance directly to the health coverage provider, reducing the amount You have to pay out of pocket. When COBRA Coverage Ends These benefits are available without proof of insurability and coverage will end on the earlies t of the following: a covered individual reaches the end of the maximum coverage period; a covered individual fails to pay a required Premium on time; a covered individual becomes covered under any other group health plan after electing COBRA. If the other group health plan contains any exclusion or limitation on a pre- existing condition that applies to You, You may continue COBRA coverage only until these limitations cease; a covered individual becomes entitled to Medicare after electing COBRA; or the G roup terminates all of its group welfare benefit plans. Continuation of Coverage During Military Leave ( USERRA) Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the Member may have a right to continuation of benefits s ubject to the conditions described below. Under USERRA, if the Employee (or his or her Dependents) is covered under this Plan, and if the Employee becomes absent from employment by reason of military leave, the Employee (or his or her Dependents) may have the right to elect to continue health coverage under the plan. In order to be eligible for coverage during the period that the Employee is gone on military leave, the Employee must give reasonable notice to the Employer of his or her military leave and t he Employee will be entitled to COBRA -like rights with respect to his or her medical benefits in that the Employee and his or her Dependents can elect to continue coverage under the plan for a period of 24 months from the date the military leave commences or, if sooner, the period ending on the day after the deadline for the Employee to apply for or return to work with the Employer. During military leave the Employee is required to pay the Employer for the entire cost of such coverage, including any electe d Dependents' coverage. However, if the Employee's absence is less than 31 days, the employer must continue to pay its portion of the Premiums and the Employee is only required to pay his or her share of the Premiums without the COBRA -type 2% administrati ve surcharge. 70 Also, when the Employee returns to work, if the Employee meets the requirements specified below, USERRA states that the Employer must waive any exclusions and waiting periods, even if the Employee did not elect COBRA continuation. These requirements are (i) the Employee gave reasonable notice to his or her Employer of military leave, (ii) the military leave cannot exceed a prescribed period (which is generally five (5) years, except in unusual or extraordinary circumstances) and the Employee must have received no less than an honorable discharge (or, in the case of an officer, not been sentenced to a correctional institution), and (iii) the Employee must apply for reemployment or return to work in a timely manner upon expiration of the military leave (ranging from a single day up to 90 days, depending upon the period that he or she was gone). The Employee may also have to provide documentation to the Employer upon reemployment that would confirm eligibility.

The Member will have a separate prescription drug benefit identification card from Express Scripts which must be presented to the pharmacist at the time of service. A twelve- digit ID number (not the social security number) is assigned to the plan member. If the plan member has a covered spouse and/or dependent(s), this same twelve- digit ID is used for each respective plan participant, with a different two- digit suffix (i.e. plan member - \"001\", spouse/dependent - \"002\", etc.) Prescription drug benefits are pay able for covered prescription expenses incurred by the Member and the Member's covered dependents. Benefits are payable for such expenses for charges made by a participating pharmacy for each separate prescription, subject to the applicable co- payment or c oinsurance as shown in the Schedule of Benefits.

The Retail Prescription Drug Card Program is administered by Express Scripts. Participants are provided a prescription drug card to purchase drugs from a local pharmacy that participates in the Express Scripts Network. This network includes over 53,000 pharmacies nationwide. These include most chain or grocery stores such as Wal -Mart or Kroger as well as many independent pharmacies across the nation. Confirmation of participating pharmacies may be obtained by calling Express Scripts at 1 -877-242-1864 or through the web site at www.express -scripts.com. 91 The amount of the coinsurance or co -payment is dependent upon whether the prescription is for a generic, a formulary brand name drug or a non -formulary brand name drug. A generic drug is identical in chemical composition to its brand name counterpart, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be therapeutically equivalent, and is as effective as the brand name product. The use of generics and formulary brand name drugs help to keep the cost of prescription drugs down for both the participant and the plan. All non -formulary drugs have alternatives available; preferred brand name drugs and possibly generics, both of which are more, cost effective. As a participant in this program, you must pay for: The cost of medication not covered under the prescription benefit; The cost of any quantity of medication dispensed in excess of a consecutive 30- day non- maintenance medication supply.

Each retail prescription is limited to a 30- day supply. However if the medical condition is such that the prescription drug is to be taken over a prolonged period of time (month or even years) it may be more financially advantageous to use the mail order program described below. Reimbursement for prescriptions purchased at non- network pharmacies will not be reimbursed under your prescription benefit, and are the financial responsibility of the Member. All paper claims incurred during the calendar year must be submitted within 365 days of the original date of service. Any claims received after that date will be denied.

The Co- payments or Coinsurance for each type Mail Service prescription (for a 1 to 34 day supply) are the same as outlined under the Retail Prescription Program above. The Co- payments or Coinsurance for each type Mail Service prescription (for a 35 to 90- day supply) are: Generic: 10% or minimum of $24.00 Formulary minimum of $60.00 Formulary Brand Name Drug: 40% or minimum of $120.00 92 The out of pocket maximum is $100 per generic prescr iption and $120 per formulary brand name prescription (non- formulary drugs have no maximum).

Each mail service prescription is limited to a maximum quantity limit of a 90 -day supply.
