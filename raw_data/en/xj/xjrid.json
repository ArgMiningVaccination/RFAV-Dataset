Read on to learn more about these amazing oils and how you can use them in your practice. Headaches, anxiety, achy joints, stress relief, insomnia; essential oils are touted as a cure-all for virtually everything these days. Homeopaths swear by them and even those who practice and rely on conventional medicine support the use of them to some extent. Essential oils are also believed to possess magical properties. Essential Oils: An Introduction Essential oils aren't new. In fact, they've been used for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians cultivated various types of plants specifically for their oils. They used the oils for a variety of reasons; religious ceremonies, cosmetics, and even for embalming. Most notably, the Egyptians used essential oils for medicinal purposes and established the aromatherapy as it is known today. Following the lead of the ancient Egyptians, cultures around the world began using essential oils. Fast forward to today and people around the world use essential oils for many different reasons; stress relief, increased energy, improved focus, skin soothing, and of course, stress relief. Essential oils can be diffused into vapor; they're added to ointments, lotions, and cosmetics; they can be added to baths, and they can be used through a process known as dry evaporation, which involves adding a few drops of an oil to a piece of fabric or a cotton ball and then holding the material near the nose and inhaling it. The Magical Properties of Essential Oils While most people are familiar with aromatherapy's traditional uses, they can also be used in a less conventional (at least to the general public) way. They can be used in magical ritual. Most experienced wiccans are quite familiar with the magical properties that essential oils offer; but, if you're just beginning to explore the mystical world, the use of essential oils may be completely new to you. In fact, this may be the first time you're hearing about essential oils in magic. How Are Essential Oils Used in Magic? A lot of different ingredients are used in the art of magic. Some of the most common include sugar, garlic, sage, basil, and ginger. Essential oils are usually used as a supplement to these main ingredients. They're commonly used to anoint tools that are used in rituals, crystals, amulets, and talisman. Some witches even use them to anoint their own physical bodies. Essential oils are often used to create some of the most basic witchcraft tools; incense, candles, and charms. In the simplest terms, essential oils can be used to enhance pretty much anything magical that you want to do. Why are Essential Oils Magical? Essential oils are derived from plants. Highly concentrated oils are extracted from the flowers, leaves, and stems of various types of plants. There are two reasons why essential oils are used as powerful agents in spells and rituals. Firstly, they are comprised of the magical energies of the plants that they are derived from. Because plants are living beings themselves and they have their own living intelligence that are symbiotic with nature, which makes them quite magical. Of course, plants have their own magical properties, and those properties are highly concentrated in the oils. It's important to note that when using essential oils for witchcraft, only natural oils should be used. Synthetic oils, while they do have a similar scent to natural oils, they do not have the natural ingredients that botanical oils are derived of. Secondly, essential oils are magical because of their powerful scent. The sense of smell has a profound impact on the mind, and since essential oils are so robust, they have the power to alter the way the mind thinks. As an example of the impact that scent has on the mind; picture your favorite smell and how it makes you feel. It likely elevates your mood, eases your stress, and just makes you feel happy.
