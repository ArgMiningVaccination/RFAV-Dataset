Get the latest Chicago COVID-19 information and updates from Chicago Tribune reporters and editors on our [COVID-19 Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/378543406904366). With the recent easing of COVID-19 restrictions coinciding with seasonal gatherings like graduation parties, how can we safely mingle in social settings with friends and family members who are not vaccinated? Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said vaccinated people who don't have immunodeficiency (meaning no active cancers, no organ transplants, no one on immunosuppressive therapy) \"are very safe from getting symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization and death. A relatively small number may get infected but for the most part, without symptoms. They essentially have no restrictions and no longer have to use masks except in hospitals, medical facilities, long term care residences.\" Murphy noted that local or state regulations \"may be more strict, for now anyway.\" He also pointed out that unvaccinated people \"will continue to become infected, about 15% will get very ill and may end up in hospital, and 1-2% will die from COVID-19. This is where the epidemic is going now.\" Many local stores have signs saying masks are optional but recommended for those who aren't vaccinated. But those of us who are vaccinated still wear a mask indoors, at least for the short term? Murphy's response was no. \"I follow the science,\" he said. \"Masks are no longer needed for fully vaccinated persons in most situations indoors or outdoors.\" For families who are planning summer vacations, but have kids under 12 who are still too young for the vaccine, is there a safe way to travel that would mitigate risk for the unvaccinated? \"Not really,\" Murphy said. \"Vaccines are now approved at 12 years and older. Younger children, if they do get infected, typically have very mild disease if otherwise healthy. They will be at risk for infection like everyone else who is not vaccinated. They just handle the infection better.\" \u2014 Karen Ann Cullotta With some vaccination sites winding down in the city and suburbs, where can I get a shot? Chicago is winding down the United Center mass vaccination site, and half of Cook County's six suburban mass vaccination locations will close permanently May 27. City health officials said they will shift focus to a hyperlocal inoculation campaign that includes dozens of pop-up events, vaccine incentives and home visits. \"Protect Chicago at Home\" will expand the city's homebound vaccination visits to all residents who are 65 or older or have a disability or medical condition. Residents can sign up for a Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson dose by calling the city's vaccine hotline at 312-746-4835. [Pop-up events](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/calendar-of-events.html) throughout the summer will have tents at churches, farmers markets and Chicago Transit Authority buses filled with nurses giving shots, public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Locations and dates can be found on [the Chicago.gov \"Find a Vaccine\" page](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/calendar-of-events.html). And incentives like the \"Vax and Relax\" partnership with barbershops and hair salons will start in June. It's Official Barbershop in Englewood will give free haircuts or gift cards to vaccinated people 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. June 5. Josephine's Jet Set hair salon in South Shore will do a similar event with vouchers 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. June 12. Vaccinations will also be available at clinic locations throughout the state this Memorial Day weekend (via a state partnership with organizations including Amtrak and Walmart), officials announced. A vaccination clinic at Union Station will be open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. May 28-30, offering the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to anyone 18 and older without an appointment. J&J vaccinations will also be offered at no cost at TravelCenters of America locations in Mount Vernon, Troy, Effingham and Bloomington. The clinics will be open 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. May 29 through June 1. A vaccination clinic at Wally's and Hy-Vee along Interstate 55 outside Pontiac will be open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. May 31. The United Center mass vaccination site ended its partnership with the federal government and its walk-in appointments Monday, Arwady said. The drive-thru option will remain open under city leadership until June 24. The Tinley Park, South Holland and River Grove mass vaccination centers will be \"consolidating\" into the remaining locations May 27. That means residents seeking a mass vaccination site in the suburbs must go to Forest Park, Des Plaines or Matteson for an inoculation shot, either with an appointment or as a walk-in. \u2014 Alice Yin and Jenny Whidden Swollen lymph nodes have been mistaken for cancer after Pfizer and Moderna vaccination shots. Does J&J have the same possibility, even though it approaches the coronavirus in an entirely different way? Dr. Deepa Sheth, a radiologist and breast imaging specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine, says all the recent research journal articles focus on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so there isn't any data yet on the Johnson & Johnson shot \"But the prior guidelines and recommendations should theoretically remain the same, since this vaccine also boosts your immune response,\" she said. \"Getting a COVID-19 vaccine might result in swollen lymph nodes under the arm in which the injection was given. These swollen lymph nodes under the arm might show up on a mammogram done to screen for breast cancer.\" Women are encouraged to wait four to six weeks from the date of their last COVID-19 vaccine before undergoing a routine screening mammogram. But if one has any breast-related complaints (i.e. skin changes, nipple discharge, breast mass, breast pain, underarm swelling), Sheth said don't delay going in for a mammogram. \u2014 Darcel Rockett Will a COVID booster shot be necessary? Scientists and doctors say it remains an open question, but the evidence \u2014 at least right now \u2014 [doesn't point to a need for another shot](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-covid-vaccine-booster-shot-20210527-3slnby6vobbbxinc3j5sxkfawu-story.html). Illinois vaccine providers say they will be ready to distribute a booster shot if it becomes necessary. It's possible a variant breaks through that resists the vaccines. And because the vaccines are so new, no one knows how long the immunity will last. \"This is a question, of course, on literally everybody's mind,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Doctors point to the more than six months of vaccine data we do have that shows the vaccine's immunity appears to last at least that long. \"The levels of immunity are pretty durable,\" said Dr. Benjamin Singer, pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The other scenario where a booster would be needed would be if a variant emerges that evades the current vaccines. Though there is evidence that the immune response isn't as effective against some variants, experts said that overall the U.S. vaccines still work well against the known variants. The Illinois Department of Public Health said its current vaccine program is a blueprint if it needs to handle rollout of a booster. \u2014 Madeline Buckley Where do I need to wear a mask under the new Illinois and Chicago guidelines? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [revised its guidance on where people need to wear masks](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-cdc-indoor-mask-guidelines-20210513-5rmcat62vvhyhds6peirsaup6i-story.html), saying that those who are two weeks past their vaccines can mostly return to prepandemic activities without masks. Following those recommendations, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced new guidelines that [put Illinois in line with the new federal guidance](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-mask-mandate-20210517-3wulwtdeo5ejtoev3sbh5icovq-story.html). In Chicago, which has at times maintained separate rules from the state throughout COVID-19, [public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said Tuesday](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-chicago-mask-mandate-update-20210518-7p5jki4re5fgbc5nw4s4ro7vue-story.html) that fully vaccinated people can go maskless in most settings, but some businesses will be strongly advised to maintain mask requirements. According to that guidance, people who are fully vaccinated should still wear masks in health care settings or while riding trains, buses, planes or other forms of public transportation, including at airports, bus stations or train stations. \u2014 Alison Bowen After my second COVID-19 shot, I was sick for five days and continue to feel fatigued and have a headache. I was told side effects would last only two days. Should I be worried about long-term repercussions from the vaccine? Dr. Katarzyna Scigacz, an internal medicine physician with Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital, said symptoms following vaccination vary from person to person, and some may have none at all. Symptoms may include soreness at the injection site, fever, muscle pain, chills, headache and nausea. She added that there is no specific length of time side effects can last; some last up to a week. \"We do know these vaccines are safe and effective and serious side effects are extremely unlikely,\" she said. \"I would advise contacting your doctor if a fever lingers for more than 48 hours, or if increased pain, redness and swelling develops at the injection site.\" Primary care physicians are available for questions and can help direct or reassure patients, she said. \u2014 Alison Bowen Now that kids age 12 to 15 can get a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, what other vaccines should parents be sure tweens and teens are receiving? Dr. Tanya Altmann, a Calabasas, California-based pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said due to the multitude of COVID-19 concerns and hardships families have been facing for more than a year, many tweens and teens did not have their annual physicals, and some might also be behind on their childhood immunizations. \"Everyone was staying home, and afraid of getting COVID, so even though pediatric offices were very clean and safe, some parents have kept their kids away,\" Altmann said. \"Now, as everything is getting back to normal, and families are registering their kids for the next school year, it's time for parents to schedule their children's appointments to visit the pediatrician for a checkup, and to get any missing vaccines.\" Currently, the CDC recommendation is to not get any other routine vaccines within two weeks of the COVID-19 vaccines, Altmann said. Still, outside of that short pause, parents of children aged 11 to 13 should check that they're up to date on a slate of other academy-recommended vaccines, including the Tdap booster, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Kids at that age should also get meningitis and HPV vaccines. In addition, parents should ensure their tweens and teens see their pediatrician for an annual physical, even if it's not being required for school registration or to play on an athletic team, Altmann said. \"With COVID, many kids have not had a well-child checkup for more than a year, which means things like scoliosis, vision issues or a heart murmur might not have been caught and dealt with earlier,\" Altmann said. While some Chicago-area public health officials and school districts were already making plans to deliver Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccines to kids 12 to 15 in mid-May, parents can also check with their pediatrician to see if the shots might be available by appointment. \"The logistical challenge for private practices is once you open a vial, there are six vaccines you need to use within six hours,\" Altmann said, adding: \"It's going to take some coordination, but pediatricians will be able to figure it out, without wasting any doses.\" \u2014 Karen Ann Cullotta The city is slated to reopen without restrictions July 4. What can we look forward to? Mayor Lori Lightfoot said May 4 that she plans to [fully reopen the city of Chicago](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-lightfoot-pritzker-reopening-july-20210504-5n5spwz67fbmtadrumgt5qbb5u-story.html) with no capacity limits by the July Fourth holiday, potentially opening the door to bigger events and festivals if the city continues to see progress in its COVID-19 numbers. \"We will be one of the first cities to fully and safely reopen,\" she said. Lightfoot announced her goal [days after relaxing pandemic rules ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-lightfoot-reopening-phase-four-20210429-nrhz42yfi5flpmpepqdf7vjiam-story.html)on indoor gatherings by expanding the number of people allowed inside bars, restaurants and churches, reopening large venues like the United Center and boosting capacity at outdoor festivals and farmers markets. If current trends hold, Illinois will be further loosened in Illinois on May 14 with the goal of a full reopening set for June 11, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said on Thursday. Pritzker [said May 3 that Illinois is on track to enter the \"bridge phase\" ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-prem-coronavirus-illinois-restrictions-20210503-hqrvgegucrcqffi5z5lzq57zxu-story.html)of his plan soon. Illinois public health officials said May 5 that [60% of residents](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-metrics-20210505-6ije7iqylzbtjbmgzjsjx4dsdm-story.html) 18 and older have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a day after President Joe Biden set a new national [ vaccination goal](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-coronavirus-vaccine-distribution-states-20210504-d7uitr6mvjho3hasz3gfvpztrm-story.html) of having a shot in the arm of at least 70% of all adults by July Fourth. \"Open Culture,\" [the next phase of Open Chicago](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-open-culture-chicago-events-summer-20210505-wkyq3byjuvdqtnqnkbnzflxkcy-story.html), is a full calendar of entertainment and events put on by the city for the summer. Dance, music, theater and public art are included, as are the Riverwalk and special events, including \"Chicago In Tune,\" a musical festival. SummerDance returns to parks around the city in August and September. The Chicago Bears will begin selling single-game tickets for the 2021 season May 12 at 8:30 p.m., marking preparation for fans' return to Soldier Field. Northalsted Market Days \u2014 the popular LGBTQ-friendly street fest in Lakeview \u2014 announced tentative plans to return in August after canceling last year due to the pandemic. And the Chicago Auto Show will [return to McCormick Place](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-auto-show-july-mccormick-place-20210504-ybikozhk5nflvgdlfeo3hhtk2a-story.html). The 113th annual show, which normally runs in February, is scheduled to take place July 15 to 19, with exhibits both inside and outside McCormick Place. It will use an electronic ticketing process and timed entrance windows to regulate attendance and control crowd capacity throughout the day, organizers said. Ramping up to the July Fourth reopening date, Chicago will host a [series of concerts](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-ent-city-of-chicago-concert-series-fully-vaccinated-20210505-tt6edypowrbn3cdussasdcllaq-story.html) for those who get vaccinated against COVID-19. It's scheduled to kick off May 22 in Hyde Park with performances by DJ Ron Trent and Duane Powell. The Silver Room, which used to host an annual block party in Chicago, is a partner in the first concert. To attend, concertgoers must have received the final dose of a two-dose vaccine or a single-dose vaccine on or before May 8. The city said each concert will be ticketed, and attendees must bring their CDC vaccination card and a matching photo ID. Tickets for the May 22 concert are scheduled to be released at noon May 11 at [thesilverroom.com](https://thesilverroom.com/). Tickets will also be made available to those who get vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson shot May 8 at Apostolic Faith Church, 3823 S. Indiana Ave. With a [host of area events and venues ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-cb-coronavirus-entertainment-reopenings-20210503-n7tkvqesmjfghiwaqjqeuct43y-story.html)making comeback plans for 2021, [safety guidelines still remain](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-reopening-illinois-guidelines-bridge-plan-20210505-7xwotigscjh35jqfupd5grhvfu-story.html) for Illinois and Chicago. The news of the reopening comes on the heels of Pfizer announcing it expects to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for authorization to administer its [coronavirus vaccine to children](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-nyt-pfizer-vaccine-children-20210504-4cwdc6ad7jdpla2l2qt4ili4cy-story.html) between the ages of 2 and 11. The company said it also plans to apply this month for full approval of the vaccine for use in people from ages 16 to 85. And it said it expected to have clinical trial data on the safety of its vaccine in pregnant women by early August. \u2014 Chicago Tribune staff, New York Times After I get a vaccine, is my immune system weakened? Should I be extra careful? It's important to know that the vaccine does not weaken your health, said Dr. Susan Bleasdale, chief quality officer and medical director for infection prevention at University of Illinois at Chicago Hospital Health Sciences System. Instead, it is helping your body develop a strategy to fight COVID-19. \"The vaccines cause a robust immune response because they are so effective, and that is why some people have fatigue or achiness or fever,\" she said. \"This is the immune system strongly responding to the vaccine.\" As for concerns about whether someone should be extra careful to protect their immune system following a vaccine, she said, \"It is important to know that the vaccines do not contain live virus and cannot give you COVID-19 infection.\" In general, remember that you are still susceptible and not fully protected until you are done with the vaccine series, plus two weeks of time. \u2014 Alison Bowen 2 of my adult children have had COVID-19. I have been fully vaccinated. Does this provide equal protection for each of us? Is having had COVID-19 considered equal to vaccination in helping to prevent spread? Like many things involving the virus, this is a complicated question, said Rachel Marrs, director of infection control at University of Chicago Medicine. \"It may not be as cut and dry as it first appears,\" she said. First, data is still arriving on vaccine protection, but it appears that over a long period of time COVID-19 vaccines give you more protection than if you had been infected with the virus itself, she said. Second, natural immunity from infection provides a high degree of protection, but that protection lessens over time. Same goes for protection from the vaccine, but many people are now recently vaccinated. \"That means it's important to know whether you're considering spending time with someone who has had COVID-19 within the past three months and still has pretty strong natural protection, or if they were infected, say, six months ago or even earlier in the pandemic, and now their natural protection is weakening,\" she said. Ideally, she suggests, you should postpone multihousehold gatherings until every adult is fully vaccinated. And it's still a great option to have family hangs outside, she said. \"We're so close to the end of this marathon,\" she said. \"So if it were me, I'd wait it out a few more weeks until your adult children can get vaccinated, too.\" And remember that kids should still wear masks in multiple-household gatherings. \u2014 Alison Bowen CDC: The fully vaccinated no longer have to wear masks outdoors. Are there exceptions? The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html) said Americans who are fully inoculated don't need to wear masks outdoors anymore when they bike, walk or run alone or with members of their household. They can also go maskless in small outdoor gatherings with fully vaccinated people. The exception is in a large crowd of strangers, such as at concerts and sporting events. Then masks should be worn by everyone \u2014 vaccinated and unvaccinated. The updated guidance comes as more than half of U.S. adults have gotten at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine and more than a third have been fully vaccinated. According to the CDC, the unvaccinated (those who have yet to receive both shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or the one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine) should wear masks at outdoor gatherings that include other unvaccinated people, as well as outdoor restaurants. The fully vaccinated don't need to cover up in those scenarios. However, the agency is still recommending that masks be worn at indoor public places like hair salons, shopping centers, restaurants, museums and movie theaters. \"The timing is right because we now have a fair amount of data about the scenarios where transmission occurs. What's more, the additional freedoms may serve as a motivator for people to get vaccinated,\" said Mercedes Carnethon, a professor and vice chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. Chicago public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady says she supports the CDC's mask guidelines and says the city of Chicago will be following them. \"For people who are fully vaccinated \u2014 two weeks post a second dose \u2014 you no longer need to wear a mask outside unless you're in crowded settings,\" she said at an April 27 press conference. \"If you are out and about, this is just highlighting again that you getting vaccinated is the best thing you can do to lower your risk. If you're not vaccinated, you need to keep wearing that mask. There's going to be more opportunities for people to do things if they're vaccinated.\" Arwady added that there will be more reopening announcements coming \u2014 with the assumption that Chicagoans will continue to make that decision to get vaccinated. Arawady said the fully vaccinated still need to bring a mask with them if they choose to eat indoors at a restaurant. \"Masks remain required indoors,\" she said. \"The risk remains higher indoors. If you are out in a restaurant, you can't know whether everybody around you has been vaccinated. Expectation remains indoors that you would be wearing that mask, putting it on when servers are near you.\" When asked if parade organizers should start making plans for summer, Arwady said she expects we will have some version of those activities that we love. \"I do think, by this summer, we're expecting to be in a much better place,\" she said. \u2014 Darcel Rockett and Associated Press The Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause has been lifted. What's next? A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel recommended lifting the pause to resume use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine, despite the rare risk of blood clots. And U.S. health officials rapidly followed the recommendation, ending the 11-day pause. Out of nearly 8 million people vaccinated before the U.S. suspended J&J's shot (April 13), health officials uncovered 15 cases of a highly unusual kind of blood clot, three of them fatal (seven remain hospitalized). All were women, most younger than 50. But advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said April 23 the vaccine's benefits outweigh that serious but small risk. Members of the panel didn't recommend U.S. regulators restrict the use of the vaccine based on age or gender, but they did propose that the FDA consider adding a warning label for women under age 50. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked to its advisers to help evaluate the numbers and determine how big the vaccine's risk really is \u2014 and how to balance that risk against the need to vaccinate millions against a virus that's still infecting tens of thousands of Americans each day. \"I appreciate the importance of acting swiftly\" on that advice, said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. Dr. Emily Landon, executive medical director of infection control and prevention at the University of Chicago Medicine, understands there may be some people who want to avoid the vaccine because of their own medical problems or risk tolerance levels. In that case, she says to ask first when scheduling an appointment. Those who don't wish to receive the J&J vaccine will need to make sure it's not the only vaccine being offered at the vaccination site they're going to. If it's the only option and they're not comfortable with it, then they should find another vaccine site. \"But it's important to remember that the public health authorities did their due diligence and the reason they decided to allow this vaccine out in the world is that they think the benefits far and away outweigh the risk,\" Landon said. \u2014 Darcel Rockett, Associated Press, CNBC Should pregnant women feel safe taking a COVID-19 vaccine? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [the answer is yes](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-aud-nw-covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-20210423-rax7ix3cira3pdzfn24vfw3lp4-story.html). Agency Director Rochelle Walensky announced the recommendation during an update on the pandemic at a [White House briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrEwCeoi7uA) April 23. She noted that a CDC study found no safety concerns with Moderna and Pfizer vaccinations given during the third trimester of pregnancy. The new study is based on reports from pregnant women who got shots soon after the vaccines became available. The researchers called for more data, including from vaccination earlier in pregnancy. Pregnant women were excluded from COVID-19 vaccination studies, although there is limited safety data on some who became pregnant after enrolling. \"We know that this is a deeply personal decision, and I encourage people to talk to their doctors or primary care providers to determine what is best for them and for their baby,\" Walensky said. \u2014 Associated Press Do vaccinated people still need to wear masks outdoors? Should you wear a mask outside if you are fully vaccinated? A Northwestern experts say yes. Dr. Benjamin Singer, assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says the likelihood of a fully vaccinated person transmitting SARS-CoV-2 while outdoors is exceedingly low. But upholding the social norm of mask-wearing outdoors and indoors until the vast majority of people become vaccinated in the next few months is important. ( [The CDC has similar recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html#:~:text=After%20you've%20been%20fully,places%20until%20we%20know%20more.).) It's also a symbol of solidarity. \"Social courtesy is the reason to mask up when outside,\" said Mercedes Carnethon, vice chair of research in preventive medicine at Northwestern. \"I also feel strongly that until we have vaccines for children, we need to continue to model the behavior of mask-wearing for them. In settings where the adults are vaccinated, they are at low risk; however, children don't know that. They behave in ways that they see respected adults behave. As more adults become vaccinated, we risk seeing the disease continue to spread among children.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett My period is somewhat irregular after receiving my vaccination. Why? So far, there have been only anecdotal reports of menstruation changes following the COVID-19 vaccines, and experts emphasize that there is no sign of danger in getting the vaccine, nor is this a reason to skip getting vaccinated. But there are a [number of stories about abnormal menstruation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-vaccine-side-effects-period-menstruation-20210420-i4fy7a7tnnbchi654z3o64a7my-story.html) following inoculations, and Kathryn Clancy, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is running a survey to catalog people's menstrual experiences after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The [survey](https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP) is a joint effort between Clancy and Katharine Lee, a postdoctoral research scholar at Washington University School of Medicine. As of April 19, Lee said, more than 25,000 people had filled it out. While the study will look at trends, Lee said, they won't be able to determine cause and effect. Clancy outlined her personal menstruation experience in a [February tweet](https://twitter.com/KateClancy/status/1364671490772320259?s=20), after receiving her first dose of the Moderna vaccine. Hundreds of women and people who menstruate replied in the comments with their own experiences. Dr. Julie Levitt, an OB-GYN at Northwestern Medicine, said two patients have come to her with concerns specifically related to their periods after getting vaccinated. \"Bleeding occurs for so many reasons that it's really hard to isolate the two,\" Levitt said. She also said the COVID-19 vaccine could be creating a hormonal spike that could trigger bleeding. \"A hormone rises, it goes down, you bleed a withdrawal bleed. But is that a bad thing? No,\" Levitt said. Levitt emphasized that this was not a subject of concern, nor a reason to stop taking birth control. \"No. 1, I wouldn't worry. No. 2, contact your doctor if you want to talk about it to gain that reassurance,\" Levitt said. \"If it does continue after a few weeks following the administration of the vaccine, it probably is something else.\" Clancy said those experiencing abnormal period symptoms after getting the vaccine should talk to a doctor if they are concerned. \"If you are a post-menopausal person who has experienced bleeding, you should really talk to your doctor,\" Clancy said. \"And if you have any significant or concerning symptoms alongside your changes to your menstrual cycle, you should also see a doctor.\" \u2014 Nicole Stock The Johnson & Johnson vaccine pause continues. What do I do if I received it? What causes the blood clots seen in people who received the vaccine? As of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been administered in the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for a pause in the use of the vaccine April 13 after six reported cases of rare blood clots in U.S. recipients of the vaccine. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women ages 18 to 48, and symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination. Of the six patients hospitalized with CVST, two were also diagnosed with splanchnic and portal vein thrombosis (clots that impede blood flow to abdominal gastrointestinal organs) during hospitalization. Four patients developed intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage (when blood pools in the tissues of the brain), and one subsequently died. It's not yet clear if the J&J vaccine is causing these adverse events and, if so, what the mechanisms are. It is notable that these events are similar to other recent reports of thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia by some who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe, as both are viral vector vaccines According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, that pause [could come to an end by April 23](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/decision-lift-jj-suspension-occur-friday-fauci/story?id=77141917). According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/JJUpdate.html?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_2067-DM55262&ACSTrackingLabel=What%20to%20Do%20If%20You%20Received%20the%20J%26J%2FJanssen%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20%7C%20COVID-19&deliveryName=USCDC_2067-DM55262), if you received the J&J vaccine more than three weeks ago, your risk of developing a blood clot with low platelets is very low. If you got the vaccine within the last three weeks, your risk of developing a blood clot with low platelets is also very low. But you should be on the lookout for symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. Symptoms are: severe headache, backache, blurred vision, fainting, seizures, severe pain in your abdomen or stomach, severe pain in your chest, leg swelling, shortness of breath and tiny red spots on the skin (petechiae). If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical attention. \u2014 Darcel Rockett What should people know about the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? Health departments across Illinois on Tuesday paused administering the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine following [recommendations from federal officials](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-johnson-and-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-blood-clots-20210413-iagzysugkvgjvidwega4625bly-story.html) after reports of six women who experienced blood clots about two weeks after vaccination. Pharmacies and other providers, including Walgreens, which runs the state's largest pharmacy vaccination program, also said they were temporarily halting the one-shot vaccine and are working with people to reschedule appointments. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration are reviewing data of the rare and severe [type of blood clot](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-explainer-covid-vaccine-rare-blood-clots-20210413-75bxbup53valzlfsusjlkrwqfq-story.html) that the women experienced after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to a statement from both federal agencies. Federal officials said the decision was made out of an abundance of caution and assured the public that the risk of having a severe reaction to a vaccine is low, noting that the blood clots have surfaced in six cases in the U.S. out of nearly 7 million Johnson & Johnson doses given.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the need for and timing for COVID-19 booster doses [have not been established](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html). Right now, no additional doses have yet been recommended. Dr. John Segreti, medical director of infection control at Rush University Medical Center, said if COVID-19 is like any other coronavirus, it will come back every year. \"I expect we'll be getting variants and probably will require immunizations on a regular basis,\" he said in a statement. \"Whether it's once a year, once every six months, once every two years? We don't know. But I expect we'll need more vaccinations in the future.\" As far as whether a patient will need the same shot they had before, or can switch brands, it's too early to know that as well. The CDC has said that in rare situations, people can follow one dose with a different brand's dose. \u2014 Alison Bowen After traveling hundreds of miles for the 1st COVID-19 shot, can you get the 2nd dose closer to home? With vaccine supply still limited in the Chicago area, many city residents and suburbanites are [traveling hundreds of miles ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-prem-covid-19-vaccination-travel-quincy-20210331-pfwjgfgwezfstjfkiptj7wsrja-story.html)across the state to get inoculated, often finding appointments in Quincy, Danville, Springfield and other downstate cities. Now some Chicago-area residents are trying to reschedule that second dose closer to home, with mixed results. Vaccine providers locally and across the country have different policies and philosophies about changing locations for the second dose: While some public health officials and private pharmacies say they have no problem with folks booking appointments in different locations, some counties in Illinois and providers in other states forbid the practice and turn away vaccine-seekers if they received a first dose in another location. Illinois Department of Public Health guidance says patients should schedule their second dose of vaccine at the same location where they received their first dose, to help ensure proper allocation of doses to providers.

Dr. Michael Lin, an infectious disease specialist at Rush University Medical Center, said if people who get vaccinated have symptoms such as fever or pain, it is safe to take fever-reducing or pain-reducing medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. For pregnant women specifically, acetaminophen is preferred. In general, Lin said, there is no data to suggest avoiding specific classes or types of medications. CDC [guidance suggests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) talking to your doctor about over-the-counter medicines. The agency does not recommend taking pain relievers before vaccination for the purpose of avoiding side effects. \u2014 Alison Bowen Should I let my child play sports now that more schools are considering reopening for in-person learning? According to Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency has been trying to understand outbreaks of coronavirus among those under age 25. \"We are learning that many outbreaks in young people are related to youth sports and extracurricular activities,\" she said in a Monday [White House news briefing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/04/05/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-24/) on COVID-19. \"According to CDC guidance, these activities should be limited, but if they are not, the risks of clusters can be prevented with cadence testing strategies, as are being rolled out in so many different places.\" Cadence testing or serial, random testing is something professional sports organizations have been conducting. Testing entails pre-entry testing, and daily testing. Walensky says everyone needs to remain vigilant to keep case numbers down. West Rogers Park native Dr. [Jonathan Baktari](https://jonathanbaktarimd.com/), CEO of U.S. Drug Test Centers and [e7health.com](http://e7health.com/), a Las Vegas-based provider of adult vaccinations, says being vigilant doesn't mean stopping your child from participating in youth sports. It does mean doing everything you can to mitigate the spread while playing sports \u2014 like reducing the size of team squads, eliminating unnecessary sports meetings or taking them outdoors. \"Maybe we can do without a locker room, no celebrating after a touchdown, no high-fives, that kind of stuff,\" he said. \"Potentially we just need to come up with a strategy for the next month or two, since Pfizer announced that they've had [amazing results in the 12- to 15-year-old population](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal), so it may be before summer camp or summer sports begin that all 12- to 15-year-olds may have access to the Pfizer vaccine.\" Baktari said parents with kids playing contact sports like football might be more on edge than those who have children participating in swimming, but it's all about the ventilation either way \u2014 high ceilings and ventilation are better than practice rooms with air conditioning. \"That's where the education comes in. If we're going to play this sport, we're going to do all these steps to minimize contact,\" he said. \"Wear your mask when you're not playing, and stay socially distant. It's not ever going to be: 'This gets rid of all risk, or this sport is 100% risky.' It's a continuum. Our job is to chip away at the risk. If you use mitigating strategies, you may have spot breakouts, but you won't have 50 to 100 people infected at one event. That's what we're trying to avoid.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett What are the CDC's new rules for school cleanings? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is no longer recommending daily disinfection of schools to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The [CDC updated its guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html) Monday on settings, including homes, saying disinfecting chemicals need to be used only within 24 hours after an infected person has been there. The CDC news coincides with the news that [more school districts are opening up](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/ct-sta-south-suburban-schools-bring-more-students-back-st-0407-20210406-bckxnraiifbj5enl2fyeix4uqq-story.html) for in-person learning. In summer 2020, the agency had recommended that strong disinfecting chemicals be used daily to prevent the spread of the virus in classrooms. Colleges like [The University of Notre Dame](https://here.nd.edu/news/student-vaccination-requirement-for-fall-2021/) are requiring all students to receive COVID-19 vaccinations to enroll in classes next school year. The decision follows similar moves by [Rutgers, Cornell, Brown and Northeastern universities](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-notre-dame-covid-vaccine-required-20210407-4xt7qewgljbdfjc3fzxihaslhi-story.html). \"We will, of course, accommodate documented medical and religious exemptions,\" Notre Dame said on its website. \"We will also offer a way to be vaccinated for those who are unable to obtain a vaccination prior to arriving for the fall semester or whose vaccination is not recognized by the state of Indiana.\" Notre Dame will open a campus vaccination site for students Thursday. \u2014 Elyssa Cherney and Associated Press Why should I hold on to my vaccination card? The [vaccine card](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-nyt-covid-vaccination-card-cb-20210402-4zxhz53kwvco3fq46n5rjdhd7i-story.html), given after your first shot and then updated if you're required to have a second shot, includes the vaccine manufacturer, the dose numbers, and the date and location each was administered. While the government has said that it would not be passing a federal mandate or distributing its own vaccine passport, having and holding on to your card after you receive doses could make it easier to travel. Some destinations and cruise lines have started requiring that travelers be fully vaccinated before they travel. Fully vaccinated Americans who can present proof of vaccination can visit Iceland and avoid border measures such as testing and quarantining, the country's government said. And cruise lines like Royal Caribbean are requiring passengers and crew members 18 or older to be vaccinated to board ships when companies restart cruise operations. For the moment, airlines are not requiring vaccinations for travel. But the idea has been much talked about in the industry. The universal use of vaccine cards as \"passports\" to allow a safe return to \"normalcy\" during reopening has also raised [ethical, equity and privacy concerns](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778526?guestAccessKey=0355c664-03ab-4d4a-8101-1bea4b0e907b&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=040721). Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University, recommends laminating the card and keeping it in a safe place, as you would a passport, rather than carrying it around. Having a picture of your card on your phone, so you'll have the information in your photo library, and emailing it to yourself as backup are also recommended. If you lose the vaccination card, return to where you were vaccinated to get a new one. Vaccinations are tracked by state health departments, so you can also reach out to the state's agency to get a replacement card, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The agency lists contact information for the Immunization Information System in each state, which tracks vaccinations, on its website.) \u2014 Concepci\u00f3n De Le\u00f3n, New York Times, and The Journal of the American Medical Association How long do the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines protect us? New research in the [New England Journal of Medicine ](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916)suggests the protection the Moderna vaccine gives against COVID-19 lasts for at least six months \u2014 the [Pfizer ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-study-20210401-ectwuynlozbevcigm6wu42kbla-story.html)vaccine has a similar efficacy time frame. Both reports were based on follow-up tests in dozens of people who received the shots during studies that led to the vaccines' use. Those studies were done before troubling new variants, or new versions of the coronavirus, had emerged and started to spread. Pfizer and Moderna have said they are working to update their vaccines, or possibly design a booster shot, in case they're needed against variants. As of Tuesday, [40% of Illinois residents 16 and older ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-vaccinations-cases-20210406-7d6hr3cubvgzfgbz7vy37dfj4e-story.html)have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Vice President Kamala Harris made a brief visit to Chicago on Tuesday and toured a vaccination site run by the Chicago Federation of Labor for union workers. She touted efforts to expand vaccination sites in underserved communities, as the White House announced that all adults in the U.S. will be eligible for vaccines by April 19, rather than May 1. \u2014 Associated Press, Chicago Tribune staff Is there a new COVID-19 variant? Yes, there is a new variant called the [\"double mutant\" variant](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-aud-nw-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-california-20210407-ayi3wrghyvfotk5dsfvct4ot7e-story.html). It was first identified in India and has now been found in California by scientists at Stanford University. This variant contains two mutations in its genetic composition that also have been identified in other variants being tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to Dr. Benjamin Pinsky, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Stanford, the lab identified one confirmed case of the new variant and seven presumptive cases among samples from patients in the Bay Area. None of the other variants being monitored by federal officials have the same combination of these two mutations, known as L452R and E484Q. The L452R mutation has also been found in the California variant (B.1.427/B.1.429). The E484Q mutation is closely related to the E484K mutation, which has been found in variants first identified in South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1 and P.2) and New York (B.1.526). The mutations concern scientists because the former is believed to make the virus more infectious and might cause reduced immunity in people who have been vaccinated. The latter mutation might give the virus the ability to partly evade the immune system's protective response in inoculated people or those who have survived a conventional COVID-19 illness. \"What we don't know is how those (two mutations) will behave when they're put in the same virus,\" Pinsky said in an interview April 5. \"There's a reasonable amount of information about those (two mutations) individually. But will it be worse if they're together? We don't really know how they're going to interact.\" The emergence of the new variant underscores how important it will be to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible. Because as Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in March, one way variants can emerge is through the infection of a single person who has a compromised immune system (the virus could evolve in that person to become even more robust). \u2014 Rong-Gong Lin II, Luke Money, Los Angeles Times Should you abstain from alcohol for one to two weeks after a vaccination shot? Some people are worried that drinking alcohol for one to two weeks after receiving a vaccine shot can reduce its efficacy. But according to Dr. Emily Landon, executive medical director of infection control and prevention at the University of Chicago Medicine, people shouldn't worry. \"There were probably lots of people who received the vaccine in clinical trials who drank alcohol after receiving it. And the vaccines were still shown to be effective,\" she said. \"That's part of the beauty of a randomized clinical trial like the ones for the COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 they reflect the realities of real life. So as long as you're not overindulging and going above and beyond what's considered normal and regular behavior, it's probably OK.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett Can vaccinated people spread the virus? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, current research is far from sufficient to claim that vaccinated people cannot spread the virus. The data suggest that \"it's much harder for vaccinated people to get infected, but don't think for one second that they cannot get infected,\" said Paul Duprex, director of the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh. \"We're stopping symptoms; we're keeping people out of hospitals. But we're not making them completely resistant to an infection.\" The question came up because of misinterpretation of CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky's comments about recent [data](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_x) in a television interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. \"What we know is the vaccines are very substantially effective against infection \u2014 there's more and more data on that \u2014 but nothing is 100%,\" said John Moore, a virus expert at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. \"It is an important public health message that needs to be gotten right.\" \u2014 Apoorva Mandavilli, The New York Times Can you mix and match vaccines? Some people might be wondering if they have an adverse reaction to a vaccine for a first shot, if they can follow up with a different vaccine for a second dose. Dr. Michael Lin, an infectious disease specialist at Rush University Medical Center, said the mRNA vaccines were not studied in a \"mix and match\" fashion, so patients should make a strong effort to receive the same product. \"That said, in exceptional situations, any available mRNA vaccine could be used as a second dose with a minimum interval of 28 days, and that would be considered a complete vaccination, even if potentially mismatched,\" he said. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [notes](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/janssen/downloads/Janssen-Standing-Orders.pdf) that if someone has received one dose of an mRNA vaccine, like the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, the same brand should be administered for the second dose. But, the agency added, in situations where the first dose was received but the patient cannot complete the series with the same vaccine, \"consideration may be given to vaccination with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine at a minimum interval of 28 days from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose.\" This should be done under the supervision of a healthcare provider experienced in managing severe allergic reactions. The agency noted that in only \" [exceptional situations,](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)\" any available mRNA vaccine may be administered at a minimum of 28 days between doses to complete a vaccination series. The agency also noted it is better to delay the second dose up to six weeks to receive the same product than to receive a mixed series. How might anesthesia interact with the vaccine? Can you plan surgery after having COVID-19 or a recent vaccination? According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, there is no evidence that either COVID-19 or the vaccine interferes with anesthesia. However, the group noted in a statement, because surgery is stressful on the body and can temporarily strain your immune system, \"You should wait until you are fully recovered from COVID-19 or you are fully immunized after vaccination before proceeding with surgery.\" As for either essential or elective surgery after contracting COVID-19, the group recommends waiting four weeks if you had no symptoms or only mild ones and 12 weeks if admitted to intensive care. If vaccinated, surgery should be scheduled at least two weeks after the final dose. \u2014 Alison Bowen How do vaccination providers ensure a 2nd dose for patients? After reports of vaccine appointments canceled and rescheduled when the city [ended a contract](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-19-vaccines-chicago-public-schools-20210324-ytvrkmqiwjhnpgcbpakym4txjy-story.html) with Innovative Express Care, people might be worried about how their second dose is ensured. Places do not typically keep an entire dose for the month for a specific patient, said Hani Mahmassani, who specializes in planning and operations as well as logistics and distribution systems as the director of the Northwestern University Transportation Center. \"They are supposed to use them, and expect later shipment for second doses,\" he said. Mahmassani said that for every shipment of a first dose sent to a state from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a corresponding one should be programmed to ship three weeks later for Pfizer or four weeks later for Moderna. Early on in the vaccination process, he said, some were holding onto doses to save them as second shots, which he said slowed down the initial rollout process. Different locations handle the booking for second doses in different ways; some will book patients right away; others might send a link to book the second one later. At CVS, for example, a company statement notes that when patients make an appointment for their first shot, they are prompted to schedule an appointment for the second dose at the same time. The company said CVS Health has a detailed tracking system to make sure they know who received which vaccine and ensure a second dose. Walgreens also confirmed they honor all second doses promised to patients, and that people can also separately schedule a second dose through Walgreens regardless of where their first dose was administered. People who might be concerned about second-dose availability should be heartened that for now, the federal supply chain appears to be keeping up with vaccine demand, said Shaun Grannis, vice president of data and analytics at Indianapolis-based research organization Regenstrief Institute. \u2014 Alison Bowen Who is eligible right now for the vaccine in Chicago and Illinois? As of March 22, Illinois allowed new groups to be eligible for the vaccine: government workers, higher education and media workers. Chicago is still vaccinating only certain groups including frontline essential workers, people within specific zip codes and people age 65 and older. Beginning March 29, in both Illinois and Chicago, restaurant staffers, construction workers and religious leaders also will be eligible. People with underlying health conditions such as obesity, diabetes and pregnancy have already been able to be vaccinated. In Chicago, as of March 29, all other essential workers will be also eligible in Chicago. A full list is available [here](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html). Gov. J.B. Pritzker said coronavirus vaccinations will be expanded to all Illinois residents 16 and older outside of Chicago beginning April 12. \u2014 Alison Bowen How should families with vaccinated adults and unvaccinated children plan for family visits or summer activities? A [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/chicagotribune/videos/453011345732460) with the University of Chicago's Dr. Emily Landon, an infectious disease expert, addressed how families can approach the period when adults might be vaccinated but kids are not. Since it might be months before younger children are able to vaccinated, families should treat children the way we have been treating everyone throughout the pandemic \u2014 with caution around where we are going and who we meet. Vaccinated families can spend time together; for example, a vaccinated grandparent can visit and even hang out and hug children without a mask. But the key is not to expand this unmasked ability to too many people, Landon said. Even eating in restaurants, for example, a vaccinated person can still have the virus and give it to others who are not vaccinated. So it is important, Landon said, to remain cautious about which activities families participate in. \u2014 Alison Bowen Why isn't Walgreens consistently giving COVID-19 vaccines to people with health conditions? In recent weeks, a number of people with health conditions who now qualify for vaccinations under state guidelines say they've been turned away from some Chicago Walgreens stores despite the fact that many other Walgreens stores in the city and suburbs are vaccinating that group. The inconsistency at Walgreens, which has the largest vaccination program of any pharmacy in the state, has created yet another layer of confusion and anxiety for a group that's already having trouble finding vaccines. Walgreens follows federal, state and local eligibility guidelines when giving vaccines, said Kris Lathan, a Walgreens spokeswoman, in an email. \"These guidelines differ per state and jurisdiction and are rapidly evolving, which, at times, and understandably, can complicate the scheduling process,\" she said. \"We make every effort to reflect changing eligibility guidelines through our scheduler and in our stores, so that our pharmacists have the latest information available to ensure the most current guidance is carried out in our practices and procedures at the store level.\" The disparities, however, have proved frustrating to a number of people.

Chicago residents age 16 and older who have medical conditions or are essential workers but haven't yet qualified for the coronavirus vaccine will become eligible for the shot starting March 29, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced Wednesday. The upcoming group is expected to be getting vaccinations through May and will likely see some of the same scramble for limited appointments that Chicagoans in the previous stages have weathered, Chicago public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Still, she said, the city expects its vaccine supply to increase over time and believes it will have enough to broaden vaccine eligibility. Health conditions that qualify are those in the Illinois Department of Health's [guidelines](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/vaccine-distribution), including cancer, lung disease, heart conditions and other ailments that put individuals at greater risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19. Unlike the rest of the state, however, Chicago will not include smokers in that category and will [expand to conditions](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html) such as HIV/AIDS, liver disease and schizophrenia. Essential jobs will [be defined as](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/vaccine-distribution-phases.html) industries such as restaurants, construction, finance, media and other categories. The expansion to phase 1c follows the current phase, which began Jan. 25 to include Chicagoans age 65 and up, those in congregate living settings and front-line essential workers, including teachers and police officers. Before that, vaccination kicked off mid-December for health care workers and nursing home residents and staff only. Cook County public health officials announced that suburban residents who are 16 or older and have health conditions as defined by the Illinois Department of Public Health will be eligible for the vaccine starting Monday. Mass vaccination sites run by Cook County Health in the suburbs also will begin accepting those residents then. Arwady said those in earlier phases will continue to be prioritized by primary care providers. She also added that, starting March 29, city-run mass vaccination sites such as the ones at City Colleges of Chicago locations will close to non-Chicago residents. Those centers were first launched as places to inoculate non-hospital-based health care workers, some of whom do not live in Chicago but work in the city. About 10% of Chicago residents are fully vaccinated, according to IDPH numbers. That lags the overall 12.3% rate statewide and the 12.5% figure in suburban Cook County. All Chicago Public Schools employees and vendors are now eligible to get COVID-19 vaccines at sites run by the district. CPS CEO Janice Jackson said Wednesday that the goal is to have all staff members receive a vaccination by the end of March. \u2014 Alice Yin and Gregory Pratt Why is vaccine hesitancy higher among Black and brown communities? As Illinois increases COVID-19 vaccination numbers (4.1 million vaccinations were administered statewide as of Monday), state and local leaders continue to grapple with how to make sure those in Chicago's hardest-hit communities get vaccinated. They want to make sure people in Chicago's brown and Black communities, who have [suffered disproportionately from COVID-19](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-coronavirus-deaths-demographics-lightfoot-20200406-77nlylhiavgjzb2wa4ckivh7mu-story.html), have access to vaccines. And they want to ensure the [vaccine distribution process is equitable](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-coronavirus-vaccine-equity-south-side-suburbs-appointments-20210219-pgynkdcxvra3rbndlij2qlvlm4-story.html). In a Facebook Live event March 15, community leaders including Arturo Carrillo, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council's director of health and violence prevention; the Rev. Brian E. Smith, director of advancement and strategic partnerships at the Chicago Theological Seminary; and Dr. Maya Green, Howard Brown Health's regional medical director for the South and West sides spoke about vaccine equity, access and outreach challenges facing people of color. \"We have to look at what we call preexisting social determinants,\" Green said. \"We are looking at a population that is already traumatized, and now we're confronted with yet another trauma. And as we move to a phase of potential healing, people are still concerned about what has happened to them in the past. We have to be honest with ourselves and recognize that, in this country, we have a history of medical racism. \"I think we're dealing with people that simply have been traumatized,\" Smith said, \"and they have what I call a cautious optimism. I don't think African Americans are against being vaccinated. They're just concerned that they could possibly be victimized. We have to take in account that history, be patient and do the things that are necessary to make people feel more comfortable with what we're trying to do in the present time.\" Green agreed and said conversations about vaccine hesitancy must respect that history and seek solutions from Black and brown communities. \"That conversation cannot look like me, as the doctor, trying to come in and educate,\" Green said. \"I have to come in and listen because our communities of color are brilliant. They're already educated from history.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett and Lisa Schencker Comparing the numbers of white people who are fully vaccinated versus people of color who are fully vaccinated, there's a dramatic difference. Where are missteps in outreach occurring? When talking about equality and equity with the COVID-19 vaccinations, there's a difference, the Rev. Brian E. Smith said. Equality is treating everyone equally, but equity is treating people according to their specific needs, and that's what's needed given disparities between white communities and those of color, he said. Smith said he's been asking members of his congregation to testify about their experiences when they get vaccinations. \"This is very important in terms of helping people to feel comfortable with the process and help them deal with the fears they may have regarding the vaccine,\" Smith said. The Brighton Park Neighborhood Council's Arturo Carrillo said a lack of better planning for the vaccine rollout is partly to blame for disparities between white people and people of color. \"We knew there was going to be a moment where the vaccine was going to roll out, and unfortunately, our city government hadn't planned as intentionally as they should have to ensure the infrastructure was there in these communities ... the moment these vaccines rolled out,\" Carrillo said. Carrillo said his group and other nonprofits have been trying to address questions from community members and dispel myths by providing information in Spanish and through social media. Howard Brown Health has also held Spanish-language events on vaccinations, Dr. Maya Green said. Cook County officials kicked off a new outreach campaign March 15 to encourage residents to get the vaccine. The \"My Shot\" campaign will feature county residents sharing their experience after getting the vaccine and the reason they chose to get it, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said during a news conference at Proviso Missionary Baptist Church in Maywood. The multilingual campaign will use radio and TV ads, as well as ads in bus shelters, on billboards and on social media to reach people. It's one of a number of steps the county is taking to provide resources and educational materials for those who are still unsure about getting the vaccine, so they can make a decision about vaccination, officials said. \"While many are overjoyed to get the vaccine, I also see reluctance, fear and misinformation,\" Preckwinkle said. \"The 'My Shot' campaign directly speaks to these individuals who need to hear from their neighbors about the safety of this shot and the importance of making the choice to get vaccinated.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett, Lisa Schencker and Laura Rodr\u00edguez Presa Is it safe to have surgery if I've recently been vaccinated? According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the answer is yes. If you've been vaccinated, your surgery should be scheduled at least two weeks after your final dose, so that you are fully protected. If you've had COVID-19, you can have essential or elective surgery if you have fully recovered. The [ASA recommends](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asahq.org%2Fabout-asa%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2F2020%2F12%2Fasa-and-apsf-joint-statement-on-elective-surgery-and-anesthesia-for-patients-after-covid-19-infection&data=04%7C01%7Cdrockett%40chicagotribune.com%7C0ee1a39af4814dc2cbf408d8e7eb535c%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C637514345183826384%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=2OfeKmRj1qzWb2PrT980whzHnuAeTYUL9RH%2B3FYw%2B4s%3D&reserved=0) waiting four weeks (if you had no symptoms or only mild symptoms) to 12 weeks (if you had been admitted to the ICU) to have surgery. \"It is very safe to have surgery, especially with all of the precautions in place,\" said ASA President Dr. Beverly Philip. \"Patients should feel safe and secure that they can have surgery when they need it.\" As for waiting to have surgery until you're vaccinated, the ASA recommends that if you are eligible for vaccination and are having non-emergency surgery, such as hip or knee replacement, it may be wise to get vaccinated first. If you are not yet eligible for the vaccine, talk to your surgeon or physician anesthesiologist about the best time to proceed. \u2014 Darcel Rockett Can I get a mammogram the same week I get the vaccine? A patient's mammogram can be affected by the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Dr. Deepa Sheth, an oncology radiologist at UChicago Medicine's Breast Imaging \"Specifically, we are seeing increased rates of axillary adenopathy (increased size of lymph nodes in the armpit) after receiving any of the COVID-19 vaccines,\" Sheth said. Inflammation of the lymph nodes is common after getting a vaccine that prompts a strong immune response - including the current COVID-19 vaccines, said Georgia Spear, MD, Chief of the Department of Breast Imaging at NorthShore University HealthSystem. Although the reaction is harmless, it may feel like a lump, causing undue fear for women. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/moderna/reactogenicity.html), the enlarged lymph nodes typically appeared within 2-to-4 days post-vaccination, with a median duration of lymphadenopathy of 1 to 2 days. To avoid unnecessary callback and possible biopsy, the Society of Breast Imaging recommends women consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination or four to six weeks following the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccination (if possible, and when it does not unduly delay care). \"This assumes that the patient is asymptomatic and is just getting routine screening,\" Sheth said. \"If, however, she has a new breast/axillary related concern (i.e. breast mass, new armpit swelling, skin changes, nipple discharge), then women should not delay getting a mammogram.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett Can I choose which vaccine I get? Health experts are imploring people not to wait for one type of vaccine, saying they're all effective at preventing death and hospitalization, and that rapid, widespread vaccination is needed to control the spread of COVID-19. But with the newly approved Johnson & Johnson vaccine now available in Illinois, some people are actively seeking it out, while others are trying to avoid it \u2014 a task that's easier in some places than others. Cook County's mass vaccination site in Des Plaines has so far only offered Johnson & Johnson vaccines, meaning people who want Johnson & Johnson can try to get it there and those who don't can avoid that location. And Jewel-Osco has modified its website to allow people to choose appointments for Moderna and Pfizer vaccines or those made by Johnson & Johnson, depending on supplies. But people looking for specific types of vaccines at many other pharmacies and sites must call the individual store or site if they want to know which shot is being offered on a given day.

When can I gather with friends? In what is likely welcome news to many, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-cdc-coronavirus-guidelines-for-vaccinated-people-20210308-egfbuqq6ure5tk3jr5gt3itpve-story.html)new guidance March 8, saying that fully vaccinated Americans can gather with other vaccinated people indoors without masks or social distancing. Vaccinated people can also gather with some people considered at low-risk for severe disease, such as vaccinated grandparents visiting healthy children and grandchildren. In other words, said Dr. Robert Citronberg, Advocate Aurora Health's executive medical director of infectious disease, a person who is fully vaccinated can have small, indoor gatherings with other fully vaccinated people without a mask. They can also have indoor gatherings with unvaccinated people from one other household, unless they or anyone they live with is at an increased risk for severe illness. \"You can think of this as the 'grandparents rule,' because if the grandparents have been vaccinated, they can hug their grandkids as long as there is no one in the household at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection,\" he said. But until more people are vaccinated, the CDC still cautions that vaccinated people should keep wearing masks, avoid large gatherings and physically distance when out in public. A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the last vaccine dose. Caution is still key, said Dr. John Segreti, an epidemiologist and medical director of infection control and prevention at Rush University Medical Center Hospital. \"Even though the vaccines are very effective, particularly at preventing severe COVID-19 and death, they're not 100% effective at preventing people from getting sick,\" he said. \"We also don't know if they prevent vaccinated people from transmitting the virus to others. So it's possible for someone who's vaccinated to be infected but not have symptoms and unknowingly pass on the virus to someone else. Therefore, we need to keep wearing masks and distancing until most of the population has been vaccinated and we achieve herd immunity.\" \u2014 Alison Bowen When will vaccines be available for children? COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in adults are also authorized for use in teenagers at least 16 years old, said Dr. Matthew Davis, chair of pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Davis expects that vaccines may be authorized for children 12 years and older as soon as this summer; clinical trials may begin for children as young as 6 months later this spring or summer. Lurie Children's Hospital will serve as a site for COVID-19 vaccine trials for children under 12; parents interested in enrolling their children can find out more information [here](https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/news-stories/sars-cov-2-covid19-pediatric-vaccine-registry). Pfizer and Moderna [both have studies](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-nw-coronavirus-vaccine-children-20210304-xry7th4p3jg2zhap74oeu33yha-story.html) for children age 12 and older, and are expecting to release that data this summer. Testing for younger children will be more complicated, because they might need different dosing. Pfizer and Moderna expect to start studies for children 11 and younger later this year, according to the Associated Press. \u2014 Alison Bowen Do the vaccines impact fertility? Doctors are [working to combat misinformation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-coronavirus-vaccine-fertility-misinformation-20210304-ju45hft27rhytjvj5sc62c44ai-story.html#nt=outfit&nt=feed-flex-feature) online about how the vaccine might impact fertility. The misinformation is falsely connecting the vaccine and infertility, and fertility experts say there is no evidence the vaccines can lead to loss of fertility. Experts point out that the COVID-19 vaccines have nothing to do with the reproductive system, and that the vaccines do not use live viruses or alter human DNA. And they stress that the danger of contracting COVID-19 [when pregnant is real](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-covid-health-pregnancy-vaccines-phase-available-tt-20210120-g3ixheou45cb7b2bkh2w22mvmi-story.html), including increased risk of hospitalization, premature delivery and other delivery complications. The CDC has added pregnancy to its list of conditions that are deemed high risk. \u2014 Madeline Buckley Can I get a flu shot or any other vaccine near when I get the COVID-19 vaccine? People who plan to get a flu shot should ensure it is not timed near a COVID-19 vaccine. [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/faq.html) for health care professionals indicates that, ideally, the coronavirus vaccine should be administered by itself, with 14 days before or after any other vaccine, such as a Tdap or flu shot. However, it says COVID-19 vaccines may be administered within a shorter period in situations where the benefits of vaccination are deemed to outweigh potential risk or to avoid barriers or delays. \"Additionally, if the only opportunity for vaccination occurs during this 14-day interval and you do not expect the patient to return, you may vaccinate them,\" the CDC instructs providers. \u2014 Alison Bowen Who can get a vaccination at the United Center? Seniors age 65 and older can schedule an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccine at the new [United Center mass vaccination](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-united-center-vaccination-site-20210302-d6uvdojpu5atdnpl2casiairie-story.html) site.

The United Center site will have the capacity to administer 6,000 doses per day, with all doses provided directly by the federal government. Documentation regarding immigration status is not required. On-site language translation will be available. Arwady said seniors are welcome to bring a companion to help walk them through the vaccine process, but the companion won't get vaccinated.

Are doses being wasted? According to Chicago public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady, vaccine doses are not being wasted. During a [March 2 news conference](https://twitter.com/chicagosmayor/status/1366826487601504261), she said that is the question she gets most often. After the Pfizer vaccine is thawed for use, Arwady said, the six doses in the vial must be administered within five days. For the Moderna vaccine's 10 doses in one vial, it's 30 days. She said there is a lot of behind-the-scenes planning to ensure that all vaccine is used \u2014 from waitlists to putting missed appointments back on [zocdoc.com/vaccine](http://zocdoc.com/vaccine) to vaccinating workers and volunteers at city of Chicago vaccination sites at the end of the day. \"I want people to hear that there is not wasted vaccine,\" she said. \"At the city level, when we're pushing out vaccine, we will push the vaccine that has one day of use on it to sites that we know will use it all at the beginning of the day. The way we allocate vaccine in Chicago and the way people pull vaccine out of the freezers only on a week-by-week basis, we provide vaccine where people are able to say, 'Here's how many appointments I have for this week.' And they've got to show they've been using 85% or more of their appointments each week.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett A study shows patients with severe COVID-19 may be at risk for certain eye abnormalities. Should I see an eye doctor if I had COVID-19? [The study](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2021204394?_ga=2.84704793.1856767117.1613509379-1816357284.1613149885&) used MRI scans to find significant abnormalities in the eyes of some people with severe COVID-19. The 129 patients in the study underwent a brain MRI, and 7 percent of those had abnormal MRI findings of the eyeball. Eight of these patients had spent time in the ICU for COVID-19. The scans revealed one or more nodules on the back of the eye. According to Dr. [Asim Farooq](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/asim-farooq), a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Chicago, it's unclear how common these findings are, what the significance is, and what would be any long-term impact on vision. Farooq said more research is needed. \"In that particular study, patients had severe COVID, they were in the ICU, then they had an MRI for other reasons, not because they were having vision problems or eye problems,\" he said. \"Data warrants more investigation to determine whether or not these are long-term changes or are just temporary. Do they impact vision, or is their vision completely unaffected. At this point, I don't have enough to go on to say that every patient who's had COVID-19 needs to have a full dilated eye exam within X number of days of their diagnosis because we're really worried about this process happening or there being nodules on the back of the eye. I think we'll know more in the future.\" Farooq said that if patients who have had COVID-19 are having vision problems, they should see an ophthalmologist and have a full eye exam. \"I've seen, at this point, a lot of patients who have had COVID-19. They recovered, and they come in for an eye exam. And they have a normal eye exam,\" said Farooq, whose area of expertise is viral infections of the eye. \"Most patients don't seem to be getting long-term complications from COVID-19 in the eye. Is it possible? Yes. If he has symptoms, then you should go see your ophthalmologist.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett Johnson & Johnson's single-dose COVID-19 vaccine is effective, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed. Who should get it? Dr. Emily Landon, the head of the University of Chicago's infection control and prevention efforts, said she expects the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to make recommendations soon about which population it would be best to prioritize with this vaccine. The vaccine, which is about 66% effective, \"isn't as effective as the others, but it's still very effective at preventing illness and reducing transmission, and you should get whatever vaccine you can.\" As far as the possibility of people being able to choose which vaccine, \"We're a long way from people being able to have choice in terms of which vaccine to get,\" Landon said. \"So at this point, the most important thing is to get whatever vaccine you're able to get.\" \u2014 Alison Bowen How long will Johnson & Johnson's vaccine protection last? Much like with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it is not clear how long immunity from Johnson & Johnson's product will last. Scientists are trying to answer that question now and say it's possible people might need annual shots, just like with the flu vaccine, especially as more variants emerge and become dominant. The vaccine makers also say they are prepared to adapt their vaccines for the variants if needed, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said recently that it would not need to do more expansive human trials. \u2014 Baltimore Sun If offered, should I take a Johnson & Johnson vaccine or wait for a more effective one? There is wide agreement among public health and medical professionals that people should not hesitate to take Johnson & Johnson's vaccine. The latest vaccine offers a high level of protection after just one dose, while Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's products call for two doses. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine can last up to three months in the refrigerator, whereas the other vaccines must be stored at very cold temperatures. That could potentially make it easier to access and administer, especially in rural areas without freezer capacity. Dr. Anna P. Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said people should not dwell on which vaccine to get, and that it's difficult to compare the vaccines, which were tested in different places and reported their data differently. Johnson & Johnson, for example, factored in some of the new, more contagious virus variants into its study, including the one first discovered in South Africa, which the Pfizer and Moderna trials did not originally include. It also studied more non-U.S. citizens than the other two candidates, and measured efficacy at different points in the study. \"It's like comparing apples and oranges,\" Durbin said. \"What I would recommend is take whatever vaccine you can get. Don't quibble over which one it is. Take whichever is available. Efficacy numbers ... are not the whole story. We're really looking for prevention of severe disease, hospitalization and death. All of these vaccines are excellent at that.\" \u2014 Baltimore Sun Read more about the latest information on the [Johnson & Johnson vaccine here.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-aud-johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-questions-20210225-iqbhesjxnrb77odfyznu6emwvu-story.html) When and how can I finally hug my parents or grandparents after they have the 2nd dose of vaccine? Landon says if grandparents want to hang out with people who are not vaccinated, it doesn't really matter how vaccinated they are. They should still gather in the safest way possible. \"The same thing still applies until everybody that's getting together has been vaccinated and it's (two weeks) after their second dose,\" she said. Think of something outdoors, with masks and the same precautions experts have been urging. But, she said, hug away. Grandparents and a grandkid wearing masks can hug briefly, she said. \"I think that's OK, these brief contacts with another human being when you are protected with a mask, and there's good ventilation, like you're outside,\" she said. \"That's different from everybody hanging out in a warm, hot kitchen, with the windows closed and no ventilation on and not wearing masks.\" Dr. Jacqueline Ivey-Brown, a primary care physician with Advocate Health Care, is empathetic to people wanting to get together once vaccinated. But she cautions, \"Even after fully vaccinated, people still need to be vigilant with masks and social distancing, because there is a chance you can spread viral particles even if you're not sick.\" \u2014 Alison Bowen Are larger venues, like a spacious museum or concert hall, safer than restaurants? Dr. Benjamin Singer, assistant professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, said that it depends, and it will be hard to assess because ventilation matters. \"I do not know of any data comparing the risk of transmission in outdoor versus large indoor spaces,\" he said. \"Of course, not all large indoor spaces and events are the same in terms of airspace, ventilation, airflow patterns, number of occupants, spacing between occupants, time in the space and other factors that determine the risk of transmission.\" So essentially, although a larger and emptier, well-ventilated indoor space is better than a small, cramped and poorly ventilated indoor space, \"I do not think we know that the former is necessarily as safe as being outside.\" He added that having a larger amount of air in a space means more opportunity for airborne virus to be diluted, which could mean less likelihood of encountering an infectious dose. But he said the ventilation is likely more important. \u2014 Alison Bowen Should people wear 2 masks to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus? Researchers found that two masks are better than one in slowing coronavirus spread. The [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) reported on Feb. 16 the results of a lab experiment that spaced two artificial heads 6 feet from each other and checked to see how many coronavirus-size particles spewed by one were inhaled by the other. The researchers found that wearing one mask \u2014 surgical or cloth \u2014 blocked about 40% of the particles coming toward the head that was breathing in. When a cloth mask was worn on top of a surgical mask, about 80% were blocked. When both heads were double-masked, more than 95% of the particles were blocked, according to the CDC's Dr. John Brooks. However, health officials stopped short of recommending that everyone double up on masking. \u2014 Darcel Rockett Will vaccines be available to everyone by the end of April? In a \" [CBS This Morning](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/dr-anthony-fauci-on-covid-19-vaccination-efforts-school-reopenings/#x)\" interview Feb. 17, U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci said the plan to have vaccines available to \"everybody and anybody\" who wants to take them (beyond those eligible under 1a, 1b and 1c guidelines) by the end of April has shifted. Johnson & Johnson's one-dose vaccine will likely not be available for \"another couple of months after that,\" he said. However, Fauci said he's pretty confident that J&J's doses will be in the pipeline by the end of June or the beginning of July. \"I'm sure we'll get them by that time,\" he said. He knows uniformity and consistency with vaccination dissemination has been difficult so far. \"Right now the demand far exceeds the supply. As we get into the later months, April, May, June and July, those kind of difficulties and discrepancies will disappear.\" \u2014 Darcel Rockett Will more mass vaccination sites be opening in Illinois? Gov. J.B. Pritzker launched three additional state-supported mass vaccination sites \u2014 two in Carbondale and another in Springfield. The Springfield site (opened Feb. 17) and the combined Carbondale sites (opening Feb. 19) will each launch with an allocation of 4,000 doses per week with plans to ramp up to the full capacity of 2,700 doses daily, pending increases in federal vaccine shipments. The new sites build upon the state-supported mass vaccination infrastructure at the Tinley Park Convention Center in Cook County and the Belle-Clair Fairgrounds and Expo Center in St. Clair County. \u2014 Darcel Rockett As news of COVID-19 variants spreading continues, is there an entity keeping track of their development? Cases of COVID-19 mutations of the coronavirus have been popping up in Illinois. Last week, [22 ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-illinois-covid-vaccines-20210209-teaybdm6uvegdkojgrlumu4ve4-story.html) [cases](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-illinois-covid-vaccines-20210209-teaybdm6uvegdkojgrlumu4ve4-story.html) of the B.1.1.7 variant were identified in Illinois, according to public health officials. And a case of variant B.1.351 was reported in [Rock Island](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-illinois-vaccines-20210211-fgobvgdfyveuzaffcj7jv5tnfu-story.html).

White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients has called U.S. tracking of virus mutations \"totally unacceptable,\" saying the nation ranks 43rd in the world. Currently, there is [legislation advancing in Congress](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-aud-nw-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-20210217-ni4yiuz3uzhivmld5rt4qrf4t4-story.html#rt=chartbeat-flt) that would provide $1.75 billion for genomic sequencing or mapping the DNA of coronavirus mutations. Sequencing could take COVID-19 precautions to the next level, according to U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. \"Variants represent a growing threat. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing our testing capacity was essential to our ability to track and slow the spread of the virus \u2014 the same is true for finding and tracking these variants,\" she said. \u2014 Angie Leventis Lourgos and Associated Press Will community health centers directly receive more vaccines from the federal government? On Feb. 9, President Joe Biden announced the Federally Qualified Health Center program, which will directly provide more vaccines to community health clinics. According to the White House, starting Feb. 15, federally qualified community health centers will [begin directly receiving vaccines](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-community-health-centers-vaccination-program-to-launch-next-week-and-another-increase-in-states-tribes-territories-vaccine-supply/ersity). The initial phase will include at least one community health center in each state. Gov. J.B. Pritzker noted the program Jan. 10 and said it would ramp up over the coming weeks. When will pregnant women be eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine? In Illinois, pregnant women will be eligible when phase 1b expands to include medical conditions such as pregnancy on Feb. 25. Pregnant women are [commonly excluded from research](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-coronavirus-vaccine-analysis-sex-women-0719-20200719-cpas3dhilvemxfqrs4wzmcpjrm-story.html), and were not included in initial clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine, despite groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calling for their inclusion. This is an issue, said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, co-director of the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Prevention Network, because many in the health care field are women. A Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine statement recommended that health care workers be offered the vaccine if pregnant, and that in general, pregnant women should have access to vaccines in future vaccine campaigns. Dr. Emily Miller, assistant professor in the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Northwestern Medicine's Feinberg School of Medicine, said unknowns have to be \"balanced against the risk of not getting the vaccine, which is the risk of acquisition of (COVID-19), which has concrete and well-documented risks. ... Through that lens, if we can remember that there is no zero-risk option, then the balance at this point favors receiving the vaccine.\" Should breastfeeding moms receive a vaccine? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [guidance](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19), says lactating women should be offered the vaccine. Because breastfeeding and lactating women were not included in initial trials, data is limited about how the COVID-19 vaccines might impact them. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine [noted the limited data](https://www.bfmed.org/abm-statement-considerations-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-lactation) but also noted that vaccines generally do not affect the safety of breastfeeding. Despite the CDC guidance that women should be able to speak with their provider and make their own decisions regarding the vaccine, some localities might exclude them. Last week, Kane County reversed a decision that had [denied vaccines to pregnant and breastfeeding women](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-covid-vaccine-breastfeeding-kane-county-pregnant-women-tt-20210205-cwfun6twmzh5jgpt3gvecs5ywy-story.html) even if they were otherwise eligible. I completed my doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Days later, I was prescribed a steroid and antibiotic. I am concerned this might blunt or diminish the vaccine. How can I determine if the vaccine will still be effective? Should I get an antibody test to determine efficacy? Dr. Michael Lin, a Rush University Medical Center infectious disease specialist, said that right now, antibody testing is not recommended to assess immunity to COVID-19 after vaccination, partly because reliable tests are not commercially available. Many of the antibody tests are not designed to test for the vaccine-generated antibody, he said, so these tests would be expected to have negative results, which could lead to false anxiety. As far as medications, Lin said that, in general, medications will not interfere with COVID-19 vaccines. \"A potential exception would be medications designed to suppress the immune system, such as steroids,\" he said. \"At this time, data are not available to establish vaccine safety and efficacy in people who are taking immune-suppressive medications.\" But he added that he agrees with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [statement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html) that people with immunocompromising conditions might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19, and that they may receive the vaccine if \"they have no contraindications to vaccination.\" CDC guidance adds, \"However, they should be counseled about the unknown vaccine safety profile and effectiveness in immunocompromised populations, as well as the potential for reduced immune responses and the need to continue to follow all current guidance to protect themselves against COVID-19.\" It's hard scheduling a vaccination appointment. Is there a site that makes it easier? The hunt for COVID-19 vaccines has seemed like a part-time job for some, and stories of people venturing to other neighborhoods to get them are plentiful. Starting Feb. 2, Chicago began promoting use of Zocdoc, a [national website](https://www.zocdoc.com/vaccine) that allows people to find and schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments from some local vaccination sites, including those operated by AMITA Health, Erie Family Health, Innovative Express Care and Rush University Medical Center. Don't be worried if appointments for February are already full, said public health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady. The process is going as expected, Arwady said, and residents should register their emails for notifications about future availability. Zocdoc will allow people to sign up to be notified when new appointments are available. Suburban Cook County residents can make appointments through the Cook County Public Health [site](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/communicable-diseases/covid-19/). Illinoisans can go through the [ Illinois Department of Health](https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/vaccination-location) and enter their ZIP code to find vaccination locations and get appointment information. \u2014 Gregory Pratt, Alice Yin What if I get one dose of the vaccine but don't follow up for the second? According to the Journal of the American Medical Association ( [JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776229?guestAccessKey=f955f7b1-976c-46a9-9e7b-6e1432f604cb&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=020321)), it is not known what will happen if a person gets only one dose \u2014 partial immunity and a higher risk of susceptibility to a variant that causes COVID-19 are two possibilities. There is no evidence that people who get only one dose have adequate long-term protection against COVID-19 infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html)) recommends the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine be given within three weeks of the first dose for the Pfizer vaccine and within four weeks for the Moderna vaccine. No more than six weeks should lapse between doses. If the second dose is not given during these time frames, it can be given without the need to repeat the first dose. Earlier doses of the second shot are not recommended, but if a person needs to get a second dose earlier, giving the second dose up to four days ahead of schedule is allowed. Is anyone studying how vaping affects a COVID-19 outcome? [Dr. Nora Volkow](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2020/10/new-evidence-substance-use-disorders-covid-19-susceptibility), director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (part of the National Institutes of Health), says there is [research/data](https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/news-releases/2020/12/study-surge-of-teen-vaping-levels-off-but-remains-high-as-of-early-2020) being collected from the vaping population. While relatively new, there are [published reports](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30399-2/fulltext) that look at the association between vaping and the risk of getting infected with coronavirus and/or developing symptoms. A national online survey conducted in May 2020 of people aged 13-24 revealed those with a history of e-cigarettes and vaping showed a significant increased risk of being infected with COVID-19, five times higher. \"Vaping poses inflammatory changes in the pulmonary airway,\" Volkow said. \"And if you have an inflammation, you are much more vulnerable to being infected with viruses or bacteria. You have two conditions - vaping and COVID-19, both of them harming the pulmonary epithelium, and you can see why it is very likely that in this case, if you are vaping you are at higher risk of not just infection but worse, the outcome. The recommendation across the world of pulmonary specialists is try to avoid smoking, vaping or putting anything in your lungs, that can harm them.\" How can I schedule my second shot? The second dose of the Moderna shot is supposed to be given 28 days after the first, and the second dose of the Pfizer shot is supposed to be given 21 days after the first. Many pharmacies and health systems are scheduling second shots, on-site, right after people receive their first ones. University of Chicago Medicine is typically scheduling people for their second shots when they get first doses, and if they don't schedule at that time, they get electronic reminders to do so. At Rush University Medical Center, the clinician who gives a person a shot also books that person for their second one, Quick said. Some people reported trouble scheduling a second shot at Walgreens, but the Walgreens website has been updated to allow people to schedule first and second doses at the same time, said spokesman Phil Caruso. People who already got a first shot at Walgreens without being able to schedule a second one will be contacted with steps to make their second dose appointments, he said. Mariano's, Jewel-Osco and Walmart are scheduling second shots when people get their first shots. \u2014 Lisa Schencker What if I can't get my shot 21 days or 28 days after the first? People shouldn't panic if they can't get their second doses on day 21 or 28, said Dr. Michelle Prickett, an associate professor of medicine in pulmonary and critical care at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. Those are the recommended times for the second doses, but there is wiggle room. Those second doses may also be given, if necessary, up to four days earlier than the recommended time or as late as within six weeks of the first dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As long as people receive their second doses within that six-week time frame, \"It should be effective,\" Prickett said. \u2014 Lisa Schencker Do all Cook County ZIP codes work for the county's vaccination program? Yes. Despite a technological snafu Jan. 27, all Cook County ZIP codes should work on the website for the Cook County Community Vaccination Program, where people can sign up for vaccine updates, distribution locations and notification of when vaccine administration is open to your phase. Put in your ZIP code for more information here: [https://vaccine.cookcountyil.gov](https://vaccine.cookcountyil.gov/). People should get an email with their phase and a confirmation number. Do I have to prove I'm 65 or older or an essential worker to get a shot? In some places, yes, and in other places, no. Loyola, for example, is asking older patients to bring an ID with date of birth, and essential workers to bring proof of their employment, such as a letter from their employer, a pay stub, a work ID or a uniform to their vaccination appointments, Gupta said. Loyola is turning away people who cannot prove they're eligible. Cook County Health asks for proof from essential workers when they check in at the county's mass vaccination sites, such as staff IDs, professional license numbers or certificates, pay stubs, signed letters from employers or a uniform. Others, however, are taking a different approach. Rush is asking people to bring a photo ID, but otherwise is not asking essential workers for proof of employment, Quick said. Walgreens' website says people should bring work IDs or other documents showing proof of employment to their vaccination appointments if they're front-line, essential workers. \u2014 Lisa Schencker What kinds of side effects might I experience from the vaccine? The most common side effects are pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain, though people may also have chills, nausea and/or vomiting. Most side effects go away within a few days. Side effects are mostly mild to moderate, according to the CDC. \u2014 Lisa Schencker Is it true that side effects are more common with the second dose than the first? Yes, said Prickett. The side effects typically only last for a day or two but most commonly include fatigue, headache and/or muscle pain. With the second dose of each vaccine, higher percentages of people in clinical trials experienced fatigue, headache or muscle pain than with the first dose, according to the CDC. \"It's essentially restimulating your immune system to think it's trying to fight the virus again,\" Prickett said. \"Most people who are vaccinated are having an immune response, and it's just an indicator their immune system is trying to make antibodies to the virus.\" \u2014 Lisa Schencker When should someone seek medical attention because of side effects? Severe reactions, such as an allergic response, are rare, and typically occur within 15 minutes of receiving the shot, which is why patients are generally being observed for 15 minutes after being vaccinated, Prickett said. People, however, should seek medical attention if they're experiencing high fevers after a shot, altered mental states, gastrointestinal issues with dehydration, or if they pass out, she said. \u2014 Lisa Schencker Will we see 100 million doses of the vaccine delivered in the next 100 days? As this week marks the [one-year anniversary](https://www.ajmc.com/view/a-timeline-of-covid19-developments-in-2020) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States, the CDC has a new director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky. She spoke to the [Journal of the American Medical Association's network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSopzX_uZ5Q) Jan. 19 about President Joe Biden's goal of delivering [100 million doses](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-fauci/fauci-says-100-million-vaccinations-in-100-days-absolutely-a-doable-thing-idUSL1N2JS0CF) of COVID-19 vaccine within the first 100 days of his presidency. This was on the heels of the announcement of four [new Cook County vaccination locations](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-vaccine-chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-distribution-update-20210114-bhjwgvaksvcy7acv67qrhsumzi-story.html) (available for health care workers who are part of phase 1a before opening to those eligible for phase 1b on Jan. 25). \"I don't think the (president) would have suggested 100 million doses for the next 100 days if he, his team, and we didn't have a vision about supply,\" Walensky said. \"There are four prongs to this that Biden and the team is working on: - One is community vaccination centers, be it stadiums, gymnasiums, things like that. - Another is mobile units, making sure we can do the outreach to get to those communities who otherwise wouldn't be reached. - Another is for federally qualified health centers. Some of that is happening, but not as much as could be happening across the States. - And finally, a pharmacy program \u2014 working closely with the States and the [pharmacies](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/vaccine/ct-coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-illinois-seniors-get-shots-20210120-y76mmtd5dfc55ikn25x7fqib2u-story.html)to make sure we can do outreach at the pharmacy level.\" Will the distribution of the vaccine be fair? \"The vision of that four-pronged approach to places is really founded in equity,\" Walensky said. We want to make sure that we can deliver volume, but also volume to the people in places that might be harder to reach, and then this collaboration of the federal level to make sure that with the entire support and resources available at the federal level to work with states in order to do that distribution.\" Robert Wachter of UCSF School of Medicine and Paul Offit of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia spoke about vaccine doses in [another virtual conversation with the JAMA Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrHbBolmmqc). Wachter said the rollout has been sluggish. \"I think what we had was a lot of well-meaning groups try to parse this around to which groups should be prioritized using ethical principles and redressing health care disparities,\" he said. \"All correct, but I don't believe there was a whole lot of discussion about the practical implications, someone saying, 'How the hell is this going to work?' \"The more complex a system is, the less equitable it is likely to be. Who is going to be able to figure out their way around the system? It's going to be the well-to-do, it's going to be the privileged \u2014 exhibit A is the tax code. And so, what our fear was in a perfectly well-meaning effort to get the ethics right, we have created a monster \u2014 an absolutely, unworkable mess of a system that was going to be confusing. And ultimately, inequitable, even though the goal was equity,\" Wachter said. \"Our recommendation: We go back to the drawing board and start with the groups that we started with: health care workers and people in nursing homes, and then go to age,\" he said. \"The advantage of age is it's completely knowable, stores know how to card people, everybody has identification that shows their age. When you're done with 55 and above, you go to a lottery. And the lottery this week, the number we pulled is a No. 3. If the last number in the year of your birth is the number three, it is your week. Congratulations. You go and get your shot.\" How effective will the vaccines be on COVID-19 variants? \"I think with regard to the variants,\" Walensky said, \"we worry about four things: increased transmissibility, increased morbidity and mortality, and then, how robust our vaccines and our therapies are in tackling them when they arise. We will probably be doing most of the detection and the surveillance at the CDC level,\" she said. \"I think the good news with regard to the variants is that the efficacy of the vaccine is so good and so high that we have a little bit of a cushion. So that even in the lab some of these variants don't appear as robust as the initial strain that we'll probably still end up with quite a good vaccine. \"I just want to remind people almost no vaccine we have is 95% effective. So, before we panic and say, 'Well, should I really get the vaccine if it's not going to work against the variant?' It's going to work against the variant. Will it be 95%? Maybe. Will it be 70%? Maybe. But our flu vaccines aren't 70% effective every year, and we've still got them. So, so I'm really optimistic about how these variants are going to go.\" How can Chicagoans get information on when a vaccine might be available to them? Although public registration to get in line for a vaccine is not yet available, Chicagoans can find vaccine updates at [chicago.gov/COVIDvax](https://www.chicago.gov/COVIDvax). As the rollout progresses, the Chicago Department of Public Health will update the website with registration and clinic information. The city is expanding its network of vaccination sites, called Points of Dispensing, or PODs, in preparation for vaccine rollout to the general public. By next week, the city will have six PODs, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Jan. 14. The city-run sites, similar to the city's COVID-19 testing sites, will be in addition to several thousand established providers \u2014 doctors' offices, pharmacies and federally qualified health centers \u2014 ready to vaccinate Chicagoans when more doses of the vaccines become available, Lightfoot said. Health care workers, who are already eligible under the current phase 1a, can make an appointment to receive a vaccine at a POD site. A representative from their health care facility must complete the Staff Vaccination Inquiry Survey, which is [available here](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid19-vaccine/home/healthcare-providers.html). Why does COVID-19 pneumonia last longer and cause more damage than typical pneumonia? Northwestern Medicine researchers sought to answer this question in a study published in the journal Nature on Jan. 11. They found that COVID-19 spreads across the lungs in a way unlike other types of pneumonia. Instead of rapidly infecting large regions of the lungs, the virus causing COVID-19 plants itself in multiple small areas across the lung, researchers said. It uses the lungs' own immune cells to spread in a way that researchers described as like multiple wildfires spreading across a forest. This drives the disease over a slower and longer course than what doctors see with influenza. Northwestern will be testing an experimental drug that targets COVID-19 pneumonia. When might teachers receive vaccines? Chicago Public Schools resumed some in-person schooling Jan. 4, but [half of teachers did not show up](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-schools-reopening-plan-principal-union-attacks-district-20210105-uigfhflnafepbazdj4kugdfbey-story.html), amid concerns about risks. \"It is absolutely possible for schools to be open, not driving community infection,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said Jan. 5. Arwady said educators will be included in phase 1b. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, teachers and support staff members and child care workers should be vaccinated under [phase 1b](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm695152e2.htm?s_cid=mm695152e2_w). Educator access to vaccines has been [part of the conversation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-covid-19-vaccines-cps-teachers-20210122-uzklx3tktvhhrcpiucngrmzlda-story.html) as Chicago Public Schools considers its reopening plans. Arwady said guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows moving onto future stages when several things happen: when demand seems to be met for those vaccinating under the current stage, and when the supply of vaccine increases. \"We need more vaccine,\" she said. \"We do intend to make vaccine available for anyone who is in public-facing settings,\" she said. She added that this means all kinds of educators, including those private and parochial schools as well as day care workers. Does Chicago have enough vaccine? Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Jan. 5 that with the level of vaccine the city has received so far, administering at least 33,607 doses of vaccine, it would take a year and a half to vaccinate everyone. The city has distributed 95% of the vaccine that officials have received, Lightfoot said. But she added, \"We do not have enough vaccine.\" She has asked both the outgoing and incoming federal administrations for an [increase in the amount of the vaccine](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-vaccines-second-doses-20210105-34pgyimohbesndxyxg2dvvugyy-story.html) to the city. \"If you want to have us bend this curve, and give people confidence that they can resume their normal lives, there must be an exponential increase in the amount of vaccine that's available to cities and towns all over the country,\" Lightfoot said. I am in the high-risk category for COVID-19. I'm an Illinois resident but out of state for the next six months. Am I eligible to receive the vaccine in the state I am visiting? According to Dr. Kevin Most,a board-certified physician in family medicine and chief medical officer and senior vice president for medical affairs at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital, the issue is going to hinge on whether the reader has a physician who will identify her as being high risk. \"We're getting to this 1B, 1C rollout, where we're starting to take care of people over the age of 75 \u2014 that's easily done with a driver's license,\" he said. \"Those between the ages of 16 and 64 in that 2B (rollout) with complications or vulnerabilities \u2014 that certainly is going to take a physician to identify you as having diabetes or COPD. We're making sure we vaccinate people in the right stratification regardless of where they're at. I can't speak for whatever state she's in, but you would hope that if she has proof that she falls into what would be the 1C category, that they would honor that. When she's back here, the vaccine should be out to the general public.\" I am a nurse who tested positive with coronavirus in November. I had mild symptoms and recovered. What are the findings related to people with past histories of virus exposure and the vaccine? \"We're asking any health care workers who know that they have tested positive for COVID-19, and done well, to hold off getting the vaccine for 90 days,\" Most said. \"We don't have enough vaccine to get to all the front-line workers, and we know that these individuals who had COVID-19 have some natural immunity. That being said, individuals who had COVID-19, we certainly will vaccinate them. You've had influenza before, do we give you another influenza shot? Absolutely ... it's essentially a booster. With this illness, it's very clear we have many people who are asymptomatic, but yet had the illness. We're not sure exactly how strong their immune system is, so the ability to give them a booster with the vaccine is going to be one of the ways that we're really going to fight and control the spread.\" I agreed to watching a friend's pets while she is out of town. I will not be in direct contact with her, however I am nervous about the apartment. How long before the danger of inhaling the virus is gone? \"If they're going to be gone for two months or three weeks, cleaning the house once is perfect,\" Most said. \"Be careful of any surfaces you touch. We know that the virus can survive on surfaces for a while. As long as you are wearing a mask and don't touch the surface and then your mouth or your face very quickly, you'll be fine. Someone who is going to take care of a dog in a house, If they wait for 24 to 48 hours, after walking the dog a couple of times and they're going to do it the next week, you don't have to wash the surfaces every day. \"Now, if you have a neighbor who can't get out to walk their dog, and you're going to go walk the dog for that individual, you've got to be a little bit more careful. Wash your hands prior to going in, make sure you wear a mask, wear gloves. Walk the dog. When you bring the dog back and hand the dog off again, wash your hands. The goal is to not be around somebody for more than 15 minutes who potentially could have the illness that you don't know about. For the long-term care of a home when someone's gone, don't be concerned.\" Should Americans be concerned about the highly contagious new variant of the coronavirus circulating in England? British officials recently have expressed alarm about a highly contagious [coronavirus mutation](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-nyt-covid-mutations-variants-20201220-6rhskcsekzcyznm7lgt4tfgepq-story.html) circulating in England. According to University of Chicago Medicine's Dr. Allison Bartlett, who specializes in the medical management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, it is important that Americans be aware that this variant has been detected. But because scientists actively have been looking for potential variants throughout the pandemic, news of mutations lets us know that the process is working. \"This variant has multiple mutations, several of which are in the spike protein, which is important for attaching to host (human) cells and which is the target for the currently available vaccines,\" she said. \"There are many parameters that influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). The structure of the virus is one important parameter, but the behavior and environment of the population is critical as well. Mask use, physical distancing, ventilation, hand-washing all impact the risk of transmission, and will remain effective and essential components of controlling the pandemic.\" Bartlett says the mutation news does not have an impact on vaccination plans in the United States because there is no evidence to suggest that the spike protein in the variant is distinct enough that the current vaccines will not be effective. \"The virus (as with all viruses) is constantly mutating. Many mutations lead to dead ends; some lead to virus that can be spread from person to person,\" Bartlett added. \"Our hope is that when millions of people are vaccinated, there will be less virus circulating in the community and, therefore, fewer opportunities for mutations to develop. However, if a mutant virus develops that is not susceptible to the vaccine-derived immune response, that strain could spread from person to person if people have let down their guard and are not masking, physically distancing, etc.\" How can the medical field ease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in communities of color? While the pandemic has affected all of our lives, it has disproportionately affected Black and brown communities. [Over one-third ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/almost-one-third-of-black-americans-know-someone-who-died-of-covid-19-survey-shows/2020/06/25/3ec1d4b2-b563-11ea-aca5-ebb63d27e1ff_story.html)of Black adults in a June survey said they knew someone firsthand who'd died after contracting COVID-19. And yet, in a [recent poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/), fewer than half of Black Americans said they would take the coronavirus vaccine. Drs. Brandi Jackson and Brittani James discussed COVID-19 and the Black community in a Chicago Tribune [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/chicagotribune/videos/752022209062967). James, a family practitioner with the University of Illinois health system and assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine, offered some suggestions on how to alleviate vaccine concerns for those in the Black community: \"Think of the people who will be trusted by the Black community, who are already trusted by the Black community,\" she said. \"I'm talking about Black church leaders. We turn to local community centers, we turn to local activists, nonprofits. Those are the people and the institutions, really, that the Black community trusts. So, any intervention that is serious about getting their buy-in, you have to go through these authorities in the local community, Black and brown communities, to spread that message (to take the vaccine). From everything that I can evaluate, this is safe, not just for white people, for all people.\" Jackson, director of Integrative Behavioral Health at Howard Brown Health Center and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Rush University Medical College, agreed and suggested that Black and brown communities read the vaccine research and data, and then make an informed decision. \"When you're making your assessment, don't fall into the trap of only attending to the potential side effects,\" she said. \"The question people need to be asking is: How does that compare to what happens if I don't get the vaccine? How does that compare to my risk of contracting and passing away from coronavirus? That number is so far from zero, that risk is not negligible, particularly if you're in the Black community. We know that being a Black person in America right now, your risk is higher than a white person of contracting and dying from COVID-19. So, you should think about that.\" How long does it take before the vaccine is effective in the body? The vaccine starts to work right away within the body, said University of Chicago Medicine infectious diseases expert Dr. Emily Landon. In a Chicago Tribune [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/chicagotribune/videos/245728680227205), Landon explained how it signals our immune system: \"We create molecules that have our body make the proteins that basically act like a wanted poster for your immune system. They say, 'This is what you're looking for. When you find this, kill it.'\" Although the vaccine starts to work right away, how long it takes until you're immune or able to fight off the disease is hard to say. Landon said with the Pfizer vaccine, about half of the time, data showed people had antibodies a few weeks after getting the vaccine. Researchers are still learning about how long this might protect people. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it typically takes a few weeks for the body to provide protection, so it is possible that a person could be infected and become sick with COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination. What will distribution of the vaccine look like? The first thing to understand, Landon said, is \"it's not a single-file line.\" Rather, when the vaccine is released to approved populations, it will be groups of people that are first priority, second priority, third priority. \"It's not like Southwest boarding, it's more like United boarding,\" Landon said. Groups of people will be able to get vaccines all at the same time. And this is important to understand because there might not be enough vaccines for everyone in those groups on the first day a group is able to be vaccinated. So there might be some waiting, but, Landon added, \"It doesn't matter too much in the grand scheme of things if you get vaccinated this Wednesday or next Wednesday.\" She added that you don't have to go when your group is called. You can wait until the next group, if you still have some concerns about some aspects of the vaccine. For example, some people who are pregnant are [assessing whether to get a vaccine](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-covid-pregnant-women-becoming-pregnant-vaccine-tt-20201202-xl4jvwjoqvfhfpciigjetcef5a-story.html). Landon won't wait. \"I am raring to go. I am signing up right away for my first time.\" Given the speed with which these vaccines were developed and tested, what long-term safety concerns, if any, do you have? Landon emphasized that there aren't long-term consequences of other vaccines we already know more about. And for any issues that vaccines can cause, \"They start upfront. They don't start 10 years later.\" So with the data we already have, we should have a good sense of what to expect. \"The short-term problems are all mild,\" she said. \"They may not feel awesome to you, because you have a pretty bad headache and you may feel really tired afterwards. But that is way better than having COVID.\" Headaches can be expected after the vaccine, she said, but with most people it goes away with Tylenol and within 24 hours, she said. What should people with allergies know about the Pfizer vaccine, now that British regulators are investigating 2 possible allergic reactions? First, don't panic, says Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and former board member at the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The recent news of [possible allergic reactions](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-nw-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-allergic-reactions-20201209-ww7r2rofxrfmzaxa6uhic4lssm-story.html#nt=pf-double%20chain~top-news-chain~flex%20feature~curated~britain-wed-545a~WW7R2ROFXRFMZAXA6UHIC4LSSM~1~1~2~5~art%20yes) is \"a bit of a surprise,\" he said, as this did not occur during Pfizer's clinical trials. But varying things can happen after a person is vaccinated \u2014 we are, after all, giving them to many different people. The system is working as it should, he said. Experts have detected this issue, and British officials are going to investigate further. \"And they've said in the meantime, all you folks who have had allergies to other things, stand aside for the moment, and we'll call you when we're comfortable with this,\" Schaffner said. If someone has already had COVID-19, could they still get the vaccine? Yes, Schaffner said. In fact, experts hope the vaccine will offer even more robust protection than whatever protection someone gets from the infection itself. \"If you've had COVID before, that's OK,\" he said. \"You're not going to have a more severe reaction to the vaccine or anything like that.\" How long will the vaccine give people protection from COVID-19? It's hard to say, Schaffner said, and he knows this might be an unsatisfactory response. He, too, is eager to find out. \"Just as soon as we start vaccinating a large number of people that will be assessed, and we'll just have to stay tuned for further information down the road,\" he said. He would not offer any estimate, saying this is a new vaccine and a distinctive virus, and more data is needed.

If so, should people limit or stop drinking during the pandemic? The Zoom happy hours have added up. With Thanksgiving in our rearview mirror and more holidays on the horizon, opportunities for drinking are all around us. The full impact of COVID-19 on alcohol use is not yet known, but [rates of alcohol usage](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770975) have been rising during the pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, [alcohol compromises the body's immune system](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/disease-prevention/alcohol-use/news/news/2020/04/alcohol-does-not-protect-against-covid-19-access-should-be-restricted-during-lockdown) and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes. The organization suggests people minimize their alcohol consumption \u2014 particularly during the pandemic. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has issued communications [warning people to avoid excessive drinking](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/directors-blog-alcohol-poses-different-challenges-during-covid-19-pandemic). According to NIAAA Director George Koob, people who choose to consume alcohol should follow the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. \"A person's pattern of alcohol consumption can have an impact on health,\" he said. \"The [current 2015-2020 guidelines](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhealth.gov%2Four-work%2Ffood-nutrition%2F2015-2020-dietary-guidelines%2Fguidelines%2Fappendix-9%2F&data=04%7C01%7Cdrockett%40chicagotribune.com%7C41e3f59f96cf4a19c26d08d887f26975%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C0%7C637408822515929387%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=C2Zc53D%2FKB0UaNyeGpvtnS2jlmulEub7U%2FiFfYJiMpY%3D&reserved=0) suggest limiting drinks to up to one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men. Having one drink per day is not the same as having seven drinks all at once in a single day. It's best to spread them out as recommended in the guidelines.\" Need to get tested for COVID-19? Here's how to find the most convenient and affordable options. To get the most convenient, affordable and reliable COVID-19 test possible: Start with your primary care doctor; many doctors offer in-office testing. If you don't have a doctor who does testing, then rapid testing, in-home testing or drive-thru testing are options. If an option is not affordable enough or closed to you due to restrictions, try crowdsourcing information to get up-to-date information about local testing sites, appointment availability, cost and wait times. Looking for a rapid test with same-day results? Those tests are best for people who actually have COVID-19 symptoms, said Heather Keirnan, a nurse and vice president of operations for Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care. If you don't have symptoms, the PCR test, which can detect very small amounts of the coronavirus, is a better choice, she said. Northwestern and other local hospitals and state drive-up testing sites offers PCR tests. Northwestern offers drive-up testing for those [ with Northwestern doctors' referrals](https://www.nm.org/conditions-and-care-areas/covid-19-resource-center/testing-locations) in Wheaton, Aurora, St. Charles, Bartlett, Glenview, Vernon Hills, Sycamore, McHenry and Huntley, and both drive-up and walk-up testing at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in downtown Chicago. For free tests, your options include state drive-up sites in [Arlington Heights, Harwood Heights and South Holland. ](http://www.dph.illinois.gov/testing)Tests are free for those without insurance; if you have insurance, bring your information, and the state will submit a claim. The [city of Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/testing.html) and [ Cook County](https://cookcountypublichealth.org/covid-19-testing/) also offer free testing. For those who care more about convenience than cost, private clinics offer shorter waits. Many require upfront payments of $175 to $300. If you want to submit a claim to your insurance company, check the rules for coverage. Your insurer may require that you are referred for testing by a doctor. Is it OK to travel if you're in good health? In a Nov. 19 [\"What The Health?\"](https://khn.org/news/podcast-khn-what-the-health-fauci-interview-november-19-2020/) podcast from Kaiser Health News, Dr. Anthony Fauci said traveling \"depends on your individual circumstances,\" and that, \"If you're a 25-year-old person who has absolutely no underlying conditions, that's much different than a 75-year-old person, a woman who's on chemotherapy for breast cancer.\" Is it OK to travel if you don't have any co-morbidities, and is it possible to do so safely? The short answer is no, according to Dr. Gregory Poland, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic. \"It's not a good idea,\" said Poland, who is also director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group. \"What (Dr. Fauci) meant when he said that was your individual risk. But that's only one side of the coin. \"The other side of the coin is the more times you bring more people together, the greater the risk for super spreader and transmissibility,\" he continued. \"So that healthy 22-year-old may have an upper respiratory mild symptom, or no symptoms at all, and yet can spread the virus to the people he walks by, or sits next to, or in that airplane with him. So it actually does add risk.\" Poland predicts that there's going to be a \"continued exponential increase\" in COVID-19 cases, followed by increases in hospitalizations and deaths, he said. \"So it makes absolutely no sense to be traveling right now \u2014 unless you have no possible alternative.\" What about driving, instead of taking a train or plane? To some degree, that does cut down on exposure, as it decreases the number of people you'll encounter and who will encounter you, Poland said. Yet, the current surge stems from small gatherings, he said. \"Here's what's driving a lot of this current surge: It is this seemingly deceptively safe family gatherings and small group gatherings,\" Poland said. \"So when your relatives drive a day or two to come and see you, now both of you are trading whomever you've been in contact with at school, work, church (or) whatever it might be, and so you're just giving more and more opportunity.\" Suppose everyone quarantines for two weeks before driving? \"The real question is: What could we do to be absolutely sure we're not going to get infected or infect other people?\" proposed Poland. He set up a hypothetical scenario in which driving and quarantining could work, but acknowledged it's a situation most people wouldn't adhere to. \"You would drive, you would quarantine \u2014 as you say \u2014 the two weeks before,\" he said. \"You might even get a test to be sure that even though you're asymptomatic, that you're not infected. You would then drive without staying in a hotel or going to restaurants. You'd have a procedure for how you'd get gas and go to the bathroom.\" Once you arrived, you'd ideally not stay in the same house as other family members, or at least sleep on different floors, he said. When sharing common areas, everyone would wear masks and maintain their distance. Meals would have be to eaten in separate rooms. \"So do you really want to do all that?\" Poland asked. \"Or do you want to say, like our family is saying, 'We're really thankful that everybody's in good health, and we want everybody to stay healthy'?\" I tested positive. I isolated. Now what? Once all symptoms are gone, people can return to work and be with others 10 days after testing positive, said Mercedes Carnethon, vice chair of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. A negative test isn't needed, unless someone's workplace or school requires it. If people test positive, they should isolate themselves immediately, said Robert Citronberg, Advocate Aurora Health's executive medical director of infectious disease and prevention. Isolate for 10 days from the onset of symptoms. If someone tested positive but never had symptoms, they should isolate 10 days from the date of the positive test. Here's the good news: those who test positive can still go outside. \"Truthfully, if you're cooped up inside your house for 10 days you may go a little stir crazy,\" Citronberg said. They should wear a mask and avoid being close to people, but it's OK to get some fresh air. What can college students do to best protect themselves and their families when they come home? No matter what students do, it won't be without risk, Citronberg said. If any family members at home are high risk, students should be especially cautious. He recommends two layers of testing \u2014 one test before leaving campus and another three days after returning home. Here's what he acknowledged will be the tough part: Until you have passed the 14-day incubation period, everyone should remain masked inside the home except while eating. Families should try to eat separately. He recommends remaining masked until 14 days after the student last had other social contact. \"This is awkward,\" he said. \"It's not something people are used to when kids come home.\" Most importantly, college students should be limiting their social gatherings now. \"Every day you do that will decrease your chances of having infection,\" he said. I isolated for 14 days before seeing family. Is that enough? Citronberg said if people isolate themselves for 14 days and do not experience symptoms, that should be fine, even without a test. Northwestern Medicine pulmonologist and critical care physician John Coleman said people often plan to isolate for two weeks in order to feel secure in visiting loved ones. \"But in my experience, this degree of caution doesn't happen,\" he said. \"The minute you leave the house, even just for a coffee or gas, that invalidates the quarantine.\" Should a vaccine be mandated? Chicago's health commissioner Allison Arwady recently said there likely [won't be enough doses of the vaccine](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-chicago-vaccines-arwady-20201116-xggbs3g5njcftpdlulab4ecswy-story.html) to go around when it first becomes available. But eventually, should a vaccine be mandated? It might be mandated for people at high risk, but likely not for the general population, said Tina Tan, pediatric infectious disease physician at the Feinberg School of Medicine. She noted there is not enough information about how these vaccines might impact children or pregnant women, for example, who have [not been included in trials](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-coronavirus-vaccine-analysis-sex-women-0719-20200719-cpas3dhilvemxfqrs4wzmcpjrm-story.html). \"The vaccines can be strongly recommended but (it) probably would not be a good idea to mandate their use,\" she said. Lori Post, director of Northwestern's Buehler Center for Health Policy and Economics, said vaccines can sicken people with some autoimmune disorders, and there is little information on adverse effects at this point. \"Better strategies than a blanket vaccine mandate would be to prohibit children from attending schools or universities, employees from presenting to the office or block people from group events who are unvaccinated,\" she said. Pfizer says its COVID-19 vaccine may be 90% effective. The vaccine uses genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. How does it work? [Pfizer Inc.'s Nov. 9 announcement](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against) comes on the heels of the pandemic having killed almost a quarter-million people in the United States, according to The Associated Press. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, said the results suggesting [90% effectiveness](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/mc-nws-cornavirus-pfizer-vaccine-more-than-90-percent-effective-20201109-kgngsnm4wrhlhduwga6pk5gygm-story.html) are \"extraordinary.\" Pfizer, which is developing the vaccine with its German partner BioNTech, is among four candidates already in huge studies in the U.S., with still more being tested in other countries. Another U.S. company, Moderna Inc., also hopes to file an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month. Neither company's shot is made with the coronavirus itself. Instead, the vaccine contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus. It's called a messenger RNA vaccine. (A refresher on basic biology: DNA is transcribed, or copied, into RNA, which then makes proteins that carry out the actual work of living cells. Molecules called messenger RNA are couriers that carry instructions from DNA to proteins.) Chemist and biochemist Chuan He, the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Chicago, says what Pfizer has done has taken advantage of the basic knowledge about messenger RNA generated in the last several decades. \"mRNA therapy in the vaccine field supplies proteins that mimic viral proteins to induce an immune response,\" he said. \"mRNA comes in, will express the encoded protein for a period of time to elicit an immune response, then the immune cells will keep this memory. The RNA is gone and your body goes back to its normal state, but your immune cells have been trained by the presence of this foreign protein produced from the delivered mRNA.\" Pfizer's news, however, doesn't mean a vaccine will be here soon. Pfizer's study is continuing, and the company cautioned that the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 cases are added to the calculations. Scientists have warned for months that any COVID-19 shot may be only as good as flu vaccines, which are about 50% effective and require yearly immunizations. Earlier this year, Fauci said he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that was 60% effective. Many questions still need to be answered, including how long the vaccine's effects last and whether it protects older people as well as younger ones. Confirmed COVID-19 infections in the U.S. eclipsed 10 million on Nov. 9, the highest in the world. Can you explain the new colors and the changes in Chicago's quarantine travel list? Chicago's travel quarantine list moved Nov. 10 from a list of states under travel quarantine orders to a color-coded list comparing the rate of infection here with other states. Under the original version of the emergency travel order, states were added to the list when they had an infection rate higher than 15 cases per 100,000 residents and were removed once the daily case average remained below that rate for two consecutive weeks. The city's new color-coded list will be updated every two weeks. Here's what you need to know: - Yellow states are those with a rolling seven-day average below 15 cases per day per 100,000 residents. Travelers returning from these states don't have to quarantine. - Orange states are those with a rolling seven-day average between 15 cases per day per 100,000 residents and Chicago's rolling seven-day average. People traveling from these states must either quarantine for 14 days or show they had a negative COVID-19 test no more than 72 hours before arrival in Chicago. - Red states are those with a rolling seven-day average above Chicago's. Anyone traveling from these states has to quarantine for 14 days. Visitors of red states will face fines of $100 to $500 per day if they don't quarantine, according to the city. Those who visit orange-listed states are subject to the same fines if they don't have a negative COVID-19 test or quarantine. There are exceptions based on [how long travelers spend in the listed states.](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/emergency-travel-order.html) People who commute across the Indiana or Wisconsin state line to or from Chicago to work or go to school will be exempt from the quarantine rule. But workers in Chicago from Indiana will be expected to avoid restaurants, bars and other public spaces in the city. Read on for the [rolling list of states on Chicago's orange and red lists.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-cb-coronavirus-chicago-self-quarantine-rules-to-know-20200729-rzt3x7jj5fbsxi2ewq4oxvgs5i-story.html) \u2014 Katherine Rosenberg-Douglas Should you get tested for COVID-19 before a gathering? The Illinois Department of Public Health encourages people to get tested before and after any gatherings and to curb activities outside their homes before getting together. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the lowest risk plans include celebrating only with those who already live in your home, or a virtual dinner with friends and family. Dr. Michael Lin, an infectious disease specialist at Rush University System for Health, said he doesn't recommend testing as a prelude to holiday gatherings. \"Testing, in general, only applies to the day of your test. It tells you something about your status,\" Lin said. Tests can have false negatives, but if they're combined with 14 days of quarantining, they might help families get together more safely, said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead for the Cook County Department of Public Health. Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, recommends people who choose to get tested do so as close to the event as possible \u2014 keeping in mind that some tests return results in 15 minutes and others take days. \"That's not a perfect solution, but if you test everybody, that does give you some measure of protection,\" Murphy said. \"Nothing is 100% protective. There's no right or wrong answer. It's how much risk you're willing to take.\" People who want to get tested for COVID-19 before the holidays are looking at two basic types of tests. One is an antigen test, which looks for specific proteins on the surface of the virus and often returns results within 15 minutes. However, it is not considered as accurate as the other type of test, a molecular test, such as a PCR test. Molecular tests detect the virus's genetic material. It can take a day to a week for results, depending on the testing facility. [Sites like the 11 run by the Illinois Department of Public Health](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/testing) offer tests to everyone, regardless of symptoms. People can also take at-home, PCR COVID-19 tests, such as those sold through Osco Drug and Costco's website. \u2014 Lisa Schencker and Hall Dardick Is a person likely to catch COVID-19 a second time? Is immunity real? If so, how long does it last? \"There have been proven cases of repeat infection (or 're-infection') with COVID-19, although it remains [rare](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fyour-health%2Freinfection.html&data=04%7C01%7Cchrjohnson%40chicagotribune.com%7C2173c214c73041f5928508d881e293d3%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C1%7C637402157452083314%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=6TL2jubI3ri%2Bkjes5FMVLD%2FqKOUXgfSbBQT5nSMNzMI%3D&reserved=0),\" wrote Dr. Mai Tuyet Pho, an infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, in an email. Like other viruses, immunity is real, explained Pho, but the question is how long it lasts. In the case of COVID-19, it's unclear. \"At this time the CDC estimates that on average immunity to COVID-19 lasts about 3 months, making re-infection before that time [unlikely](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Facip%2Fmeetings%2Fdownloads%2Fslides-2020-10%2FCOVID-Wallace.pdf&data=04%7C01%7Cchrjohnson%40chicagotribune.com%7C2173c214c73041f5928508d881e293d3%7Cf7da0482aed242fa80233b240fb6598d%7C0%7C1%7C637402157452083314%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=PGnw1mD8w7OYeFdwnoFZI8b%2Bp8mFUBXNOB1bWGZgPgk%3D&reserved=0),\" wrote Pho. \"Chances go up the more someone is exposed to the virus.\" Is there any way to safely have an indoor gathering with a small group of family, around six people? Should we quarantine for two weeks prior or get tested before the gathering? \"Unfortunately, there is no risk-free gathering,\" wrote Dr. Benjamin Singer, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, in an email. But, if you do choose to congregate with loved ones, he suggests keeping groups small and spending most of the time outside. Masks should be worn, said Singer, and social distancing rules should be followed. The risk isn't gone, but these precautions can \"reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.\" Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said Nov. 5 that even though we all desire to spend time with friends and family, it's best to sit it out. If not, she said previously, it could result in a [funeral down the line.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/ct-lns-hispanic-impact-covid-st-1028-20201027-j7wjzdb2ufgy3htb5mdsqyanaa-story.html) Ezike urges people to not travel unless it's a must, and if so, to drive if possible. What is the risk of eating or meeting outside, and not socially distancing from people sitting at the table, especially when we're all from different households and all have been following different levels of precautions? While spending time outdoors has been said to lessen the risk of spreading COVID-19 to some degree, Singer reiterates that there is no \"risk-free gathering.\" In May, when the state was beginning to reopen and loosen restrictions after the quarantine period, [the general rule of thumb ](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-safety-hangout-reopen-illinois-gatherings-tt-0528-20200528-womvcbqjlffdjarsdcaq43qa54-story.html)for meeting up with friends was that outside is better than inside, and masks are better than no masks, said Dr. Emily Landon, executive medical director of Infection Prevention and Control at the UChicago Medicine. What is the most recent breakdown of age groups that have died of COVID-19? There have been 10,030 reported deaths in Illinois from COVID-19 as of Nov. 5 since the start of the pandemic. A breakdown on those deaths by age, race and gender can be found [here](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-viz-coronavirus-cases-in-illinois-20200304-wz44mgw6wrd5zmzngx4kc3z6a4-htmlstory.html). Data on available hospital beds and ventilators can also be found on the same page. Is it safe to visit your doctors if you're at higher risk now? What about colonoscopies and other scoping procedures? \"Patients should not defer necessary medical care, as long as it is provided in a safe environment,\" wrote Pho. She suggests finding out what safety measures your doctor's office is taking, like remote check-in to limit waiting room time, screening before entering the facility, visitor restrictions, increased cleaning procedures, and 100% masking of staff and patients, among other things. \"The same rules apply for procedural areas,\" she said. \"Additionally, some providers require that patients undergo COVID-19 testing prior to procedures. For less urgent medical issues, some providers offer telehealth (or) video visits, which is the safest option.\" How serious is the potential for ocular transmission of COVID? Should I wear goggles when in proximity to others, like on an airplane or in a grocery store? \"The most common mode of transmission for the virus that causes COVID-19 is respiratory,\" wrote Pho. But transmission through the eyes is \"definitely possible,\" she said, even though it's more rare. \"There are receptors for the virus present in the structures of the eye, but this route (of transmission) is less common,\" explained Pho. \"In situations where masking and social distancing can't be guaranteed, such as in crowded places, or more enclosed areas like airplanes, I do recommend wearing eye protection. I also strongly recommend them for people who are knowingly in close proximity to someone who is infected, such as caregivers for household members with COVID-19.\" Could we make a big difference in hospitalization rates and death tolls by changing our diet and health habits? How does your personal health increase or decrease your chances of COVID-19 complications or death? Which health conditions are mostly linked to higher death tolls? While pursuing a healthy lifestyle with good eating habits and regular exercise can be beneficial, Pho says prevention methods are the best way to evade COVID-19 and the complications that can come with it. \"Avoiding exposure to the virus through masking, social distancing and hand sanitizing are essential,\" she wrote. \"There is a theory that even if masks aren't 100% effective at preventing all infections, they reduce the amount of virus ... that is inhaled, leading to an overall milder illness.\" Older age, pregnancy, medications that weaken the immune system and medical conditions including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, obesity, sickle cell disease and more can increase the risk for severe complications or death in someone who has contracted the virus, said Pho. How should I decide it's safe to return to the office? At the minimum, make sure (your company and office building are) [following the guidelines](https://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/COVID-19_WorkplaceHealth_SafetyGuidance20200505.pdf), said [Dr. Erica Hartmann](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hartmann-erica.html), assistant professor of environmental engineering at Northwestern University. \"I wouldn't frame it in terms of a 'safe' office environment, but rather one in which as much as is reasonably possible is being done to minimize risks.\" \"At this point, focus on what you can continue to do to mitigate risk for yourself and family,\" said [Dr. Amy Bohnert](https://www.luc.edu/psychology/people/faculty/facultystaff/amybohnert/), associate professor of clinical and developmental psychology at Loyola University Chicago. Consider the following: 1) Your vulnerability and those of members of your family to COVID-19. 2) The value of being at the office, which would include factoring in how well you can work from the office and expectations from supervisor about how much you need to be at the office. 3) Is your office following local and national health guidelines about maintaining a safe work environment? 4) How many people are at the office? What is the layout \u2014 do you have your own office with a door, or are you in large, open space in close proximity to others? \"Keep in mind that it is generally safest to work from home, but in the event you have to be at the office, take the recommended precautions to reduce risk,\" Bohnert said. \u2014 Kori Rumore If someone stands too close to me without a mask, should I say something? \"This is tricky, and inevitable,\" said [Dr. Amy Bohnert](https://www.luc.edu/psychology/people/faculty/facultystaff/amybohnert/), associate professor of clinical and developmental psychology at Loyola University Chicago. \"One thing you could do is wear a mask yourself, which at least communicates that you are taking measures to protect yourself and others. The mask also sends a message that you are engaging in protective measures, which also entails not being too close to anyone right now. \"You can also back away from someone as they move closer, which also conveys that you'd prefer more distance. If these steps are not enough, you could just say, 'I'm sure the event of anything happening is unlikely, but I would hate to make you sick, can you give me a little more space?' If you are still uncomfortable, you may just need to leave the situation.\" \u2014 Kori Rumore I don't feel comfortable going into a restaurant with friends. What should I do? \"Indicate to your friends that you are not quite ready for indoor dining, suggest a few outdoor dining alternatives, but in the end, stand your ground,\" said [Dr. Amy Bohnert](https://www.luc.edu/psychology/people/faculty/facultystaff/amybohnert/), associate professor of clinical and developmental psychology at Loyola University Chicago. \"Even with the liveliest group of friends, you won't enjoy dinner if you are worried about getting sick all night.\" \u2014 Kori Rumore What do I need to know before going to the gym? \"I would hope that any business currently in operation is genuinely adhering to their stated policies about cleaning and infection prevention,\" said [Dr. Erica Hartmann](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/hartmann-erica.html), assistant professor of environmental engineering at Northwestern University. \"Moreover, according to guidelines, it is your responsibility to clean equipment before and after using it. The gym should have cleaning supplies out. Remember to use them correctly and, in particular, don't just wipe and go. Wait for the appropriate amount of time (even if it's only 15 seconds) for the cleaning product to do its work. \"In general, outdoor spaces appear to be less risky than indoor ones,\" said [Dr. Benjamin Singer](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=19461), assistant professor of medicine (pulmonary and critical care) and biochemistry and molecular genetics at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, \"but distancing and mask-wearing are good practices regardless. \u2014 Kori Rumore How should we communicate information or the lack of information to people who are not scientists? \"When the health commissioners in the counties of the Bay Area came to the conclusion that it was important for everyone within their jurisdiction to now work from home, stay at home, be separate from one another, it was not because they had absolutely certainty about what was happening,\" said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, an editorial board member of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Enough evidence had accumulated, and they had reached a clear and very compelling conclusion that they communicated with coherence, with coordination and with great clarity. Those are very important features for conveying a public health message. \"It is an ongoing challenge for health officials to be both decisive and clear and sensitive to the uncertainties that underlie what their recommendations rests upon. We should not only be willing, but eager to learn in real time more information that shapes and informs the public health recommendations.\" How do we address the reflex to blame people and the health inequalities we're observing? \"The hope is this makes people realize that we're all human and we're all connected in very fundamental ways. We're all at risk,\" said Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist and associate professor of epidemiology and associate director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard's school of public health. \"We are a globally connected population. \"The problem with a crisis is that it exposes some of the bigotry that is present already in a population, and of course racism is still with us and will continue to be with us. It's really important there is leadership around communication here and people understand that this virus is agnostic to who it infects, but structural inequalities and chance play a big role in who may be infected first and who is going to be hit hardest.\" \"This epidemic really won't be over anywhere until it is over everywhere,\" said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, an editorial board member of the New England Journal of Medicine. \"That means not only attending to the differences in the United States and the varieties of expression and stages of the pandemic, but it means a genuinely global outlook of collaboration, cooperation and joint purpose with colleagues and counterparts in countries all around the world. If we don't really collaborate and work together to defeat the coronavirus in the world, no one country will ultimately be secure from the coronavirus. It's as simple as that.\" I think I have the coronavirus. What should I do? If you are experiencing minor symptoms, don't just show up at a clinic, doctors say. \"They should not see their doctor immediately,\" said Michael Ison, a professor of infectious diseases and organ transplantation at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. \"They should call their doctor first.\" The primary care doctor will go over the patient's symptoms by phone and decide what to do next. If the symptoms are minor, the doctor's advice will likely be to stay home to avoid spreading any type of virus and call back if the symptoms get worse, Ison said. \u2014 Madeline Buckley What are the steps you need to take after your diagnosis? \"You will want to rest, stay hydrated, and self-quarantine at home,\" said Dr. Emily Landon, executive medical director of infection prevention and control at UChicago Medicine. \"Avoid sharing household items like cups and dishes with people and pets, and when you do, wash them thoroughly. \"If you get sicker, you may need to go back to the emergency department or contact your doctor for another exam. This includes having symptoms of a hard time breathing, chest pain, the inability to eat or drink much, vomiting, watery stool or feeling weak,\" she said. Also if you are over 60 and have other chronic medical problems in addition to less-severe symptoms, she said, \"you should consider contacting your doctor to see if they recommend you come in to the emergency room.\" How can people who live in parts of the city that lack grocery stores get nutritious food? \"The city has a whole team, as part of the emergency operations, making sure people are fed,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot. \"And that includes working with organizations such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository and Meals on Wheels. People can also call 311 to learn more about the city's food support for residents.\" You can also use [chicagosfoodbank.org/find-food/](https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/find-food/) to find a food pantry within a 2-mile radius of your home. What services are available to seniors who don't speak English? \"The same services we provide for anyone, we can also provide to people who don't speak English,\" said Lisa Morrison Butler, the commissioner for the city's Department of Family and Support Services. \"The department is able to offer translation in 100 languages. Please don't let language be an issue for not getting this information.\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot added that the city is also working with community-based organizations in immigrant and refugee communities to provide services for seniors.
