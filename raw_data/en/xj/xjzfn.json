The new diagnostic methods like, Ultrasound. C.T., NMR etc., have revolutionised the medical practice to arrive at correct and accurate diagnosis. WHO have already envisaged One X -ray unit to be attached to every pr imary health centre thus creating the need for trained para medical personnel in X -ray technology. On the horizon of cancer treatment, radiotherapy plays a crucial role. All modern cancer treatment centres are equipped with radiotherapy units which have an essential requirement of trained para-medical personnel in radiotherapy. The vocational course of X -ray technician aims at meeting the demand for trained para medical petsonnel in the field of radiology/radiotherapy. The trained personnel will help in pro viding better radiological services leading to optimum utilization of the available resources. Employment Potential Wage Employments Radiographer Dark Room.

SUGGESTIONS X-ray technician course in very lucrative, offering, right career prospect. An Assessment should be made regarding demand in both wage and self employment in the country and aboard before starting the course. The candidates should be made aware of the career prospect in wage employment, and the fact that setting up of even a small X -ray clinic involves at least a lac of rupee in equipment itself. However, if X -ray technician wishes to put up his own X -ray plant he will have to seek help of radiologist for interpretation of X -rays. The course is practically oriented one and hence the attachment for tr aining has to be in well equipped radiology deptt. of hospital. Normally not more than 6 students be attached to one hospital. Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology -Should be taught be Medical doctor while general physics can be taught by Physics teache r however Radiation Physics has to be taught by Radiological Physicist. Dark room techniques, General Radiography special Investigations and Radiotherapy should be taught by qualified X -Ray technician and Radiological.

Worldwide, nations are seeking viable answers to the question of how to offer a health care system, which leads to improvements in the health status of their citizens. In our view, health care in India is the responsibility of the community as a whole. A collaborative approach, which involves financial support, strategic planning and health prioritizing legislation, involves the government, community leaders, and private and public health care professionals. Here in India we must encourage individual, family and group participation in taking care of their physical, mental and emotional health and provid e venues for doing so. We need to support an increase in health seeking behaviours motivated by education, through the school system, civic groups and public information. Faults of the country's medical system have become apparent within the last decade a s economics forced hospitals to begin amalgamating services and reducing staff, thereby increasing clients' access to timely services. From years of evidence, public and private health care understands the need to view health care from a business perspective; however, without losing sight of the need to provide high quality, accessible services. Indeed, we must strive to improve the health care system by creating an environment that encourages and rewards quality of care by the professionals who are provi ding the services. We are seeing to do more than maintain the status quo of our community's health, and instead to improve on the health status of all concerned. Through tightly coordinated partnerships with medical, social, educational, business, civic a nd religious organisations of this country, we can develop a comprehensive and coordinated health care system. This curriculum on Health Care Sciencehas been developed for a two year new course at 10+2 stage. It has been so designed that the trainees on completion of the course will be competent to work as General Duty Assistants (GDAs) and go up in ladder as supervisor in Hospitals and Nursing Homes, to start their own self - employment ventures. The Course intends to impart both theoretical knowledge and practical training, suited for both self and wage employment. Scope and Prospects of Health Care Science Course This forms a good basic course for healthcare sector, after which the pass out can either join the healthcare service system as a GDA or go f or higher education (Vertical Mobility) in the health care sector related courses (advanced courses in the health sector) . Pass out of this course can be good multi -skilled worker for the healthcare industry, who can handle a number of jobs depending upon where he/she is posted. 2.Employment Opportunities General Duty Assistant (GDA) in a hospital .
