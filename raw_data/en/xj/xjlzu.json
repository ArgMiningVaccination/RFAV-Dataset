Amrit Kalash Nectar Paste It takes 250 meticulous steps to prepare this powerful paste in Noida, India. Twenty-two pounds of precious, raw ingredients are required to produce just a single jar. Thirty-eight rare herbs are slow-cooked at low temperatures to protect their vital nutrients. We use special organic sugar to preserve the nectar and cook the herbs in organic ghee from grass-fed cows. Both ghee and sugar also serve as carriers in Ayurveda, which means they bind with the herbal ingredients and \"carry\" the nutrition through the lipid (fat) membrane that surrounds the mitochondria; antioxidants are carried to the heart of the cell, where they protect the DNA. All this specific attention to tradition and detail ensures a genuine ayurvedic product of unique quality. Amrit Kalash Ambrosia Tablet This complex formula requires quality checks at every stage of processing, from selection of raw material through packaging. The herbs are harvested at precise times to ensure maximum potency. Each ingredient is carefully prepared for processing, and the fruits are cooked at specific temperatures to eliminate degeneration of the essential intelligence of the herbs. All parts of the formulation are prepared independently in a meticulous manner as designed by the Vaidyas, and the different parts are blended in at specific stages, maintaining the appropriate temperatures and mixing times necessary to preserve the integrity of the formulation. According to Vedic lore, humanity was steeped in suffering in ancient times. One day, the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) resolved to find a solution; they churned the mighty ocean, and Amrit Kalash\u2014the Nectar of Immortality\u2014appeared to restore health and happiness to humanity. Many millennia later, in the 1980s, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi gathered preeminent Ayurvedic scholars and physicians in Noida, India, to create a powerful rasayana (rejuvenative) formula for mind, body, and spirit. The result was Amrit Kalash\u2014a full-spectrum antioxidant, rejuvenative formula that represents the ultimate knowledge of the ancient Vedic texts.
