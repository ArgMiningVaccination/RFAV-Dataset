[Paige Stables](/author/15543/paige-stables/)and [Dori Price](/author/223992/dori-price/) We updated this article in August 2022 to ensure all picks vetted by the [Good Housekeeping Institute](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/about-the-institute/a19748212/good-housekeeping-institute-product-reviews/) were in stock, available and correctly priced. Traditional [nail polish](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/nails/g27437679/best-nail-polishes/) has acquired a bad rap, largely due to chemical ingredients and a harsh odor. Besides irritating your senses with a pungent scent, \"nail polishes contain solvents and some ingredients that can potentially cause health issues and irritation if inhaled in large quantities,\" says [Sabina Wizemann](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/1473/sabina-wizemann/), a senior chemist in the Health, Beauty & Environmental Sciences Lab at the [ Good Housekeeping Institute](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/institute/about-the-institute/a19748212/good-housekeeping-institute-product-reviews/). The strong aroma may not be the only thing that's harsh about some nail polishes: Chemicals in common nail lacquer formulas could potentially enter the body through your nail beds. A [2015 study by researchers at Duke University](https://www.ewg.org/research/nailed/nail-polish-chemical-doubles-furniture-fire-retardant) detected evidence of a common nail polish chemical called triphenyl phosphate, or TPHP, in the bodies of every woman who volunteered to paint her nails for the study. The good news: Many advancements have been made in nail polish formulations since this study. There are options without that particular harmful chemical and other potentially dangerous ingredients, which brings us to so-called \"nontoxic\" or \"natural\" nail lacquers. \"Natural,\" much like \" [clean beauty](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/a26522538/clean-beauty/),\" is a marketing term that is unregulated by the FDA for consumer products, so the term itself doesn't have a solid definition when it comes to beauty products. That said, most non-toxic nail polishes are 3-free, meaning they do not contain formaldehyde, toluene or dibutyl phthalate, three known disrupters. You can find more information on what these terms mean below, but in the interim, these are the best natural nail polishes reviewed by our Beauty Lab. Wizemann ensured the below picks, selected by our editors, are formulated without potentially harmful ingredients. Here, the best natural nail lacquers available right now: How we choose the best natural nail polishes We selected these products based on expert advice, extensive research and top reviews. The [Good Housekeeping Institute's Beauty Lab](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty-products/videos/a36899/inside-the-good-housekeeping-beauty-lab/) is constantly testing the newest nail and makeup products, including [ hand creams](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty-products/best-lotions/a25136153/best-hand-cream/), [nail polishes](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/nails/g27437679/best-nail-polishes/) and more, and our beauty pros shared their favorite picks for natural nail polishes based on years of industry experience and product testing. After we gathered the top picks, GH Institute Beauty Lab's Senior Chemist, Sabina Wizemann, combed through the selections to ensure they are each formulated without potentially harmful ingredients, so the included nail polish brands have been vetted not only for performance, but safety as well. What does \"non-toxic\" nail polish mean? \"Products are crossing off 'toxic' ingredients from formulas at rapid speed, and some brands offer vegan and gluten-free options,\" says Wizemann. Many \"non-toxic\" polishes are and Dibutyl phthalate. Here's why: - Formaldehyde, an intense smelling and colorless gas, typically used as a nail hardener in nail polishes, has been linked to some types of cancer, including leukemia, in humans when exposed in high amounts, according to [the American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/formaldehyde.html). Though formaldehyde does occur naturally in the environment and is present in small amounts in most living organisms, it is recognized as a carcinogen by [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet)as well as by the [Department of Health and Human Services](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/roc/index.html) [.](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/roc/index.html) - Toluene is a colorless, sweet-smelling industrial solvent that temporarily affects the nervous system and can cause strong eye and nose irritation as well as dizziness and fatigue when inhaled, [according to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/toluene.pdf). It is not characterized as a carcinogen, but is a teratogen, an agent that can disturb the development of the embryo or fetus after prolonged exposure. - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is commonly used as a plasticizer to promote material flexibility and reduce brittleness, and it can cause irritations, headaches and dizziness when inhaled. Beyond that, polishes go as far as being 10-, 14- or even 16-free. Here's the breakdown of what's missing (thankfully!) from those formulas: - 5-free contains no formaldehyde, toluene, DBP, formaldehyde resin, camphor - ethyl toluene, and polymers, plus they are also odorless,\" says Wizemann. Though easy to apply, they are often not as long-lasting. Why trust Good Housekeeping?
