Wanna borrow games? how about the 5 that I lent you? We gonna run it back minus Malik on the team He be turning the ball over and his defense is weak Feeling chic high top sneaks with extra large jeans After ball we pushing weights I did my set to Mobb Deep Paul's a hater had Decepticon and Autobot beef His game was garbage probably studied tapes from Olden Polynice Stretch marks between my shoulders and chest I'm getting bigger mad at myself When I would miss Rap City with Big Tigga Most the girls would claim they were virgins like Richard Branson Rocked the strength shoes and Worked on my footwork like Barry Sanders Rushing to grow up would fantasize on hitting clubs up Most of the decent girls in school were acting stuck up You know what? all this rejection built up my character Flew overseas it hit me damn I grew up in America Napoleon Da Legend [hook x2] \"You ain't got a job Tommy!\" Now he's resting in Peace She gave me a hug and a kiss what an affectionate tease She was 3 years my senior yet she recognized my genius Big homie scooped me up his whip had extra large speakers We would analyze flics like Juice and Menace to Society Bragging about the chicks he pulled that sucka used to lie That's his prerogative like Bobby remember Bell Biv? Selfish for life T was allergic to shell fish Copped a Bath Ruth and a 64 ounce slurpee Favorite color was blue I used to hate Bobby Hurley Nothing personal I was a Terp cops came we was alert Jessica was teasing me to death she was a flirt Scotty used to cheat he used to sneak to smoke weed They sent his ass back to Gabon that's a country overseas I had the crazy handles used to watch Childress Randolph And write breakthrough lines like Ernest Byner on the hand off The Wizards were the Bullets Manute Bol would shoot 3s My mentor was Ron Williams I was told to do me Doc's Gym Iverson used to come with Norris Moochie When you dropping 27 a game you getting groupies I loved it Naive showing affection out in public Thought she loved me, that reality check was the roughest Dreams of playing at the Rucker Conversations were like \"How we rank among the best in the nation?\" Slam Magazine Hip-Hop quotables in the Source Rocking Illmatic in a Walkman portable of course Used to watch Beavis and Butthead what a horrible show How I grew to be a man only the oracle knows it goes...

I was lost and confused A young adult still with something to prove Had to shake it up and move That's the best thing I ever did Caught ya attention like a chick with a big set of tits Getting paid for conversation that's my type of life I had to try quench my insatiable appetite Once In a blue moon Cheese puffs and blue moons In my boom boom room we hit it off boom boom Whats ya definition of a coon? Let's set the rules so we can kick em all out and make room Black Excellence Keni Burke [Chorus] Napoleon Da Legend [verse 2] Black excellence what does that mean? Being black excellent with an immaculate team? Being black and relevant thats an industry term Having melanin? and hitting the epitome curve? Is it uplifting or marketing? Am I drifting? Is it pitch to make money and another gimmick ? To fool blacks and other into buying a product? Is it for profit? and is there something wrong profit? Is a benchmark? For all to strive to reach for? Is it detour? An insecurity hiding a deep flaw? Is it really the best? Who selects em? People in power? Making money off of our affection? Black excellence I like that term Cause why not? Try to be best in all your work You push me i push you pull me I pull you Cause I don't see any other way we gonna pull thru This terrain complex full of pain and bomb threat Frame of mind of a young bull mix with a calm vet If it's about progress then I'm on deck You can miss me with all the rest you on the wrong thread And If you ain't about the people u a non-threat Cause without the action black excellence is just a concept We got the rock now lets run the play Black excellence minus the black on black gun-play And that's on any given Sunday we done prayed We gonna raise the bar Born from the particles that make stars Nina Simone [speech] \"My job is to somehow persuade them To get more aware of themselves and where they came From and what they are into and what's already there And to bring it out.

Spread the gospel like the saints in the Bible\" He gave me dap and said \"respect\" then he dashed upstairs And literally two minutes later he was live on air I understand you a successful man so I kept it moving Ideas is worth nothing with no proper execution Next day seen sway the same way gave him a hoodie First reaction I'm a wear this today it's all goodie Posted the video sales went up Around the time taxstone went to jail that was bugged But where's the black privilege when you be dissing on ya guest On ya hoodie underlined with a sentence on ya chest And see you good at what you do and that's obvious fact People share more interviews that get the audience mad Fickle when u lose em hard to get ya audience back Bringing Farrakhan don't be that Pharaoh conning ya pack Ya Black Privilege is burned when corporations help you earn I see ya work in Carolina to give back in return Talking about gangsta rapper and their image in rap But you talking and shining light on mostly rappers that trap Or claim it I know ya struggles with Wendy and other stations The success and the scrutiny coming from publications I salute you love you as a brother even as stranger It always good to see black man who made it Wanna see you reaching higher don't resent those who ya voice represents we still holding ya feet to the fire Black Privilege [Napoleon Da Legend Chorus] Came from the bottom straight to the top my name Po what you know about me? From the bottom straight to the top name Po what you know about me? From the bottom straight to the top name Po what you know about me? What you know about me? [Napoleon Da Legend verse] Black Privilege black black privilege That's the premise if you black then u primitive That's the main stream I don't play the same stream This ain't fast food I don't sell fake dreams I spit it different with the words yea I give my own definition to the words yea I put my vision in these words and disturb Then I Destroy the system with my word yea They call me Po never riding coat tails No crimes no coke sales no gunshots no jail No co-signs from a Nobel prize winner If u building then I side with cha yea Climb with cha break bread drink wine with cha It's not about the bank account kid my mind richer If you a snake spend no time with cha Never blind with cha never stand in line with cha Stand tall I can tell you got some pride witcha White privileges is what's given from society Cops Letting go after you failed ya sobriety Good jobs good schools u get the first dibs Ya whole profile on paper looking perfect Black Privileges what u did to make yourself better Gave yourself an edge in life being a go getter Never quitting when the odds go against you Working on ya talent to be sharper than a ginsu Slice the competition cause u better now u get fetta now It's on another level now Create my own Privilege I'm different Everything I say sound different Everything I wear look different I'm different spit to beat that I kill for a living Black Privilege black black privilege Black privilege that's my Privilege [Napoleon Da Legend Chorus] Came from the bottom straight to the top my name Po What you know about me? From the bottom straight to the top name Po What you know about me? Napoleon Da Legend Brooklyn, New York Napoleon Da Legend Bilingual MC & Afrobeat artist from Comoros, living in Brooklyn, New York.
