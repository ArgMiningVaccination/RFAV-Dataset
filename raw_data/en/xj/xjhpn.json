Researchers from Boston University's [National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories](https://www.bu.edu/neidl/) (NEIDL) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard say it's the first real look at exactly what types of \"red flags\" the human body uses to enlist the help of T cells\u2014killers sent out by the immune system to destroy infected cells. Until now, COVID vaccines have been focused on activating a different type of immune cell, B cells, which are responsible for creating antibodies. Developing vaccines to activate the other arm of the immune system\u2014the T cells\u2014could dramatically increase immunity against coronavirus, and importantly, its variants. In their findings, [published in Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00701-7#%20), the researchers say current vaccines might lack some important bits of viral material capable of triggering a holistic immune response in the human body. Based on the new information, \"companies should reevaluate their vaccine designs,\" says [Mohsan Saeed](https://www.bu.edu/neidl/profile/mohsan-saeed/), a NEIDL virologist and the co-corresponding author of the paper. Saeed, a BU School of Medicine assistant professor of biochemistry, performed experiments on human cells infected with coronavirus. He isolated and identified those missing pieces of SARS-CoV-2 proteins inside one of the NEIDL's Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) labs. \"This was a big undertaking because many research techniques are difficult to adapt for high containment levels [such as BSL-3],\" Saeed says. \"The overall coronavirus research pipeline we've created at the NEIDL, and the support of our entire NEIDL team, has helped us "}
