Here's what research shows As part of a series of studies for The Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC), a network of national research institutions studying the range of responses to different infections and vaccinations, Emory researchers analyzed the molecular characteristics of 820 healthy young adults who were immunized with 13 different vaccines to identify specific biomarkers that generate antibody response to vaccines. [] New findings from a meta-analysis published in Nature Immunology has examined the biological mechanisms responsible for why some people's immune systems respond differently to vaccinations, which could have global implications for the development and administration of vaccines.
