First, we observed the meticulous packing and moving preparation at The Textile Museum building on S Street NW, where the museum closed to the public in October. It will reopen later this year as part of The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum at its new home on the Foggy Bottom Campus. We also visited GW's Virginia Science and Technology Campus, where a newly built conservation and study center will house expanded museum storage and workspace. Last, we received a hard-hat tour of the in-construction museum home on campus at 21st and G streets. In this and previous editions, we have documented the move of The Textile Museum as well as another part of the museum, the Albert H. Small Washingtoniana Collection. I hope you are impressed with the caliber of the individuals as well as the assets of both of these groups. Similarly, I hope you are equally impressed with the topic of this edition's cover story. Astrobiologist Pascale Ehrenfreund is part of a European Space Agency mission to land a satellite onto a comet to study the origin of life. Dr. Ehrenfreund is just one of so many leaders with profound skill and applied knowledge in a particular area of expertise here at George Washington. In this issue, we also employed three of our top Middle East experts to provide an at-a-glance look at the state of the region, three years into the Arab Spring. And my note would not be complete without mention of professor Thomas Buergenthal, a former judge at the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, who shares his wrenching story of surviving the Auschwitz concentration camp at 10 years of age. Stay tuned in future editions for more coverage of other amazing GW community members as well as the much-anticipated opening of the museum. Heather O. Milke editorWilliam atkinseditor Heather O.

I'm sure there have been and will be many letters reflecting considerable surprise and satisfaction. William A. morgan, BA '77 Washington, d .C. I've been intending since I got the summer 2013 GW Magazine to tell you how much I like the changes you've made. This is probably the first time I really paid attention to the magazine and actually looked through it cover to cover. Good work, guys. Jim Cook, mA '81 reston, Va. Tracking a Correction I enjoy reading the new, improved GW Magazine . However, the fall 2013 issue describing the return of the university's track team (\"GW Athletics Welcomes Back Diving and Track\") merits a correction. There was a GW track team in 1955 that competed with Roanoke College, the University of Richmond, and the College of William and Mary. Edward Jaffee, BA '55, and I served as Hatchet sports editors as well as \"tracksters.\" With the aid of the athletics department, we created a track team that year. Please refer to the 1955 Cherry Tree (p. 205) for further details. By the way, I ran the mile and the two-mile events that spring. rabbi A. James rudin, BA '55 New York operation e ducation I noted in the recent issue an article discussing Operation Education and veterans. I am a 1975 master's graduate of GW who started at the then small, off-site campus of GW in the Hampton Roads area (circa 1971-72), followed by a dedicated year at the main campus. Being military, I was finally able to take the time away from military duty to complete my master's. I feel that GW was very veteran friendly at that time. The interaction among a variety of military studying for their degrees together with what I shall call younger students was very rewarding. It was a great experience that enabled me to move onward career-wise, both in and out of the military. Being fully retired for 10 years now causes me to reflect based on my experience and your recent article. I applaud your veteran efforts, although one could read into it that this is something really new for GW. From my experience it dates back to the '70s and probably much earlier. francis C. m arr, ms '75 dumfries, Va. GW Valor initiative! I am very happy to see GW embrace the military. Thirty-five years ago, in my time, it was quite different. Fifteen of us active-duty Navy and Air Force men were enrolled in the School of Medicine & Health Sciences. We were fresh from service in the Vietnam War and were chosen by the military to further our education. Military uniforms, ROTC, and all references to the military were banned on campus. We stood out, however, as we all had regulation military haircuts in the hirsute era of the '70s. I can still hear the echoing cries of \"warmonger\" and \"baby killer\" shouted at us as we traversed the campus. Tolerance and diversity did not extend to us. The concept of hate the war but love the warrior was not, it seems, going to be in vogue for some 35 years. I am happy that at GW that time has finally come. Jeffrey Purtle, Bs '81 Pratt, Kansas After receiving my latest GW Magazine (Fall 2013) on the theme of veterans, I knew it was time to write to you. As a lowly E-2 in the U.S. Army, stationed in the Pentagon in 1967 during the Vietnam era, I needed a break. I was drafted after having my share of college failures in New York. A career I thought I was headed toward fell through. I got drafted, wound up in D.C., and knew it was time to figure the future out. I registered for several off-campus courses before I was to be deployed (that got canceled due to, the Tet Offensive), got all As, but was rejected for matriculated status by the admissions office. But there was a wonderful gentleman named John Lobuts who met with me. He took an interest in soldiers; even more than that, he really cared. The results were that all my off-campus courses were credited to me, and many of my credits from several other schools were advanced to me as well. I was matriculated and graduated one month after I was honorably discharged in July 1969. I have since gone on to receive an MSW from the University of Maryland, retire from the Medical School Faculty of the University of Maryland in 2004 (after serving 26 years), and continue to be on the faculty of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, and maintain an active psychotherapy practice. In my mind I owe this all to GW, my alma mater, and to that \"can do\" guy, John Lobuts. stuart A. Tiegel, Bs '69 Havre deg race, m d. The ACA e xplained I enjoyed the article about the Affordable Care Act in the latest issue of GW Magazine, but I was hoping to see some information about important but less well-publicized parts of the ACA. As part of the ACA, the Elder Justice Act was enacted to protect America's elderly community from abuse, neglect, and fraud\u2014all of which are a growing trend in the United States. The National Background Check Program is one initiative; it provides grant funds to states to upgrade or create a background check process for people working in long-term-care facilities. I have been working on the National Background Check Program since 2010, and I would like to propose a story on this program and other aspects of the Elder Justice Act. The ACA is more than just insurance reform, and the public should know this. Kristin s chrader, mA '10 Washington, d .C.

We regret the error. \u2014Eds. president e lliott I attended the School of Government and Business Administration from 1966 to 1970 and the National Law Center from 1971 to 1974. The letters about President Elliott since his passing remind me of my own experiences with that outstanding educator. My first encounter with Dr. Elliott was in 1968, when I was elected student council representative for the SGBA. It was during the height of on-campus protests and demonstrations over the Vietnam War. On at least one occasion, Dr. Elliott was held \"hostage\" when the university's administrative offices were \"overtaken\" by protesters. My recollection is that Dr. Elliott did what he did best: He sat down with the students and listened attentively to their grievances. The protests generally emanated from segments of the university other than the SGBA. Nonetheless, the business school community was hardly removed from what was going on. Students in the business school were anxious to have a voice in a rational discussion of how change would be implemented. To that end, I met with Dr. Elliott and with then Dean Phillip Grubb\u2014another truly wonderful educator and administrator\u2014to convince them to allow the student council representative to sit in and speak on agenda items raised at SGBA faculty meetings, a truly radical idea for that time. Not only did Dr. Elliott and Dean Grubb agree with the proposal, but they also became active proponents, so much so that they lobbied faculty members to embrace the concept, and they did. While I served in that capacity, the faculty never tried to censor me; they never ejected me from meetings save for discussions of hiring and firings, compensation, and the like; and they allotted time to me every meeting to speak on whatever I wished. Indeed, they seemed to share Dr. Elliott's view that students' voices and ideas should not be stifled but rather heard and considered. It was an amazing time to be in school, in the nation's capital no less, and the experience was only enriched by the \"top down\" policy of openness that emanated from Dr. Elliott. scott L. b aena, bba '70, Jd '74 Miami xp @GWautism STAND with AND!

Merrigan, former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has been named the first executive director of GW's Sustainability Institute, the university announced in February. As leader of GW's sustainability initiatives, Dr. Merrigan will be responsible for launching and nurturing a Sustainability Institute that advances GW's prominence in multidisciplinary education, research, and outreach. She will also join the university's academic faculty. \"Kathleen Merrigan has exactly the combination of deep experience, professional stature, and energetic commitment we need to launch this important effort,\" President Steven Knapp says. \"Under her leadership, the Jessica m c c onnell BurtLEADERSHIP Sustainability Institute will enable us to develop a full academic complement to the sustainability work we are actively pursuing across the university's operations.\" Named one of Time magazine's \"Most Influential People in the World\" in 2010, Dr. Merrigan brings to the university a diverse range of experience spanning nearly 30 years. In 2009 she was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as USDA deputy secretary and was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. During her four-year tenure she oversaw the agency's daily operations. Her accomplishments include creating and leading the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative to support local food systems; serving as a key architect of first lady Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move!\" campaign; and representing the United States before the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. Before joining the USDA, Dr. Merrigan served for nearly a decade as a faculty member and director of the Agriculture, Food and Environment Program at Tufts University. \"I'm thrilled to build upon the university's innovative sustainability efforts. GW is ideally located, situated among federal and international agencies and in a city with its own ambitious sustainability plan,\" Dr. Merrigan says. \"Given the limitless opportunity in our capital city coupled with the extraordinary expertise across GW faculty and staff, the university is well positioned to advance the field of sustainability in profound ways through research, teaching, and practice.\" At GW, Dr. Merrigan will oversee universitywide sustainability efforts with the goal of building programs focused on sustainable systems. She will work closely with GW's Office of Sustainability to integrate academics with GW's successful sustainability outreach and practice initiatives, including its Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy, Climate Action Plan, and GWater Plan. Sustainability is one of GW's core strategic initiatives and an area of wide-ranging research and academic expertise.

The remainder of the Corcoran collection would be transferred to the National Gallery of Art. After the announcement the three institutions entered a discussion period to explore the definitive terms of collaboration. \"This coalition among our three institutions will open important new possibilities for Washington, D.C.,\" says Peggy Loar, interim director and president of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and Corcoran College of Art + Design. \"The Corcoran's great cultural, educational, and civic resources that are at the heart of this city will not only remain in Washington but will become stronger, more exciting, and more widely accessible in a way that stays centered on the Corcoran's dedication to art and mission of encouraging American genius.\" The university and the Corcoran have a rich history. William Wilson Corcoran served as the president of GW's Board of Trustees from 1869 until 1872 and donated generously to the university. In 1884 he founded the Corcoran Scientific School, which is now the GW School of Engineering and Applied Science. He also donated a building on H Street that served as the location for the medical school and later as the university hospital from 1898 to 1948. In 1924, Foggy Bottom's Corcoran Hall was dedicated to honor Mr. Corcoran's memory. He founded the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1869 and donated additional funding to establish the Corcoran school in 1878. The gallery's collection includes more than 17,000 works and objects and is considered one of the world's best American art collections. The institution moved to its present 17th Street location in 1897. The new collaboration will complement the university's existing range of arts programs, which include theater and dance, music, fine arts, interior and architectural design, and museum studies. \"This is an exciting opportunity for us to dramatically enhance our arts and arts-related footprint in the academic community and in Washington, D.C.,\" says Ben Vinson III, dean of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. \"The Corcoran and the National Gallery of Art are titans in the art world\u2014our new collaboration with these two cherished entities will instantly elevate our endeavors in the field.\" gwmagazine.com / 9It's where GW Law students experience firsthand the art of lawyering and community service, as they represent people in need of legal services. And earlier this year the legal clinics not only got a new home, but a U.S. Supreme Court justice cut the ribbon. In one of two visits to GW in January, Justice Sonia Sotomayor helped inaugurate the newly renovated building that houses the Jacob Burns Community Legal Clinics. The clinics' facilities, at 650 20th Street, now feature 4,000 square feet of common space, a moot courtroom, four private rooms for client interviews, and five classrooms with state-of-the-art technical equipment. They also boast a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold rating from the nonprofit U.S. Green Building Council. In her remarks, Justice Sotomayor underscored the importance of public service in the legal field and said she is passionate about law because the profession places a premium on pro bono work. \"To me the students in this room, the faculty members, and the administration who have supported the building of this center put on display the importance of law in service. It's a great, great testament to the heart of GW,\" Justice Sotomayor said. \"Now you have a home befitting of your efforts.\" At the ceremony, Phyllis Goldfarb, the Libraries exploring churchill's past, Future More than 350 scholars and enthusiasts of British statesman Sir Winston S. Churchill flocked to Washington this fall for the 30th International Churchill Conference, hosted by GW. The conference commemorated a partnership between the university and the Chicago-based Churchill Centre to create the National Churchill Library and Center, a seat of scholarship and archival materials to be housed at the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library. A formal dedication of a bust of Mr. Churchill took place at the U.S. Capitol prior to the start of the conference, kicking off three days of events. The conference featured a salon, a gala, a dinner, and presentations examining Mr. Churchill's contributions to literature, his relationship with numerous U.S. presidents, and his leadership as Britain's wartime prime minister from 1940 to 1945. The Churchill family, represented by Randolph Churchill\u2014Winston Churchill's great-grandson\u2014also announced a major philanthropic commitment to the project, which was promptly matched by Churchill Centre Chairman Laurence Geller and then, again, by another a member of the Churchill Centre's Board of Trustees. \"Our family is so excited about the plans being developed to give us a proper home,\" Mr. Churchill said. The Churchill Centre, in cooperation with GW, seeks to raise $8 million for the project. The four components of the project include renovating the street-level floor of Gelman Library to include a Churchill reading room and exhibit gallery, which will host special events and public lectures. Also included in the project are an endowed professorship in the Department of History to facilitate scholarship and original research, an endowed curatorship position to oversee the collections and their preservation, and a fund to build a collection of Churchill-related research materials and provide programming for future scholars and the public. Jessica Mc connell BurtJacob Burns Foundation Professor of Clinical Law and associate dean for clinical affairs, noted the university's unique connection to clinical education: alumnus William Pincus, who earned a JD in the 1950s, is widely considered the father of clinical education. Inspired by the clinical programs that Mr. Pincus helped create, professor Eric Sirulnik led the effort to open a law clinic at GW more than four decades ago. The clinics received significant support from alumnus Jacob Burns, LLB '24, whose generosity helped GW's clinical program thrive. Today the clinics allow students to practice in international human rights, immigration law, domestic violence advocacy, and community economic development law, among other areas. The dedication coincided with the 64th annual Van Vleck Constitutional Law Moot Court Competition, which Justice Sotomayor judged. Just a few weeks earlier, she was on stage before a capacity crowd of 1,500 at Lisner Auditorium for a discussion hosted by Smithsonian Associates about her life and road to the court. Afterward, she signed copies of her 2013 autobiography, My Beloved World . When the topic turned to diversity on the bench, she focused on the diversity of ideas rather than religion, ethnicity, or gender. \"We are being asked to become experts in someone else's problems,\" Justice Sotomayor said. \"The way you can do that with greater facility is if you've had enough of your own life experiences to be able to comprehend the width and depth of issues that judges face.\" That kind of diversity, she said, is the foundation of what she calls her \"beloved world.\" \"You educate yourself to make yourself a more interesting person,\" she said. \"You can't be interesting unless you learn.\" inaugurates renovated c linics lawassociate dean phyllis Goldfarb, Justice sonia sotomayor, p resident steven knapp, and Law school i nterim dean Gregory e.

CURRICULUM i am Malala' comes to classrooms Sixteen-year-old Malala Yousafzai has become a symbol of peace and hope to millions around the world. The youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize nominee has campaigned since the age of 11 for the education rights of girls and was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012 for making her voice heard. Now GW's Global Women's Institute is bringing her story into the classroom, hoping it will deepen students' understanding of women's rights issues and inspire activism. As the educational partner of the Malala Fund\u2014a nonprofit that works to ensure girls' access to education\u2014GWI-affiliated faculty members will work with publisher Little, Brown and Co. to develop a university-level curriculum to accompany Ms. Yousafzai's 2013 memoir, I Am Malala .The curriculum will focus on themes such as the importance of a woman's voice, how education empowers women, global feminism, and political extremism, and it will encourage students to take action through service learning and advocacy. \"Malala's courageous campaign for girls' education is an inspiration to all,\" says GWI Director Mary Ellsberg. \"We are honored to serve as the Malala Fund's educational partner, and to work with Little, Brown and Co. to develop a curriculum that will not only educate students but spark the very activism Malala stands for.\" The curriculum will be made available to faculty members and students around the world at no cost beginning in mid-2014. At GW, it will be created by an interdisciplinary group from the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, the Elliott School of International Affairs, the Graduate School of Education and Human Development, and the University Writing Program. \"We'd like to encourage college students and eventually high school students to get involved, to facilitate dialogues among various groups and to influence public opinion,\" says Michele Clark, an adjunct professor in international affairs who is among those working on the project. Shiza Shahid, co-founder and CEO of the Malala Fund, says the group is \"so heartened by the support Malala has received, and we hope her book and this curriculum will give students the knowledge and resources to join Malala in her fight.\" gwmagazine.com / 11 at the announcement of the \"i am Malala\" curriculum development, in october, students and faculty members gathered in support of activist Malala yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban.gw news 12 / gw magazine / Spring 2014International Affairs one d ay Apart, World Bank and imf leaders Address gW students In back-to-back appearances by heavy hitters in global finance, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde addressed GW students one day apart in October. Mr. Kim, who spoke and took questions from students, focused his address on the World Bank's goal of ending extreme poverty. \"This is the defining moral issue of our time,\" he said. \"We cannot let over a billion people suffer in extreme poverty when we have the tools and the resources to change their lives for the better. We cannot allow the bottom 40 percent of the population be denied opportunities for jobs, health, and education. We can do better.\" In working toward that 2030 goal, Mr. Kim outlined the World Bank's plans to overcome challenges by partnering with the private sector to generate job growth for the poor; increasing its commitment to conflict-ridden areas, like the Middle East; and focusing on issues that directly affect poverty, like climate change and investments for women and girls. Ms. Lagarde, who is the first woman elected to lead the International Monetary Fund in its 67-year history, spoke and took questions at an address kicking off the IMF's annual meeting, which was held in part on GW's Foggy Bottom campus. Five years after the global economy avoided going into a depression, the fog of the financial crisis is starting to lift, she said. But even as the economies of the United States, Europe, and Japan show signs of stabilization, it will be crucial to carefully manage monetary policies. \"The key now is to use this time wisely and not waste space,\" she said. \"This means different things in different countries. All advanced economies need to move on a broad policy front, but with different emphases: financial in the euro area, fiscal in the United States and Japan, structural in the euro area and Japan.\" Emerging markets, she said, must cooperate internally and with each other. And low-income and conflict-ridden countries, especially in the Middle East, will need more engagement with and support from the international community and organizations like the IMF.

The 100-square-foot solar-paneled pathway is part of the Solar Walk project on GW's Virginia Science and Technology Campus, completed in the fall. The project includes 27 slip-resistant, semitransparent walkable solar panels and a solar-powered trellis. In peak conditions the walkable panels, designed by Spain-based Onyx Solar, generate enough energy to power 450 LED pathway lights, while the trellis generates energy that feeds back to the campus' Innovation Hall. \"We are excited to explore the potential of this newly patented product and participate with Onyx in its goal of furthering unique photovoltaic technologies,\" says GW Senior Land Use Planner Eric Selbst. The solar table, on the Foggy Bottom Campus, was proposed and built by students, led by sophomore Ben Pryde. Installed on a plaza between 21st and 22nd streets and F and G streets, the six-foot-long table is made of rain-resistant plywood and aluminum, with a layered tabletop of sophomore Ben Pryde sits at the solar table he built with the help of students and departments across the university. plywood and a 280-watt solar panel covered with Plexiglas. Devices like cell phones and laptops can be placed on the table and plugged into one of its eight, 120-volt outlets. \"We wanted this table to be simple to build and durable,\" Mr. Pryde says. \"It can be built by anyone.\" The project was funded through the GW Center for Student Engagement, the Student Association, and the Residence Hall Association. Mr. Pryde led a team in drafting the proposal, outlining how the solar table would improve student space, increase awareness about sustainability, and align with the university strategic plan's emphasis on innovating through cross-disciplinary collaboration. curriculum federal reserve is Topic of first open, online Course The university this fall plans to offer its first-ever massive open online course, or MOOC, which will examine the Federal Reserve. The free course will be open to the public through a collaboration among GW, Pearson Education, Blackboard Inc., and In the Telling, a documentary film-education William atkinscompany. The class will examine the philosophical underpinnings, operations, and policies of the Federal Reserve, drawing up a series of lectures given at GW in 2012 by then Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke; an event last spring featuring former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker; and interviews with leading scholars, policymakers, critics, and current and former Federal Reserve officials. \"There are very few institutions that are simultaneously so important and so little understood as the Federal Reserve,\" says Paul Schiff Berman, GW's vice provost for online education and academic innovation. \"This MOOC will be a significant, non-partisan contribution to public discourse on the Fed, and it will use the online medium in new and innovative ways in order to reach a broader public.\" The announcement was made in December at a daylong symposium called \"Past, Present and Future of the Federal Reserve System,\" which featured former leaders of the Federal Reserve; Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.); Pulitzer Prize-winning author Liaquat Ahamed, and other finance and government experts. The event was the first of four to be organized by GW to mark the Federal Reserve's 100th anniversary. Provost Steven Lerman says the MOOC will not be built around the traditional classroom approach that is standard among large-scale online courses. Instead, it will have a more narrative format, with documentary-style interviews conducted by School of Media and Public Affairs Director and former CNN anchor Frank Sesno, as well as detailed reporting and intensive interactive learning modules. \"We are consistently able to provide public access to leaders in public policy and, through our scholarly research and our convening role, to deepen public understanding of the key issues underlying influential institutions of governance,\" he says. \"The MOOC is an extension of that commitment and expands our relationship with key governmental agencies.\" The seven-week, noncredit course is planned for launch in fall 2014. Registration will begin in the summer. gwmagazine.com / 15 Members of the GW community toured the science and e ngineering hall in d ecember to celebrate the completion of the initial concrete structure. Student Profile GW Junior brings 'ideas Worth spreading' to Foggy bottom Home to the Kennedy Center, the U.S. State Department, the World Bank, and other institutions, GW's Foggy Bottom neighborhood is no slouch when it comes to ideas. But Brian Doyle is trying his best to pile on more. As curator of TEDxFoggyBottom, Mr. Doyle, a junior at GW who is studying human services and social justice, is in his third year of bringing to the neighborhood a part of the renowned TED speaker series, which carries the motto, \"Ideas worth spreading.\" TED\u2014which stands for technology, entertainment, design\u2014provides a platform for visionary presenters to discuss everything from the perfect spaghetti sauce (Malcolm Gladwell, 2004) to whether eating certain foods can \"starve\" cancer (William Li, 2010). Thousands of people have attended TED events, from its main annual conference to smaller, independently organized versions known as TEDx events. In 2010 GW co-hosted a TEDxPotomac event, whose speakers included Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, a 7-year-old tap dancer, and a Paralympic athlete. TEDxFoggyBottom began two years later, with Mr. Doyle assisting the group of organizers he now helps lead. It was a role that he prepared for well as a San Diego high schooler involved in the local TEDxYouth@SanDiego. Mr. Doyle became the speaker coordinator for that event, and it took just a month for him to be appointed student lead organizer. \"The journey was one of the most incredible adventures I've ever been on,\" he says. \"I wanted to take part in something that was changing the world for the better\u2014something that put the power of ideas in the hands of everyone.\" After working with the organizers of the first TEDxFoggyBottom in 2012, Mr. Doyle was selected to attend TEDGlobal in Edinburgh, Scotland, which afforded him the official capacity as a TEDx organizer to produce events of any size, he says. Last March he helped lead TEDxFoggyBottom 2013, which featured eight speakers and drew 400 people. This year's event, in February, grew to include 21 speakers and performers before an audience of 1,200. In the meantime, his TEDx experience came full circle in November when he was invited to deliver a talk at the San Diego youth event that gave him his start. The mission of spreading ideas now includes, in part, his own. Mr. Doyle discussed \"365 Days of 'Thank You,'\" a project\u2014to express appreciation to one person each day for a year\u2014that he launched after he and two friends narrowly evaded a car crash. His final \"thank you,\" issued on the project's blog ( 365thankyou.wordpress.com ) two days before the talk, went to the people who would be in the audience. The audience, he writes, \"is the whole reason the event exists.\" \u2014Menachem Wecker For more on T edxFoggy bottom, visit tedxfoggybottom.net.Jessica Mc connell Burt facilities science and engineering hall 'Tops o ut' Donning hard hats and safety glasses, GW President Steven Knapp, trustees, university administrators, donors, and friends of the university took a sneak-peak tour of the Science and Engineering Hall in December to mark the completion of the top-most point of the building's concrete structure, a stage known as \"topping out.\" The university broke ground on the building in 2011, and the milestone brings it a step closer to becoming a hub of research and teaching on the Foggy Bottom Campus.

DaVe scaVonegwmagazine.com / 19Jessica m c c Business school professor Annamaria Lusardi, the Denit Trust Distinguished Scholar in Economics and Accountancy, is one of the foremost researchers in the field of financial literacy, and the academic director of GW's Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center. Dr. Lusardi sat down with GW Magazin e to discuss the state of financial literacy (it's not good, people) and how Colonials can help. What is \"financial literacy?\" Why use that term? I like the phrase \"financial literacy\" because in today's world an understanding of basic financial concepts is equivalent to the ability to read and write. During the industrial revolution, people increasingly needed to be literate in order to participate in society; in the modern economy people need to understand simple financial ideas. And fortunately people are beginning to recognize that it is a basic skill. Broadly speaking, what does your research say about the current state of financial literacy in the u nited s tates? The level of financial literacy is critically low, especially if we consider what is at stake. From age 17, when we decide whether to go to college, we start making big decisions. Then people have to make decisions about pensions, how much to save, and how to invest their retirement. We also have broad access to credit, so we can rack up huge debts. But the research suggests that we don't actually have the skills to make those decisions. Only a third of Americans can correctly answer our [three simplest] questions about the most basic concepts at the heart of financial decision-making. We are not asking if people know asset pricing or complex things like that. We don't even ask people to do the calculations. The first question is about interest: If you put $100 in a savings account with an interest rate of 2 percent per year, would you have more than $100 after five years? Less than $100? Exactly $100? Then we have a question about inflation, and finally a question about risk diversification. That's why we say the knowledge is critically low, because these are three quite elementary questions. Why aren't people financially literate, and when and how should they be taught to be? Financial literacy is not learned by osmosis; it's not \"general knowledge.\" It's a specific skill, and we need to start teaching it as early as possible. The way it's done now, we have basically one semester-long course in high school\u2014and not all states have even that much. I can't think of any single subject that is learned in one semester at the end of high school. We don't learn math or history or English this way, because that's not how an important topic is learned. We don't teach literature so that you can write War and Peace . We teach it so that you can appreciate books. We want people to be financially literate not because we expect them to be Warren Buffett, but so that they can compute the complexity of the decisions they will have to make, ask for advice if they need to, and take proper action. Are there groups that are made particularly vulnerable by a lack of financial literacy? Actually, there are three. We see a lack of knowledge at both ends of the age spectrum: The young are vulnerable because they have no experience. But while the young know little and acknowledge they know little, the elderly also know little but they think they know the most. That makes them an ideal object for scams. Interestingly, around the world we also find that women have been left behind as market economies develop. Across the countries where we have used our questions, they answer in the same way: they say that they do not know the answer. This is critically important, because we have a group that not only doesn't know but it admits it doesn't know. And I think that makes women an amazing group and an amazing target for financial education. Especially because in many households, it's the woman who makes the domestic decisions\u2014planning for a child's education, taking care of aging parents. So teaching a woman to be financially literate will help her and help her take better care of her family. What can gW alumni do to improve the state of financial literacy? They can be proactive ambassadors for financial literacy. A GW alumnus could ask the school district where they live to add financial literacy in the curriculum. Or they could ask the business community of which they are part to support the training of the teachers in that district. We can break this cycle where the young are not equipped to live in society. We can also educate adults. We can push for workplace financial education, and if not in the workplace, then in the places where people go to learn: libraries and museums. It's not just about personal finances. This stuff has implications for society, as we saw in the financial crisis. If a substantial number of people make mistakes, taxpayers will be asked to pay for that. So we need to be as informed as possible. And there's nothing magical about it! There's not even anything particularly difficult about it. The fact that we are making such a drama out of this topic has been to the detriment of everybody.\u2014ruth s teinhardt gwmagazine.com / 19 gw news 20 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 START SAVING NOW SOFI.COM/GEORGEWHY REFINANCE WITH SOFI ?

The Lincoln, Neb., native came to GW on several occasions for reasons much more grave: treatments at GW Hospital for cardiovascular disease. \" If this is dying , I remember thinking, it's not all that bad ,\" he writes in the prologue to his new book, Heart , co-written with Jonathan Reiner, his cardiologist and the director of GW Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Lab. The book alternates between memoir- style and historical vignettes in Mr. Cheney's and Dr. Reiner's voices, and although the latter's sections are heavy on medical terminology\u2014\"red pulse oxymetry sensor,\" \"coronary arteriography\"\u2014the prose is whimsical and accessible. A defibrillator sits on a \"fire-engine-red\" cabinet, for example; latex gloves make a \"characteristic thwack,\" and a catheterization lab is a \"multimillion-dollar cathedral to the latest technology.\" Elsewhere, Dr. Reiner waxes philosophical: \"Unadorned we come into this world and, in a hospital, unadorned we go out\"; \"Medical school ... teaches plenty of science but very little of the art of being a doctor\"; and, he writes, \"I know that heart transplantation is fundamentally an elegant surgical procedure ... but for me, like the birth of a child, the awakening of a heart in its new host is a moment filled with divine grace.\" Other passages discuss everything from an autopsy Leonardo da Vinci performed in Florence in 1507 to five pints of blood that were drained from George Washington's arm on Dec. 14, 1799, before he died later that evening. Mr. Cheney's 35-year struggle with heart disease is a fascinating and highly personal story in its own right, and when it is interwoven with the observations and recollections of Dr. Reiner the narrative takes on further complexity and context. And in this case, the sum is even greater than its parts. Both Mr. Cheney and Dr. Reiner have the humility and insight to recognize that their already compelling stories become The Rhythm and Blues In Heart: An American Medical Odyssey , former v ice p resident d ick cheney and his cardiologist of 15 years, Jonathan reiner of GW hospital, agree to waive the physician-patient privilege and discuss their interactions over the years.

Heart is about not only the heart of one man\u2014albeit a very famous and powerful man\u2014but all hearts. Nowhere is the wonder of that organ more apparent than in Dr. Reiner's observation: \"Over an eighty-year life, a human heart beats, uninterrupted, 2.5 billion times, an astonishing example of physical durability seldom, and maybe never, replicated by even the most sophisticated human engineering. An automobile motor, for comparison, will make less than 500 million revolutions if you're lucky enough to keep it running for 100,000 miles.\" Other perks of reading the book?

In wartime, Britain \"impressed,\" or forced, its subjects to join its navy. \"Impressment was more than a stopgap measure to keep the Royal Navy afloat,\" writes Denver Brunsman, an assistant professor of history at GW. \"It was a fundamental component of Britain's early imperial success.\" Instead of targeting criminals and the lower classes, the Royal Navy conscripted men who were skilled sailors and who typically stood to make less in their new, involuntary naval employment than in their old day jobs. And therein lay what Dr. Brunsman calls the \"impressment paradox\"; given how much sailors and their local communities fought the so-called press gangs that came to enlist conscripts, it's surprising that impressment was so successful. The book may also have one of the most creative acknowledgments section, which begins, \"Writing a book is much like working as a member of a crew on a ship.\" The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election (p rinceton University press, 2013) John sides and Lynn v avreck The term \"game changer,\" which was wielded early and often in the analysis leading up to and during the 2012 presidential election, was largely misapplied to \"blips that failed to transform the race,\" write John Sides, an associate professor of political science at GW, and Lynn Vavreck, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. \"It was, according to one reporter, the single worst clich\u00e9 of the campaign.\" U.S. presidential elections, they write, are \"rarely decided by a single moment that changes everything.\" Instead factors like the economy tend to have a much greater impact. This book adopts a data-driven, Moneyball approach to the question of what propelled President Barack Obama to a second term. \"Our answer turns more on the advantages incumbent presidents have even in slowly growing economies and less on television advertising or field organizations,\" the authors write. That's not to say that the $2.3 billion spent by the candidates and their allies was entirely wasted, but that each one's spending balanced the other's out.

Having lived with 23 years of essentially nonstop war\u2014an eight-year war with Iran, then the first Gulf War, then the \"most comprehensive embargo ever enforced on a nation,\" and periodic U.S. and British bombings\u2014Iraqis had seen \"the militarization of [their] politics and society, the brutalization of public culture, and the creation of irreconcilable divisions within Iraq,\" Dr. Khoury writes. Although there has been some scholarly attention to the ways that long periods of war have affected parts of Africa, Israel and Palestine, Iran, and the United States after 9/11, Dr. Khoury's book\u2014based on government documents and interviews with soldiers and families\u2014fills a void by casting the spotlight on Iraq.willia M atkins 26 / gw magazine / Spring 2014gw news athletics news AthleticS newsgwmagazine.com / 27 G w a thletics c oMM unicationsThrill of v ictory: First o ver c ancer, Then on the c ourt GW volleyball freshman natalie Leger did not have a traditional recruitment. she was sidelined her entire junior year of high school while she battled h odgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. but before her illness, Ms. Leger had a goal, and she refused to let it go: she wanted to play d ivision i volleyball. \"people always say you should follow your dreams, and i did that,\" says Ms. Leger. \"My dream was to play d ivision i volleyball, and i had to do some crazy things to get here. i had to fight a lot, and i was not going to let anything stop me. i would work out after chemotherapy treatments, which looking back probably wasn't the smartest thing. i wouldn't let cancer stop me from achieving my dream, and it has all paid off.\" The Woodmere, n.y., native won her battle with cancer and made enough of an impact during her senior year of high school and club seasons to be noticed by the GW coaching staff. she joined the colonials in the fall of 2013.

The team boarded a plane in Dallas on Dec. 27 and landed on Dec. 29 half a world away, leapfrogging the 28th, for an Australian odyssey that more than made up for the calendar gap. The 12-day, three-city trip\u2014 including 65 hours of travel and seven plane rides\u2014had the team practicing, playing, touring, and immersing itself in the Australian culture. \"It is hard to put into words how incredible this trip was,\" says Head Coach Tara Hannaford. \"We packed a lot of activities into our time there, and that is exactly what we wanted\u2014for the student-athletes to embrace the culture, to learn about Australia and its history, and to compete against competitive lacrosse programs.\" In Cairns, the team's first stop, travelers dined on traditional fare of barramundi, bison, crocodile, emu, and for a postgame barbecue. Later, GW hosted a youth clinic for more than 40 local girls. The team then competed against the SA All Stars, a team comprising the best players from club teams across South Australia. The Colonials next headed to Sydney for the final leg of the tour, where team members delved into the history of Australia's most populous city. They rode the surf at Manly Beach and capped the trip by trekking across Sydney Harbour Bridge\u2014a 1,332-step, three-and-a-half-hour journey through and over the world's tallest steel arch bridge, which reaches 440 feet above the water. Men's Basketball Homes Away f rom Home More often than not during this 100th season, the GW men's basketball team felt at home even on the road thanks to hundreds of Colonials faithful who came kangaroo; they spent a day swimming and snorkeling at the picturesque Great Barrier Reef; they white-water rafted down the Barron River; and, upholding GW's dedication to service, the team volunteered at Harald's House, which provides a safe and stable home to homeless youth. In Adelaide, where the students spent five days touring, feeding kangaroos, and trying their hands at cricket and traditional Aboriginal dances, the team also got to work with its first practice of 2014. The squad notched a win against the Brighton Lacrosse Club, before both teams gathered to cheer, reminisce, and network at alumni receptions across the country. Large gatherings of GW fans and alumni came together across the country, from Manhattan and Long Island to southern California, Philadelphia, and the Midwest\u2014even at D.C.'s Verizon Center, mere blocks from home court, for the 2013 BB&T Classic in December, where GW sent the Buff and Blue assemblage into euphoria with a buzzer-beating win over local rival Maryland. \"In 20 years of coaching, including a year at Maryland, our alumni events are the best attended I've ever seen,\" says third-year Head Coach Mike Lonergan, who has addressed packed rooms at each event this season. As part of a scheduling philosophy that will take the Colonials to areas populated with GW alumni, the team made four trips to the New York City area this season (Manhattan, Hofstra, Fordham, and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn), with road dates in front of hundreds of GW fans.

The study, she says, shows \"the whens, hows, and whys behind plant species' trait evolution and movements.\" The researchers identified three repeated evolutionary shifts they believe flowering plants made to fight the cold: Plants either dropped their leaves seasonally, shutting down the pathways that would normally carry water between roots and leaves; made skinnier water-conducting pathways, allowing them to keep their leaves while reducing the risk of developing air bubbles during freezing and thawing; or avoided cold seasons altogether, losing aboveground stems and leaves and retreating underground. The team found that the woody plants\u2014those that maintain a prominent stem above ground year-round, such as maple trees\u2014most often either retreated below ground, becoming herbs, or developed thinner pathways before they moved into freezing climates. Shedding leaves, in contrast, usually developed after a plant moved into freezing climates. For the study, the researchers created a database of traits and environmental conditions for more than 49,000 species, then built the largest time-pegged evolutionary tree for plants, tracing the lineage of more than 32,000 species. Dr. Zanne and her colleagues now plan to use the massive evolutionary tree to explore other aspects of plant history, including the responses of plants to other environmental pressures beyond freezing. \u2014kurtis h iattlike the seasonal shedding of leaves\u2014that enabled these plants to spread across the globe.

The Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics , published by CQ Press, contains nearly 600 entries, a collection of essays, and original research. The content spans from a 1945 Atlantic Monthly article written on engineer Vannevar Bush, to the intricacies of software like FinFisher, to a recent study from the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. Individual entries shed light on how technology is a companion presence for other areas of life and collective governance.Chemistry a Faster Fight against chemical, biological agents Knowing one's enemy is a tenet of war, but in the fight against chemical and biological weapons it can be exceedingly arduous and time-consuming. Now a team led by a George Washington University researcher is working to vastly improve the process under a grant that will provide up to $14.6 million over five years. The grant, from the military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, tasks the researchers with reducing to 30 days a process that can sometimes take years or even decades. \"Clearly, this is a very large \"We were peeling back the Earth's surface and seeing the wiring underneath, looking at how every aspect of public life\u2014religion, music, art, education, household decisions, everything\u2014is interconnected,\" she says. But as deep as the project went, completing it also was a race against time and obsolescence. The information included had to be practically useful and academically important, as well as having influence on the current field. \"What we produced is an artifact,\" Dr. Harvey says. \"This encyclopedia is a portrait of the social media political landscape at this place and this time, in all of the dimensions we could get access to.

The study, published online in October in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also suggests the two species may have diverged around 1 million years ago, hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The hardness and size of teeth make them a well-preserved and common line of evidence, offering a good representation of many early species in the human family tree, says lead researcher Aida G\u00f3mez-Robles, a postdoctoral scientist at GW's Center for the Advanced Study of Hominid Paleobiology. willia M a tkins challenge, and it's easy to understand why it's important to overcome,\" says lead researcher Akos Vertes, a GW chemistry professor who will be collaborating with GE Global Research, Protea Biosciences Inc., and SRI International. \"Discovering the cause behind a biological or chemical threat can provide information that not only counteracts the threat,\" Dr. Vertes says, \"but also provides important information for pharmaceutical companies developing drugs that may be unrelated to the threat.\" Biological threats, like anthrax, derive from bacteria, viruses, toxins, or fungi. Chemical threats include substances that work to interfere with the nervous system or cause asphyxiation. Both have the potential to cause rapid and widespread injury or death. To determine how a biological or chemical threat disrupts the functions of life, researchers have to take a holistic view of the threat and the system in which it operates.

If found, those would be the fossils \"that can give us a clearer answer to this problem.\" That may mean finding new species or simply better- preserved fossils.

It was only December when we met, but she was suddenly awash in the thought that the reading and thinking and preparations of the past 14 years were about to come to a head. Her mind was 520 million miles away, floating out near the orbit of Jupiter. There in the frigid deep, the European satellite Rosetta was snoozing. Launched in 2004, Rosetta had carved a circuitous, sightseer's path to the outer solar system, where it was put into hibernation as it coasted toward the comet it will chase this summer at 62,000 miles per hour. In November a landing craft will grab it and, like a robotic Errol Flynn, ride the comet around the sun and into history. Rosetta's alarm clock was set to go off in just over a month. \"After January 20,\" Dr. Ehrenfreund, an astrobiologist and research professor in the Elliott School of International Affairs, said at the time, \"boom\u2014it will really be a wake-up for everybody.\" For the mission's engineers and scientists, and for sky-watchers of all stripes, the wake-up would set in motion a spectacular and unprecedented feat of cosmic derring-do; landing on a comet has never been attempted. Rosetta already is the first satellite to venture so far from home relying exclusively on solar power, and by the time it lands this fall it also will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet and observe it over time. Yet the delicate orchestration of closing in on a comet and landing on its unknown surface is just the beginning for Dr. Ehrenfreund, one of the mission's scientists, and her colleagues. The orbit will give them a front-row seat as the sun brings the comet to a boil. And the landing will offer a chance to mine an artifact from the birth of the solar system, one that has been in cold storage for billions of years. So when Rosetta blinked back to life on Jan. 20 after two and a half years of silence\u2014sending an A-OK that traveled 45 minutes at the speed of light to reach Earth\u2014the European Space Agency control room erupted into cheers and hugs. Dr. Ehrenfreund, receiving word while at a government dinner in Austria, could hardly sit and went table to table sharing the news. \"But right now,\" she cautioned in an email, \"still 9 million kilometers to go.\" It was nonetheless a monumental start to a new year\u2014one in which she also plans to be part of an experiment sent to the International Space Station and will settle in as the first female president of the Austrian Science Fund, her home country's equivalent of the inset, Philae lan Der: esa /atg me Diala BNational Science Foundation in the United States. She also will be busy preparing to lead a space station experiment next year and, if all goes well, to land instruments on Mars in both 2018 and 2020. It marked the start of another year of searching the stars for timeless and essential unknowns: the conditions under which the solar system was forged, the inventory of molecules in the universe, and unraveling the moment when chemistry became biology. We are composed of the traces of stars, cobbled together from materials they produced in life and rocketed out in their fiery deaths; \"starstuff pondering the stars,\" as astronomer Carl Sagan put it. And at this moment perhaps nothing in our galactic neighborhood is closer to that notion than the Rosetta spacecraft. Both comets and asteroids are leftovers from the swirling gas and dust that formed the sun and accumulated into its surrounding planets, but comets are the \"more pristine\" artifacts, says Dr. Ehrenfreund. While asteroids are rock or metal and reside mostly in an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, comets are so-called dirty snowballs, conglomerations of ice, gas, and dust that were flung beyond the planets to the cold outer reaches of the solar system. Cometary ice has preserved easily vaporized elements that asteroids lost long ago. \"Asteroids,\" she P was 520 million miles P Deep Space Hibernation June 8, 2011 Launc H March 2, 2004 Wake- up January 20, 2014arriva L in area of c omet May 2014gwmagazine.com / 37says, \"have just had a rougher life.\" Scientists think that comets may have brought water and the molecular ingredients of life to a young Earth, or added to what was already here. Carbon, for instance, is the basis of biology as we know it, and the comets and asteroids that pummeled the planet for hundreds of millions of years delivered it by the truckload: perhaps a million tons each year, by one estimate. That barrage of impacts helped make the Earth inhospitable at the time, Dr. Ehrenfreund says, but may have sown the seeds of life, which arose fairly soon afterward, some 3.5 billion years ago. \"We don't know what the early Earth did with all this material. We can't prove it, but we can research what is possible,\" she says. Whether the necessary ingredients were imported from space or homegrown, or both, \"the fact that you get this pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter with asteroids and comets, you cannot ignore that,\" she says. \"So that's why we need to know the composition of those objects.\" Through Earth-bound observations and satellite missions, scientists so far have been able to discern a lot about comets: from their orbital paths, to the nature of their icy nuclei (which are among the darkest objects in the universe) and of the jets of gas and dust that in some comets form the characteristic haze, or coma, around the nucleus and a tail, which can streak across millions of miles. Satellites have conducted observational flybys, collected samples of escaping dust and gas, and even smashed into one comet with a coffee table-size probe. Dozens of molecules have been identified in comets, including one type of amino acid\u2014chemicals that are the building blocks of proteins, which drive essential functions for life on Earth. All of these missions have had \"an incredible impact on increasing our knowledge,\" says Dr. Ehrenfreund. \"But it is not a piece of the nucleus.\" In that sense, everything that the Rosetta mission finds on the comet stands to be something of a breakthrough, whether it reveals molecules that had gone undetected\u2014or had changed chemically by the time they were found off the comet\u2014or simply confirms and quantifies what was thought to be there. Studying a comet from the surface also could provide unparalleled insight into its internal structure. \"Those questions about porosity and layers and dynamics between ice, gas, and rock in a comet are important to understanding what actually comes down to Earth, what survives, [and] what would help to create something new upon impact,\" she says. Rosetta's target is comet 67P/Churyumov- Gerasimenko, which is about two and a half miles in diameter and oval-shaped. Although it used to be much deeper in space, close encounters with Jupiter over the past two centuries have gradually pulled the comet closer in, and it now swings by the sun every six and a half years. As Rosetta chases the comet over the spring and summer and enters its orbit in August, the satellite will be studying it from a distance through a fleet of cameras, sensors, and other instruments. Among them is a microscope capable of analyzing individual grains of dust flying from the comet, which Dr. Ehrenfreund is involved with as a member of the instrument's science team. The lander, called Philae, is expected to touch down in November and will study both the surface and below, using a drill that will plunge nearly a foot into the comet. Dr. Ehrenfreund is involved with a lander instrument that will search for complex carbon-based molecules, which could include amino acids or other organic molecules that are potentially significant to life on Earth. The hope of the European Space Agency is that Rosetta will do for planetary science what its namesake did for the understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing. \"Imagine you are reading something but you cannot understand the meaning of it because you do not know the letters, the symbols, the signs that are being used,\" said Alvaro Gim\u00e9nez, ESA's director of science and robotic exploration, at a news conference on wake-up day. \"This is the situation we find ourselves [in] when we try to tackle the big questions about our place in the universe.\" The comet \"is made out of material that is linked to the infancy of our solar system\u2014it's pristine, noncorrupted material, giving us information [about] the gas and dust nebula that gave birth to our entire solar system,\" Rosetta An artist 's impression of the r osetta orbiter (above) and the Philae lander (top left)rosetta or Biter: esa /atg me Diala B arriva L at comet August 2014LanDing November 2014 cLoSeSt a pproac H to Sun August 2015 a Brief History source: esa 38 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 38 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 38 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 toP: esa \u00a9 2007 m P s F or osiris team m P s / u PD/ lam /iaa / rss D/ inta / u P m / D asP/ i D a / Bottom: esa \u00a92007 m P s F or osiris team m P s / u PD/ lam /iaa /rss D/inta / u P m /DasP/i D aDr. Gim\u00e9nez said. Exploring the comet \"will be like opening a window in time.\" It's not what usually comes to mind when someone refers to leading a \"double life.\" Torn between studying genetics or astronomy in college, Dr. Ehrenfreund took a road less traveled: She pursued them both. It was a decision that resulted, not surprisingly, in some missed parties. But that broad focus would position her in the late-1980s and '90s to jump into an emerging field at the intersection of both subjects. After college at the University of Vienna, she followed suit with a master's in molecular biology and a PhD in astrophysics. Only a few months separated her thesis work, which involved \"extracting enzymes from the skin secretions of [African clawed] frogs,\" and her PhD research, observing carbon molecules in interstellar space, she recalled in an essay in the journal Astrobiology . In 1999, just nine years after Dr. Ehrenfreund received her PhD, an asteroid was named in her honor\u2014a designation that is made by an asteroid's discoverer (in this case, a renowned asteroid-hunting team led by Dutch astronomer Cornelis Johannes van Houten) but also must be approved by an international governing committee. The citation for \"9826 Ehrenfreund 2114 T-3\" notes her work on cosmic dust, organic molecules, and fostering international cooperation. \"They told me it's quite a nice object,\" Dr. Ehrenfreund says. (She hasn't actually seen it. To get a good look would require a high-powered telescope, and time slots on those are usually reserved for, well, science. \"Just saying, 'Oh, I want to see my asteroid,' doesn't really work.\") By 2008 she already had become a highly cited researcher of ices and organic molecules in the vast spaces between stars. She had served as a professor of astrobiology in the Netherlands, as a scientific adviser and a committee member helping to steer the work of space agencies, and as a visiting scientist and consultant at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.She was by then also a veteran of astronomical observations from some of the world's premier optical and radio telescopes and had served on the science teams of several space missions, from the early days of Rosetta, to experiments that exposed organic and biological materials to the space environment, to helping design an instrument for detecting organic molecules on a 2018 mission to Mars. In 2008 she became a GW research professor of space policy and international affairs in the Elliott School's Space Policy Institute. And although policy is a decidedly terrestrial pursuit, it's inextricably bound in the exploration of space, from where to go and what to do, to how it's preserved, and how any of that gets funded. As Dr. Ehrenfreund and her co-authors write in a recent article, as members of an advisory group to the European Commission: Plans for space exploration and Earth observation \"are becoming more and more technically complicated and so costly that a single nation can hardly afford to realize them.\" The sustainable way forward will be through new ideas about collaboration, Dr. Ehrenfreund and her colleagues write in a 2011 report. That means partnerships not just among today's big-league space agencies and the up-and-comers, like China and India, but also with developing nations interested in sparking technological growth, and with people from overlapping fields, such as earth science and space law. That paper, which Dr. Ehrenfreund co-authored as chair of the international Committee on Space Research's Panel on Exploration, outlines a series of \"stepping stone\" opportunities, which include international coordination of studies into extreme environments on Earth; joining forces to defray the costs of high-priority robotic missions to bring home samples from asteroids, Mars, and other objects; and a program to support a class of increasingly sophisticated, small, lightweight, and low-cost satellites that can essentially piggyback to space aboard other missions. She helped lead one of these missions for NASA in 2010, launching a loaf of bread-size satellite that demonstrated the capacity of so-called nanosatellites to carry out astrobiology experiments. Based on its success, she's leading a follow-up experiment for the International Space Station, planned for next year. It's Dr. Ehrenfreund's search for the ingredients and origin of life, however, that will push back into the foreground with Rosetta and her planned Mars missions. The findings might fuel something deeper, too: a theory for how it all came together. After one of its swings past earth, in November 2007, rosetta snapped this image of the moon, pockmarked and nestled in black. on its way out, the satellite also made close-up observations of two asteroids orbiting between mars and Jupiter.Along the journey to deep space, rosetta received gravitational boosts from three swings past earth and one past mars, which gave the satellite a nudge\u2014and a chance to do a little sightseeing. This image of mars was taken in f ebruary 2007. Along the journey to deep gwmagazine.com / 39 gwmagazine.com / 39 gwmagazine.com / 39\"I also work on something that is a little outside the mainstream,\" Dr. Ehrenfreund says. \"I do not believe that life at the beginning was composed of the compounds which we are using now, in modern biochemistry.\" One of the prevailing theories is that the first organisms were built using ribonucleic acid, or RNA, as a precursor to the current genetic molecule, DNA\u2014an idea known as the \"RNA world.\" RNA still plays a vital role in life, decoding genetic instructions for making proteins, among other things, and is made with nearly the same ingredients as DNA: a set of carbon-and-nitrogen compounds called nucleobases, sugars, and phosphates. Each of those, or their precursors, have been found in space or in meteorites (fragments of asteroids and comets that survive the fall to Earth). But the Earth was a different place billions of years ago, and Dr. Ehrenfreund thinks the environment likely was too hostile for \"very fragile molecules\" like sugars and meteorite-bound amino acids. \"I think you should start very simple: What was there at the very beginning, and what could withstand the radiation, and thermal and geological activity, and could be versatile enough to be incorporated into the first protocells?\" she says. The answer, she thinks, is simpler but sturdier molecules called aromatic hydrocarbons. These honeycomb-like chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms\u2014\"aromatic\" in this case refers to a type of chemical bond\u2014represent the largest portion of solid carbon in the universe. Among carbon-containing gas molecules, too, a group called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, is the most abundant; on Earth they are seen when carbon-based material is burned incompletely, such as in vehicle exhaust and char-grilled meat. The availability and robustness of these compounds have led Dr. Ehrenfreund to contemplate life's beginnings as an \"aromatic world.\" In 2006 she led a team in formally making the case for it in the journal Astrobiology . The argument builds in part on an earlier hypothesis about PAHs guiding the formation of a DNA-like genetic blueprint molecule. But her team's hypothesis goes beyond that, envisioning vital roles for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons in the construction and operation of life's other requirements, as well: energy-harvesting mechanisms and the cellular structure. \"In looking at life as we know it, or as we don't know it, we have to follow the basic rules of the universe,\" Dr. Ehrenfreund said at a NASA-organized conference that year. \"We have to understand abundances and distribution. The inventory is strikingly similar everywhere.\" From a carbon perspective, she said, the universe \"is absolutely aromatic.\" As she works to build the case in the lab\u2014a 2012 study found PAH derivatives helped stabilize a simulated primitive cell wall, similar to cholesterol in modern cells\u2014she does so knowing that the unknown and perhaps never knowable details loom for any theory of life's origin. Still, there's much that can be done to fill in the picture. And comets, she says, remain \"a big question mark.\" \"Everything we can measure to help us understand the organic inventory of comets will be a big breakthrough,\" she says.Aromatic hydrocarbons and amino acids will be among the complex organics the Rosetta team will look for when the lander digs into comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. While none on their own is likely to be a smoking gun, in total they may reveal much about an ancient chemical symphony and its prospects for sparking life here\u2014and maybe elsewhere, a prospect Dr. Ehrenfreund has not ruled out. At that 2006 NASA conference, she closed her remarks by echoing a sobering thought from evolutionary paleobiologist Simon Conway Morris: \"Life may be a universal principle, but we can still be alone.\" Her own hunch is somewhere in between endless solitude and a crowded universe. Of the possibility for primitive life beyond Earth, she says, \"we cannot exclude it whatsoever.\" The universe is big place. There are hundreds of billions of galaxies, and ours alone is thought to have a similarly vast number of stars. Many of those have planets, some of which may be habitable. But finding similar life-forms? \"To have exactly the same arising somewhere else, like us humans, I would be astonished. It is difficult to reproduce all these fantastic things that happened on our planet.\" Asked whether she thinks life is out there, or if she shouldn't say, she replies, \"I hope so,\" with a laugh. \"I am a scientist so I have to be correct. I cannot say there will be; I cannot say there will not be,\" she says. \"I would just say: It would be real fun.\" \"In looking at life ... we have to follow the basic rules of the universe,\" she says. \"We have to understand abundances and distribution. The inventory is strikingly similar everywhere.\" Previous missions have observed, collected bits of, and even smashed into comets. But a landing has never been attempted. The Philae lander, seen in this artist's impression, promises a new view of these icy relics of the solar system.esa /atg me Diala Buniverse,\" she says. \"We have to understand abundances and distribution.

DeMpseyTHE TExTILE MUSEUM begins the journey to its new home at the George Washington University. 42 / gw magazine / Spring 2014Question: How do you pack a pre-Columbian apron with a real toucan's head attached to the front of it? Answer: Very carefully. Indeed, \"very carefully\" is how a team at The Textile Museum is packing some 19,000 items as it prepares its internationally known collection, much of it fragile, for relocation. Later this year, The Textile Museum joins university art holdings and the Washingtoniana Collection in one location under the umbrella of The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum. Although the university has a collection of paintings, decorative arts, prints, and photography at the Luther W. Brady Art Gallery, it had no museum of its own\u2014until now. In the fall, the new museum will debut in a 46,000-square-foot building under construction at 21st and G streets NW, adjacent to the University Yard. Its galleries and large exhibition space will be complemented by a climate-controlled conservation and study center on GW's Virginia Science and Technology Campus. This partnership of an exemplary existing museum and a leading university has been characterized as a \"truly unique collaboration\" by Ford W. Bell, president of the American Alliance of Museums. \"By combining resources, these institutions increase their reach and impact while The Textile Museum maintains the reputation and identity it has established over the last eight decades,\" Dr. Bell says. Under the arrangement creating the new museum, The Textile Museum will continue to manage its preeminent collection, which will be on perpetual loan to the university. Bruce Baganz, president of The Textile Museum Board of Trustees, says the new museum is ready to embrace its role as an influential world venue for art and cultural understanding. \"Programs and exhibitions at the museum can associate with research, seminars, and lectures as well as widespread interaction with core and expanded audiences outside the university,\" Dr. Baganz says. Doug Evelyn, a museum specialist and consultant on the project, says the Washingtoniana Collection of D.C.-focused historic memorabilia expands the university's connection to national and local urban history while the textiles, which offer expressions of cultural activities and creativity worldwide, strengthen its international prominence. Although the new museum will do much more than dovetail with coursework at the university, there will be collaboration opportunities for students and faculty. Such collaborations \"will create unparalleled opportunities for students, researchers, and scholars as well as for the general public,\" GW President Steven Knapp says. GW's museum studies program at the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences and the museum education program at the Graduate School of Education and Human Development are a logical starting place for these activities. But John Wetenhall, director of The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum, envisions interaction with a long roster of academic disciplines. He points to the departments of museum studies and history in utilizing the Washingtoniana Collection. He and others also see ways that the scholarship of professors in the departments of history, anthropology, and religion can connect textiles to the times and places where they were created. Art and art history classes, meanwhile, can explore textiles as an art form. The Department of Chemistry is cited in the context of the analysis of textile dye while scholars in international and cultural studies might complement the museum's role as a center of learning and discussion. Students may also participate in the long-term goal of digitizing the new museum's collections. Professor Kym Rice, the chair of GW's Department of Museum Studies, says some courses have already identified opportunities. One tackled a social media project for the new museum. Its recommendations for creating an online community for textile enthusiasts will be considered as the museum shapes its long-term web presence. An exhibit design class, meanwhile, has been involved in the Washingtoniana portion of the new museum's opening show. \"Our classes can work on projects for the museum, and our students will also have a chance to practice their skills and have a real-life learning experience,\" Dr. Rice says. a Most Delicate Move At the 89-year-old Textile Museum, currently housed in connected mansions in D.C.'s Kalorama neighborhood, the exhibits are gone. Members of the public are still invited to participate in on-site and off-site programs, including the popular once-a-month \"Ask a Curator, Ask a Conservator\" sessions for guidance on storage, care, and provenance of rugs and fabrics. But the last exhibit at the museum, \"Out of Southeast Asia: Art That Sustains,\" closed in mid-October, and a sign on the front door announces that the museum is moving. That doesn't mean things are quiet. On the second floor, museum staff is busy building customized trays for spindles used by weavers in civilizations that flourished more than 1,000 years before the Spanish Conquest. Special acid-free archival board helps support a 12th-century sock, richly detailed in blue and white and unusual for its shaped heel. Care is given to a deerskin riding coat, embroidered with silk, from the Kazakh region. Members of the conservation team roll 17th-century dragon carpets, so named because of their dragon imagery. The Textile Museum's dragon carpets make up the finest and largest collection outside of Turkey of this material. Chief Conservator Esther M\u00e9th\u00e9 says one of the delights in the packing is the opportunity to savor the depth of the collection. \"We have seen some pieces before. And we have seen photos of the textiles. But as we pack, we get to see every piece in the collection,\" she says. \"Some of the pieces are just so beautiful.\" Intensive planning preceded the actual packing, which itself has been underway for months. As the staff works, it wields the tools of its trade: an iron, measuring tape, tissue paper. Pens are discreetly confiscated at the entry of the packing room to prevent inadvertent damage to the precious items. \"We have about a third of the collection ready to move,\" says Rachel Shabica, the registrar at The Textile Museum and the person overseeing the logistics of the move. Items are placed into boxes that are numbered and adorned with color-coded stickers, part of a meticulous inventory process. Later the boxes will be trucked to industrial freezers, where they will be placed in frigid temperatures to prevent insect infestations before they are transported to their new home. \"We are tracking every item every time it moves,\" explains Assistant Registrar Tessa Lummis, MA '10. \"We had to redo our entire system with new location codes.\" Ms. Lummis, who interned with The Textile Museum while earning her museum studies degree at GW, says the inventory system devised for the move also will expedite researchers' access to textiles in the new facility. University interns have been actively involved in the move. They enter information in the museum database, cut blue board mats to support fragile textiles, seal packages containing rolled objects, and plastic-wrap the boxes. Each box is labeled and the information is added to a computer database before a box goes to a holding shelf in an adjacent room, waiting for the day when moving vans arrive.

Bruce Baganz, president of the board of the textile museum, noted that the collection started by m r. myers long ago outgrew its space in side-by-side mansions near Dupont circle. Dr. Baganz believes the textile museum's founder would have approved of the upcoming move. \"they are lovely, historically significant mansions, but they no longer are appropriate for a modern museum,\" Dr. Baganz says. \"as early as 1938, in the museum's board minutes, it is apparent that g eorge hewitt myers was already thinking about what would be the ultimate home for the museum.\" mr. myers added to his treasures through acquisitions at auctions in the united states and by purchases from dealers in new york, london, Paris, and cairo. at the time of m r. myers' death in 1957, at age 82, the textile museum's collection included 500 rugs and some 3,500 textiles. as it makes it move, the museum's holdings number more than 19,000 objects, dating from 3,000 B.c.e. to the present.

Ms. M\u00e9th\u00e9, the Margaret Wing Dodge Chair in Conservation, noted that the cramped working areas she is accustomed to will be a thing of the past after the move. The lab at the Virginia center has a dry room for fabrics, a wet room for cleaning textiles, and a separate dye lab, giving her team far more flexibility in its conservation work. Most of The Textile Museum's collections, conservation, and exhibition production staff will remain with the collection at its new home. That 22,000-square-foot facility at the Virginia campus is ready except for the installation of customized storage equipment and unusual special features, including an area where textiles can be hoisted, as well as viewed from above, for photographing. the Collections The new museum is a partnership that encompasses university artworks that have never had a home, a long-established museum with textiles that attract 25,000 visitors annually, and a highly specialized private collection of historic artifacts. Once the textiles are relocated to the Virginia campus, where they will be housed when not on exhibit, then the Washingtoniana Collection will be prepared for its move from the offices of Albert H. Small, a third-generation Washington resident and president of Southern Engineering Corp. Over the decades, Mr. Small amassed a treasure trove of rare maps, drawings, letters, documents, lithographs, and books relating to the history and growth of the nation's capital. In 2009, President Barack Obama presented him with the National Humanities Medal. Two years later, the George Washington University awarded him its President's Medal. \"This is Albert Small's personal collection. It's never been publicly presented and studied in the same way as the textile collection. We'll have to build its staff,\" Dr. Wetenhall says, adding that in its new home, the Washingtoniana artifacts will be protected, promoted, and made available to scholars. Professor Rice says The George Washington University Museum and The Textile Museum promises to raise the university's profile. Dr. Baganz takes it a step farther when he maintains that the potential of the new museum is boundless. \"We are only limited by our imaginations,\" he says.

Unraveling Identity will use more than 100 items to demonstrate the power and prestige of textiles as identity markers. the exhibition, tentatively scheduled for fall 2014, will showcase works from the textile museum's own collection as well as contemporary textile art and articles of fashion on loan. the historical exhibitions in the museum's inaugural show, meanwhile, will reveal how Washington, D.c., served as an incubator for social change and urban planning. the civil War brought a remarkable transformation, both physical and political, to Washington, D.c. The Civil War and the Making of Modern Washington will use maps, prints, and illustrations of the federal buildings, barracks, hospitals, hotels, and markets that served a burgeoning population. t he exhibition tracks the city's evolution from the beginning of the war through reconstruction and details Washington's role as a laboratory for social change during a pivotal period in u.s . history. Plans for a Capital: Washington in Maps, 1790-1801, also uses maps and related images, this time to trace how political compromise merged with artistic imagination to bring about an early experiment in urban design. in 1792, george Washington gave French-born architect Pierre l 'enfant a momentous task: to shape the capital of a new nation from a swatch of private properties and plantations at the confluence of two rivers. Plans for a Capital underscores the sweeping impact of l 'e nfant's choices. the inaugural shows are expected to be followed in spring 2015 by the museum's second textile exhibition, which will combine photography and textiles to document a chinese sojourn.

From northern Africa across the Middle East, the anger of individuals\u2014over rampant corruption, chronic unemployment, and brutality by authoritarian regimes\u2014erupted into protests and uprisings demanding change and accountability from governments. The Arab Spring is now entering its fourth year. Rulers entrenched for decades have been ousted, including in Tunisia, where the movement began. In some places, reforms and democratic systems struggle to take root, while elsewhere nations are locked in civil war or teetering on the brink. In short, the Arab Spring continues to smolder. To better understand what's happened to date and where things may be headed, GW Magazine sat down with three experts on the region who guided us through selected hot spots of the movement. \u2014Tara m edeirosthree years into the revolution that has cascaded across the arab world, a trio of experts offers a country-by-country analysis of the movement and where it may be headed. shana m arshall (right) is the associate director of g W's institute for middle east studies. she has been a fellow at the crown c enter for middle east studies at Brandeis university as well as at Princeton university's n iehaus c enter for globalization & g overnance. her current research explores how transnational economic interests shape regional politics, and the influence of foreign direct investment and other official investment channels on the distribution of economic and political power within a rab states.Nathan Brown (left) is a professor of political science and international affairs. his most recent books are The Rule of Law, Islam, and Constitutional Politics in Egypt and Iran (suny Press, 2013) and When Victory Is Not an Option (cornell university Press, 2012). last year he received a prestigious guggenheim Fellowship and was elected president of the middle east studies a ssociation. edward \"skip\" g nehm Jr. (center) is the kuwait Professor of gulf and arabian Peninsula affairs and the director of the middle east Policy Forum. During his distinguished 36-year career in the u.s. Foreign service he was a member of the senior Foreign service, held the rank of career minister, and served as the u.s. ambassador to kuwait, australia, and the hashemite k ingdom of Jordan. William atkins48 / gw magazine / Spring 2014tunisia Following the December 2010 self- immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi, Tunisia became the first country to experience the anger and protests that soon would become widespread throughout the Arab world. These protests led to the eventual ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the formation of an elected Islamist government\u2014which itself agreed to step down in September 2013. shana m arshall: What happened in Tunisia was really stunning, and it's an interesting case because when you compare conditions there to what was going on in many of the other Arab states, Tunisia seemed an unlikely candidate for revolution. Tunisia today looks hopeful in the sense that they have held relatively free and fair elections and the parliamentary impasse over the role of religion in the constitution has been resolved. Still, we see many of the same troubling signs plaguing neighboring states\u2014high-level political assassinations, political polarization. Hopefully now that these constitutional issues are resolved, a more accountable and transparent government can begin to address the conditions of economic and social injustice that led to the regional upheaval. Nathan Brown: This is the one Arab country that seems on an identifiable trajectory toward a new political system, though even there it has been a slow and very contentious process. The main political forces in the country sketched out a road map towards a new political system after the overthrow of President Ben Ali back in early 2011. There have been periodic outbreaks of violence, a couple of assassinations, and violent demonstrations. But Tunisia remains the only state where a more democratic order seems at this point to be emerging. skip gnehm: Tunisia has seen the most relative success in administering change. There was an election in 2011 in which an Islamist government was elected, though there were other, secular parties involved. There has been some political difficulty, which has led to an agreement for the current government to resign and an interim government to take its place until elections can be held later in 2014; this new government will incorporate far more of the political spectrum. So this is a fairly good development. I think one of the significant differences between Tunisia and other countries in the region is that the Tunisian military has actually stayed out of politics. This has enabled the political side to deal with political issues, which they have done well. egypt Egyptian protests began in January 2011. Crowds gathered in Cairo and other cities demanding political change. The movement led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, who had led the country for 30 years. In 2012, elections were held and Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, became president. One year later, in July 2013, Mr. Morsi was forced out of office and the military took control of the government. dr. Brown: If you go back to February 2011 and the forced departure of Hosni Mubarak, there seemed to be a consensus among all the main political forces about how to proceed. The problem was that that consensus obscured some very deep ideological divisions, and there were some fundamental mistakes made by each political force early on that aggravated those divisions. The most important mistake was to allow absolute, short-term power to the Egyptian military, a military that had very little political experience and probably little interest in the democratic transition. That set off deep suspicions and rivalries. Those have only worsened, to the point that now Egypt's political differences seem unbridgeable. There is no generally accepted process for coming to terms with, managing, or negotiating them, unlike in Tunisia. When elections were held after Mubarak's ouster, it turned out that Islamist political forces (most notably the Muslim Brotherhood) who wanted a stronger role for religion in public life could win any time Egyptians went to the polls. But after winning elections, the Islamists found that it was very difficult for them to govern. Egypt had a state apparatus that just wasn't used to Islamist leadership, and some parts of the apparatus went beyond unresponsive to active hostility. That system came crashing down this past summer in large demonstrations and a military coup. In its place is a system in which all the state institutions that threw out the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist rule are now asserting control for themselves. Most observers outside the country, and some inside, see that what is emerging in Egypt is a period of renewed authoritarianism\u2014a consolidation of essentially unaccountable state structures dominating Egyptian political life. The only question is whether it will be a stable or unstable authoritarianism. dr. m arshall: I think we are seeing a return to the politics of the 1990s, with arbitrary arrests of both religious and secular activists, car bombings and other forms of random violence, and a new level of vitriol and conspiracy in public rhetoric. Unfortunately the spiral into violence in Egypt following the military coup in July 2013 was utterly predictable. Supporters of President Morsi justifiably felt that their electoral victory had been forcibly discarded by an unelected military authority, and their demands that Morsi be reinstated were met with lethal crackdowns that killed hundreds. The FJP\u2014the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2014did overreach, and Morsi's attempts to consolidate power and institute a restrictive religious code alienated many Egyptians. Some now embrace the military-backed interim government as the lesser TUNISIA LIBYAEGYPTLEBANON JORDANSYRIAgwmagazine.com / 49 of two evils. One bright spot is the draft constitution, which is an improvement in many ways, especially with regards to women's rights and protections for religious minorities. However, it still grants sweeping immunity to the military, which is especially troubling as the military is also the key power behind the current government. Libya The government of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya was often considered to be one of the most brutal and repressive in the region. Following air strikes by an international coalition and a popular uprising led by Libyan rebels, Mr. Gadhafi's regime fell in late-2011 and he was executed, bringing an end to 40-plus years in power. amb. Gnehm: Libya began as an uprising of people against a dictator, Gadhafi. But what re-emerged in Libya was the historic split between the eastern and western parts of the country. That has been compounded in the way the opposition to Gadhafi developed. Many militias were centered in towns or geographic regions, and they rose up in very disparate ways to fight against the regime. The new government, which came into power after the Gadhafi regime collapsed, has not been able to establish itself in a strong way. The various militias continue to keep the country fragmented. dr. Marshall: Early on, there was a great deal of optimism about what would prevail in Libya one or two years down the road, as the country possesses natural resource wealth and a well-educated and relatively homogenous population. For the most part, I think this optimism was misplaced. Although the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] air strikes were decisive in bringing down Gadhafi, the protracted conflict and influx of weapons built up the power of local militias. The new government has attempted to integrate these groups into the formal security apparatus of the state, but their loyalties lie with their individual commanders, not the central government. There have been small victories: Pro- testers in the capital managed to push out some powerful militias, and some oil ports are up and running. Implementation of the recent law that forbids anyone who served in Gadhafi's government from holding office in the new government has also not been very strict\u2014which is fortunate. A similar de-Baathification policy in postwar Iraq made rebuilding there very difficult. Syria What began as relatively peaceful protests against the Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria has rapidly descended into civil war. Now entering its third year, the violent conflict has seen more than 100,000 casualties and has displaced millions. The conflict shows no sign of ending, and the Assad regime remains in power. dr. brown: What initially looked to be a peaceful uprising against an authoritarian government gradually transformed itself into a sectarian struggle between the country's Sunni majority and a variety of other groups, and the Sunni population became increasingly radicalized. Outside actors, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, and to a lesser extent some of the Western powers, internationalized the crisis by supporting one side of the conflict or the other. Because of the nature of the violence, Syria appears to be deeply entrenched in a civil war with no obvious political solution in sight. Any kind of compromised political solution that involves al-Assad leaving power just does not seem likely. amb. Gnehm: In Syria, the government of Bashar al-Assad decided to use brutal force to put down peaceful street demonstrations. This created more radical and militaristic reactions to the government amongst the opposition. The fighting in Syria has led to more than 130,000 deaths. Forty percent of Syrians are either refugees outside their country or have been displaced internally. The resistance itself is fragmented. The government is capable of remaining in power but not of completely suppressing the resistance. The resistance is strong enough to continue to fight but not strong enough to actually overthrow the government. There's really a feeling in Syria that this civil war is not going to be resolved anytime soon.\"noW eGypT's po LiTica L diFFerences seeM Unbrid Geab Le. There is no Genera LLy accep Ted process For co MinG To TerM s WiT h, Mana GinG, or magazine / Spring 2014Lebanon Lebanon has seen a tremendous influx of refugees since the start of the conflict in Syria. This increase demand on Lebanese resources\u2014as well as outside pressures from around the region\u2014creates a difficult situation in the country. amb. Gnehm: Lebanon has been fragile since the end of its civil war in 1990. We are now seeing a number of external factors at play in Lebanon, which is putting stress on an already vulnerable system. There is an influx of refugees, especially coming from Syria. There is regional Sunni anger at the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which has been involved in helping Shia fight against the Sunnis in Syria. This has led to reprisals within Lebanon in the form of bombings and assassinations. These external interventions are exacerbating internal political problems. The anxiety in Lebanon today is quite high that the situation could collapse and the country could descend back into a civil war. Yemen Yemen is a country in turmoil, as it had been for years prior to the Arab Spring. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president, relinquished power in early 2012. The interim government remains weak and does not control much of the country. amb. Gnehm: The Arab Spring largely focused on then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Following his resignation, there was an international effort to broker a transition for the interim president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who is now in office. A national dialogue called for the factions to come together to develop a plan for the way forward. In doing so, they had to deal not only with the former regime and its forces but an insurrection in the north of the Shia population against the central government. That has been largely a religious issue. Then in the south there is a separatist movement, where individuals are fighting to establish their own state\u2014a breakup of Yemen into north and south. These are major issues that have not yet been reconciled, though there has been some progress. In addition to internal fighting, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, a branch of the al-Qaida terrorist network, is fighting against the Yemeni government. There have been a large number of bombings, assassinations, and disruptions of oil exports. It's a very unstable situation in a highly populated country that is strategically located on a major waterway between the Suez Canal and Asia. dr. Marshall: Under the previous president, resources and influence in Yemen were essentially handed out by the central government in exchange for political support. It now seems that the population is cohering around the political networks that the government used to distribute that patronage. The weakening of the central government\u2014and likely the impact of the U.S. drone campaign in Yemen\u2014has fed into a resurgence of the grievances that divided the country in the past, when north and south Yemen were unified in 1990 following a civil war. These grievances are being exploited both by religious extremists and neighboring states to foment violence and discord, which is truly tragic. Gulf Monarchies Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have seen a range of activity from their populations. Some countries have had relatively large protests while others have faced smaller ones. Bahrain remains the notable exception to how the monarchies have responded to regional conflicts around them. amb. Gnehm: The situation in Bahrain is different among the other five Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The issues are demographics and power: Seventy percent of the population is Shia and 30 percent Sunni, but the government\u2014including the monarchy, the intelligence services, and the military\u2014is dominated by the Sunni minority. So calls for political reform by the Shia threaten the Sunni establishment. This has led to concern from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states because they see Iran as behind any Shia uprisings in the region. This fear led the Saudis to send troops to support the Bahraini government. Protests continue in Bahrain without resolution, and that creates a dilemma for the United States. We have had good relations with Bahrain for decades and it is the home port for our naval presence in the Persian Gulf. dr. brown: Early on in 2011, Bahrain looked like it might be following the Egyptian and Tunisian path toward a new government, or at least a reformed one. However, the Bahraini monarchy was essentially able to retain power due to a Sunni-Shia division \"vioLence is noT a si Gn oF sTaTe sTren GTh. iT's a si Gn o F sTaTe Weakness, a si Gn ThaT The exis TinG sys TeM is no LonG er viab Le.\" \u2014shana Marshall gwmagazine.com / 51within Bahraini society. You've got an entrenched authoritarian rule there. Kuwait has been surprisingly lively and there's a stronger sense of national unity, though that has frayed a little since 2011. Kuwait has political rivalries that appear intense, but they are kept peaceful and within bounds. In Kuwait, there are some long-term trends that will have resulted in a little bit freer and a more permissive political system than others in the region. Saudi Arabia, to me, is a big question mark. There have been fundamental social changes going on inside Saudi Arabia that are virtually invisible to outsiders. If you look at the big political picture, which basically has remained unchanged, the Saudi ruling family has kept all political authority within its hands. But with the types of social change being seen in Saudi Arabia comes greater political awareness, newly articulate groups, and much more ideological diversity than has previously been seen in the kingdom. Whether that social change is going to translate into political change anytime soon is anybody's guess. dr. Marshall: In most of the Gulf monarchies\u2014Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar\u2014there is a type of social contract in place: The government uses its natural-resource wealth to subsidize consumption, and state subjects agree not to rock the boat. But when activists in neighboring states demonstrated that they possess real power to influence government, this threatened the concept that opposition to the regime is futile and the costs of repression overwhelming. The Gulf monarchies responded very early on with a combination of new subsidies, including large state-mandated wage increases, housing vouchers, and expansions in funding for health care and education in an attempt to preempt the spread of protests. Where these programs didn't quell opposition, such as in Bahrain, they sent in troops. But violence is not a sign of state strength. It's a sign of state weakness, a sign that the existing system is no longer viable. Bahrain will have to fundamentally alter its governing structure and allow the Shia majority to have a greater formal role in governing. Qatar is also an interesting case, because the Qatari government has been traditionally viewed as much more moderate and open to transparent forms of government than the other Gulf monarchies. However, early on in the Arab Spring the Qatari government was the source of, or at least perceived to be the source of, a lot of funding for conservative religious groups fighting in Libya and Syria as well as the government of Mohammed Morsi in Egypt. This has led to quite a bit of resentment and anger at the Qataris throughout the region. The Qatari government has definitely gotten the message and seems to be refocusing on domestic politics and withdrawing from the regional diplomatic position that it had forged during the early days of the Arab Spring. Jordan Jordan has long been seen as one of the region's relatively moderate countries. In 2011 it saw a burst of activism seeking change, which has since calmed. amb. Gnehm: Jordan has been more stable than other countries in the region. There are many people in Jordan who would like to see political reform, but they are hesitant today to push for change. This is partly because the population looks around and sees the chaos in Egypt and the enormous loss of life in the civil war in Syria; they see the ongoing fighting next to them in the western part of Iraq. Basically, they want to keep that kind of violence and instability out of their country. So they have been willing to tolerate their domestic political situation for the time being. Palestinian Territories While Palestinians face economic difficulties and political stalemate, much of the political focus has been on creating an independent state. dr. brown: The odd thing about what has been happening in the Palestinian Territories is that nothing has been happening. Elsewhere in the Arab world regimes have fallen, popular mobilization has surged, and there are long-standing rulers who suddenly felt deeply threatened. Palestinians\u2014who historically have been the Arab world's most highly politicized population, the most willing to take political action\u2014have been quiescent. That stems from an underlying despair in Palestinian political life. For a long time Palestinian politics has been led by movements that have had at their core the promise of building some kind of Palestinian state. Those movements are still there, but they don't seem to have any viable project leading toward the accomplishment of any national objective anymore. How Will History Look Back Upon the Arab Spring? dr. brown: I think that 2011 will be seen as a turning point in which politics that dominated the Arab world and Arab political systems for two or three decades showed that it was in crisis and could not deliver. But whether the old order will completely collapse, whether it will be able to reassert itself, whether there will be some kind of gradual reform, whether there will be some instances of political decay, that is still not clear yet. amb. Gnehm: In the short term, over the next four to 10 years, it's going to look bad in the region. But I think that over a longer period of time the issues that sparked the uprisings in 2011 are fundamentally important to the people in the region, and the Arab Spring will actually end up being a very positive development. dr. Marshall: I think the Arab Spring will be seen in a positive light. However, I think that positive perception will take maybe a decade or two decades to coalesce. I think if we went back and looked at the proximate media coverage and academic theorizing of the third wave of democratization that took place in Latin America and Asia, we would see similar pessimism. I think ultimately the Arab Spring will be viewed as a real example of the power of individuals to demand change from their governments. I think that the ultimate outcome will leave the people of the region with governments that are more representative and more accountable than they previously were.52 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 inset: willia M a tkins / o pposite: courtesy tho Mas Buer GenthalA Lucky Child GW La W professor Thomas Buer GenThaL rose from T he ashes of T he hoL ocaus T To Become an archi TecT of in Terna Tiona L human ri GhT s LaW. By Jamie L. Freedman The word \"lucky\" is rarely uttered in the same breath as \"Auschwitz.\" But GW Law professor Thomas Buergenthal, one of the youngest survivors of the notorious Nazi concentration camp, indeed considers himself a lucky man. Repeatedly slipping the grasp of certain death, he emerged from the horrors of the Holocaust at the age of 10 to become one of the world's leading experts on international and human rights law. It is \"only natural\" that he opted to dedicate his life to preventing human rights abuses, says Mr. Buergenthal, who returned to GW as an endowed professor in 2010 after leaving to serve for a decade on the United Nations' International Court of Justice, in The Hague. \"I grew up in the camps\u2014I knew no other life\u2014and my sole objective was to stay alive, from hour to hour, from day to day,\" he explains in the preface to his powerful memoir, A Lucky Child , published in 2007. \"It equipped me to be a better human rights lawyer, if only because I understood, not only intellectually but also emotionally, what it is like to be a victim of human rights violations. I could, after all, feel it in my bones.\" \"I knew what it was to be a victim of human rights violations and wanted to work for a world in which the rights and dignity of human beings everywhere would be protected,\" says Mr. Buergenthal. In September he was awarded the law school's inaugural Dean's Medallion, GW and Thomas\u2014in 1937 in czechoslovakia.54 / gw magazine / Spring 2014A Child of the Holocaust By the time 10-year-old \"Tommy\" Buergenthal was sent to Auschwitz in August 1944, he already knew the tricks of survival. On the run with his mother, Gerda, a German Jew, and father, Mundek, a Polish Jew, since the age of 4, he had witnessed unimaginable atrocities in his young life. The nightmare began in 1938, when the local fascist party confiscated the Buergenthal family's hotel in Lubochna, Czechoslovakia. They fled to Poland, where they eventually acquired prized visas to enter England as political refugees. On Sept. 1, 1939, the day they were scheduled to depart for England, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. The Buergenthals boarded a train headed for the Balkans but jumped off when German planes began dropping bombs overhead. For the next several years they were confined to the Jewish ghetto of Kielce, Poland, where residents suffered frequent Nazi raids and beatings. After the ghetto was liquidated in August 1942\u2014and the majority of its 20,000 inhabitants massacred at the Treblinka concentration camp\u2014the Buergenthals spent two years in labor camps before being deported to Auschwitz in August 1944. Upon their arrival Tommy and Mundek were separated from Gerda, who was sent to the women's camp. \"I was lucky to get into Auschwitz,\" Mr. Buergenthal reflected during a July interview in his GW office overlooking the University Yard. \"Most people who arrived at the Auschwitz-Birkenau rail platform had to undergo a so-called selection,\" he explains, \"where the children, elderly, and invalids were taken directly to the gas chambers.\" But there was no selection process when his train pulled in. The Nazi SS officers, he says, assumed that since the prisoners were coming from a work camp the children had already been eliminated. \"Had there been a selection, I would have been killed before ever making it into the camp,\" Mr. Buergenthal says. Surviving was no less horrific. In his memoir, Mr. Buergenthal recalls being assigned to a barracks so close to the gas chambers at Auschwitz that his sleep was frequently interrupted by screams and pleas for help. To cope, he would tell himself that it was only a nightmare. It was also at Auschwitz that he was torn away from his father in October 1944 during one of the selections. It was the last time they saw each other. Eluding death time and again, Mr. Buergenthal remained at Auschwitz until January 1945, when the Nazis\u2014on the edge of defeat\u2014evacuated the camp, forcing the \"half-starved and dying\" prisoners to endure a three-day \"death march\" through the frozen Polish countryside. \"The roads were covered with snow and ice,\" he recalls, \"and those who could not go on ... were shot by the SS guards, who kicked their bodies into a nearby ditch.\" One of three children to survive the march, he was next herded with other prisoners onto open freight cars, without food or water, for a frigid 10-day journey to Germany, and ultimately the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. \"As the train moved slowly through Czechoslovakia, men, women, and children standing on bridges threw us loaves of bread,\" he says. \"Had it not been for that Czech bread, we would have starved to death.\" By the time he arrived at Sachsenhausen, he was suffering from such severe frostbite that two of his toes were amputated. Finally, in April 1945, the camp was liberated by Polish and Russian troops, and he was free. \"A Polish army company took me with them as their 'mascot' because I had nowhere else to go,\" he says. \"They made me a small uniform and gave me a pair of shoes, a pistol, and a pony. I had a wonderful time with them, filled with adventures.\" Upon discovering that the 11-year-old was Jewish, one of the soldiers found a place for him at a Jewish orphanage, which, he says, served as \"a halfway point from one life to another.\" A year after arriving at the orphanage, he received the miraculous news that his mother was alive and had tracked him down. After nearly two and a half years apart, mother and son were reunited in December 1946 and settled in Goettinger, Germany, his mother's hometown. His father, he later learned, was executed by the Nazis at another camp, Buchenwald, in the final days of the war. \"Somehow, I knew that she had survived and that she would find me,\" he says. Gerda Buergenthal was equally certain that her son was alive, despite the fact that her friends tried to convince her there was no way such a young child could have survived Auschwitz. \"She refused to give up hope,\" Mr. Buergenthal says. One of the things that kept her going was the prediction of a fortune-teller she'd visited in Poland just before the war started. \"She told my mother that terrible things would happen to our family, but that her son was a 'lucky child' who would emerge unscathed from the future that awaited us,\" he says. Six decades later, that phrase became the title of his book. Once the two were reunited, Mr. Buergenthal turned his attention to making up for the many years of education he'd lost. \"When I arrived at the orphanage, I did not know how to read or write,\" he says. He was tutored privately for a year before beginning his formal education in seventh grade. \"I always tell my daughters-in-law not to worry if the children miss a few days of school, because I lost seven years of school and it didn't stop me from becoming a lawyer,\" he says. Protecting Human Rights Internationally In 1951, at the age of 17, Mr. Buergenthal set sail for America in search of greater academic opportunities. After finishing high school in New Jersey, where he lived with his uncle and aunt, he attended Bethany College in West Virginia on a full scholarship, graduating summa cum laude. He applied to law school \"partly because my father had attended law school in Poland and partly because I realized I would never become a doctor or scientist,\" he says. After earning his law degree at New York University and a master of laws and doctor of juridical science in international law at Harvard University, he turned his attention to the fledgling field of international human rights law. \"When I was a child, there was no such thing as international protection of human rights,\" he says. \"I have always believed that if some of today's international organizations and laws were in place in the 1930s, we could have prevented many of the terrible things Hitler did. I knew what it was to be a victim of human rights violations and wanted to work for a world in which the rights and dignity of human beings everywhere would be protected.\" As one of the pioneering members of the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Justice in the 1980s, Mr. Buergenthal helped lay the foundation for the groundbreaking Latin American human rights tribunal. \"I look back on the court with special sentiment,\" says Mr. Buergenthal, who \"We interviewed the sole survivor of the El Mozote Massacre, in which 500 women and children were killed, and after the first few minutes of her testimony, I realized that I could have finished her story.\"gwmagazine.com / 55served for the maximum two terms and is the only U.S. judge ever to sit on the court. \"It was a dream come true to help establish a new court dedicated to strengthening the protection of human rights. We all felt like John Marshall!\" With Mr. Buergenthal as its president, the court rendered a landmark decision in 1988\u2014ordering the government of Honduras to compensate the families of \"forced disappearance\" victims kidnapped and murdered by government forces during that country's civil war. \"It was very satisfying work,\" he says. \"We had the sense that we had really achieved something.\" After Mr. Buergenthal completed his service on the Inter-American Court, the secretary-general of the United Nations appointed him to the three-member United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador, charged with investigating the massive human rights abuses committed during that country's 12-year civil war. Memories of his past came pouring back as he \"interviewed witnesses, heard their stories, and inspected the killing fields,\" he says. \"We interviewed the sole survivor of the El Mozote Massacre, in which 500 women and children were killed, and after the first few minutes of her testimony, I realized that I could have finished her story.\" While building an international reputation on the bench, he also became an influential scholar. In 1973 Mr. Buergenthal co-authored the first American casebook on international human rights law, International Protection of Human Rights . Written with Louis B. Sohn, his mentor at Harvard who eventually joined him at GW, this pivotal text introduced human rights law into the curricula of law schools nationwide. Mr. Buergenthal launched the international law program at American University's Washington College of Law, where he served as dean from 1980 to 1985, and worked closely with former President Jimmy Carter as the director of the Human Rights Program at the Carter Center of Emory University from 1985 to 1989. At GW Law Mr. Buergenthal spent a decade as the Lobingier Professor of Comparative Law and Jurisprudence, leading up to his election to the International Court of Justice, in The Hague, where he served as the American judge from 2000 to 2010. The principal judicial organ of the United Nations, with jurisdiction over disputes between states, the court determines \"what is and what is not international law,\" Mr. Buergenthal says. \"It is a dream court for international lawyers\u2014comparable to serving on the Supreme Court of the United States.\"It also, after 10 years, was a long way from family for Mr. Buergenthal and his wife, Peggy. \"We wanted to enjoy our grandchildren and for them to know us,\" he says. In 2010 Mr. Buergenthal returned to his chair at GW Law. Recalling fondly his time at the university, he says, \"there was no reason to go anywhere else.\" Sean Murphy, GW's Patricia Roberts Harris Research Professor of Law, calls his longtime international law colleague a treasure. \"I doubt most of our students know there is only one school in our entire country that boasts a full-time faculty member who is a former ICJ judge, and that school is in Foggy Bottom,\" he says. \"Tom has been a centerpiece of our international law program for many years. Even before he served on the International Court of Justice, he brought into the classroom an enormous range of scholarly and practical achievement.\" Mr. Buergenthal's career \"is inseparable from the emergence after World War II of the new field of human rights law,\" Mr. Murphy says. \"... There will always be more work to be done, but without people like Tom, we would still be in the Dark Ages.\" With the publishing of his Holocaust memoir in 2007, Mr. Buergenthal's influence has reached beyond the bench and outside the classroom to audiences across the globe. First published in Germany, A Lucky Child \u2014which Mr. Buergenthal wrote in English\u2014has already been translated into 14 languages. \"It has been published in all the major European countries, as well as Japan, Brazil, and Indonesia,\" he says. The book spent weeks on the best-seller list in Germany. And although publishers in the United States and England initially told him that \"Holocaust books don't sell,\" he says, the English paperback edition has been reprinted 15 times. He is now working on a sequel, incorporating the wealth of material that has surfaced in recent years documenting his mother's two-year search for him. And it was the search that marked the start of a wholly improbable happy ending\u2014their reunion was one of just a handful of moments that demanded he pause to collect himself when writing the 2007 book, while the rest of the story \"just flowed out of me,\" Mr. Buergenthal writes in the epilogue. Youth for the \"lucky child\" had been solely about survival, he writes. \"But once I was back in her arms, I could be a child again, leaving these worries and concerns to her.\" top eleven-year-old Thomas Buergenthal, six months after his liberation, with the Polish soldier who helped find him a place at a Jewish orphanage bottom mr.

The Oct. 29 panel discussion, \"A Conversation on Public Health and National Prosperity,\" was held at the Waldorf Astoria before an audience of more than 650 alumni, parents, and friends. The annual event, which offers speakers on a variety of topics, featured financier and philanthropist Mike Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute and FasterCures, and Lynn Goldman, dean of the GW School of Public Health and Health Services. Before they took the stage, Dr. Knapp told the audience that the discussion was part of an ongoing dialogue on campus regarding global public health. \"Chronic diseases are now encroaching on the lives of our children and threatening social and economic progress around the world,\" Dr. Knapp said. \"Tonight's discussion Ben solo Monphilanthropist Mike Milken joined GW's Lynn Goldman in new y ork to discuss public health and national prosperity.alumni news gwmagazine.com / 61 top: Ben s olo Mon / B otto M: courtesy u.s. state depart Mentwill provide an example of how we and our partners are addressing those issues.\" Milken began his presentation at a macro level, zooming out the lens from the issues of obesity and chronic diseases to the importance of capital markets in a global economy. In the summer of 1965, Milken was home in Los Angeles from his first year at University of California, Berkeley and witnessed the Watts riots. He realized then that the issue was about more than race. It was about \"access to capital as a civil right\u2014a chance to succeed based on your ability, not background.\" That chance came for many beginning in 1974, when the capital markets began to displace banks as a source of funding for small and medium businesses. However, in the 1980s, new laws began distorting the utility curve for many middle-class Americans, he said, and the American Dream became increasingly associated with home ownership. Today about 50 percent of U.S. middle- class consumer dollars go toward housing and transportation, he said. That is 25 times the 2 percent spent on supplemental education. Middle-class Asians, in contrast, allocate 15 percent of their consumer spending to tutoring and after-school education services. This matters, Milken said, because education builds human capital, the world's largest asset class. \"To invest in human capital, countries need to increase education and practical skills, import people with skills, and/or improve health and quality of life.\" Quality of life has direct implications on the global economy, he said. Over the past two centuries as much as 50 percent of all economic growth can be traced to advances in health. And yet more than 90 percent of health spending is dedicated to treatment, versus less than 10 percent spent on research and prevention combined.According to Milken, eradicating chronic diseases through research and prevention is where the United States and global health organizations need to focus money and effort. Obesity, for instance, which has ballooned in the United States over the past two decades, is linked to many chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and depression. From an economic standpoint, Milken noted that \"failure to address chronic diseases adequately costs the U.S. more than $1 trillion annually.\" Dr. Goldman joined Milken on stage and reiterated the importance of prevention and wellness in keeping people healthy. She highlighted the work her school is doing locally and nationally, citing research conducted that offers activity guidelines for children and families struggling with obesity. The two also discussed the lower health care costs that would result from significant weight loss nationwide. And at the center of these conversations guiding global economic and health decisions is GW. Major public and private health organizations are convening at SPHHS and collaborating to solve some of the biggest issues facing the nation and the world. \"The country's commitment to the biosciences brought people to Washington for the Milken Institute's 2012 Celebration of Science,\" Milken said. \"And now it's time to focus that commitment on GW.\" \"It's quite possible,\" he added, \"that a GW diploma will be the most valuable in the world.\" After the panel, alumni like Madeleine Rumely, BA '07, reconnected with old friends over food and drinks and met new people. \"To come here and see the international perspective, the health perspective, the financial perspective\u2014and then to also see so many other alumni in the middle of New York City at a wonderful venue is a great opportunity,\" she said. \"It can't be missed!\" Madeleine r umely, ba '07 (right), chats with fellow attendees of the oct. 29 reception at new york's Waldorf a storia.alumna named deputy secretary of state George Washington University alumna Heather Higginbottom, MA '99, has been named the U.S. deputy secretary of state for management and resources. She is the first woman to hold the position. Ms. Higginbottom was sworn in on Jan. 30, after being nominated by President Barack Obama in September and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in December. In the position, she shares in the global responsibilities for U.S. foreign policy, and has broad management and programmatic oversight responsibilities for both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Ms. Higginbottom began working for Secretary of State John Kerry in 1999, while he was serving as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She handled domestic policy as his legislative assistant and, later, legislative director. She also worked as Mr. Kerry's deputy national policy director during his presidential campaign. She later founded the American Security Project, a national security think tank. In 2007, Ms. Higginbottom served as policy director for Mr. Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign and supervised all aspects of his policy development. After the election, Ms. Higginbottom worked as deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. She advised Mr. Obama on education, immigration, and economic development issues, and helped design the Race to the Top and Promise Neighborhoods programs. She has been called one of Mr. Obama's \"big thinkers\" on health care, according to The Washington Post . Mr. Kerry hired Ms. Higginbottom as counselor in 2013. alumni news 62 / gw magazine / Spring 2014 Auto insurance as special as your alma mater.

They were excited to see their first GW home and meet the students who were now creating big memories in a room with little closets. Their love for GW was clear as they talked about the people they met, the classes that challenged them, and the lessons they took from campus to the workplace. Since my first semester in Thurston, alumni have played a significant role in my GW experience\u2014providing internship opportunities, advising my sorority, and helping me craft a professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Now as a member of the alumni community myself, supporting students is a priority and what led me to serve with the GW Alumni Association as the vice president for student-alumni initiatives. The GWAA and GW's global network of alumni work to enhance the student experience from Colonial Inauguration to commencement. Incoming freshmen share dinner with alumni on the first night of CI and may attend a Summer Send-Off hosted by a proud alum before packing up for freshman year. The Dinner With Alumni series allows small groups of students to share a meal with an alum to swap stories about the GW experience. Alumni also support students' career interests by attending Speed Networking Nights to help students connect with professionals, and leading \"How Do I Become A ...\" lectures to highlight careers such as Major League Baseball scout, CIA operative, or campaign manager. There is a way for every alum to help improve the student experience and help create an #OnlyAtGW moment. In March 2013, the GWAA partnered with the Student Association to host the first Student-Alumni Day of Service. Nearly 75 students and alumni spent a day doing direct service at four area nonprofits\u2014each organization had a GW alum serving in a paid or volunteer leadership role. This day of serving side by side allowed alumni and students to connect in a casual way and grow their GW networks. During the 2013 Student-Alumni Day of Service, I spent time with a bright, outgoing, and fun undergraduate student who shared my interest in public health. Starting in January this student will join my office as an intern, and I'm thrilled to add more buff and blue to the department. We invite you to join us in reaching and supporting students throughout the year. Events focused on developing career skills, service projects, and supporting GW athletics occur year-round and offer an exciting opportunity for students and alumni alike. Go Colonials!

Part of the La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, and the Organization of Latin American Students, Mr. Rodas kept a rigorous schedule throughout his four years. When he headed north after graduation for law school at Rutgers-Newark, he found himself looking for a way to stay involved but without a lot of extra time on his hands. So when Mr. Rodas, who lives in Union City, N.J., with his wife, Elizabeth, heard that GW was looking for volunteers to help plan the Class of 2008's five-year reunion, he knew it was the right fit. \"I thought it would be a great way to get involved, especially since I couldn't participate in other activities while in law school,\" he says. Soon Mr. Rodas found himself calling in to reunion committee meetings, giving input VOLUNTEER PROFILE on event details, and writing about other volunteers for the reunion newsletter. He also helped spread the word about Alumni Weekend 2013 by talking to friends and encouraging others to attend the reunion. After putting in so much time and energy, Mr. Rodas was ready to return to campus and reconnect with classmates. But something unexpected happened once he arrived. \"I knew I would come back and see people at the reunion,\" he explains. \"But what was great is that I saw friends everywhere\u2014not even just from my class, but a lot of other people I hadn't seen in a long time.\" Through his friend Eric Gutierrez, BBA '06, MTA '11, the assistant director for affinity outreach in GW's Office of Alumni Relations, Mr. Rodas learned about several events taking place that weekend, including the Alumni in Energy Association launch and the LGBT Alumni Association reception. \"I met so many new people and learned about these other alumni communities,\" Mr. Rodas says. \"Not only did I come back to revisit GW, but I was able to reach out to different parts of the community that I hadn't when I was an undergrad.\" Today, he keeps busy by running the Law Office of Rudy A. Rodas LLC, the immigration law practice he founded after graduating from law school. He also does of counsel work for the Consulate General of Colombia in Newark, N.J. While running his firm takes up much of Mr. Rodas's time, he says he's glad he made time to volunteer for his reunion committee. \"It's important to stay involved in the GW legacy,\" he says, \"because the only way to make a difference is by having a voice.\" For more about a lumni Weekend volunteer opportunities, visit alumni.gwu.edu/alumniweekend. rudy rodas, bba '08, got involved by helping to plan his class' five-year reunion. alumni r elations official Leaves strong Legacy GW Associate Vice President of Alumni Relations Adrienne Rulnick retired in December, stepping down from the position she had held since 2007. Dr. Rulnick, whom the alumni association awarded the special designation of \"honorary alumna,\" began her tenure at GW on the same day as President Steven Knapp. She recalls that on that first day, Dr. Knapp shared his vision of \"cultivating a lifelong and worldwide community of GW alumni.\" Dr. Rulnick stepped up to the challenge throughout her six years at GW. She established many engaging programs and signature events, including Alumni Weekend, which brings thousands of alumni back to campus each year to reconnect with the university. Other notable milestones achieved during Dr. Rulnick's service include: Creating the Women & Philanthropy Forum, an annual event that highlights the adrienne r ulnick with p resident k napp at her retirement celebration in n ovembercritical role that women play in enhancing human welfare through visionary philanthropy. Establishing more than 60 alumni networks in the United States and across the globe that host programs and events, including George's Birthday Bash and Summer Send-Offs. Enhancing the GW alumni career services program, which includes one of the largest university LinkedIn networks. GW now offers a robust array of virtual and in-person career networking events to provide job postings, advice, and valuable Colonial-to-Colonial mentoring opportunities. Expanding networking and programming opportunities for a variety of affinities and interests: black alumni, Latino alumni, Asian-American alumni, veterans, the Green Alumni Network, LGBT alumni, and athletic alumni. Dr. Rulnick's accomplishments were celebrated both by the university and the George Washington Alumni Association in November.

Now Paul Shapiro, BA '01, is operating on a national scale, as vice president for farm animal protection at the national nonprofit Humane Society of the United States. \"This is my life's work,\" he says.And unlike the challenges for him as a teenage vegetarian in the early 1990s\u2014when meatless diets were a \"foreign concept\" in the United States, he says\u2014Mr. Shapiro now has prominent company at the table. Rapper Jay-Z made news in December, when he and his wife, Beyonc\u00e9, announced a trial vegan diet. \"And people like Al Gore and Bill Clinton are nearly vegan and are talking about the benefits of plant-based eating,\" Mr. Shapiro says. (Vegans typically avoid using products derived from animals.) \"Meat consumption has declined 10 percent in just six years, since 2007,\" he says, \"and because of that, the number of animals being raised for food is hundreds of millions fewer than just six years ago.\" From his time at GW, where he majored in peace studies and minored in religion, Mr. Shapiro says he remains inspired by the work of professors David DeGrazia and the late Harry Yeide. Dr. DeGrazia is professor of philosophy and a senior research fellow in bioethics at the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Yeide was a professor of religion. Each \"had a pretty substantial influence on my views, even outside animal issues,\" especially Dr. Yeide and his knowledge of \"traditional religious advocacy.\" Mr. Shapiro learned that \"many of the abolitionists were religious. In the 19th century, advocates were cognizant about slavery\u2014and about poverty, women's equality, prison reform, and animal cruelty. \"A lot of abolitionists started animal protection groups,\" he says. Likewise, Mr. Shapiro had wanted \"to bear witness to how we treat our fellow animals, to transform our relationship with other animals.\" Referring to \"other animals\" denotes his vision of a planet on which \"animals are no longer [seen] as a commodity to be exploited but as individuals who are to be respected, and to avoid suffering.\" In January 2005 he joined the Humane Society of the United States, billed as the nation's largest animal protection group, which is headquartered just off GW's Foggy Bottom Campus. (The HSUS is a national organization, and not affiliated with local humane societies.) \"Without a doubt we're making progress,\" he says, but \"not enough.\" \"When I graduated there were zero states that had passed laws [about farm animal protection]. Now there are nine states.\" And, he says, \"we've persuaded many of the biggest food retailers, who are now mandating animal-welfare improvements to their suppliers.\" That makes some meat producers unhappy, according to a December article in Rolling Stone that reports \"Big Meat\" producers have \"declared jihad on the Humane Society.\" Despite detractors, though, Mr. Shapiro remains vocal. \"My voice is basically trying to halt the war we wage on animals. Most farm animals are tormented their entire lives,\" he says. \"Many are locked in cages so small they can hardly move.\" In Mr. Shapiro's own home, not surprisingly, the conditions for cats Calvin, Emma, and Sam are much more comfortable, for the cats and for others. \"I built them a 'catio'\u2014a screened-in enclosure outside my bedroom window\u2014where they can enjoy watching the birds without attacking them.\" \u2014J. Ford h uffman Giving GW Freemasons pledge Funds A Masonic lodge founded by GW alumni has pledged a portion of its membership dues to the Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library. Members of the Colonial Lodge No. 1821 in December signed a memorandum of understanding and wrote into their bylaws the annual contribution of 10 percent of members' dues in support of the library. \"We're honored and humbled to receive this thoughtful and generous donation from the Colonial Lodge No. 1821,\" says University Librarian and Vice Provost for Libraries Geneva Henry. \"This gift will provide and promote new resources for the students, faculty, and staff of the GW community and support the creation of information in diverse formats.\" Lodge Co-Founder and Secretary Morgan Corr, BA '07, says the commitment was a way to honor the history of Freemasonry at the university, which began with its namesake. \"The whole allegory of Masonry is focused on dispensing light, with light being a metaphor for knowledge,\" he says. \"There is no better place for us to support that part of our mission and the mission of the university than through the library.\" \u2014brittney d unkins For more about colonial Lodge 1821 visit thecoloniallodge.org.
