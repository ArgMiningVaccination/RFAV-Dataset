There are 4 ways to take (measure) a temperature: under the armpit (axillary method), in the mouth (oral method), in the ear (tympanic method) and in the rectum/bum (rectal method). Safe and accurate temperature taking is important especially in young children. For more information, see [HealthLinkBC File #99 How to Take a Temperature: Children and Adults](/healthlinkbc-files/how-take-temperature-children-and-adults), or visit [Caring for Kids - Fever and temperature taking](https://www.caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/fever_and_temperature_taking). If your child has a fever, home treatment can include giving over the counter medication such as acetaminophen, to help lower their temperature. The amount of medication to give depends on the age and weight of your child. If you have questions about taking a temperature, body temperatures or fever, speak with your health care provider or call 8-1-1 to speak with a nurse or pharmacist. Our nurses are available anytime, every day of the year, and our pharmacists are available every night from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. Topic Overview Fever is the body's normal and healthy reaction to infection and other illnesses, both minor and serious. Fevers help the body fight infection. Fever is a symptom, not a disease. In most cases, fever means your child has a minor illness. Often you must look at your child's other symptoms to determine how serious the illness is. Although it may be scary when your child's temperature es up, fever is not harmful. Normal body temperature The average normal body temperature taken orally is about 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). It usually rises during the day from a low of 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F) in the morning to a high of 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) in the late afternoon. Each child has a normal temperature range that may be different from another child's. Mild increases to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) can be caused by exercising, wearing too many clothes, taking a hot bath, or being outside in hot weather. Fever Temperature varies depending on how you take it. The most common ways to measure it are: - Under the tongue. - In the armpit. - In the rectum. - In the ear. Some methods may not be as reliable or accurate as others. For information about taking accurate temperatures, see the topic [Body Temperature](/tests-treatments-medications/medical-tests/body-temperature). If you think your child has a fever but you are not able to measure his or her temperature, it is important to look for other symptoms of illness. Children tend to run higher fevers than adults. The degree of fever may not indicate how serious your child's illness is. With a minor illness, such as a cold, a child may have an oral temperature of 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), while a very serious infection may not cause a fever or may cause only a mild fever. With many illnesses, a fever temperature can up and down very quickly and often, so be sure to look for other symptoms along with the fever. Babies with a fever often have an infection caused by a virus, such as a cold or influenza (flu). Infections caused by bacteria, such as a urinary infection or bacterial pneumonia, also can cause a fever. Babies younger than 3 months should be seen by a doctor anytime they have a fever because they can get extremely sick quickly. A fever in a healthy child is usually not dangerous, especially if the child does not have other symptoms and the fever es away in 3 days. Most children who have a fever will be fussy and play less and may not eat as much as usual. High fevers may make your child uncomfortable, but they rarely cause serious problems. There is no medical evidence that fevers from infection cause brain damage. The body limits a fever caused by infection from rising above 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F) orally. But outside heat\u2014such as from being in a car that is parked in the sun\u2014can cause body temperature to rise above 41.5\u00b0C (106.7\u00b0F), and brain damage can occur. Childhood immunizations can reduce the risk for fever-related illnesses, such as [Haemophilus influenzae type b](/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b) (Hib) infection. Although no vaccine is 100% effective, most routine childhood immunizations are effective for 85% to 95% of the children who receive them. For more information, see the topic [Immunizations](/health-topics/immunizations). Causes of fever It is not unusual for a preschool-aged child to have 7 to 10 viral infections in a year. Each new viral infection may cause a fever. It may seem that a fever is oning, but if 48 hours pass between fevers, then the new fever is most likely from a new illness. Common causes of fever include: - [Viral infections](/viral-infection), such as colds, [flu](/influenza-flu), and as a [urinary tract infection](/urinary-tract-infection-uti-children). - [Immunizations](/health-topics/immunizations-may-cause-fever). Teething does not cause fever. If a baby is teething and has a fever, look for other symptoms that may need to be evaluated. A fever that increases quickly may lead to a [fever seizure](/fever-seizures) in some children. Fever seizures can be frightening to see, but they usually do not cause other problems, such as brain damage, [intellectual disability](/intellectual-disability), or learning problems. If your child has a high fever and a seizure, see the topic [Fever Seizures](/health-topics/fever-seizures). Low body temperature If a low body temperature is your child's only symptom, it is not something to worry about. If a low body temperature occurs with other symptoms, such as chills, shaking, breathing problems, or confusion, then this may be a sign of more serious illness. Low body temperature may occur from cold exposure, [shock](/shock-adults-and-older-children), alcohol or drug use, or certain metabolic disorders, such as [diabetes](/diabetes) or [hypothyroidism](/hypothyroidism). A low body temperature may also be present with an infection, particularly in newborns, older adults, or people who are frail. An overwhelming infection, such as [sepsis](/health-topics/sepsis-septic-shock), may also cause an abnormally low body temperature. [Check your child's symptoms](/illnesses-conditions/infectious-diseases/fever-or-chills-age-11-and-younger) to decide if and when your child should see a doctor. Check Your Symptoms The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. - If you are transgender or non-binary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you now have in the area where you are having symptoms. - If your symptoms aren't related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. - If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as \"male\" and once as \"female\"). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. [symptoms of shock](#tf6948)? [symptoms of or mild](#tf6938)? [baby in an [older child](#tf7088). [symptoms in a baby](#tf6938)are different an older child](#tf6960). [trouble breathing](#abj7487)? [clearing the nose a rubber bulb](#tf7185)may help. [severe, moderate, or mild](#tf6940)?

[severe, moderate, or mild](#tf6940)? [symptoms in a baby](#tf7103)are different than the [symptoms in an older child](#tf6965). [red or purple spots or bruises](#tf7111)appeared suddenly? [Signs of pain in a baby or toddler](#tf7019)are different than [signs of pain in an older child](#tf7096). [weakens his or her immune system](#tf6964)? [other symptoms of a more serious infection](#tf7198)? [how you took the temperature](#tf6957). [How high](#tf7100)do you think the fever is? [medicine](#tf7193)may be causing the fever? Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: - Your age. Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. - Your overall health. If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. - Medicines you take. Certain medicines, such as blood thinners (anticoagulants), medicines that suppress the immune system like steroids or chemotherapy, or natural health products can cause symptoms or make them worse. - Recent health events, such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. - Your health habits and lifestyle, such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel. Try Home Treatment You have answered all the questions. Based on your answers, you may be able to take care of this problem at home. - Try home treatment to relieve the symptoms. - Call your doctor if symptoms get worse or you have any concerns (for example, if symptoms are not getting better as you would expect). You may need care sooner. Babies can quickly get dehydrated when they lose fluids because of problems like vomiting or fever. Symptoms of dehydration can range from mild to severe. For example: - The baby may be fussy or cranky (mild dehydration), or the baby may be very sleepy and hard to wake up (severe dehydration). - The baby may have a little less urine than usual (mild dehydration), or the baby may not be urinating at all (severe dehydration). You can get dehydrated when you lose a lot of fluids because of problems like vomiting or fever. Symptoms of dehydration can range from mild to severe. For example: - You may feel tired and edgy (mild dehydration), or you may feel weak, not alert, and not able to think clearly (severe dehydration). - You may pass less urine than usual (mild dehydration), or you may not be passing urine at all (severe dehydration). Temperature varies a little depending on how you measure it. For children up to 11 years old, here are the ranges for high, moderate, and mild according to how you took the temperature. Oral (by mouth) temperature - High: 40\u00b0 C (104\u00b0 F) and higher - Moderate: 38\u00b0 F) 39.9\u00b0 C (103.9\u00b0 F) - Mild: 37.9\u00b0 C (100.3\u00b0 F) and lower A forehead (temporal) scanner is usually 0.3\u00b0 C (0.5\u00b0 F) to 0.6\u00b0 C (1\u00b0 F) lower than an oral temperature. Ear or rectal temperature - High: 40.5\u00b0 C (104.9\u00b0 F) and higher - Moderate: 38.5\u00b0 F) 40.4\u00b0 C (104.7\u00b0 38.4\u00b0 (axillary) temperature 39.8\u00b0 (103.6\u00b0 F) Moderate: 37.8\u00b0 F) 39.7\u00b0 C (103.5\u00b0 Mild: 37.7\u00b0 C (99.9\u00b0 F) and lower Note: For children under 5 years old, rectal temperatures are the most accurate. Certain health conditions and medicines weaken the immune system's ability to fight off infection and illness. Some examples in children are: - Diseases such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and congenital heart disease. - Steroid medicines, which are used to treat a variety of conditions. - Medicines taken after organ transplant. - Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. - Not having a spleen. A baby that is extremely sick: - May be limp and floppy like a rag doll. - May not respond at all to being held, touched, or talked to. - May be hard to wake up. A baby that is sick (but not extremely sick): - May be sleepier than usual. - May not eat or drink as much as usual. Symptoms of difficulty breathing can range from mild to severe. For example: - You may feel a little out of breath but still be able to talk (mild difficulty breathing), or you may be so out of breath that you cannot talk at all (severe difficulty breathing). - It may be getting hard to breathe with activity (mild difficulty breathing), or you may have to work very hard to breathe even when you're at rest (severe difficulty breathing). Symptoms of difficulty breathing in a baby or young child can range from mild to severe. For example: - The child may be breathing a little faster than usual (mild difficulty breathing), or the child may be having so much trouble that the nostrils are flaring and the belly is moving in and out with every breath (severe difficulty breathing). - The child may seem a little out of breath but is still able to eat or talk (mild difficulty breathing), or the child may be breathing so hard that he or she cannot eat or talk (severe difficulty breathing). Sudden drooling and trouble swallowing can be signs of a serious problem called epiglottitis. This problem can happen at any age. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue at the back of the throat that you can't see when you look in the mouth. When you swallow, it closes to keep food and fluids out of the tube (trachea) that leads to the lungs. If the epiglottis becomes inflamed or infected, it can swell and quickly block the airway. This makes it very hard to breathe. The symptoms start suddenly. A person with epiglottitis is likely to seem very sick, have a fever, drool, and have trouble breathing, swallowing, and making sounds. In the case of a child, you may notice the child trying to sit up and lean forward with his or her jaw forward, because it's easier to breathe in this position. If you're not sure if a child's fever is high, moderate, or mild, think about these issues: With a high fever: - The child feels very hot. - It is likely one of the highest fevers the child has ever had. With a moderate fever: - The child feels warm or hot. - You are sure the child has a fever. With a mild fever: - The child may feel a little warm. - You think the child might have a fever, but you're not sure. Severe dehydration means: - The baby may be very sleepy and hard to wake up. - The baby may have a very dry mouth and very dry eyes (no tears). - The baby may have no wet diapers in 12 or more hours. Moderate dehydration means: - The baby may have no wet diapers in 6 hours. - The baby may have a dry mouth and dry eyes (fewer tears than usual). Mild dehydration means: - The baby may pass a little less urine than usual. Severe dehydration means: - The child's mouth and eyes may be extremely dry. - The child may pass little or no urine for 12 or more hours. - The child may not seem alert or able to think clearly. - The child may be too weak or dizzy to stand. - The child may pass out. Moderate dehydration means: - The child may be a lot more thirsty than usual. - The child's mouth and eyes may be drier than usual. - The child may pass little or no urine for 8 or more hours. - The child may feel dizzy when he or she stands or sits up. Mild dehydration means: - The child may be more thirsty than usual. - The child may pass less urine than usual. You can use a small rubber bulb (called an aspirating bulb) to remove mucus from your baby's nose or mouth when a cold or allergies make it hard for the baby to eat, sleep, or breathe. To use the bulb: - Put a few saline nose drops in each side of the baby's nose before you start. - Position the baby with his or her head tilted slightly back. - Squeeze the round base of the bulb. - Gently insert the tip of the bulb tightly inside the baby's nose. - Release the bulb to remove (suction) mucus from the nose. Don't do this more than 5 or 6 times a day. Doing it too often can make the congestion worse and can also cause the lining of the nose to swell or bleed. Severe trouble breathing means: - The child cannot eat or talk because he or she is breathing so hard. - The child's nostrils are flaring and the belly is moving in and out with every breath. - The child seems to be tiring out. - The child seems very sleepy or confused. Moderate trouble breathing means: - The child is breathing a lot faster than usual. - The child has to take breaks from eating or talking to breathe. - The nostrils flare or the belly moves in and out at times when the child breathes. Mild trouble breathing means: - The child is breathing a little faster than usual. - The child seems a little out of breath but can still eat or talk. Symptoms of heatstroke may include: - Feeling or acting very confused, restless, or anxious. - Trouble breathing. - Sweating heavily, or not sweating at all (sweating may have stopped). - Skin that is red, hot, and dry, even in the armpits. - Passing out. - Seizure. - Nausea and vomiting. Heatstroke occurs when the body can't control its own temperature and body temperature continues to rise. Pain in children under 3 years It can be hard to tell how much pain a baby or toddler is in. - Severe pain (8 to 10): The pain is so bad that the baby cannot sleep, cannot get comfortable, and cries constantly no matter what you do. The baby may kick, make fists, or grimace. - Moderate pain (5 to 7): The baby is very fussy, clings to you a lot, and may have trouble sleeping but responds when you try to comfort him or her. - Mild pain (1 to 4): The baby is a little fussy and clings to you a little but responds when you try to comfort him or her. Pain in children 3 years and older - Severe pain (8 to 10): The pain is so bad that the child can't stand it for more than a few hours, can't sleep, and can't do anything else except focus on the pain. No one can tolerate severe pain for more than a few hours. - Moderate pain (5 to 7): The pain is bad enough to disrupt the child's normal activities and sleep, but the child can tolerate it for hours or days. - Mild pain (1 to 4): The child notices and may complain of the pain, but it is not bad enough to disrupt his or her sleep or activities. Sudden tiny red or purple spots or sudden bruising may be early symptoms of a serious illness or bleeding problem. There are two types. Petechiae (say \"puh-TEE-kee-eye\"): - Are tiny, flat red or purple spots in the skin or the lining of the mouth. - Do not turn white when you press on them. - Range from the size of a pinpoint to the size of a small pea and do not itch or cause pain. - May spread over a large area of the body within a few hours. - Are different than tiny, flat red spots or birthmarks that are present all the time. Purpura (say \"PURR-pyuh-ruh\" or \"PURR-puh-ruh\"): - Is sudden, severe bruising that occurs for no clear reason. - May be in one area or all over. - Is different than the bruising that happens after you bump into something. Symptoms of serious illness in a baby may include the following: - The baby is limp and floppy like a rag doll. - The baby doesn't respond at all to being held, touched, or talked to. - The baby is hard to wake up. Symptoms of serious illness may include: - A severe headache. - A stiff neck. - Mental changes, such as feeling confused or much less alert. - Extreme fatigue (to the point where it's hard for you to function). - Shaking chills. Shock is a life-threatening condition that may occur quickly after a sudden illness or injury. Babies and young children often have several symptoms of shock. These include: - Passing out (losing consciousness). - Being very sleepy or hard to wake up. - Not responding when being touched or talked to. - Breathing much faster than usual. - Acting confused. The child may not know where he or she is. Fever can be a symptom of almost any type of infection. Symptoms of a more serious infection may include the following: - Skin infection: Pain, redness, or pus - Joint infection: Severe pain, redness, or warmth in or around a joint - Bladder infection: Burning when you urinate, and a frequent need to urinate without being able to pass much urine - Kidney infection: Pain in the flank, which is either side of the back just below the rib cage - Abdominal infection: Belly pain Many prescription and non-prescription medicines can trigger an allergic reaction and cause a fever. A few examples are: - Antibiotics. - Barbiturates, such as phenobarbital. - ASA, if you take too much. Seek Care Today Based on your answers, you may need care soon. The problem probably will not get better without medical care. - Call your doctor today to discuss the symptoms and arrange for care. - If you cannot reach your doctor or you don't have one, seek care today. - If it is evening, watch the symptoms and seek care in the morning. - If the symptoms get worse, seek care sooner. Seek Care Now Based on your answers, you may need care right away. The problem is likely to get worse without medical care. - Call your doctor now to discuss the symptoms and arrange for care. - If you cannot reach your doctor or you don't have one, seek care in the next hour. - You do not need to call an ambulance unless: - You cannot travel safely either by driving yourself or by having someone else drive you. - You are in an area where heavy traffic or other problems may slow you down. Call 911 Now Based on your answers, you need emergency care. Call 911 or other emergency services now. Sometimes people don't want to call 911. They may think that their symptoms aren't serious or that they can just get someone else to drive them. But based on your answers, the safest and quickest way for you to get the care you need is to call 911 for medical transport to the hospital. Make an Appointment Based on your answers, the problem may not improve without medical care. - Make an appointment to see your doctor in the next 1 to 2 weeks. - If appropriate, try home treatment while you are waiting for the appointment. - If symptoms get worse or you have any concerns, call your doctor. You may need care sooner. Home Treatment It can be hard to know whether you should call your doctor when your child has a [fever](/fever), especially during the cold and flu season. The degree of the fever may not be related to the seriousness of the illness. The way your child looks and acts is a better guide than the thermometer. Most children will be less active when they have a fever. If your child is comfortable and alert, is eating well, is drinking enough fluids, is urinating normal amounts, and seems to be improving, home treatment without medicine is all that is needed for a fever. Dress your child lightly, and do not wrap him or her in blankets. Dressing lightly will help your child's body cool down. Try these home treatment measures to make sure your child is drinking enough fluids and does not get dehydrated while he or she has a fever. Newborns and babies younger than 1 year of age Don't wait until you see [signs of dehydration](/dehydration-children) in your baby. These signs include your baby being thirstier than usual and having less urine than usual. - If you breastfeed your baby, nurse him or her more often. Offer each breast to your baby for 1 to 2 minutes every 10 minutes. - If you use a bottle to feed your baby, increase the number of feedings to make up for lost fluids. The amount of extra fluid your baby needs depends on your baby's age and size. For example, a newborn may need as little as 1 fl oz (30 mL) at each extra feeding, while a 12-month-old baby may need as much as 3 fl oz (90 mL) at each extra feeding. - Ask your doctor if you need to use an [oral rehydration solution (ORS)](/health-topics/oral-rehydration-solutions-children)if your baby still isn't getting enough fluids from formula or the breast. The amount of ORS your baby needs depends on your baby's age and size. You can give the ORS in a dropper, spoon, or bottle. - If your baby has started eating cereal, you may replace lost fluids with cereal. You also may feed your baby strained bananas and mashed potatoes if your child has had these foods before. Children ages 1 through 11 - Make sure your child is drinking often. Frequent, small amounts work best. - Allow your child to drink as much fluid as he or she wants. Encourage your child to [drink extra fluids](/pregnancy-parenting/parenting-babies-0-12-months/baby-health/dehydration-drinking-enough-fluids)or suck on flavoured ice pops, such as Popsicles. Note: Do not give your child fruit juice or soda pop. Fruit juice and soda pop contain too much sugar and not enough of the essential minerals (electrolytes) that are being lost. Diet soda pop lacks calories that your child needs. - Cereal mixed with milk or water may also be used to replace lost fluids. - If your child still is not getting enough fluids, you can try an [oral rehydration solution (ORS)](/health-topics/oral-rehydration-solutions-children). Keep your child comfortable Lowering your child's temperature is important when the fever is causing discomfort. If your child is uncomfortable: | | Try a non-prescription medicine to help treat your child's fever or pain: | | Talk to your child's doctor before switching back and forth between doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. When you switch between two medicines, there is a chance your child will get too much medicine. | | Be sure to follow these safety tips when you use a non-prescription medicine: | | - Encourage quiet activities. - Watch for [signs of dehydration](/dehydration-children). These include your child being thirstier than usual and having darker urine than usual. Symptoms to watch for during home treatment [ Call your child's doctor](/illnesses-conditions/infectious-diseases/fever-or-chills-age-11-and-younger) if any of the following occur during home treatment: - [Level of consciousness](/level-consciousness)changes. - Your child has [signs of dehydration](/dehydration)and is not able to drink enough to replace lost fluids. Signs of dehydration include being thirstier than usual and having darker urine than usual. - Other symptoms develop, such as pain in one area of the body, shortness of breath, or urinary symptoms. - Symptoms become more severe or frequent. Prevention The best way to prevent fevers is to reduce your child's exposure to infectious diseases. [Handwashing](/illnesses-conditions/disease-and-disease-prevention/handwashing) is the single most important prevention measure for people of all ages. Childhood immunizations can reduce the risk for fever-related illnesses, such as [ Haemophilus influenzae type b](/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b) (Hib) infection. Although no vaccine is 100% effective, most routine childhood immunizations are effective for 85% to 95% of the children who receive them. For more information, see the topic [Immunizations](/health-topics/immunizations). Preparing For Your Appointment To prepare for your appointment, see the topic [ Making the Most of Your Appointment](/health-topics/making-most-your-appointment). You can help your child's doctor diagnose and treat your child's condition by providing the following information: - The history of the fever, including: - When did the fever start? Did it come on suddenly or increase over several hours? - Are you able to measure your child's temperature? How high is the fever? - Does the child have any other symptoms? - Does your child have frequent fevers? - How often does your child get a fever? - How long does the fever usually last? - Has your child had any other health problems during the past 3 months? - Has your child been eating, drinking, and playing normally? - Has anyone else in your family been ill? - Is your child in daycare? If so, have any other children at the facility been ill? - Has your child recently travelled outside the country? - Has your child recently had close contact with immigrants or nonnative people? - Has your child had any animal or insect bites (including ticks) in the past 6 weeks? - Has your child had an immunization (vaccine) shot recently? - Does your child have any [health risks](/health-topics/health-risks)?
