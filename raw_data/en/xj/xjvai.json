Introduction The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) Evidence -Based Practice Work Group (EBPWG) was established and first chartered in 2004, with a mission to advise the Health Executive Committee (HEC) \"...on the use of clinical and epidemiological evidence to improve the health of the population...\" across the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS), by facilitating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the VA and DoD populations .[1] This CPG is intended to provide primary care providers with a framework by which to evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of adults and children four years or older with asthma , thereby leading to improved clinical outco mes. In 2009, the VA and DoD published a CPG for the Primary Care Management of Asthma (2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG), which was based on evidence reviewed through February 2008. Since the release of that guideline, a growing body of research has expanded the general knowledge and understanding of asthma . Consequently, a recommendation to update the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG was initiated in 2018. The updated CPG includes objective, evidence -based information on the management of asthma . It is intended to assist pr imary care providers in all aspects of patient care, including, but not limited to, assessment, treatment, and follow -up. The system -wide goal of evidence -based guidelines is to standardized management pathways for health professionals to improve the healt h and well -being of patients with asthma . The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to : Assess the patient's condition and determine, in collaboration with the patient, the best treatment method Optimize each individual's health outcomes and improve quality of life Minimize preventable complications and morbidity Emphasize the use of patient - (and family -) centered care (PCC) II. Background A. Description of Asthma Asthma is a common medical problem frequently managed by primary care providers. It usually presents in the primary care setting with typical symptoms of wheezing, coughing, and dyspnea. In some cases, asthma exacerbations can be severe and potentially life threatening. Airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity are considered the primary underlying pathologic processes. Asthma is characterized by airway obstruction that is usually at least partially reversible. Despite these unifying characteristics, asthma is a very heterogeneous condition. There is significant variability in presenting symptoms, degree of airway obstruction, level of impairment, responsiveness to medication, and frequency/severity of exacerbations. Patients with asthma also vary with respect to age at diagnosis, symptom triggers, psychosocial factors, and comorbid medical conditions. The heterogeneous nature of asthma can complicate diagnostic and treatment decisions. A one -size-fits-all approach may lead to inadequate treatment or exposure to unnecessary risks and burdens of therapies. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 7 of 156 CPGs attempt to reduce inappropriate practice variability by providing recommendations based on scientific evidence. The varied nature of asthma, however, also makes clinical research and the application of that research to individual patients challenging. CPGs also provide a conceptual framework for the treatment of an illness. The paradigm for asthma treatment has evolved to recognize both the diversity among patients and variability of symptoms within an individual patient over time. Early asthma guidelines determined levels of severity based on pretreatment symptom burden and matched controller therapy to a specific severity level. The goal in this paradigm was to provide adequate medication for the severity of the disease whil e minimizing the risks and burdens of therapy. The current paradigm addresses attaining control of current symptoms, but it also considers the therapy necessary for maintaining control of symptoms and reducing the risk of loss of control from exacerbations . Therapy can be stepped up or down over time to achieve these goals while minimizing risks and burdens of the therapy. The current conceptual framework for asthma care also addresses quality of life and considers patients' values and preferences. Therapeu tic choices are based on shared decision making (SDM) and are periodically reviewed over time. B. Classification of Asthma Severity and Control Asthma severity is commonly classified as mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent , or severe p ersistent. This CPG did not determine if applying a particular classification system for asthma severity led to improved outcomes. We do recognize, however, that this classification system is widely used by clinicians, researchers, and other guideline deve lopers and provides a common reference for communication. Table B -1 provides information to assist in assignment of the severity level during the initial evaluation of a newly diagnosed patient. This table was carried forward from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG. The Algorithm within this CPG refers to Table B -1 for the initial management of newly diagnosed patients. Decision points in the algorithm are determined by the CPG's key recommendations and also by current standards of care. The system for the initial classification of asthma severity reflects a standard of care that has been carried forward from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG. Asthma severity can also be classified once a patient is stabilized based on the medication required to maintain control of symptoms. Quality asthma care involves not only assessing initial severity but also requires regular follow -up in which control of symptoms are assessed and therapy is adjusted to maintain effective control. This CPG did not validate a particular methodology for determining level of control but recognizes that clinicians benefit from a systematic approach when assessing asthma control. Therefore, Table B -2 was carried forward from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG. The Algorithm within this CPG refers to Table B -2 for ongoing follow - up of patients and can assist providers in making determinations to adjust therapy. C. Epidemiology and Impact in the General Population The national public health impact of asthma is significant. Based on health statistics from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, over 20 million adults and six million children had a diagnos is of asthma in the United States ( U.S.).[2] According to the 2015 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, over 6% of all office -based physician visits included asthma as a diagnosis. [2] Additionally, this 2015 survey reported 1.7 million emergency department (ED) visits with asthma as the primary diagnosis. The morbidity caused by chronic asthma impacts society. Uncontrolled asthma leads to activity limitation and missed days of school and/or work. In 2007, t he estimated cost of asthma from loss of productivity was 3.8 billion VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 8 of 156 dollars .[3] Beyond morbidity, asthma is still a cause of death in the U.S. In 2016, 3, 518 people died from asthma .[4] D. Asthma in the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs Populations Since 2004, medical standards for appointment, enlistment, or induction into the military services have listed asthma as a disqualifying condition unless exempted via medical waiver. The current Do D instruction 6130.3, last updated in 2018, states the following with respect to asthma and disqualification for service :[5] History of airway hyperresponsiveness including asthma, reactive airway disease, exercise - induced bronchospasm or asthmatic bronchitis, after the 13th birthday. Symptoms suggestive of airway hyperresponsiveness include but are not limited to cough, wheeze, chest tightness, dyspnea or functional exercise limitations after the 13th birthday. History of prescription or use of medication (including but not limited to inhaled or oral corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or any beta agonists) for airway hyperresponsiveness after the 13th birthday. Additional information can be found in Appendix D. Despite these accessioning standards, asthma remains a common pre -service condition leading to discharge from the military within the first six months of military service. Perhaps more relevant to this guideline is that m ilitary members are commonly first diagnosed with asthma as adults , after they have begun military service. The reasons for this may involve occupational exposures, including deployment - related exposures, and increased smoking rates among active duty perso nnel compared to civilian counterparts . Retention standards for active duty personnel diagnosed with asthma vary by military service. Generally, S ervice Members with well -controlled asthma may remain on active duty. Uncontrolled asthma impacts military rea diness; asthma -related disability is commonly evaluated in the separation and medical retirement process. Additionally, several studies have reported higher rates of new -onset asthma in Service Members that have deployed to the Middle East during Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF).[ 6] This makes it likely that primary care provid ers in both the DoD and VA will encounter patients with a diagnosis of asthma or with symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis that will warrant evaluation and treatment. Th is guideline is designed to assist these primary care providers in the diagnosis and management of asthma. III. About this Clinical Practice Guideline This guideline represents a significant step toward improving the diagnosis and management of asthma in the VA and DoD. As with other CPGs, however, challenges remain, including evidence gaps, the need to develop effective strategies for guideline implementation , and the need to evaluate the effect of guideline adherence on clinical outcomes. This guideline is intended for VA and DoD primary care practitioners treating patients four years of ag e and older (see Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline for more information). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 9 of 156 As elaborated upon in the qualifying statement on page one, this CPG is not intended to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns evolve. This CPG is based on information available by J uly 24, 2018 and is intended to provide a general guide to best practices. The guideline can assist care providers, but the use of a CPG must always be considered as a re commendation for the care of an individual patient, within the context of a provider's clinical judgment and patient values and preferences. A. Methods The current document is an update to the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG . The methodology used in developing the 2019 CPG follows the Guideline for Guidelines , an internal document of the VA and DoD EBPWG that was updated in January 2019 .[7] The Guideline for Guidelines can be downloaded from http://www.healthquality.va.gov/policy/index.asp . This document provides information regarding the process of developing guidelines, including the identification and assembly of the Guideline Champions (Champions) and other subject matter experts from with in the VA and DoD, known as the Work Group and, ultimately, the development and submission of a new or updated Asthma CPG. The Champions and Work Group for this CPG were charged with developing evidence -based clinical practice recommendations and writing a nd publishing a guideline document to be used by providers within the VA/DoD healthcare systems as well as those within the community who treat individuals within the VA and DoD . Specifically, the Champions and Work Group members for this guideline were re sponsible for identifying the key questions (KQs) with the most clinical relevance, importance, and interest for the primary care management of asthma . The Champions and the Work Group also provided direction on inclusion and exclusion criteria for the evidence review and assessed the level and quality of the evidence. The amount of new scientific evidence that had accumulated since the previous version of the CPG was also taken into consideration in the identification of the KQs. In addition, the Champions assisted in: Identifying appropriate disciplines of individuals to be included as part of the Work Group Directing and coordinating the Work Group Participating throughout the guideline development and review processes The VA Office of Quality, Safety and Value, in collaboration with the Office of Evidence Based Practice, U.S. Army Medical Command, the proponent for CPGs for the DoD, identified four clinical lead ers, Andrew I. Philip , MD and Amir Sharafkhaneh , MD , PhD from the VA and MAJ Nikhil Huprikar , MD and MAJ Cristian S. Madar, MD, MPH from t he DoD, as Champions for the 201 9 CPG. The Lewin Team, including The Lewin Group, Duty First Consulting, ECRI Institute, and Sigma Health Consulting, LLC, was contracted by the VA and DoD to support the develo pment of this CPG and conduct the evidence review. The first conference call was held in March 2018, with participation from the contracting officer's representative (COR), leaders from the VA Office of Quality , Safety and Value and the DoD Office of Evide nce Based Practice, and the Champions. During this call, participants discussed the scope of the guideline initiative, the roles and responsibilities of the Champions, the project timeline, and the approach for developing and prioritizing specific research questions on which to base a systematic review (SR) about the assessment and management of patients at risk for asthma. The group also VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 10 of 156 identified a list of clinical specialties and areas of expertise that are important and relevant to the management of as thma , from which Work Group members were recruited. The specialties and clinical areas of interest included: primary care, family medicine , pediatrics, pulmonology, pediatric pulmonology , critical care medicine, nursing, social work, pharmacology , and respiratory care . The guideline development process for the 2019 CPG update consisted of the following steps: 1. Formulating and prioritizing KQs and defining critical outcomes 2. Convening patient focus groups 3. Conducting the systematic evidence review 4. Convening a face -to-face meeting with the CPG Champions and Work Group members 5. Drafting and submitting a final CPG on the management of asthma to the VA/DoD EBPWG Appendix A provides a detailed description of each of these tasks. a. Grading Recommendations The Champions and Work Group used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recomm endation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each recommendation :[8] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence Patient or provider values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation as \"Strong\" or \"Weak .\" A \"Strong\" recommendation generally indicates a high confidence in the quality of the available scientific evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient or provider values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). If the Work Group has less confidence after the assessmen t across these domains and believes that additional evidence may change the recommendation, it generally assigns a \"Weak\" recommendation. It is important to note that the GRADE terminology used to indicate the assessment across the four domains (i.e., \"Strong\" v ersus \"Weak \") should not be confused with the clinical importance of the recommendation. A weak recommendation may still be important to the clinical care of a patient with asthma. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 11 of 156 Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a specific topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong for (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak for (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") The grade of each recommendation made in the 201 9 CPG can be found in the section on Recommendations . Additional information regarding the use of the GRADE system can be found in Appendix A. b. Reconciling 20 09 Clinical Practice Guideline Recommendations Evidence -based CPGs should be current , which typically requires revisions of previous guidelines based on new evidence, or as scheduled and subject to time- based expirations. [9] For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a process for refining or otherwise updating its recommendations pertaining to preventive services. [10] The Asthma Guideline Work Group focused largely on developing new and updated recommendations based on the evidence review conducted for the priority areas addressed by the KQs. In addition to those new and updated recommendations, the Work Group considered, without complete review of the relevant evidence, the current applicability of other recommendations that were included in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG , subject to evolving practice in today's environment. A set of recommendation categories was adapted from those used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). [11,12] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which older recommendations could have been updated. In brief, the categories took into account whether or not the evidence that related to a recommendation w as systematically reviewed, the degree to which a recommendation was modified, and the degree to which a recommendation is relevant in the current care environment and within the scope of the CPG. Additional information regarding these categories and their definitions can be found in Recommendation Categorization . The categories for the recommendations included in the 201 9 version of the guideline can be found in the section on Recommendations . The categories for the recommendations carried forward from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG are noted in Appendix I. The CPG Work Group recognized the need to accommodate the transition in evidence rating systems from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG to the current CPG. In order to report the strength of all recommendations using a consistent format (i.e., the GRADE system) the CPG Work Group converted the USPSTF strengths of VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 12 of 156 the recommendation accompanying the carryover recommendations from the 20 09 guideline to the GRADE system. As such, the CPG Work Group considered the strength of the evidence cited for each recommendation in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG as well as the intervention's harms and benefits, values and preferences, and other implications, where possible. The CPG Work Group referred to the available evidence as summarized in the body of the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG and did not systematically re -assess the evidence. In some ins tances, relevant peer -reviewed literature published since the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG was considered along with the original evidence base for the specific recommendation . Where such newer literature was considered when converting the strength of the recomm endation from the USPSTF to the GRADE system, it is referenced in the discussion that follows the corresponding recommendation, as well as in Appen dix H. The CPG Work Group recognizes that, while there are somet imes practical reasons for incorporating findings from a previous SR , previous recommendations, [13] or recent peer -reviewed publications into an updated CPG, doing so does not involve an original, comprehensive SR and, therefore, may introduce bias. c. Peer Review Process The CPG was developed through an iterative process in which the Work Group produced multiple drafts of the CPG. The process for developing the initial draft is described in more detail in Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline . Once a near- final draft of the guideline was agreed upon by the Champions and Work Group members, the draft was sent out for peer review and comment. The draft was posted on a wiki website for a period of 14 business days. The peer reviewers comprised individuals working within the VA and DoD healthcare systems as well as experts from relevant outside organizations designated by the Work Group members. Organizations designated by the Work Group to participate in the peer review and who provided feedback inc lude the following: American College of Physicians The VA and DoD Leadership reached out to both the internal and external peer reviewers to solicit their feedback on the CPG. Reviewers were provided a hyperlink to the wiki website where the draft CPG was posted. All feedback from the peer reviewers was discussed and considered by the Work Group. Modifications made throughout the CPG development process were made in accordance with the evidence. B. Summary of Patient Focus Group Methods and Findings When forming guideline recommendations, consideration should be given to the values and preferences of those most affected by the recommendations: patients and their caregivers . Patients bring perspectives, values, and preferences into their healthcare experience that can vary from those of clinicians. These differences can affect decision making in various situations, and should thus be highlighted and made explicit due to their potential to influence a recommendation's implementation. [14,15] Focus groups ca n be used as an efficient method to explore ideas and perspectives of a group of individuals and collect qualitative data on a thoughtfully predetermined set of questions. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 13 of 156 Therefore, as part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership, along w ith the Asthma CPG Work Group, held a patient focus group on June 22, 2018 at the Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, NC . The aim of the focus group was to further understand and incorporate the perspective of patients who a re living with asthma and who are covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems, as these patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group delved into the patients' perspectives on a set of topics related to their asthma management , including their priorities, challenges they have experienced, and the information they received regarding thei r care, as well as the impacts of their care on their lives. It is im portant to note the focus group comprised a convenience sample of Veterans, Service Members, and their dependents. Perspectives of children with asthma were provided through parent participation in the focus group. The Work Group recognizes the lack of generalizability and other limitations inherent in the small sample size. Less than 10 people in total were included in the focus group to be consistent with the requirements of the federal Paperwork Reduction Act, 1980. The Work Group acknowledges that the sample included in the focus group is not repres entative of all patients within the VA and DoD healthcare systems. Further, time limitations for the focus group prevented exhaustive exploration of all topics related to asthma management in VA and DoD and the patient s' broader experiences with their care . Thus, the Work Group made decisions regarding the priority of topics to discuss at the focus group. These limitations, as well as others, were considered during guideline development as the information collected from the discussion was being used. Recruitment for participation in the focus group was managed by the Champions and VA and DoD Leadership, with assistance from coordinators at the facilit y at which the focus group took place. The following concepts are ideas and suggestions about aspects of care that are important to patients who are living with asthma and emerged as recurring themes during the discussions ( Table 1). These concepts were important parts of the participants' care and added to the Work Group's understanding of patient values and perspectives. Additional details regarding the patient focus group methods and findings can be found in Appendix G. Table 1. Asthma CPG Focus Group Concepts Asthma CPG Patient Focus Group Concepts A. Ensure that patient history and symptoms are taken into account when assessing pulmonary issues. Once a patient is diagnosed with asthma, help the patient understand his or her triggers. B. For every patient, establish and maintain an asthma action plan in conjunction with the patient. Leverage multiple types of clinical expertise (e.g., pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists) when educating the patient on their condition, their asthma action p lan, and treatment adherence. C. Work with the patient to identify an effective treatment for asthma, considering co -occurring conditions. Be mindful that different patients may respond to medications differently. D. Be mindful that, in some cases, a diagnosis of asthma or the inability to achieve control of asthma symptoms may affect an active duty Service Member differently than a civilian. E. Ensure that various types of clinicians are engaged as appropriate (e.g., specialists provide pulmonary exper tise as needed based on patient condition, clinical pharmacists provide education). Leverage telehealth, mobile applications, and other information technology to the extent that it is available and helpful for the patient. F. Acknowledge the seriousness of asthma and its impact on the life of the patient. Discuss the patient's goals for asthma treatment and help each patient work toward those goals. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 14 of 156 C. Conflicts of Interest At the start of this guideline development process and at other key points throughout, the project team was required to submit disclosure statements to reveal any areas of potential conflict of interest (COI) in the past 24 months. Verbal affirmations of n o COI were used as necessary during meetings throughout the guideline development process. The project team was also subject to random web- based surveillance (e.g., Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services open payments , ProPublica). If a project team member reported a COI (actual or potential), then it was reported to the Office of Evidence Based Practice. It was also discussed with the Asthma CPG Champions in tandem with their review of the evidence and development of recommendations. The Office of Evidence Based Practice and the Asthma CPG Champions determined whether or not action, such as restricting participation and/or voting on sections related to the conflict or removal from the Work Group, was necessary. If it was deemed necessary, action to mitigate the COI was taken by the Champions and Offic e of Evidence Based Practice, based on the level and extent of involvement. No conflicts of interest were identified for the Asthma CPG Work Group members or Champions. Disclosure forms are on file with the VA Evidence Based Practice Program office and available upon request. D. Scope of this Clinical Practice Guideline This guideline is designed t o assist primary care providers (including general internal medicine and family medicine physicians , pediatricians , physician assistants , nurse practitioners , nurses, respiratory therapists , pharmacists , asthma educators , social workers , case managers , and others ) in managing or co -managing patients four years of age and older undergoing treatment for asthma . Moreover, the patient population of interest for this CP G consists of patients who are living with asthma and are eligible for care in the VA and DoD healthcare delivery systems who are being treated in an ambulatory or clinical setting . It includes Veterans as wel l as deployed and non-deployed active duty Service, Guard, and Reserve Members and their dependents. Patients receiving care in the urgent or emergency care setting or in the hospital, pregnant women, and children younger than four years are not included in the scope of this CPG. Regardless of setting, any patient in the healthcare system should ideally have access to the interventions that are recommended in this guideline after taking into consideration the patient's specific circumstances. Guideline recommendations are intended to be patient centere d. Thus, treatment and care should take into account a patient's needs and preferences. Good communication between healthcare professionals and the patient is essential and should be supported by evidence -based information tailored to the patient's needs. Use of an empathetic and non- judgmental approach facilitates discussions sensitive to gender, culture, ethnic, and other differences. The information that patients and caregivers are given about treatment and care should be culturally appropriate and available to people with limited literacy skills. It should also be accessible to people with additional needs such as physical, sensory, or learning disabilities. Family involvement should be considered, if appropriate. E. Highlighted Features of this Clinical Practice Guideline The 201 9 edition of the VA/DoD Asthma CPG is the second update to the original CPG . It provides practice recommendations for asthma as well as guidance for specialty referral. A particular strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception, ensuring representation from the broad VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 15 of 156 spectrum of clinicians engaged in the treatment and management of asthma with and without co - occurring conditions . The framework for recommendations in this CPG considered factors beyond the strength of the evide nce, including balancing desired outcomes with potential harms of the intervention, equity of resource availability, the potential for variation in patient values and preferences, and other considerations (e.g., resource use, subgroup considerations) as appropriate. Applicability of the evidence to VA/DoD populations was also taken into consideration. An alg orithm accompanies the guideline to provide an overview of the recommendations in the context of the flow of patient care and to assist with training providers (see Algorithm ). The algorithm may be used to help facilitate translation of guideline recommendations into effective practice. F. Patient -centered Care VA/DoD CPGs encourage clinicians to use patient - (and family -) cen tered care ( PCC) approach that is individualized based on patient needs, characteristics, and preferences. Regardless of setting, all patients in the healthcare system should be able to access evidence -based care appropriate to that patient. When properly executed, PCC may decrease patient anxiety, increase trust in clinicians, and improve treatment adherence. [16-18] Improved patient -clinician communication and a PCC approach conveys openness and supports disclosure of current and future concerns. As part of the PCC approach, clinicians should engage patients in SDM to review the outcomes of previous healthcare experiences with the p atients who are living with asthma. They should ask each patient about any concerns he or she has or ba rriers to high quality care he or she might experience. Lastly, they should educate the patient on the actions that need to be taken and any decisions that need to be made and should involve the individual in decision making regarding management of asthma . G. Shared Decision Making Throughout this VA/DoD CPG, the authors encourage clinicians to focus on SDM. The SDM model was introduced in Crossing the Quality Chasm, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now called the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) report, in 2001. [19] It is readily apparent that p atients , together with their clinicians, make decisions regarding their plan of care and management options. Clinicians must be adept at presenting information to their patients regarding individual treatments, expected outcomes, and leve ls and/or locations of care. Clinicians are encouraged to use SDM to individualize treatment goals and plans based on patient capabilities, needs, goals and preferences. H. Co-occurring Conditions Co-occurring medical and mental health conditions are important to recognize because they can modify the management of asthma , patient or provider treatment priorities, and clinical decisions . Further, the appropriate providers need to be involved in the management of the patient's asthma and ongoing healthcare based on the co -occurring medical and mental health conditions of each patient. Providers should expect that many Veterans, Service Members, and their families will have one or more co -occurring health conditions. Because of the nature of the management of asthma , which sometimes takes place in parallel with ongoing care for co -occurring conditions, it is generally best to manage asthma in collaboration with the care for other health conditions that are being treated in primary or specialty care.

Implem entation This CPG and algorithm are designed to be adapted by individual healthcare providers with consideration of local needs and resources. The algorithm serve s as a tool to prompt providers to consider key decision points in the course of an episode of care. Although this CPG represents the recommended practice on the date of its publication, medical practice is evolving and this evolution requires continuous updating based on published information. New technology and more research will improve patient care in the future. The CPG can assist in identifying priority areas for research and informing optimal allocation of resources. Future studies examining the results of CPG implementation may lead to the development of new evidence particularly relevant to clinical practice.

Algorithm This CPG follows an algorithm which is designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathway and decision -making process used in the management o f asthma . The use of the algorithm format as a way to represent patient management was chosen based on the understanding that such a format may promote more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic decision making and has the potential to change patterns of resource use. Although the Work Group recognizes that not all clinical practices are linear, the simplified linear approach depicted through the algorithm and its format allows the provider to assess the critical information needed at the major decision points in the clinical process. It includes: An ordered sequence of steps of care Recommended observations and examinations Decisions to be considered Actions to be taken For each guideline, there is corresponding clinical algorithm that is depicted by a step -by-step decision tree. Standardized symbols are used to display each step in the algorithm, and arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed. [20] Shape Description Rounded rectangles represent a clinical state or condition Hexagons represent a decision point in the guideline, formulated as a quest ion that can be answered Yes or No Rectangles represent a n action in the process of care Ovals represent a link to another section within the guideline.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 27 of 156 A. Diagnosis and Assessment Recommendation 1. We suggest spirometry if there is a need to confirm a clinical diagnosis of asthma. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion The diagnosis of asthma is a clinical diagnosis based on history, physical examination , and findings suggestive of airway hyperactivity. While objective measurements of airway reactivity, specifically reversible obstruction post -bronchodilator, may be helpful in the diagnosis of asthma, the lack of objective reversibility does not disqualify the diagnosis. We suggest that spirometry be used when a confirmatory test is needed to support a clinical diagnosis of asthma. Although often considered a component of the diagnostic work -up for asthma, documentation of airflow obstruction may not be required in cases of clinical asthma that adequately respond to therapy. Current data is limited with very low quality evidence regarding the overall utility of spirometry. In a pediatric st udy conducted by Murray et al. (2017), a validated clinical questionnaire was compared to spirometry and demonstrated high specificity but poor sensitivity. [21] Furthermore, an adult study by Schneider , et al. (2009) showed a poor sensitivity (29%) for spirometry in primary care to identify patients with obstructive airway disease. [22] As the specificity of the test was relatively high (90%), the authors concluded that spirometry in primary care might have a role to confirm a clinical diagnosis of asthma, but is not useful to rule out asthma. In specific populations with occupational hazards, such as active duty military populations, specific confirmatory testing and guidance may be dictated by DoD standards of medical fitness for duty. Alternative diagnoses may have significant impact on active duty Service Members, should be included in the diagnostic evaluation, and may require subspecialty evaluation. DoD service -specific regulations related to asthma can be found in Appendix D . As thi s is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update .[21,22] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low. The body of evidence had some limitations including use of an indirect as thma diagnosis through questionnaire . Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, such as improved diagnosis, outweighing the potential harm related to lack of sensitivity. Patients are expected to have similar values and preferences regarding this issue, as most will agree with the test for improved diagnosis. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. Recommendation 2. In primary care, we suggest against whole -body plethysmography as part of the diagnostic evaluation of asthma. (Weak against |Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Lung function measurements have traditionally been a cornerstone of the work -up for respiratory disorders. Spirometry is often the initial step in assessing lung function for suspected asthma , and more sophisticated measurement of lung volumes by body plethysmography is needed only in more complex VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 28 of 156 cases. A review of the literature identified one study with a relatively large sample size examining use of whole -body plethysmography in children. [23] The assessment of specific airway resistance using whole - body plethysmography provided modest ability to diagnose asthma when compared to clinical diagnosi s and spirometry. The study was of low quality. For all the se tests, benefits and risks were determined to be balanced when the test is used in the primary care setting. There was some variation in the acceptability of these tests among users. The most im portant drawback is that these tests may not be helpful for primary care providers in diagnosing asthma, as they may not be easy to perform or interpret and may not be available in all practice settings. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update .[23] The Work Group de termined that the confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. The body of the evidence had limitations including small sample size s and limited reporting of details such as demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria. [23] Although there is little evidence of benefit, there is also little risk of harm. Further, patient preferences regarding these tests are somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak against \" recommendation. In summary, the above tests may not provide clarity in diagnosing asthma in a primary care setting. However, for this guideline, the evidence reviewed related to the above tests was limited to the examination of the benefit for diagnosing asthma in the primary care setting. Therefore, the Work Group did not review the evidence on address ing the use of these tests in other settings and for other purposes. The use of the above tests may help in the differential diagnosis of asthma in more specialized practice settings (e.g., a pulmonary practice). Recommendation 3. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of bronchodilator response testing to exclude the initial diagnosis of asthma in the absence of airway obstruction. (Neither for n or against | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion As a part of the guideline update, the Work Group reviewed evidence related to the most useful tests for a diagnosis o f asthma and, more specifically, bronchodila tor response t esting. In the previous version of the guideline (2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG ), it was recommended that spirometry should be repeated post - bronchodilator to establish presence and degree of reversibility if there is airway obstruction present or if there is a suspicion of asthma. Although the systematic evidence review for this guideline update searched for studies conducted in the adult population looking at the use of bronchodilator response testing, no such studies met inclusion criteria. After review ing evidence from Murray et al. ( 2017) [21] and Tse et al. (2013) [24] (both of which studied bronchodilator response t esting in children), the Work Group determined that, due to the poor diagnostic performance of bronchodilator response testing (sens itivity, specificity, negative predictive value [NPV], positive predictive value [PPV]), we could neither recommend for nor against the use of this test as a diagnostic tool to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of asthma. Bronchodilator testing may be appropriate in specialized care setting s; therefore, the Work Group decided to not recommendation against this test. Upon review of the evidence, bronchodilator response testing showed unreliable diagnostic VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 29 of 156 and harm/burden of bronchodilator response t esting are balanced. The confidence in the quality of evidence from the available studies reviewed was very low. This is a Reviewed, New -Replaced recommendation. Due to the shortcomings of current available evidence evaluating bro nchodilator response testing along with its poor diagnostic performance, [21,24] the Work Group determined that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of this test alone as a diagnostic test in the diagnosis of asthma. While reversibility with bronchodilator use has long been accepted as objective data to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and reversible obstruction, failure to reverse or improve obstruction with bronchodilator testing doe s not exclude the diagnosis of asthma. Further studies on the use of bronchodilator response testing are warranted and needed. Recommendation 4. If bronchoprovocation testing is considered, we suggest methacholine challenge testing . (Weak for | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion The Work Group did not develop a recommendation specifically addressing the usefulness of bronchoprovocation testing. However, if bronchoprovocation testing is considered, the Work Group suggests methacholine challenge testing. The Work Group reviewed five individual studies ,[25-29] with 1,171 total patients, that reported on the performance of methacholine challenge testing for diagnosing asthma . The participants included both children and adults, and all five studies utilized some form of clinical diagnosis as a component of the reference test. The outcomes analyzed were sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV. The studies reported a mean sensitivity of 76.2%, specificity of 76.2%, NPV of 81.1%, and PPV of 77% . The Work Group also considered an analysis of potential benefits and harms related to methacholine challenge testing. Exposure to methacholine does incur some risk , as there is a possibility of inducing asthma exacerbation during the testing process and patients may have widely varying tolerance for the risk associated with this test . Additionally, methacholine challenge testing is time and resource intensive. While methacholine challenge testing will typically be available in most hospitals, it is unlikely to be available in smaller ambulatory clinics. While bronchoprovocation testing is not mandatory in the standard diagnostic workup for asthma, it may be useful for the clarification of the diagnosis of asthma in select cases. In this setting, we suggest methacholine challenge testing ove r other forms of bronchoprovocation. Depending upon the patient characteristics, the clinician's experience, and the clinical resourcing of the individual facility, it may be appropriate for methacholine challenge testing to be ordered by the specialist or in conjunction with a specialty referral. Additionally, the Work Group re viewed the evidence related to effectiveness of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea testing compared to exercise challenge testing in the SR by Dryden et al. (2010), [30] which found that the mean sensitivity and specificity of eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea testing did not approach the levels needed to make a recommendation for this testing. The evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update did not identify evidence related to exercise challenge testing except as a comparator to other testing modalities. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 30 of 156 As this is a Reviewed, New -Replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update .[25-30] The Work Group determined that the confidence in the quality of evidence in support of methacholine challenge testing for diagnosis of asthma was low. The benefits and harms related to methacholine challenge testing were balanced. Although there are some potential harms, it can be beneficial in the diagnosis for some patients and is preferable to other bronchoprovocation tests. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak For\" recommendation. Recommendation 5. We recommend against offering computed tomography scan to diagnose asthma in patients with persistent airflow obstruction post -bronchodilator. (Strong against | Reviewed, New -added) Discussion Zhang et al. (2014) conducted a prospective cohort study investigating the use of high- resolution computed tomography (CT) to evaluate various measures of airway remodeling in adult patients with asthma.[ 31] The study found a statistically significant difference in bronchial wall thickness between asthma and control groups in only one of five anatomic levels. No differences were seen between the study and control group for any other measures. The strength of evidence of this study was determined to be very low due to serious limitations in study quality, indirectness, and imprecision. As this is a Reviewed, New added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidenc e related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [31] The Work Group determined the confidence in the quality of evidence related to this recommendation was very low in support of CT in diagnosing asthma. Studies have found increased cancer risks related to radiation exposure, particularly in the pediatric population. [32,33] Radiation exposure related to imaging studies is a concern often raised by adult patients. The International Commission on Radiologic Protection estim ates that 3 -6 radiation -induced cancers will occur o ver a 15 -20 year period per 100, 000 persons screened. [34] The harms of using CT scanning to diagnose asthma greatly outweigh any potential benefit for its use. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong Against\" recommendation. In addition, access to CT scanning and acceptability of CT scanning may be highly variable for patients due to geographic and cost issues. CT has been used to evaluate other post- deployment dyspnea, but is not needed to confirm asthma. Recommendation 6. In adults and children with asthma, we suggest identifying known risk factors of asthma -related outcomes including overweight/obesity, atopy, secondhand smoke exposure in children, and history of lower respiratory infection. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) 7. In adults with asthma, we suggest identifying known risk factors of asthma -related ou tcomes including depression, current smokers , and Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom combat deployment. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 31 of 156 Discussion As these are Reviewed, New -Replaced recommendation s, the Work Group systematically revie wed evidence related to risk factors that predict onset and exacerbations of asthma in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [6,35-46] The evidence for each identified risk factor is discussed as follows: OIF/OEF Combat Deployment Combat deployment is a risk factor unique to Service Members and Veterans. Rivera et al. (2 018) found a statistically significant association between OIF/OEF combat deployment and incidence of new -onset asthma in adults. [6] The longitudinal cohort study involved 75,770 military participants over 12 years. The primary outcome of interest in the systematic evidence review was self -reported physician -diagnosed new -onset asthma at follow -up. The Work Group found that burn- pit exposure was associated with no greater increase in the risk for development of asthma than non -burn- pit deployment. [6] The Work Group also considered the \"Defense Health Board: Deployment Pulmonary Health\" report (2015). [47] This report cites a fairly heterogeneous body of references, most of which did not meet criteria for the evidence review of this CPG (see Appendix A for more information on the methodology of the SR ). However, the Work Group acknowledges that there has been significant attention given to association between exposure to potential inhalational hazards during deployment and possible adverse pulmonary health outcomes, and that the Defense Health Board seeks to further develop recommendations for post - deployment screening and surveillance for pulmonary disease. Additional research is ongoing, which may modify our understanding of a possible association between OIE/OEF combat deployment and asthma. Clear data on the association between other deployments and asthma were not identified and reviewed as part of the systematic evidence review carried out as part of this guideline update. Obesity The Work Group found evidence that overweight/obesity is a risk factor for asthma -related outcomes. Ahmadizar et al. (201 6), an SR of five studies , found that overweight/ obesity was associated with an increased risk of asthma exacerbation in children. [35] An SR of six cohort studies by Egan et al. (2013) found that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of new -onset asthma in children (relative risk [ RR]= 1.35 for overweight, RR= 1.5 for obesity).[ 36] Severe obesity ( body mass index [BMI]>50) in adults was found to be significantly associated with poorly controlled asthma in a retrospective cohort study of 2.8 million participants ove r 4.5 years.[ 37] Additionally, Schatz et al. (2015) found a statistically significan t association between obesity and short -acting beta agonist use, as well as ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma in adults. [38] A retrospective cohort study of 72,086 patients by Luthe et al. (2018) found obesity to be associated with longer length of stay for adults with asthma- related hospitalizations, as well as increased risk of need for mechanical ventilation (odds ratio [OR]= 1.77). [48] The Work Group determined that the overall strength of evidence for overweight/obesity as a risk factor for asthma- related outcomes was very low. Atopy The Work Group reviewed the evidence from two retrospective cohort studies conducted in adults ,[39,40] as well as two SRs of studies conducted in children. [41,42] The overall streng th of evidence was very low . The studies showed that adults with a history of atopy and allergic rhinitis had a higher risk of new -onset VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 32 of 156 asthma. The evidence also demonstrated a higher risk of hospitalization and hospital readmission in children with asthm a with allergic diseases . Second hand Smoke Exposure in Children Three SRs examined an evidence base of over 200,000 patients. [41,43,44] The evidence demonstrated that secondhand smoke exposure in children was associated with a higher risk of severe asthma exacerbation, as indicated by hospital admission, ED or urgent care visit (strength of evidence [SOE] : very low). Additionally, children exposed to secondhand smoke were at increased risk for having lower forced expiratory volume/forced vital capacity ( asthma ( SOE: low). Although secondhand smoke can pose risks in adults, t he evidence review did not identify studies that met inclusion criteria that looked at the effect of secondhand smoke in adults. Lower Respiratory Tract Infection A prospective cohort study of 5,197 patients found that children with a history of early -life lower respiratory tract infection were at a higher risk of developing new -onset asthma by age 10. [45] A retrospective cohort study of 1,554 adults found that bronchitis and sinusitis were significantly associated with new -onset asthma, while pneumonia was not (SOE: Low ).[39] Depression Zhang et al. (2016) found that adults with both depression and combined psychologic dysfunction (PD) had an increased risk of asthma exacerbation. [46] There was also an increased risk of unscheduled medical visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations for patients with depression and PD (SOE: low). Current Smoking In a retrospective cohort study of 1 ,554 patients, Jamrozik et al. (2009) found a statistically significant association between current smoking and risk of new -onset asthma in adults (OR= 1.9; SOE: low).[39] Tobacco smoking is associated with accelerated decline of lung function in patients with asthma and increases in asthma severity based on guidance from another organization cited in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG. [49] As smoking is a known risk factor, recent research is limited. Other Factors The systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG update did not identify evidence related to metabolic syndrome, anxiety disorder, or depression in children as risk factors for asthma- related outcomes. Additionally, while several of the risk factors identified above are considered modifiable, the Work Group did not specifically review evidence related to the impact of modification of these risk factors . Further research is needed to investigate whether interventions aimed at decreasing these risk factors may help reduce risk of poor outcomes in patients with asthma. The Work Group did not specifically review evidence related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD ) as a risk factor for asthma. Studies that were included in the 2009 CPG did not meet current inclusion criteria for the 2018 CPG or have sufficient quality of evidence upon which to make a recommendation for screening for GERD. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 33 of 156 Although the Work Group did not specifically review evidence for the following risk factors, indoor and outdoor allergen s have been identified by other expert review panels. [50] However, this information was not included in the systematic evidence review carried out for this CPG (and there fore did not contribute to the recommendation or its strength). In drafting these recommendations, the Work Group also considered an analysis of potential benefits, harms, and patient values related to screening for the risk factors identified above. In general, patients are likely to be amenable to providing this information as part of the medical history, and there is little harm in asking about these risk factors/behaviors. However, additional screening can require further time and resources. The Work Group also recommended that certain screening questions may be more appropriately targeted towards specific populations (e.g., screening for OIF/OEF deployment would not be necessary in children). While further review is needed to investigate whether interve ntions to modify these risk factors may improve outcomes in patients with asthma, there is value to the clinician in being aware of factors that will put the patient at risk of frequent or severe asthma exacerbations. B. Treatment and Management a. Asthma Education Recommendation 8. We suggest offering a written asthma action plan to improve asthma -related quality of life. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion This weak recommendation was based on low quality evidence from the SR by Gatheral e t al. (2017). [51] This SR and meta -analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing personalized asthma action plans (PAAPs) in adults with asthma to no PAAPs found no significant effects on asthma exacerbations or healthcare utilization. One of the randomized trials in the review did show a statistically significant difference in asthma control as measured by changes from baseline control on questionnaire scores. Three of the RCTs reviewed showed a statistically significant but modest improvement in qua lity of life scores. Additionally, the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update included trials by Khan et al. (2014) and Wong et al. (2013) which compared written asthma action plans (WAAPs) to no WAAPs in children with asthma. [52,53] No differences in asthma exacerbations or healthcare utilization were detected in either of these studies. Wong et al. (2013) also did not detect a difference in asthma control or quality of life scores. [53] The overall confidence in the quality of the evidence was low. There were wide confidence intervals for most outcomes. The term WAAP has been replaced in more recent literature by PAAP . The change in terminology emphasizes that these asthma action plans are individualized for particular patients; furthermore, the patient participates in the process of developing the plan. They are not typically stand -alone interventions, but rather an integrated component of asthma self- management education. PAAPs are also integrated into regular medical follow -up and are periodically reviewed and adjusted. Formats for PAAPs can vary significantly, but their main feature includes instructions to help patients maintain control of their asthma and to recognize and respond to loss of control. The patient focus group that was conducted fo r this CPG update suggested that patients are receptive to the use of a PAAP. It provides an organized approach for day -to-day maintenance and a plan for what to VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 34 of 156 do when loss of symptom control occurs. Reviewing the PAAP with providers can provide an oppor tunity to ask questions, express concerns , and share values and preferences. Adherence to the plans may be poor or diminish over time, but the plans themselves are not likely to be viewed as burdensome by patients. Providers, on the other hand, may see PAAPs as a burden. The time to complete and review them with patients competes with other priorities during the office visit. Lack of strong evidence for their effectiveness in the recent medical literature may limit buy -in by providers. Providers who are req uired to provide a PAAP to patients to meet a quality metric may see it as another form to complete and might not take a patient -centered approach. A PAAP may also be a requirement for school in pediatric patients. In this situation they may be seen as an essential communication tool between the primary care provider and school -based healthcare providers. Other considerations are the availability of printers and PAAP templates. Templates for PAAPs can simplify the process. Integration of PAAPs into the elec tronic health record (EHR) can also facilitate their regular review and adjustment. Currently, the DoD EHR has a linked PAAP template, but the VA EHR does not. Example asthma action plans can be found in Appendix E . Our recommendation contrasts with the 2009 VA/Do D Asthma CPG, which strongly recommended the use of WAAPs . The relevant recommendations in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG were informed by SRs that did show improvement in asthma outcomes in adults [ 54] and children [ 55] with the use of asthma action plans as part of a multifaceted self- management program involving primary care provider review. The Gatheral et al. (2017) SR, which is used to support the current recommendation, aimed at isolating the effect that PAAPs have on asthma outcomes. [51] It is possible that PAAPs may be a key component of effective multifaceted interventions , but primary care provid ers would more likely be using PAAPs without the additional benefits of multifaceted self- management programs. As this recommendation is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to th is recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [51] After reviewing the evidence, the Work Group determined that the confidence in the quality of the evidence for the effect of PAAP on asthma outcomes was lower than what would be required for a strong evidence -based recommendation . Our Work Group's \"W eak for\" recommendation reflects both the low quality of the evidence and the fact that benefit was seen only in quality of life, not for other outcomes such as exacerbations and healthcare utilization. The confidence intervals for these outcomes were large, so it is possible that PAAPs might affect them. Further research with sufficient ly powered studies is required to improve the confidence in the effect of this intervention on asthma outcomes. Recommendation s 9. We suggest offering asthma education. (Weak for | Reviewed, New -replaced) 10. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one particular asthma education program or education component(s) over others. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed , New -replaced) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 35 of 156 Discussion The evidence base for asthma education considered by the Work Group included 16 RCTs [ 56-71] and one SR encompassing 12 RCTs. [72] Unfortunately, the evidence for the benefit of asthma education is only indirect. This is because asthma education is part of routine care , and it would be impractical or unethical for research studies to have a group with no education. However the evidence reviewed support s \"more\" or \"better\" education, indirectly supporting the benefit of asthma education in general. Plaza, et al. (2015), for example, shows an overall benefit of education ( including basic asthma information, a PAAP, and a review of inhaler technique) over usual care alone. [56] In this case, education contributed to improved asthma control, number of exacerbations, unscheduled medical visits, and asthma -related quality of life at one year, but no difference w as detected in number of ED visits or hospitalizations. Studies as a whole show inconsistent benefit of asthma education across several outcomes, including asthma control, asthma- related quality of life, exacerbation frequency, healthcare utilization, and adherence. Therefore, the overall assessment of the importance of asthma education as a whole on critical outcomes is largely based on the likelihood of benefit versus the likelihood of harm. Education is unlikely to cause harm, and burdens imposed by education programs are likely to be limited, such as the commitment of necessary time and resources. Benefit, on the other hand, is highly probable, but likely to be highly variable based on patient values and preferences, particularly when considering patient age, highest level of education, geographic location, and cultural background. Various studies addressed the impact of specific constituents of asthma education, but no single component or method was clearly superior to others. Approaches to education that were studied included print materials; personalized action plans; review of inhaler indications and technique; review of triggers; and phone -based, as well as clinic -based, close follow -up. Educational interventions also varied on cultural approaches, duration of interventions, and individual versus group methods. It remains unclear if education customized to cultural background is beneficial. Two of the better quality RCTs, for example, evaluated an evidence -based, culturally sensitive family education program for children aged 5 -12 years with poorly controlled asthma in Puerto Rico and found conflicting results. [57,58] The first study randomized 221 participants to receive five flyers with educational information. The authors found statistically significant improvement in asthma control at four months as well as a decrease in ED visits and hospitalizations at six months. [57] The second study randomized 404 participants to an expanded version of culturally sensitive asthma education that included home visits and telephone calls.[ 58] The study was limited by suboptimal implementation of the intervention, but nonetheless there was no statistically significant difference between groups in asthma control, self-reported ED visits, or hospitalizations at six months. In addition, it is unce rtain what duration of asthma education is most beneficial. Indinnimeo et al. (2009) showed long- term education, including a clinic diary and educational games for children, decreased the number of reported asthma attacks but did not significantly change use of systemic steroids, ED visits, or hospitalizations at 12 months. [64] A shorter duration study by Gagne et al. (2017) showed that a decision aid added to asthma education did not improve asthma control by the Asthma Control Scoring System (ACSS) at two months. [59] Another study by Morell et al. (2014) showed that two five -minute educational VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 36 of 156 interventions three months apart successfully improved asthma control and decreased general practitioner visits for exacerbations at six months. [63] It also remains unclear whether individual or group education is more effective. Goeman et al. (2013) compared individualized, person -centered education tailored to responses from a patient questionnaire to passive education. They found a statistically significant difference favoring individualized, person -centered education for asthma control and asthma- related qualify of life, but there was no significant difference in adherence or exacerbations at 12 months. [62] Taskin Yilmaz and Cinar (2015) found that a group education session along with a printed education manual improved asthma control, exacerbation frequency, and asthma -related quality of life at four months compared to usual care. [61] However, Arikan - Ayyildiz et al. (2016) found that their group education program did not significantly improve asthma control, healthcare utilization, or self- reported exacerbations at three months compared to usual care. [60] The literature reviewed also showed conflicting results regarding benefit of asthma education outside the clinic setting, particularly when considering home -based and school -based education interventions. The most convincing evidence exis ts for school -based asthma education as a means to improve asthma outcomes in children with asthma. Cicutto et al. (2013) randomized participants across 170 schools to receive school -based asthma self- management education delivered by a public health nurse , with 1,172 children completing the study. [67] At 12 months, there was a statistically significant improvement in asthma -related quality of life as well as urgent care or ED use. Halterman et al. (2011) randomized 523 children to a school -based program wherein a school nurse administered asthma medications in addition to in -home counseling sessions and follow -up telephone calls. [71] The authors found a statistically significant difference favoring the intervention for number of days with rescue medication use and exacerbations requiring prednisone. Meanwhile, some smaller studies failed to show benefit to school- based interventions. For example, Praena- Crespo et al. (2017) randomized 381 grade school students to an asthma sport and health education program with teaching integrated with physical education classes. [70] The authors found no statistically significant difference for asthma control or asthma -related quality of life. Similarly, three other studies did not find a statistically significant improvement in critical asthma outcomes for school- based programs. [66,68,69] One SR assessed the impact of home -based asthma education interventions on asthma outcomes. [72] The authors assessed 12 RCTs enrolling 2,342 children with asthma and did not find a statistically significant benefit to home -based education on the primary outcome of number of patients with exacerbations requiring ED visits at six months or at 18 months or on exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. Thus, the evidence did not support a recommendation for home -based asthma education. As Recommendation 9 is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [56-72] The Work Group offers a weak recommendation in favor of offering asthma education; the overall confidence in the quality of evidence is low. The benefits of this recommendation slightly outweigh the harms and burdens. Education requires resources, particularly time and labor, yet some benefit was seen with even the brief, five -minute interventions. We anticipate a large variation in patient values and preferences regarding education, particularly by age and education levels. Other VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 37 of 156 considerations that impact this recommendation include subgroup considerations, such as geographic location and cultural background. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \" Weak for\" rec ommendation. As Recommendation 10 is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [57-64,66-72] The Work Group recommends neither for nor against one particular asthma education program or education component(s) over others. The overall confidence in the quality of evidence was low. Data was insufficient to isolate benefit or superiority of one particular component of education over others, and most studies required a broader interpretation of educational interventions as a whole. The benefits of most individual education components likely outweigh any potenti al harms, though there is likely to be some variation in patient preference and values. Other implications include acceptability of different education components, particularly with regard to children with asthma and the role their parents may be required to play, in addition to anticipated concerns regarding resource requirements. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Neither for nor against\" recommendation. Recommendation 11. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against patient -oriented technologies (e.g., mobile apps, web based, or telemedicine) as a means to reduce the number or severity of asthma-related exacerbations. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion Review of the literature revealed no supporting evidence to recommend either for or against patient - oriented technologies as a method to reduce the number or severity of asthma -related exacerbations. Four SRs and 10 individual studies were identified and provided very low confidence in the quality of the evidence. [73-86] The evidence mixed for asthma severity, treatment adherence, and asthma control and were limited by small sample sizes and short follow -ups. An SR of 12 RCTs by Hui et al. (2017) examined use of mobile application and showed a positive impact of these tools on asthma control.[ 73] T he most optimal mobile applications included multiple features to support patient self -management. Another SR of six RCTs by Kew and Cates (2016) examined the use of technology -enabled check -ups compared to face -to-face visits; however, findings were inconclusive. [76] Miller et al. (2017) conducted an SR of 11 RCTs comparing mobile t echnology to paper - based monitoring or standard treatment. [74] Mobile technology showed an impact on unscheduled visits and medication adherence when compared to standard treatment, but the findings were inconclusive when compared to paper -based monitoring. The last SR of 39 RCTs by Normansell et al. (2017) showed a positive impact of electronic inhalers trackers on treatment adherence, but was inconclusive on the clinically relevant outcome on asthma control, number of exacerbations, or health care utilization.[ 75] Most individual studies identified were relatively small, with short follow -up, and/or inconclusive for critical outc omes .[77-86] As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed ev idence related to this recommendation.[ 73-86] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is very low. Due to the lack of strong data coupled with the large variation in patient preferences regarding mobile technology applications, the Work Group decided upon a \"Neither for nor against\" VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 38 of 156 recommendation on the use of patient -oriented technologies as a means to reduce the number and severity of asthma- related exacerbations. b. Pharmacotherapy Recommendation 12. For patients with persistent asthma, we recommend inhaled corticosteroids as initial controller medication. (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion An SR and meta -analysis of RCTs, comparing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) against leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), showed a significant decrease in asthma exacerbations requiring systemic steroids and hospitalizations favoring ICS. [87] While a few other studies had differing findings, these were smaller and lower quality studies. [88,89] The use of ICS was also associated with a decrease in incident pneumonia according to a study by Bansal et al. (2015). [90] When prescribing ICS, the lowest effective dose to control asthma should be utilized to minimize potential side effects. Broersen et al. (2015) showed that there is a risk for adrenal suppression with the use of ICS, although this risk is lower when compared to systemic steroids. [91] Decreased linear growth in children associated with use of ICS is also a consideration. Loke et al. (2015) analyzed an RCT comparing ICS versus non -ICS control with a 4.3 year mean follow -up, showing a mean decrease in final adult height by 1.2 cm. [92] Seve ral studies show that higher doses of ICS are associated with a more significant decrease in height velocity. [87,92,93] Review s of studies by Kramer et al. (2013) and Singh et al. (2016) do not sufficiently show benefit for any specific ICS, compared to another ICS, in regard to efficacy or side -effect profile. [94,95] However, evidence may emerge in the near future that supports the superiority of a specific ICS. Despite general consistency in the evidence supporting the use of ICS as initial maintenance therapy for patients with persistent asthma, there is some variability in provider, patient, and patient's guardian preferences regarding this treatment. Potential medical profile and career implications may need to be considered for active duty Service Members. Although most medical providers accept the use of ICS therapy, the patient or parent/guardian of a child with asthma may be hesitant to use ICS due to concerns for potential medication side effects. Detailed education and discussion about the benefits versus potential side effects of ICS therapy may be required in these situations. Moreover, the diagnosis of asthma in some children may not be obvious to the parent/guardian, which may lead to hesitancy in using ICS. LTRA has indications for use in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. The 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG recommendations included the use of LTRA as an alternative to ICS for mild persistent asthma. This recommendation is not carried forward based upon additional evidence for the benefits of ICS therapy significantly mitigating the risks of a severe asthma exacerbation compared to LTRA. Given the overlap in allergic rhinitis and asthma, patients may be prescribed LTRA alone for allergic rhinitis, and have poorly controlled asthma long term if ICS is not considered. Certain aspects of asthma care are beyond the scope of this review, as they are part of standard care and therefore do not require a literature review. Standard of care for asthma treatment involves well-known VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 39 of 156 protocols that provide guidelines for the initial and subsequent categorization of asthma severity ( see Appendix B ) as well as the use of short -acting beta agonist ( SABA) rescue inhaler. These protocols typically also include a step care approach (see Module C of the algorithm). As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation. [87-95] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is moderate. The body of evidence had some limitations such as high attrition and limited information on allocation concealment . Other considerations regarding this recommendation included the benefits, specifically a decrease in hospitalizations and a decrease in exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, outweighing the potential harm of adrenal suppression and decreased linear growth velocity , which was small with overall limited clinical relevance. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Strong for\" recommendation . Recommendation 13. Among patients with moderate -to-severe persisten t asthma and significant symptom burden, we suggest offering a combination of inhaled corticosteroi d and long- acting beta agonist as initial controller treatment . (Weak for | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion The Work Group made a strong recommendation for ICS as initial controller therapy medication ( see Recommendation 1 2). The evidence for addition of a long -acting beta agonist (LABA) to an ICS as a controller medication is low for preventing exacerbations, [96] but moderate for symptom control. [97] This was true for adults [98] and children. [99] Therefore, this recommendation applies specifically to patients with moderate -to-severe persistent asthma and significant symptom burden (see Appendix B for additional information on assessment of asthma severity). Most of the studies identified through the systematic evidence review were for the addition of LABA to already existing therapy, but at least one reference addressed using ICS/ LABA as first -line therapy.[ 97] LABA was when combined with ICS [ 89,100, 101] and LTRA was superior to the addition of theophylline. [102] There was no evidence that one specific brand of LABA was superior to another.[ 103- 105] One SR [106] and another single study [107] suggested that long- acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) may be added to ICS as initial controller medication in adults to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations , but it was not conclusive that this combination was superior to the ICS/LABA combination . There were concerns that beta agonist use alone was detrimental; however, when long -acting agents are used in combination with an ICS, the safety profile is similar to placebo. [108] Despite this safety profile, some patients do experience some side effects (including the patients that participated in the patient focus group conducted as part of this guideline update), which makes the benefit slightly outweigh any harms encountered. Despite general consistency in the evidence to recommend a LABA, there were some suggestions that a LAMA could be substituted in adults. [106, 107] This recommendation is similar to several recommendations in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG and is common practice among providers. Some patient subgroups , such as the elderly and young children , may be more sensitive to the adverse effects of LABA. There may also be a cost savings when a combination is given to reduce the number of co -pays (in circumstances in which co -pays apply) . There may also be some VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 40 of 156 compliance improvements with the combination, although this question was not addressed by the evidence review. The level of symptoms that might trigger the addition of LABA to ICS is an individual decision that needs to be part of the SDM process b etween the provider and the patient. The considerations for addition might be very different in an ac tive duty member of the military versus a sedentary office worker. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically revie wed evidence related to this recommendation. [89,96-108] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low for the addition of LABA to ICS as initial controller treatment for patients with moderate -to-severe persistent asthma and significant symptom burden. The body of evidence had some limitations, such as confounders in the analysis . Other considerations regarding this recommendatio n included weighing the potential harm of adverse events, which was small, against potential benefit. Patient values and preferences were thought to be somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation . Recommendation 14. For patie nts with asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids alone, we suggest adding long - acting beta agonists as a step- up treatment over increasing inhaled corticosteroids alone or adding long- acting muscarinic antagonists or leukotriene receptor antagonis ts. (Weak for | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion In patients who are uncontrolled on ICS alone, we recommend adding a LABA over other treatment options. The 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG found the addition of a LABA to ICS therapy was more efficacious than increasing the intensity of ICS treatment. However, the Work Group at that time recommended increasing ICS preferentially to adding an LABA as step -up therapy for patients not controlled on ICS alone, citing safety concerns reported at the time with the use of LABA in persistent asthma. Since that time, additional research has validated the effectiveness and safety of this combination approach for asthma management with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently withdrawing the black box labeling requirements for ICS/LABA combination products. [109] Methods to determine comparative daily dosages of the approved ICS products at low, medium, and high intensities are complex and follow FDA-approved measurements. The section on Additional Information on Drugs Used in Treatment of Asthma provides information on available products. The Work Group did not perform a focused review of all the individual studies included in the SRs that met inclusion criteria for the systematic evidence review conducted for this CPG, but relied on the author s' discussion and conclusions. ICS/LABA has been shown to reduce exacerbations and decrease treatment withdrawals due to adverse events when compared to higher dose ICS. An SR by Zhao et al. (2015) of 35 RCTs with a network meta- analysis comparing combination low-dose ICS/LABA to monotherapy with low - and high- dose ICS (high dose was defined as anything greater than low dose) show ed a 31% decrease in exacerbation with fewer adverse events for ICS/LABA compared to higher dose ICS in pediatric patients. [100] An SR by Dwan et al. (2016) showed statistically significant improvements in Asthma Control Test ( ACT) scores, spirometry , nighttime peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) , and number of adverse events in adults and children with ICS/LABA compared to higher dose ICS while changes in exacerbations, and other quality of life outcomes, were not statistically significant and/or were inconclusive. [105] Peters et al. (2016) co nducted an RCT in patients 12 years of age VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 41 of 156 and older that resulted in decreases in exacerbations and improvements in Asthma Control Questionnaire 6 (ACQ -6) scores that were statistically significant while the outcomes of safety and side effects were inconc lusive.[ 98] The SRs of the evidence c omparing different ICS/LABA products were not statistically significant and were inconclusive for the outcomes of exacerbations, quality of life, asthma control, serious adverse events , and spirometry.[ 104, 105] Furthermore, Bernstein et al. (2011) conducted a 12 -week, open -label, non - inferiority efficacy and safety trial in patients 12 years of age and older comparing two ICS/LABA combinations (mo metasone furoate/formoterol versus fluticasone propionate/salmeter ol) that showed both products were effective and safe. [103] Typically, the decision to use three or more medications is made in specialty care environments with patient s with confirmed asthma diagnoses. Patients who have uncontrolled asthma while on two medications, one of which is an ICS, may benefit from referral to specialty care for further evaluation. The Work Group reviewed evidence related to the effectiveness and safety of other treatments compared to ICS/LABA. Much of the evidence included in the SRs and/or RCTs was of low or moderate quality and many results were not statistically significant and/or inconclusive. In patients for whom LABA is contraindicated or intolerable (see Table F -1 for product -specific warnings), other combination options using non- preferred drugs may be used. Although the majority of the evidence reviewed supported this recommendation, the overall confidence in the quality of the evidence is rated low because of issues concerning study designs and small sample sizes in a portion of the reviewed literature. ICS/LABA is established practice and generally well accepted by both patients and providers although some pat ients cannot tolerate the side effects of LABA. The patients in the focus group articulated understanding of how the medications improve symptoms and decrease exacerbations but acknowledged obstacles to following treatment regimens. Combination products simplify treatment plans and support improved adherence by avoiding the need for multiple devices or delivery systems. Availability of once -daily dosing of some ICS/LABA products may be appropriate for patients with persistent non- adherence. The addition of LABA to lower doses of ICS is particularly acceptable in the pediatric population because of documented concerns of the effects of ICS on growth velocity and other possible adverse events. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation. [98,100-106,110 ,111 ] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low to support the recommendation to add LABA preferentially over other medications when intensifying treatment in patients on ICS with uncontrolled asthma. The body of evidence had some limitations including flawed study designs, small sample sizes , and confounders in the analysis. The benefits of this recommendation, including improved outcomes of better asthma control, decreased exacerbations , and lower side effects req uiring discontinuation outweigh the potential harm of adverse events , which was small. Patient and caregiver values, preferences , and safety concerns were somewhat varied, particularly in the pediatric population, but these were balanced with the desire for good asthma control and fewer severe exacerbations. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 42 of 156 Single Maintenance a nd Reliever Therapy (SMART) Compared to Other Treatment Options Use of a combination inhaler containing budesonide an d formoterol as both maintenance and quick relief therapy (SMART) has been explored in both pediatric and adult populations. An SR of 16 studies (15 of which described this treatment approach) [ 106] as well as an RCT [ 98] revealed statistically significant and positive effects on the occurrence of serious exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids when compared to same dose ICS, higher dose ICS, same dose ICS/LABA and higher dose ICS/LABA. While this research is positive , at this time, ICS/formoterol combination is not approved for the treatment of acute bronchospasm. Therefore , the Work Group does not recommend this as a current therapeutic option. Recommendation 15. In patients with controlled asthma on a stable medication regimen, we suggest either stepping down (not discontinuing) inhaled corticosteroids dose or discontinuing long- acting beta agonists . (Weak for | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion Standard practice for outpatient management of asthma involves a stepwise approach (see Module C of the algorithm). Treatment decisions are made based on response to controller therapies. Within this approach is the concept of stepping down therapy in patients that have demonstrated control of asthma symptoms over time. The goal of stepping down therapy is to maintain patients on the minimum dose of medication to effectively control their symptoms and risks for exacerbations while mitigating medication side effects. Asthma control questionnaires include, for example, the ACQ and the ACT. It is standard practice to make decision s about stepping down therapy after a patient has maintained asthma control on a regimen for at least three months (see Module C of the algorithm). Clinicians routinely take patient factors into consideration when making decisions about stepping down. Historical information like prior step down failure o r poor adherence with therapy may influence the decision. Even when a patient is on a stable regimen for three or more months, there are instances in which stepping down is ill advised. In clinical practice, stepping down is avoided during pregnancy, times of stress, planned travel, or peak allergen seasons. The stepping down of asthma therapy is an established part of asthma care for patients with controlled disease ; however, the evidence base for this practice is relatively limited. This recommendation is based on four SRs [112- 115] and two RCTs [ 116,117]. The strongest evidence was to avoid complete discontinuation of ICS in adults due to increased exacerbations and asthma symptoms. [114] With respect to stepping down ICS therapy to a lower dose ICS versus continuing a stable dose ICS , the evidence was inconclusive for the outcomes of exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life. [115] However , the same SR demonstrated that stepping down the ICS component of a LABA/ICS versus continuing a stable dose ICS/LABA resulted in equivalent level s of asthma control and asthma- related quality of life. Considering evidence for lower adverse effects at lower ICS dosage, this observation of equivalence supports the decrease in ICS dosage among well -controlled patients. Impact on exacerbations was not statistically significant. Stepping down a patient on LABA/ICS to ICS alone versus continued stable dose LABA/ICS was studied in both the SR by Ahmad et al. (2015) [ 112] and the RCT by Rogers e t al. (2018). [117] The SR found st atistically significant differences favoring continued LABA/ICS therapy with respect to asthma control and asthma -related quality of life. [112] A more recent RCT examining the same LABA step -VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 43 of 156 off found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between groups. [117] Both studies were inconclusive with respect to exacerbations after LABA step -off. As th is is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation. [112-117] Based on th e findings of the systematic evidence review conducted on step -down therapy as part of this guideline update , the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation in favor of stepping down therapy in the specific scenarios reviewed above based on low quality evidence. The Work Group determined that the benefits of stepping down therapy slightly outweighed the harms/burdens of continued therapy in patients with controlled asthma on a stable medication regimen. Each step down of asthma therapy should be considered as a therapeutic trial warranting close patient follow -up. All decisions on step -down therapy must be individualized taking into consideration the patient's clinical history and risk factors for exacerbations, as well as their values and prefere nces. Recommendation 16. We suggest short -acting beta agonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists for prevention of exercise -induced bronchospasm. (Weak for | Not r eviewed , Amended) Discussion Exercise -induced bronchospasm (EIB), commonly referred to in the medical literature as exercise -induced asthma or exercise -induced bronchoconstriction, can be diagnosed in two distinct groups of patients. The first group consists of those patients with est ablished asthma who, during exercise, have a component of bronchospasm that limits their activities. It is reported to occur in up to 9 0% of patients with asthma and is usually a self- limited process that resolves with cessation of exercise. [118] There is a separate group of patients who do not have underlying asthma but may develop symptomatic bronchospasm with prolonged exercise. These patients are generally competitive athletes and can include active duty military who exercise on a regular basis. The evaluation of these patients always demonstrates normal resting spirometry but with airway hyperreactivity upon bronchoprovocation testing. In addition to medications, a non- pharmacolo gic approach to reduce EIB includes warming up prior to exercise. This is usually done in conjunction with the use of a SABA 15 -20 minutes prior to vigorous exercise. A regular exercise program is indicated in patients with asthma to avoid deconditioning and improve cardiovascular health. For patients with EIB, treatment with either a SABA or LTRA has been proven beneficial. [119, 120] Traditionally, a SABA just before exercise was considered first -line treatment for EIB; but review of the evidence shows that LTRAs, at least two hours before exercise, also provide equivalent outcomes in EIB symptom reduction with an effect that extends up to 24 hours. [119, 120] Prevention of EIB is desired both to optimize function of daily activities and avoid complications such as ED visits. Therefore, treat ment with either a SABA or LTRA is of benefit and outweighs the minimal known side -effect profile of these medication s. This recommendation is for the prevention of EIB and it should be noted that all patients with asthma should have access to a rescue inhaler ( i.e., SABA) to treat symptoms should they occur. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 44 of 156 While SABAs have been the mainstay of treatment of EIB, certain populations may benefit from the ease of using an LTRA due to dosing once daily in pill form (at least two hours prior to exercise) as opposed to using an inhaler just before exercise. This is particularly useful for patients with variable levels of activity throughout the day or concomitant allergic rhinitis. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group based this recommendation on the evidenced cited in the previous guideline. [119, 120] The Wor k Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low . Benefits outweigh harms, as there are few harms that a small number of patients may experience. B enefits include better asthma control during exercise. Patient values and preferences were somewhat varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. c. Non -pharmacotherapy Recommendation 17. We suggest a multidisciplinary treatment approach to improve asthma- related quality of life, asthma control, and treatment adherence. (Weak for | Reviewed , New -replaced) Discussion The evidence base for this recommendation consisted of three SRs [ 121- 123] and nine RCTs. [124- 132] A multidisciplinary treatment approach for this recommendation is defined as at least one other healthcare professional in addition to the primary care provider. A myriad of other healthcare professionals provided interventions in these studies including nurses, clinical psychologists, pharmacists, community health workers, respiratory therapists, case managers, pulmonologists, physiotherapists, behavioral health personnel, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and occupational therapists. Interventions were provided by either one supplemental person or multiple personnel. One component underlying all the included studies was focused patient education based upon the patient's needs. Quality of life, per self- reported patient satisfaction, increased with chronic disease management/ education, [121] c ulturally specific 127] education, [128] and behavioral modification education. [122, 129- 131] Though there was moderate quality evidence supporting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT was not a specific program and included any model \"includ ing acceptance and mindfulness -based therapies.\" [122] There was no identifiable combination of team member disciplines preferable that was beneficial over another combination of team member disciplines . Asthma control, per patient self -reported satisfaction, increased with chronic disease management/ education, [121] holistic self-management education, [125] community pharmacist education, [126] and behavioral modification education. [122] \"A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between asthma control and asthma -related quality of life scores.\" [126] Improved asthma control from behavioral modification may be a secondary outcome as identified through patient self- reported increases in quality of life. [122] Asthma treatment adherence, per patient self- reported satisfaction, increased with community pharmacist education. [123, 132] Not all interventions were delivered exclusively by pharmacists, but all interventions had pharmacist input in the education. Primary interventions were behavioral modification VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 45 of 156 based upon goal setting, action planning, and feedba ck demonstrations (e.g., inhaler usage). [123] A patient diary -keeping method showed improvement in medication adherence only after \"the 3rd follow - up to 4th follow -up\"[132] As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed pertinent studies as part of this guideline update. [121- 132] The Work Group determined the overall confidence in the quality of evidence to be low in the support of the recommendation. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \" Weak for\" recommendation. The benefits of using a multidisciplinary treatment approach outweigh harms/burdens. Variation exists in the execution of the multidisciplinary treatment approach; but the one common underlying consistent component to all the included studies was focused patient education based upon the patient's needs. Resource use and feasibility of using a multidisciplinary treatment approach wo uld be influenced by costs, resource availability, community support, and technological advancements (e.g., telemedicine platform). Since the studies were predominately adults, further research is warranted to include adolescent and pediatric populations. Recommendation 18. We suggest patients with asthma participate in regular exercise to improve quality of life and asthma control. (Weak for | Reviewed, Amended) Discussion Patients with asthma should participate in regular exercise to improve quality of life and asthma control. As noted in the 2013 Cochrane SR [133] (which updated the 2005 review [ 134] cited in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG), \"Physical training improved cardiopulmonary fitness...Although there was insufficient data for a meta- analysis on the effects of physical training on health related quality of life, the Carson study does provide evidence, however limited, that phys ical training has positive effects on the quality of life of asthma patients.\" [133] The 2013 Cochrane SR compared several studies, showing that the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for patients with asthma .[133] The SR found that asthma symptom management, lung function, and mental health improved with regular aerobic exercise. Exercise training may also reduce the perception of breathlessness through a number of mechanisms including strengthening respiratory muscle s. The SR also noted that exercise may reduce airway inflammation and increase patency of bronchioles, thereby having a protective effect against asthma development. In some patients with asthma, exercise can provoke bronchoconstriction; however, patients may also experience worsening breathlessness with a lack of conditioning. The 2013 Cochrane review also noted that studies have shown that people with asthma are able to exercise and improve their fitness and that limitations in exercise capacity can sometimes relate more to lack of fitness than to airflow limitation. Based on the research conducted by Eichenberger et al. (2013), the quality of life of patients with asthma considerably improves with physical training and that changes through decrease in airway hyperactivity and improvement in lung function significantly contribute to this improvement. [118] In the research conducted by Flapper et al. (2008), which examined a physical exercise program along with self- management education, there were improvements in pediatric quality of life with outcomes of decreased school absenteeism of patients with asthma .[135] The 2013 Cochrane review also noted studies have shown that people with asthma are able to exercise and improve their fitness and that limitations in VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 46 of 156 exercise capacity can sometimes relate more to lack of fitness than to airflow limitation. [133] Thus, physical activity should be recommended as a supplementary therapy to medication. As this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed the evidence identified in the evidence review conducted for this CPG update [118, 133, 135] and considered the assessment of the evid ence put forth in the 2009 CPG. [134] There was some evidence of benefit and no evidence of adverse effects on asthma symptoms caused by physical training. Thus, there was no clinical reason for people with stable asthma to refrain from regular exercise. [133] Eichenberger et al. ( 2013) states about 90% of patients with asthma suffer from exercise -induced bronchoconstriction ( i.e., airway narrowing and increased airway resistance during or after exercise ) which might prevent patients with asthma from performing regular physical exercise. [118] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low, specifically regarding outcomes including asthma control/symptoms, exacerbations , and quality of life. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation that exercise will improve quality of life and asthma control in this popu lation. Recommendation 19. We suggest offering cognitive behavioral t herapy as a means of improving asthma- related quality of life and self- reported asthma control for adult patients with persistent asthma. (Weak for | Reviewed , New -added) Discussion In an SR of six studies, Kew et al. (2016) found that CBT may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels for adults with persistent asthma when compared to usual care or no intervention. [122] Studies included 214 adult participants with mean age s ranging from 39 to 53 ; no adolescents or children were included in the studies. There was much variation between studies in how CBT was delivered and what constituted usual care, meaning the most optimal method of CBT delivery, format, and target population requires further investigation. While CBT may have modest benefits for people with asthma, the current body of literature reviewed offers little insight into the possible harms of CBT. [122] When indicated, healthcare providers are encouraged to address any questions or concerns their patients may have related to the possible harms and stigma associated with counseling services.a Further more , the majority of studies in the SR by Kew et al. (2016) included intensive interventions which may not be feasible for patients and program resources. [122] Brief consultation provided by mental health professionals integrated within the primary care setting may offer the best model for optimizing services ; however, further research is needed in th is area.[ 136] As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group s ystematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review as part of this guideline update. [122] The Work Group determined the confidence in the evidence was moderate in support of CBT as a means of improving asthma -related quality of life and self- reported asthma control for adult patients with persistent asthma. Other support for this recommendation ste mmed from the Work Group's assessment that the a See the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Major Depressive Disorder (2016) (available at: https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/MH/mdd/ ). VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 47 of 156 benefits of this recommendation slightly outweigh the associated harms and burdens. Further , behavioral health consultants already embedded within primary care clinics may be able to mitigate concerns related to resources and stigma. Finally, additional research is need to determine the optimal delivery method, format, and target population when treating patients with asthma in primary care. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak for\" recommendation. d. Monitoring and Follow -up Recommendation 20. We suggest against utilizing spirometry for routine monitoring of patients with stable asthma. (Weak against | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion The diagnosis of asthma is a clinical diagnosis based on history, physical examination , and findings suggestive of airway hyperactivity. While objective measurements of airway reactivity, specifically reversible obstruction post -bronchodilator, may be helpful in the diagnosis of asthma, the lack of objective reversibilit y does not disqualify the diagnosis. Furthermore, t he use of spirometry in routine monitoring of patients with asthma was not found to significantly improve patient outcomes on the standardized ACT . An RCT by Oei et al. (2011) demonstrated no statistically significant difference between patients who received spirometry every three months v ersu s patients who received only routine medical follow - up.[137] Similarly, in patients with fixed obstruction and incomplete bronchodilator reversal, there is insufficient evidence to provide recommendations regarding follow -up spirometry. Review of the literature found a single cohort study in which children with asthma symptoms and a fixed, non- reversible airflow obstruction were unlikely to change at 12 months. [21] Associated literature regarding a similar evaluation of the adult population was not identified for review. Although a recommendation related to routine monitoring of patients with stable asthma was included in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG, that recommendation was based on guidance from other organizations. Current literature does not support routine ( e.g., quarte rly) spirometry for stable patients with asthma in the general population. However, there may be specific requirements that need to be considered for active duty members of the military). While there are no obvious harm s associated with spirometry, there may be added burden and many patients (especially the very young or elderly) may have difficulty performing an adequate/reproducible test. Accessibility for repeated visits may be burdensome to both patients and staff. In addition, not every facility may have easy access to proper equipment or trained personnel. At some facilities, a provider may need to wait for test results. If during this time the provider does not consider the symptoms to guide treatment, the harms of obtaining the test may outweigh the benefits. For these reasons, a recommendation of \"We ak A gainst \" was suggested. Although the reviewed literature does not support routine use of spi rometry in monitoring of patients with stable asthma, there does not appear to be significant variability in patient preference for this test. [137] The patient focus group revealed no comments or concerns regarding spirometry. As this is a Reviewed, New -replaced recommendation, the Work Group systematically rev iewed evidence related to this recommendation identified through the systematic evidence review .[21,137] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low. The body of evidence had some limitations VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 48 of 156 including small sample size s and unclear randomization. The benefits v ersu s harms appeared to be balanced. Patient values and preferences were not varied. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \"Weak against\" recommendation. Recommendation 21. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine use of fractional exhaled nitric oxide in monitoring patients in primary care settings to improve asthma- related clinical outcomes. (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New -replaced) Discussion Human lungs produce nitric oxide (NO) and a fraction of NO can be measured in exhaled breath ( fractional exhaled nitric oxide [ FeNO]). FeNO has been extensively studied in various diseases and specifically for asthma. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) pu blished an extensive document about interpretation of exhaled NO level.[ 138] Our evidence review focused on the role of routine measurement of FeNO on management of asthma and important clinical outcomes in the primary care setting. Two large SRs by Petsky et al. (2018) [ 139] and Wang et al. (2015) [ 44] looked at various important clinical outcomes. Asthma exacerbations occurred significantly less often in the FeNO group compared to control. The confidence in the quality of the data was assessed as moderate for both SRs. In contrast, several clinically important outcomes , including exacerbations requiring systemic steroid and healthcare utilization , did not differ significantly in the FeNO management groups compared to control. An RCT by Szefler et al. (2008) evaluated various clinical outcomes when FeNO measurement -driven guideline management of asthma was compared to control. [140] The quality of the data was rated as moderate. Treatment adherence and healthcare utilization did not differ between the two groups. As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update .[44,139, 140] The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence is low . Significant differences in exacerbation outcomes were most likely driven by improvement in milder forms of exacerbations. The Work Group determined there was little harm with the use of FeNO. The Work Group also did not perceive any significant variation among patients to accept the test. However, implementation of a new test is resource intensive and not all centers may have easy and timely access to the testing . Thus, the Work Group decided upon a \" Neither for nor against \" recommendation. In summary, use of FeNO in primary care practice may reduce milder forms of asthma exacerbations but this may not outweigh the issues related to resource use. Thus, the Work Group did not recommend for or against the use of FeNO in primary care management of asthma. The Work Group did not assess the value of FeNO in a subspecialty setting. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 49 of 156 Recommendation 22. We suggest leveraging electronic health record capabilities such as trackers and reminders in the care of patients with asthma. (Weak for | Reviewed, Ne w-added) Discussion Fiks et al. (2015) showed that families using an EHR -linked patient portal for pediatric patients had better outcomes with fewer missed days of work by parents. [141] The use of the portal was more effective in those patients with worse disease. A proprietary s ystem showed some improvement in symptom -free days, but this improvement disappeared within six months. [71] Reminders to improve inhaler adherence were mostly ineffective ; however the confidence the quality of evidence was very low.[75] Smith et al. (2012) showed reduced hospitalizations and increased prescriptions for recommended preventive therapies in primary care practices using electronic alerts compared to practices using routine care alone , although there was no overall effect on exacerbations. [142] Another cluster -randomized trial showed a reduced rate of uncontrolled asthma episodes in patients using an asthma management system. [143] While these tools may not be readily available, they may be helpful when they are available. As this is a Reviewed, New -added recommendation, the Work G roup systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation in the evidence review conducted as part of this guideline update. [71,75,141-143] The quality of the evidence was low . The harms were small, and therefore the group determined that the benefits slightly outweighed the harms. There is likely to be significant variation regarding patient preferences since many elderly patients might not feel comfortable using the technology. There may also be issues of licensure for proprietary systems and variation between different EHRs . Of note, the DoD and VA have both purchased the same EHR system , Cerner. The reminders and patient portals contained in the Cerner EHR may be able to supply the benefits outlined above. The low quality of the evidence , variation in outcomes, and variation in patient preferences caused the group to make a \"Weak for\" recommendation. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 50 of 156 VII. Research Priorities Several research priorities were identified through the development of this CPG. Regarding diagnosis and assessment, there is a need for tests that more clearly differentiate asthma from c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). Research to determ ine the effect of the use of FeNO as an assessment tool for children and adults with asthma on clinical outcomes was also identified as a priority. In general, the Work Group felt that more research is needed for supplemental tests to diagnose asthma and monitor treatment and adherence. Further, more research is needed regarding potential risk factors of asthma relat ed outcomes (e.g., use of electronic cigarettes). Research priorities for pharmacologic therapy included questions related to ICS use in children. Pediatric studies should test the risk -benefit balance of intermittent versus daily use of ICS. Other studies are needed to assess the safety profile of different types and forms of ICS in children, with a focus on systemic bioavailability and height growth. Use of higher dose ICS in cases of asthma exacerbation , as well as the testing of SMART therapy with drugs available in the U.S. , were identified as research priorities. In addition to the management of acute exacerbations, more research is needed looking at stepping down or stepping off maintenance therapy during seasons with less exacerbations. The Work Gr oup identified the need to study the use of technology to support patients and providers in the management of asthma. Technology is a promising tool to improve patient -provider communication and has the potential to improve treatment adherence. Telehealth was identified as a research priority with studies that focus on the non- inferiority of telehealth versus in -person care, including auscultatory telehealth and mobile telehealth. A lack of recent high quality research supporting the benefit of asthma action plans and asthma education was noted by the Work Group, and additional research in these areas is needed. For asthma action plans, research should focus on specific measures of benefit, the integration of technology into action plans, and the effectiven ess of written action plans. As asthma action plans are often considered a standard of care, limiting the possibility to study them in RCTs, use of registries could be an alternative research design. Additional larger studies on asthma education are necess ary to define which component, strategy, or setting for education leads to the greatest benefit. Similarly, high quality research is needed to define the size and composition of multi - or inter- disciplinary teams to improve asthma care. The Work Group identified a need for studies that assess the impact of exercise plans on asthma control and quality of life, as well as the impact of dietary changes, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan, on asthma outcomes. As risk factors for the onset or exacerbation of asthma are in part environmental, high quality care may not always be enough to improve patient outcomes. For instance, although a patient is treated for an exacerbation, they may return following care to a home with mold or dust mites. Additional research into social determinants of care (e.g., care teams that include social workers and lawyers) would be helpful in order to determine how to best take into account social determinants of health during asthma t reatment. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 51 of 156 Appendix A: Evidence Review Methodology A. Developing the Key Questions The CPG Champions, along with the Work Group, were tasked with identifying KQs to guide the systematic evidence review on management of asthma. These questions, which were developed in consultation with the Lewin T eam, addressed clinical topics of the highest priority for the VA and DoD populations. The KQs follow the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework for evidence questions, as established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Table A -1 provides a brief overview of the PICOTS typology. Table A -1. PICOTS [144 ] PICOTS Elements Description Patients, Population, or Problem A description of the patients of interest. It includes the condition(s), populations or sub- populations, disease severity or stage, co -occurring conditions, and other patient characteristics or demographics. Intervention or Exposure Refers to the specific treatments or approaches used with the patient or population. It includes doses, frequency, methods of administering treatments, etc. Comparison Describes the interventions or care that is being compared with the intervention(s) of interest described above. It includes alternatives such as placebo, drugs, surgery, lifestyle changes, standard of care, etc. Outcome Describes the specific results of interest. Outcomes can include short, intermediate, and long -term outcomes, or specific results such as quality of life, complications, mortality, morbidity, etc. Timing, if applicable Describes the duration of time that is of interest for the particular patient intervention and outcome, benefit, or harm to occur (or not occur). Setting, if applicable Describes the setting or context of interest. Setting can be a location (such as primary, specialty, or inpatient care). The Champions, Work Gro up, and evidence review team carried out several iterations of this process, each time narrowing the scope of the CPG and the literature review by prioritizing the topics of interest. Due to resource constraints, all developed KQs were not able to be inclu ded in the systematic evidence review. Thus, the Champions and Work Group determined which questions were of highest priority, and those were included in the review. Table A -2 contains the final set of KQs used to guide the systematic evidence review for this CPG. Once the KQs were finalized, the Work Group prioritized the outcomes they had defined for each KQ based on how important the Work Group judged each outco me to be. Ranking outcomes by their relative importance can help focus attention on those outcomes that are considered most important for clinical decision making when making judgements regarding the overall quality of the evidence to support a recommendation. [145] Using GRADE methodology, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1 -9 scale (7 -9, critical for decision making; 4 -6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1 -3, of limited importance for decisio n making). Critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review (see Outcomes ); however, only outcomes judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence (see Grading Recommendations ).

Conducting the Systematic Evidence Review Based on the decisions made by the Champions and Work Group members regarding the scope, the KQs, and the PICOTS statements, the Lewin Team produced a systematic evidence review protocol prior to conducting the review. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Champions and Work Group members. It described in detail the final set o f KQs, the methodology to be used during the systematic evidence review process, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria to be applied to each potential study, including, but not limited to, study type, sample size, and PICOTS criteria. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 61 of 156 Extensive literature searches identified 10,058 citations potentially addressing the KQs of interest to this evidence review. Of those, 5,727 were excluded upon title review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in English, published prior to study inclusion publication date, or not a full- length article). Overall, 4,331 abstracts were reviewed with 3,184 of those being excluded for the following reasons: not an SR or an accepted study design (see the General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review and Key Question Specific Criteria ), did not address a KQ of interest to this review, did not report on an outcome of interest, or published outside cut -off publication dates. A total of 1,147 full -length articles were reviewed. Of those, 655 were excluded at a first pass review for the following: not addressing a KQ of interest, not enrolling the population of interest, not meeting inclusion criteria for study design, not meeting inclusion criteria for any KQ, or being a duplicate. A total of 492 full- length articles were thought to address one or more KQs and were further reviewed. Of these, 346 were ultimately excluded. Reasons for their exclusion are presented in Figure A -1 below . Overall, 146 studies addressed one or more of the KQs and were considered as evidence in this review. Table A-2 indicates the number of studies that addressed each of the questions. Figure A- 1.

General Criteria for Inclusion in Systematic Review Clinical studies or SRs published on or after January 1, 2008 to July 24, 2018. If multiple SRs addressed a KQ, we selected the most recent and/or comprehensive review. SRs were supplemented with clinical studies published subsequent to the SR . Studies must be published in English. Publication must have been a full clinical study or SR ; abstracts alone were not included. Similarly, letters, editorials, and other publications that are not full-length clinical studies were not accepted as evidence. SRs must have searched MEDLINE or EMBASE for eligible publications, performed a risk of bias assessment of included studies, and assessed the quality of evidence using a recognizable rating system, such as GRADE or something compatible (e.g., the one used by the AHRQ Evidence - based Practice Centers). If an existing review did not assess the overall quality of the evidence, evidence from the review must be reported in a manner that allowed us to judge the overall risk of bias, consistency, directness, and precision of evidence. We did not use an existing review as evidence if we were not able to assess the overall quality of the evidence in the review. Intervention studies must assess diagnosti c tests , pharmacologic or non -pharmacologic treatment, interdisciplinary care , self- management, asthma action plan, education, providers or patient -facing technologies and be a prospective, RCT with an independent control group. Randomized crossover trials were included only if data from the first period (prior to treatment crossover) was reported separately. Study must have enrolled at least 20 patients (10 per study group) unless otherwise noted (see Key Question Specific Criteria below) Study must have enrolled at least 85% of patients who meet the study population criteria: children or adults who may have asthma. Study must have reported on at least one outcome of interest. b. Key Question Specific Criteria For KQ 1 and 2, SRs of acceptable study designs, RCTs and diagnostic cohort studies that compare a diagnostic test to clinical assessment, a different diagnostic test, or no diagnostic test were required. For KQ 3, SR s of acceptable study designs and comparative observational studies, such as large prospective (>100 patients/arm) or retrospective (>200 patients/arm) cohort or case -controlled studies were required. For KQs 4 -12, SRs of acceptable study designs and RCTs were required. If there was insufficient evide nce from these study designs for any KQ, we considered evidence from large prospective (>100 patients/arm) or retrospective (>200 patients/arm) cohort or case- controlled studies.

Convening the Face -to-face Meeting In consultation with the COR, the Champions, and the Work Group, the Lewin Team convened a three and one half day face -to-face meeting of the CPG Champions and Work Group members on October 15 -18, 2018. These experts were gathered to develop and draft the clinical recommendations for an update to the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG . Lewin presented findings from the evidence review in order to facilitate and inform the process. Under the direction of the Champions, the Work Group members were charged with interpreting the results of the evidence review and were asked to categorize and carry forward recommendations from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG , modifying the recommendations as necessary. The members also developed new clinical practice recommendations not presente d in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG based on the 2018 evidence review. The subject matter experts were divided into three smaller subgroups at this meeting. As the Work Group members drafted clinical practice recommendations, they also assigned a grade for each recommendation based on a modified GRADE and USPSTF methodology. Each recommendation was graded by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, the variation in values and preferences, and other implications of the recommendation. In addition to developing recommendations during the face -to-face meeting, the Work Group members also revised the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG algorithms to reflect the new and amended recommendations. They discussed the available evidence a s well as changes in clinical practice since 2009, as necessary, to update the algorithms. D. Grading Recommendations This CPG uses the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence base and assign a strength for each recommendation. The GRADE system uses the following four domains to assess the strength of each reco mmendation: [8] Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Confidence in the quality of the evidence VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 66 of 156 Values and preferences Other implications, as appropriate, e.g.,: Resource use Equity Acceptability Feasibility Subgroup considerations The following sections further describe each domain. Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes refers to the size of anticipated benefits (e.g., increased longevity, reduction in morbid event, resolution of symptoms, improved quality of life, decreased resource use) and harms (e.g., decreased longevity, immediate serious complications, adverse event, impaired quality of life, increased resource use, inconvenience/hassle) relative to each other. This domain is based on the understanding that the majority of clinicians will offer patients therapeutic or preventive measures as long as the advantages of the intervention exceed the risks and adverse effects. The certainty or uncertainty of the clinician about the risk -benefit balance will greatly influence the strength of the recommendation. Some of the discussion questions that fall under this domain inc lude: Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Confidence in the quality of the evidence reflects the quality of the evidence base and the certainty in that evidence. This second domain reflects the methodological quality of the studies for each outcome variable. In general, the strength of recommendation follows the level of evidence, but not always, as other domains may increase or decrease the strength. The evidence review used for the development of recommendations, conducted by ECRI, assessed the confidence in the quality of the evidence base using GRADE methodology and assigned a rating of \"High,\" \"Moderate,\" \"Low,\" or \"Very Low.\" The outcomes judged to be critical were used to determine the overall quality of evidence. Per GRADE, i f the quality of evidence differ s across the critical outcomes, the lowest quality of evidence for any of the relevant critical outcomes determine s the overall quality of the evidence for a recommendation ; the overall confidence cannot be higher than the lowest confidence in effect estimates for any outcome that is determined to be critical for clinical decision makin g.[15,145] The elements that go into the confidence in the quality of the evidence include: Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 67 of 156 Values and preferences is an overarching term that includes patients' perspectives, beliefs, expectations, and goals for health and life. More precisely, it refers to the processes that individuals use in considering the potential benefits, harms, costs, limitations, and inconvenience of the therapeutic or preventive measures in relation to one another. For some, the term \"values\" has the closest connotation to these processes. For others, the connotation of \"preferences\" best captures the notion of choice. In general, values and preferences increase the strength of the recommendation when there is high concordance and decrease it when there is great variability. In a situation in which the balance of benefits and risks are uncertain, eliciting the values and preferences of patients and empowering them and their surrogates to make decisions consistent with their goals of care becomes even more important. A recommendation can be described as having \"similar values,\" \"some variation,\" or \"large variation\" in typical values and preferences between patients and the larger populations of interest. Some of the discussion questions that fall under the purview of values and preferences include: Are you confident about the typical v alues and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Other implications consider the practicality of the recommendation, including resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility and subgroup considerations. Resource use is related to the uncertainty around the cost effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive measure. For example statin use in the frail elderly and others with multiple co -occurring conditions may not be effective and, depending on the societal benchmark for willingness to pay, may not be a good use of resources. Equity, acceptability, feasibility, and subgroup considerations require similar judgments around the practically of the recommendation. The framework below ( Table A -4) was used by the Work Group to guide discussions on each domain. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 68 of 156 Table A -4. GRADE Evidence to Recommendation Framework Decision Domain Questions to Consider Judgment Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes Given the best estimate of typical values and preferences, are you confident that the benefits outweigh the harms and burden or vice versa? Are the desirable anticipated effects large? Are the undesirable anticipated effects small? Are the desirable effects large relative to undesirable effects? Benefits outweigh harms/burden Benefits slightly outweigh harms/ burden Benefits and harms/burden are balanced Harms/burden slightly outw eigh benefits Harms/burden outweigh benefits Confidence in the quality of the evidence Is there high or moderate quality evidence that answers this question? What is the overall certainty of this evidence? High Moderate Low Very low Values and preferences Are you confident about the typical values and preferences and are they similar across the target population? What are the patient's values and preferences? Are the assumed or identified relative values similar across the target population? Similar values Some variation Large variation Other implications (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) Are the resources worth the expected net benefit from the recommendation? What are the costs per resource unit? Is this intervention generally available? Is this intervention and its effects worth withdrawing or not allocating resources from other interventions? Is there lots of variability in resource requirements across settings? Various considerations The strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects and is based on the framework above, which combines the four domains. [146] GRADE methodology does not allow for recommendations to be made based on expert opinion alone. While strong recommendations are usually based on high or moderate confidence in the estimates of effect (qu ality of the evidence) there may be instances where strong recommendations are warranted even when the quality of evidence is low. [8] In these types of instances where the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and values and preferences played large roles in determining the strength of a recommendation, this is explained in the discussion section for the recommendation. The GRADE of a rec ommendation is based on the following elements: Four decision domains used to determine the strength and direction (described above) Relative strength (Strong or Weak) Direction (For or Against) VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 69 of 156 The relative strength of the recommendation is based on a binary scale, \"Strong\" or \"Weak.\" A strong recommendation indicates that the Work Group is highly confident that desirable outcomes outweigh undesirable outcomes. If the Work Group is less confident of the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, they present a weak recommendation. Similarly, a recommendation for a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences. A recommendati on against a therapy or preventive measure indicates that the undesirable consequences outweigh the desirable consequences. Occasionally, instances may occur when the Work Group feels there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against a particular therapy or preventive measure. This can occur when there is an absence of studies on a particular topic that met evidence review inclusion criteria, studies included in the evidence review report conflicting results, or studies included in the evidence review report inconclusive results regarding the desirable and undesirable outcomes. Using these elements, the grade of each recommendation is presented as part of a continuum: Strong For (or \"We recommend offering this option ...\") Weak For (or \"We suggest offering this option ...\") No recommendation for or against (or \"There is insufficient evidence...\") Weak Against (or \"We suggest not offering this option ...\") Strong Against (or \"We recommend against offering this option ...\") Note that weak (For or Against) recommendations may also be termed \"Conditional,\" \"Discretionary,\" or \"Qualified.\" Recommendations may be conditional based upon patient values and preferences, the resources available, or the setting in which the intervention will be implemented. Re commendations may be at the discretion of the patient and clinician or they may be qualified with an explanation about the issues that would lead decisions to vary. E. Recommendation Categorization a. Recommendation Categories and Definitions A set of reco mmendation categories was adapted from those used by NICE. [11,12] These categories, along with their corresponding definitions, were used to account for the various ways in which recommendations could have been updated from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG . The categories and definitions can be found in Table A-5 . VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 70 of 156 Table A -5. Recommenda tion Categories and Definitions* Evidence Reviewed Recommendation Category Definition Reviewed New -added New recommendation following review of the evidence New -replaced Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried over to the updated CPG that has been changed following review of the evidence Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has been reviewed but the recommendation is not changed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG whe re the evidence has been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed based on review of the evidence Not reviewed Not changed Recommendation from previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG, but for which the evidence has not been reviewed Amended Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been carried forward to the updated CPG where the evidence has not been reviewed and a minor amendment has been made Deleted Recommendation from the previous CPG that has been removed because it was deemed out of scope for the updated CPG *Adapted from the NICE guideline manual (2012 ) [11] and Garcia et al. (2014) [12] Abbreviation: CPG: clinical practice guideline b.Categorizing Recommendations with an Updated Review of the Evidence Recommendations were first categorized by whether or not they were based on an updated review of the evidence. If evidence had been reviewed, recommendations were categorized as \"New added\" recommendations were original, new recommendations that were n ot in the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG . \"Reviewed, New- replaced\" recommendations were in the previous version of the guideline, but were modified to align with the updated review of the evidence. These recommendations could have also included clinically signific ant changes to the previous version. Recommendations categorized as \"Reviewed, Not changed\" were carried forward from the previous version of the CPG unchanged. To maintain consistency between 2009 recommendations, which were developed using the USPSTF methodol ogy (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org), and 2019 recommendations, which were de veloped using the GRADE methodology, it was necessary to modify the 2009 recommendations to incl ude verbiage to signify the strength of the recommendation (e.g., \"We recommend,\" \"We suggest\"). Because the 2009 recommendations i nherently needed to be modified at l east slightly to i nclude this language, t he \"Not changed\" category was not used. For recommendations carried forward to the updated CPG with review of the evidence and slightly modified wording, the \"Reviewed, Amended\" recommendati on category was used. This allowed for the wording of the recommendation to reflect GRADE methodology as well as for any other non-sub stantive (i.e., not clinically meaningful) language VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 71 of 156 changes deemed necessary. The evidence used to support these recommendations was carried forward from the previous version of the CPG and/or was identified in the evidence review for the update. Recom mendations could have also been designated \"Reviewed, Deleted.\" These were recommendations from the previous version of the CPG that were not brought forward to the updated guideline after review of the evidence. This occurred if the evidence supporting the recommendations was out of date, to the extent that there was no longer any basis to recomm end a particular course of care and/or new evidence suggests a shift in care, rendering recommendations in the previous version of the guideline obsolete. c.Categorizing Recommendations without an Updated Review of the Evidence There were also cases in wh ich it was necessary to carry forward recommendations from the previous version of the CPG without an updated SR of the evidence. Due to time and budget constraints, the update of the Asthma CPG could not review all available evidence on management of asth ma, but instead focused its KQs on areas of new or updated scientific research or areas that were not previously covered in the CPG. For areas of research that have not changed, and for which recommendations made in the previous version of the guideline w ere still relevant, recommendations could have been carried forward to the updated guideline without an updated SR of the evidence. The support for these recommendations in the updated CPG was thus also carried forward from the previous version of the CPG. These recommendations were categorized as \"Not reviewed.\" If evidence had not been reviewed, recommendations could have been categorized as \"Not changed,\" \"Amended,\" or \"Deleted.\" \"Not reviewed, Not changed\" recommendations refer to recommendations from the previous version of the Asthma CPG that were carried forward unchanged to the updated version. The category of \"Not reviewed, Amended\" was used to designate recommendations which were modified from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG with the updated GRADE lang uage, as explained above. Recommendations could also have been categorized as \"Not reviewed, Deleted\" if they were determined to be out of scope. A recommendation was out of scope if it pertained to a topic (e.g., population, care setting, treatment, and condition) outside of the scope for the updated CPG as defined by the Work Group. The categories for the recommendations included in the 2019 version of the guideline are noted in the Recommendations . The categories for the recommendations from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG are noted in Appendix I. F. Drafting and Submitting the Final Clinical Practice Guideline Following the face -to-face meeting, the Champions and Work Group members were given writing assignments to craft discussion sections to support each of the new recommendations and/or to update discussion sections from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG to support the amended \"carried forward\" recommendations. The Work Group also considered tables, appendices, and other sections from the 2009 VA/DoD Asthma CPG for inclusion in the update. During this time, the Champions and Work Group also made additional revisions to the algorithms, as necessary. VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Prima ry Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 72 of 156 After developing the initial draft of the updated CPG, an iterative review process was used to solicit feedback on and make revisions to the CPG. Once they were developed, the first two drafts of the CPG were posted on a w iki website for a period of 14 -20 business days for internal review and comment by the Work Group. All feedback submitted during each review period was reviewed and discussed by the Work Group and appropriate revisions were made to the CPG. Draft 3 of the CPG was made available for peer review and comment. This process is described in the section titled Peer Review Process . After revisions were made based on the feedback received during the peer review and comment per iod, the Champions presented the CPG to the EBPWG for their approval. Changes were made based on feedback from the EBPWG and the guideline was finalized. The Work Group also produced a set of guideline toolkit materials which included a provider summary, pocket card, and patient summary. The final 2019 Asthma CPG was submitted to the EBPWG in September 2019.

General Uniformed service members will be evaluated for fitness according to service regulations and policies. Asthma is specifically addressed in these regulations and policies. The services' parent regulations as of this document's publication date are as follows: Army: AR40 -501, Standards of Medical Fitness, June 14, 2017 Air Force: AFI 48 -123, Medical Examinations And Standards, January 26, 20 18 Navy: NAVMED P -117, The Manual of the Medical Department, June 1, 2018 Marine Corps: NAVMED P -117, article 15 -5, June 1, 2018 Coast Guard: Medical Manual, COMDTINST M6000.1B B. Deployment Issues Uniformed service members deploying or stationed outside of the Continental United States (CONUS) may be required to meet more stringent health requirements than their services parent regulations. Healthcare providers assessing service members for deployme nt should procure the Standard of Fitness to the deployed area of responsibility prior to clearing a service member for deployment or stationing outside of CONUS. Individuals possessing a disqualifying medical condition must obtain an exception to policy in the form of a medical waiver prior to being medically cleared for deployment. The list of deployment -limiting conditions is not comprehensive; there are many other conditions that may result in denial of medical clearance for deployment based upon the t otality of individual medical conditions and the medical capabilities present at that individual's deployed location.

Considerations Regarding Biological Agents The Work Group determined that patients for which biological agents are being considered should be referred from primary to specialty care. These medications are out of the scope of this CPG, as they are not intended to be used in primary care. Thus, primary care practitioners should consult a pulmonologist or allergist prior to offering biologic agents ( including omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab) E used as add- on therapy for moderate -to-severe asthma that is inadequately controlled (e.g., remains symptomatic, asthma exacerbations) with ICS and other controller medications. Compared to placebo, these agents have reduced exacerbations and showed modest improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life. A steroid -sparing effect has been demonstrated in studies in patients who were receiving maintenance oral steroids. Omalizumab is for moderate -to-severe persistent asthma in patients six years of age and older with sensitivity to a perennial aeroallergen and elevated serum IgE. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab are for patients with severe asthma who have an eosinophilic phenotype. Mepolizumab and benralizumab are approved for those who are 12 years and older and reslizumab is approved for those 18 years and older. Dupilumab is for moderate -to-severe asthma in patients 12 years of age and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid -dependent asthma. [150- 154] B. Considerations Regarding Theophylline The Work Group determined that patients for which theophylline is being considered should be referred from primary to specialty care. This medication is out of the scope of this CPG, as it is not intended to be used in primary care. Theophylline is considered a mild -to-moderate bronchodilator and may have mild anti-inflammatory effects. LABA or LTRA are preferred as add- on therapy to ICS. Theophylline is assoc iated with significant fo od and medication interactions and adverse reactions including insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, tremor, arrhythmias, delirium, seizures, and death. Patients on theophylline should be maintained at a serum level of 5 -15 mcg/ml w ith routine monitoring of serum level. Theophylline might be considered as a non- preferred alternative when other options cannot be used or have been unsuccessful.

Drugs Used in Treatment of Asthma Drug Classa Place used for acute relief of bronchospasm, intermittent ast hma, and prevention of exercise - induced bronchospasm May cause palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, tremor, nervousness Decreases in potassium levels or hyperglycemia have occurred Frequent use of SABA (>2 days/week) may indicate uncontrolled asthma and the need to intensify drug therapy regimen line agents for maintenance treatment of asthma Local adverse effects include oral candidiasis, dysphonia, and reflex cough/bronchospasm. Advise patients to rinse mouth and spit after use of ICS Prolonged use may slow growth r ate in children and adolescents Higher doses have been associated with adrenal suppression, glaucoma, cataracts, skin thinning, -on agents to inhaled corticosteroids May cause palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, tremor, nervousness Decreases in potassium levels or hyperglycemia have occurred Because of the risk of asthma -related death and hospitalization, use of a LABA for the treatment of asthma without concomitant use of a long -term asthma control medication, such as an ICS , is preferred over using both drugs as separate inhalers to encourage adherence to therapy See comments for ICS and beta agonists VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 89 of 156 Drug Classa Place in Therapy Clinical Considerationsb Leukotriene Modifiers Montelukast (tablets, chewable tablet, oral granules) Zafirlukast tablets Zileuton (immediate - release and extended - release tablets) Monotherapy may be considered as an alternative (not preferred) to ICS for mild persistent asthma May be used as an alternative (not preferred) to a LABA for add on therapy to ICS Montelukast may be used for prevention of exercise -induced bronchospasm (zafirlukast and zileuton are not FDA approved) Neuropsychiatric (e.g., suicidal ideation, depression, agitation, aggression, anxiousness, irritability, restlessness, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, and insomnia) have been reported. Rare cases of systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or clinical features of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg -Strauss) have occurred with montelukast and zafirlukast and may be associated with the reduction of oral steroid therapy. Serious hepatic adverse events have been reported with zafirl ukast. Use in patients with hepatic impairment, including hepatic is contraindicated. Zileuton may result increased hepatic transaminases and liver injury. Zileuton is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistent serum alanine aminotransferase elevations of 3 or more times the upper limit of normal Zileuton is not indicated in children <12 years Montelukast chewable tablets contain phenylaniline Do not abruptly substitute leukotriene modifiers for inhaled or oral cortic osteroids; reduce -acting anticholinergics (LAMA) Tiotropi um (SMI/DPI) Note: Tiotropium is the only LAMA approved for asthma.

Methods In March 2018, the VA and the DoD commenced the effort to update the VA/DoD Asthma CPG. As part of the effort to update this CPG, VA and DoD Leadership held a patient focus group. The focus group was held on June 22, 2018 at Womack Army Medical Center in Fort Bragg, NC . The aim of the focus group was to further understand the perspective of patients receiving treatment for asthma and who are covered and/or receiving their care through the VA and/or DoD healthcare systems, as these patients are most affected by the recommendations put forth in the CPG. The focus group delved into the patients' perspectives on a set of topics related to management of asthma, including their priorities, challenges they have experienced, the information they received regarding their care, as well as the impact of their care on their lives. Participants for the focus group were recruited by VA and DoD Leadership as well as by the Asthma CPG Champions. Selection of patient focus group participants was not designed to obtain a representative sample of VA and DoD patients. However, recruitment focused on eliciting a range of perspectives likely to be relevant and informative in the guideline development process. Patients were not incentivized for their participation or reimbursed for travel expenses. The Asthma CPG Champions and Work Group, with support from Lewin, developed a set of questions to help guide the focus group. The focus group facilitator led the discussion using the previously prepared questions as a general guide to elicit the most important information from the patients regarding their experiences and views about their treatment and overall care. Given the limited time and the range of interests of the focus group participants, not all of the listed questions were addressed. B. Patient Focus Group Findings a.Ensure that patient history and symptoms are taken into account when assessing pulmonary issues. Once a patient is diagnosed with asthma, help the patientunderstand his or her triggers. In some cases, pati en ts indicated that they had experienced asthma symptoms repeatedly before receiving a diagnosis of asthma. Pa tients seemed to find it helpful to understand their triggers, as they were better able to prepare for and control their asthma symptoms. b.For every patient, establish and maintain an asthma action plan in conjunction with the patient. Leverage multiple types of clinical expertise (e.g.,pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists) when educating the patient on their condition, their asthma action plan, and treatment adherence. Participants agreed that an asthma action plan should be provided to every patient, regardless of his or her experience with asthma and previous knowledge regarding the condition and its treatment.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 92 of 156 The majority of patients stated they did not recall having received education regarding asthma or its treatment, and the participants thought that patients would benefit from improved education, such as in a group class. c.Work with the patient to identify an effective treatment for a sthma, considering co-occurring conditions. Be mindful that different patients may respond to medications differently. While all patients used a rescue inhaler, only some used maintenance medications. So me participants adhered to the medication schedule p rescribed by their provider. However, some others had difficulty adhering to their medication schedules. Pa rticipants sometimes needed to change medications due to, for example, side effects, perceived loss of efficacy, and changes in the formulary. In mo st cases, these changes were favorable; however, in some cases, the participants needed to change to a less effective medication due to access limitations. Ma ny patients had co -occurring conditions in addition to asthma; therefore, it was important that they understood the tradeoffs between their asthma medications and treatment(s) for their other conditions and the best options for their particular situation. d.Be mindful that, in some cases, diagnosis of asthma or the inability to achieve control of ast hma symptoms may affect an active d uty Service Member differently than a civilian. The active d u ty Service Member needed to achieve specific goals on physical training tests and be able to complete certain tasks in order to avoid occupational consequences, such as a medical board. Al though the active d uty Service Member who participated in the focus group indicated his colleagues were supportive of him and understood his condition, the focus group participants indicate d that the situation for other active duty Service Members may be different (i.e., less understanding). e.Ensure that various types of clinicians are engaged as appropriate (e.g., specialists provide pulmonary expertise as needed based on patient condition, clinical pharmacists provide education). Leverage telehealth, mobileapplications, and other information technology to the extent that it is available and helpful for the patient. Participants thought it was most helpful when their providers were explicit regarding their tre atment. They indicated that a provider other than their primary care provider or their pulmonologist (e.g., a clinical pharmacist) could provide education regarding asthma and its treatment. Alt hough they were skeptical of the usefulness of telehealth to diagnose and assess asthma, participants thought telehealth would be useful to be able to accomplish some heal thcare activities, particularly for patients who lived farther away from their healthcare facility.VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma September 2019 Page 93 of 156 f. Acknowledge the seriousness of asthma and its impact on the life of the patient. Discuss the patient's goals for asthma treatment and help each patient w ork toward those goals. Participants expressed concern that, in some cases, providers and other members of the community do not regard asthma as a serious condition. Throughout the focus group, participants mentioned goals for their treatment and indicated that providers could help them achieve these goals by providing clear education and information regarding their treatment.
