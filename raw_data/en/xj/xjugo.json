Why would a body all of a sudden attack itself? It doesn't make sense, and yet it has grown to over 130 varieties. When you are ready, we are here to provide sound solutions for you. To Request an Action Plan to Address Autoimmune Disease [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) Are You Your Own Worst Enemy? The concept that your body could attack itself is one that might seem difficult to appreciate, but there seems to be an increase in the conditions classified as Autoimmune Disease or Disorder. In fact, over the past 25 years, there have been more than 130 different Autoimmune Diseases classified and that number is climbing every year. That in itself seems like we need to begin understanding \"Why?\" this is occurring. And since one of my practice members asked about this specifically, I'd like to help you appreciate how an Autoimmune Disorder begins and why there would be an increase in these conditions. I hope this information will educate you so that you may avoid them yourself, and that you will forward this information to any and all of your friends and loved ones who may be suffering from these disorders as well. After all, understanding is the key to prevention. Autoimmune Disorders are defined as \"Disorders in which the Immune System produces auto-antibodies to an endogenous antigen, with consequent injury to tissues.\" In simple terms, the body attacks itself. These Immune System disorders cause abnormally low activity or over activity of the Immune System. In cases of Immune System over activity, the body attacks and damages its own tissues (Autoimmune Diseases). Immune deficiency diseases decrease the body's ability to fight invaders, causing vulnerability to infections. Medicines Perspective defines Autoimmune Disorders as follows: In response to an unknown trigger, the Immune System may begin producing antibodies that instead of fighting infections, attack the body's own tissues. Treatment for Autoimmune Diseases generally focuses on reducing or suppressing Immune System activity. Examples of Autoimmune Diseases include: [Medicines Two Choices](MedicinesTwoChoices.asp) for You Why would the Immune System Attack The Body? Why, all of a sudden would your defense system begin to not recognize the cells of the blood, or other tissues such as the Spleen or Liver? Through one of my mentors, I have come to understand Autoimmune Disease as an indication that the person's body is \"allergic\" to a component within their own body. In other words, the Immune System doesn't recognize a component within the body as being part of the body, but instead sees it as a foreign invader, and hence attacks the invader wherever it goes. In ANY case of Autoimmune Disease, that could be anywhere in the body. What this will eventually lead to is multiple organ failure. If you understand how the Immune System functions and develops its memory, the answer is not that difficult to comprehend. It goes all the way back to proper nutrition and digestion. And it becomes a problem for someone with the help of taking different medications that alter normal Immune Recognition, genetic pre-disposition I'm sure, with life-style choices playing a factor too. Consider the [Digestive System Disruptors](digestivesystemdisruptors.asp) and the [Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndrome.asp) that results. Studying the information presented by and lectured about from the most famous and foremost authority on nutrition and disease of his time, Dr. Royal Lee, recognized way back in the 1940's these Autoimmune Disorders as nutritional deficiency diseases. He discovered that when a person becomes deficient in essential nutrients (from a diet high in refined, man-made foods and foods high in sugar), the body would have a hard time healing. And this makes sense to even the uneducated. So What Happens Next? If the body cannot heal itself, things will start to age, degenerate and eventually de-differentiate, meaning the cells will mutate and change form. With regards to the different organs, glands, tissues, etc., this means they will each begin to malfunction. And if not healing properly, the outer protective layer of the organ(s)/gland(s) starts to weaken and eventually it will break. What results from this is it will cause whole proteins from that organ to freely leak into the blood stream. This is something that should never happen. Then when the Immune System sees those free proteins, it recognizes them as being foreign. And because the whole protein molecules should not be circulating within the bloodstream (only Amino Acids derived from the proteins we eat), the Immune System begins creating specific antibodies to those proteins and begins attacking them as they leak from the organ. This is Autoimmune Disease. As mentioned above, SLE is an immune response to a component within the person's blood. And because the blood circulates through every organ, it eventually leads to immune responses that affect all the organs. So to simplify this condition of the Immune System attacking the body (aka Autoimmune Disease), if you are dealing with an Autoimmune Disease, know that the organ or gland associated with the disease you have is leaking its own proteins and your Immune System is doing its job of protecting you from these\"foreign\" proteins. The result of this is Autoimmune Disease. Whatever the name you have been given, this is the mechanism for your condition. Leaky Gut The gut is the gateway to health, it houses 80% of your Immune System, and you can't have a healthy Immune System without a healthy gut. Thanks to research from Alessio Fassano, which I've confirmed it in the office, we now know that if you have an Autoimmune Disease your gut has become leaky, meaning the tight junctions that typically hold your gut lining together have become loose, allowing undigested food particles, microbes, toxins, and more to escape your gut and enter your bloodstream. All of these particles are recognized by your Immune System as foreign invaders, sending your Immune System into high alert and triggering a huge rise in inflammation. This continual strain on your Immune System eventually causes it to go haywire, and it ends up attacking your own tissues by mistake. Gluten Gluten contributes to autoimmune disease in three key ways. First, it is the primary cause of leaky gut because gluten triggers the release of zonulin in your intestines, a chemical that tells your gut lining to \"open up\". Second, it is highly inflammatory, meaning it stresses your immune system. Thirdly, the gluten protein has a similar chemical structure to some of your body's tissues (specifically your thyroid), which can lead to molecular mimicry, where your body mistakes your tissues for gluten and attacks them. Toxins Toxic molds (mycotoxins) and heavy metals such as mercury are the two main toxins I see in those I see with Autoimmune conditions. Mycotoxins are very volatile compounds produced by toxic molds that wreak havoc on the immune system. We are exposed to heavy metals like mercury in different ways: mercury amalgam fillings in teeth, fish consumption, and the environment. Mercury is toxic to our bodies and can be one piece of the puzzle for those with autoimmune diseases. Infections Scientists have long suspected that infections from bacteria, viruses, and other toxins were likely to blame for the development of autoimmunity. There are now a number of infections, including Epstein Barr (the virus that causes mono), Herpes Simplex 1 and 2, E. coli, that have been linked to Autoimmune Diseases. Stress Levels of stress-related illnesses are on the rise, and stress, both of the emotional and the physical variety, has been shown to trigger and intensify autoimmune disorders. Stress disrupts Immune function through several distinct pathways. Stress is the body's response to a threat-a wound, injury, or infection. Chronic stress (the kind we face in this day and age) leads to long term inflammation that never really shuts off, creating Autoimmune Disease. Once the autoimmune response is in place, immediate stress only exacerbates it. So What Can a Body Do? That's where Dr. Royal Lee was a true pioneer. As a nutritional specialist, he developed whole food supplement products that would allow the body to focus on a special part of the ingredients of that supplement, while the balance of the ingredients would go toward repairing the organ(s) or gland(s) and stop the leaking of proteins. The special ingredient he termed Protomorphogen's or PMG for short. As an ingredient within the supplement, it acts as a counter measure designed to take the focus off the organ and direct it at itself. This causes the Immune Cells that would attack the organ or gland to attack the ingredients in the supplement. While this is occurring, the rest of the ingredients go towards repairing the organ or gland affected and the balance of health can begin to be restored. That is why Dr. Lee was such a visionary. He figured this out way back in the 1940's. And his company has developed 22 different PMG's, one for each organ or gland that are designed specifically to help that organ/gland heal, thus allowing for the Autoimmune response to stop and the body to go back to a healthy balance. Your Solution Our Approach To Healing Autoimmune Disease Healing your Gut is essential to healing yourself. After all, 80% of your Immune System lies in your gut! We use the 4 R Approach to healing the Gut and [eliminating Leaky Gut Syndrome](leakygutsyndromerepair.asp). For my patients with Autoimmune Diseases, I highly recommend removing not only gluten but all grains and legumes from their diet. These foods contain proteins known as lectins, which act as a natural pesticide for crops and can wreak havoc on the lining of your gut creating Leaky Gut Syndrome. Changing your diet is the first step in getting well. If you are going to get involved in remedying your Autoimmune Disease, you may choose to have the testing done through your Medical Doctor. These tests can be expensive and you would want them covered under your Health Insurance if possible. I recommend having your MTHFR genes tested and doing a DMPS chelation challenge test through a Functional Medical Practitioner who can order those tests to determine if mercury or other [heavy metals](heavy-metal-toxicity.asp) are an issue for you. Real Time Lab has the test for assessing if someone is being exposed to mycotoxins. I also recommend that all my Practice Members find a Wholistic Dentist to remove their mercury amalgam fillings if this is an issue. We can and do all of these tests in the office using Manual Muscle Testing and we offer true solutions to Heavy Metals and mycotoxins, and have for years. There are a number of bacterial and viral infections that have been associated with Autoimmune conditions. Have your Medical Doctor test for infections such as HSV and [EBV](ebvepstein-barrvirus.asp). We have a solution to both of these viruses, again, after you have seen your Medical Doctor for blood tests to confirm you have these concerns. Monolaurin from coconut oil can be very effective treatment for both HSV and EBV. Lysine and a lysine-rich diet is effective at treating HSV infections. I tell all my Practice Members that they should prioritize stress reduction. Take care of yourself by adopting some stress-relieving strategies, such as exercise, meditation and art. If you are having trouble relaxing, try a yoga class or a guided meditation. Even giving yourself five minutes to sit quietly with a fragrant cup of herbal tea (caffeine-free, of course!) can help tremendously. Our approach is based on getting to the root of the problem: removing the elements that derailed your Immune System in the first place and strengthening your Immune System rather than suppressing it. That's why using this approach enables you to reverse and prevent many different Autoimmune conditions at once. What This Means To You If you, or a loved one suffers with any Autoimmune or related conditions such as [Lupus](slesystemiclupuserythematosis.asp), [Fibromyalgia](fibromyalgia-fibrositis.asp), [ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome](chronic-fatigue-syndrome.asp), etc. you should take notice that there is hope for you that won't require you to take Prednisone or some other sort of medication/steroid for the rest of your life. You won't have to have organs surgically replaced or die of organ failure at an age much younger then you'd like. There is hope for you and there are treatments available here at Advanced Alternative Medicine Center to fix these imbalances and restore health to your body. Part of the treatment consisting of the good high quality whole food supplements that we carry in the office. And since they've been using the same manufacturing process for the better part of 88 years, you know the quality is superior and the technology is sound.
