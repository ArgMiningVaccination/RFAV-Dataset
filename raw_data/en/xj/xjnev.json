He found healing in a \"process\" way that enhances the flow of Qi. His [healing story](https://meditationtaoist.wordpress.com/) includes a 3000 km bike ride and disciplined meditation grounded in Taoist thought and practice. He translated The Road Less Traveled into Chinese. As an independent researcher, he has been exploring the practice and research of meditation as well as relevant areas including Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, anthroposophy, traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy (including Whitehead). In the past ten years, he has published more than 500 articles in Chinese on meditation, Taoism, Confucianism, philosophy as well as reports of patients in Chinese on his wechat blog. Dr. Jin now lives in Shenzhen, China, focusing on the research of meditation and relating issues and giving workshops, speeches and individual tutoring on natural healing through meditation.

Last March he led a P&F sponsored \"Process Pop-up\" session on [Daoist meditation](https://processandfaith.org/event/process-pop-up-daoist-meditation/).
