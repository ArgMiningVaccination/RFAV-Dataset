I am inspired by the spirit of innovation and academic excellence that are central to Geisel's mission. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues across Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, as we support the career development of diverse leaders in medicine who are committed to excellence in scholarship, biomedical research, compassionate healthcare delivery, and service.\" Chimienti, a specialist in infectious disease who is currently vice provost for Student Life and Enrollment Management and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS), brings to Dartmouth a wealth of experience in student affairs, medical education leadership, education policy development and oversight, and interprofessional program development.

In her former role as associate dean for Student Affairs at UMMS, Chimienti was responsible for guiding students through medical school from matriculation through graduation.

Through a collaboration with academic leaders at the Manning School of Business at UMass Lowell, Chimienti led the development of an interprofessional dual degree program for graduate students from medicine, nursing, and biomedical sciences. As a fellowship program director in Infectious Disease at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), she led a successful expansion of the fellowship program, developed a learner-focused transition course to help graduating fellows better understand career options following fellowship training, and coordinated a successful Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) review of the program, resulting in full accreditation. ACGME is the accrediting body for graduate medical training programs for physicians in the U.S. Chimienti earned bachelor's degrees in both Biological Sciences and Psychology from Stanford University in 1990.
