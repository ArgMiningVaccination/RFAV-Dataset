San Tan Natural medicine has a really friendly and helpful staff. They are doing so much more and have plenty of other services I'm curious about. - 9/25/2019 I have no idea why I waited so long to review this place. I'm so glad I left there and found a new place to help me with my hormones. The only good thing the doc did for me was get me off anti anxiety meds I was taking too long. The front desk staff couldn't or wouldn't return calls, follow up on prescriptions or even leave messages. My friend that initially referred me to this place left also....yes, because of the joke of a front desk staff. My new doctor said I should have never had bone loss if my hormones & blood work we're consistently checked and adjusted. Hopefully this place made some BIG changes since I left there. - 2/17/2020 BIGGEST FINANCIAL REGRET I have is the $1,000 I wasted at this AWFUL place!!! They said they'd have a doctor call me when I first got my meds and even then when I didn't receive a call I knew this was a BIG MISTAKE! I never had a doctor call me about how to use the products, my blood work, hormones-NOTHING!!!!!!!! We work TOO hard for our money to be taken advantage of by a company who does a great job pain probing but not actually giving what we pay for and then on top of that admitting they messed up but NOT offering even a partial refund. RUN FAST AWAY from this company you'll get better customer service at any random GNC customer service and health wise then here! DON'T do it!!!!!!!!!!! I will FOREVER be sharing my terrible experience with San Tan Natural Medicine, we all work too hard to have empty promises at such high price points!!!!! THE WORST investment I could have made! Health is so important and unfortunately this is NOT the place that will help you with that! - 1/6/2017 Sending my husband to San Tan Natural Medicine was a huge mistake!! He scheduled a 15 minute \"Free\" consult. 45 minutes later and a lot of upselling of services, he was told he owed $230 for the visit. When he asked why he was being charged for a \"free\" consult, the doctor told him \"that was over 30 minutes ago\". I am very disappointed that he didn't have the courtesy at the end of the 15 minutes to say the 'free' consult has concluded and if interested in a longer visit, to disclose the fees for that service before assuming**Beware of the 'free' consult** - 3/5/2016 Dr Jarom and his team are amazing. After finding out that I had low testosterone, I was referred to San Tan Natural Medicine. I started getting my shots and taking supplements that were suggested by Dr Jarom. I feel fantastic and at a follow up appointment with my general practioner they informed me that my blood work was looking much better across the board. Every week I stop into San Tan Natural Medicine for my shots and the staff is so nice and fun to talk to. I am very thankful for San Tan Natural Medicine. - 1/3/2016First to Review I came here for natural hormone replacement, and HCG diet. this place is a complete rip off, and they either don't care about their patients, or they don't know medicine. I had just got of birth control pills, and did the blood work. they told me I had high estrogen, and low test/progestrone. I asked them if birth control interferes with results, they say no. i should have known better, so they had me buy lots of meds to regulate it. I never completed the meds, they made me feel horrible. I then completed the HCG program, and got the B6 weekly shots. they had me purchase a drink mix 'that would help with the hcg program' . a couple days after completing my program, I began experiencing horrible arm pains/numbness/weakness. I go to my primary doc, do blood work.....come to find out that santan natural meds had me B6 toxic. my weekly shot, the drink mix, plus an endocrine repair they had me on was an extreme overdose for months. just be aware.......they are $$$$ HUNGRY! !! Business owner information Dr. Jarom I. 1/13/2016 Maria, thanks for your feedback and we respect your opinion. I would like to clarify a few points which I already discussed with you in person and over the phone. The shots that are included in the HCG program do not contain any vitamin B6, they have B12. And all of our dosing for supplements is within the safe and therapeutic range. We are of course very sorry that you had the described issue after you completed our program and wish you the best. - 2/19/2016 Very happy with my experience here. Nice office, professional, and easy to get an appointment. I bought a groupon for lipotropic injections, it was a great deal. After just one week I already have so much more energy and am looking forward to seeing the benefits of the metabolism booster. Nice to have an office like this nearby! - 10/18/2018 I have been a patient of Dr. Ipson's for almost 3 years and my wife longer. He is the best and is such a relief from the \"normal\" family practice doctors who just want to load you up with prescriptions. He had done wonders for me with his vitamin therapy and B12 weekly shots and with all of that I have more energy than before. None of that stuffiness about Dr Ipson, or the excellent staff, Bertha, Ashley and Rachel, who handles the front desk. They are all extremely friendly and I would not go any where else. Dr Ipson is so friendly and will always make the time to stop and chat even when I am there for my weekly B12 shorts. This would never happen in a regular doctors office. - 1/4/2017 I went to this place several times, twice for weight loss and once for a consult on the cool sculpting. I felt really uncomfortable each visit. Never once did I see a doctor, I don't even know if a doctor is even in that place. I have a medical background, so alot of what the techs (or whomever they were) were talking about didn't make alot of sense or they were just really lacking the full knowledge and confidence. They always seemed distracted. When I got my coolsculpting consult I fully expected to talk with a doctor not a tech reading off a pamphlet when I can do that myself. The main reason I didn't get cool sculpting or continue on with this place was because I didn't trust them. I had other cool sculpting consults after this who were done by plastic surgeons and doctors who obviously knew what they were talking about. When making a several thousand dollar decision i want a doctor involved. I felt ripped off every time I went in like I was getting half the deal. I was not happy and i will not be going back. I'm not sure they really know what they are doing when it comes to weight loss or anything for that matter. A piece of advice would be when you introduce your name be sure to include your title so people know who they are talking to. - 10/31/2017 Nurse Donna is wonderful. She always makes me feel welcome and is very professional. I appreciate her kindness and friendliness each week. She goes above and beyond to make my visits comfortable and makes sure to get me taken care of in a timely manner. Thank you!
