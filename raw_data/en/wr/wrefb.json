This includes One-on-One Counselling, Medicine-making Workshops, and Ceremonies such as Fasting Camps, Naming and Colours, and Sweat Lodge. Our Traditional Healing Coordinator supports the program both as a leader and traditional healing provider. Misiway's Traditional Healing Program also provides Aboriginal Orientation and Turning Full Circle programs to individuals on probation in the justice system. Aboriginal Orientation, a 10 circle program, assists individuals to understand the impact of colonization and the legacy of residential schools on First Nation families. It is offered in two groups: Eastern Door for male clients and Women's Journey for females. Turning Full Circle, comprised of 13 circle sessions, includes modules on parenting, substance abuse, domestic violence and anger management. "}
