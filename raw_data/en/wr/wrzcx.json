Simply put, aromatherapy is another term for using essential oils in treatment. It is the therapeutic use of aromatic essential oils to promote physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. TRACING THE ROOTS OF AROMATHERAPY Aromatherapy is an ancient practice that dates back thousands of years. Ancient cultures like China, India, and Egypt used resins, balms, and oils containing aromatic plant components. The healing and spiritual properties of these plants were widely recognised and utilised. HOW DOES AROMATHERAPY WORK? Aromatherapy involves a holistic approach to treating an individual. The treatment is personalised to suit the individual's physical and mental requirements. The aromatherapist may suggest a single essential oil or a mix of oils based on these needs. Essential oils are extracted from various parts of plants, including flowers, herbs, and trees, and are used for their aromatic properties. The olfactory nerves carry important oil aroma molecules to the brain, where they have a profound effect. The limbic system, which is responsible for emotions, may become more active due to the oils. Additionally, the hypothalamus, stimulated by the oil, may release serotonin, also known as the happy hormone. Essential oils have been tested in clinical trials for their potential to cure various illnesses, including - - Anxiety - Depression - Nausea - Insomnia - Poor Appetite "}
