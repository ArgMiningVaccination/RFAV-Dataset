00:06 It's Lauren London 00:07 and I am here to show you my When I care skincare routine 00:12 and a little light beat. 00:15 This is a cleanser that I use. 00:16 A Black woman owns this company and it's non-toxic. 00:20 The back says, I like my products 00:21 how I like my people, non-toxic. 00:28 I've always been very serious about washing my face. 00:30 I feel like when I was in high school 00:32 I learned the really harsh lesson 00:33 of going to bed without washing my face 00:37 and I had a really bad breakout on my forehead. 00:42 So I do some toner, which is also all-natural. 00:45 I have sensitive skin 00:47 so I try not to do too much. 00:50 I don't need a lot of harsh chemicals. 00:54 Rub it in like this. 00:59 You can do some deep breathing. 01:01 Get your mind right. 01:03 One of my favorite products. 01:05 Also a woman owns this, a woman of color. 01:09 Purple and Prosper Calm Complexion Serum. 01:13 Growing up, I don't remember 01:15 any Black-owned skin products around our household 01:20 and I feel like now it's more available. 01:24 It's out there. 01:26 It's skin products that actually understand 01:29 what's going on with my skin. 01:31 Therabody for my face and I use the red light. 01:37 Red light is really good for the rejuvenation of your cells 01:41 and fine lines 'cause this is not 22 anymore. 01:48 My handy dandy Lamier. 01:50 I've been using Lamier since I was 21. 01:53 This is a soft cream, 01:54 so you don't have to make it warm and then pat it. 01:57 This is also good for being on the go. 02:01 I don't have time to be doing all of that, 02:03 patting her down. 02:06 Honey, it is giving moisturized skin. 02:08 And go down to the neck. 02:10 I'm gonna add this under eye brightening turmeric eye cream. 02:13 A little dab like that. 02:17 I don't always have time to do this routine 02:20 especially in the morning 02:20 when I have to rush to take the kids to school. 02:22 If I have some time and I do wanna take time with myself 02:28 and be intentional about my face. 02:30 And you know, this is also very therapeutic. 02:34 I'll do all this. 02:35 If I don't have time, 02:37 it's giving face wash and a moisturizer. 02:41 When I do have time, I'm very big with meditation. 02:45 Reading, I love to read. 02:47 I love writing. 02:48 Being in the room and listening to music. 02:50 Music is a really big form of medicine for me. 02:54 I'm a really big 90s R&B, adult contemporary fan. 03:00 I'm also, I'm a big jazz fan. 03:03 Lalah Hathaway, Anita Baker, 03:06 Rachelle Ferrell, Kem. 03:09 Things that just kind of bring down my nervous system 03:12 because I'm naturally very anxious. 03:16 I love the Tatcha lip mask. 03:23 I usually use this Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. 03:30 So I rub it in like this. 03:36 Growing up, Rite Aid or CVS 03:38 would be where I would buy my makeup. 03:40 And it was really hard 03:42 finding a color that matched my skin complexion. 03:46 And I feel like you would have to mix and match 03:49 and I just am not good at that. 03:50 And I think as times have changed 03:54 and makeup has become more inclusive, 03:56 I hope everyone can find their shade in that. 03:59 I have really, really dark circles 04:01 because I don't get enough sleep. 04:03 I have two kids. 04:05 So I use this Tom Ford color correcting pen under my eyes 04:10 before I go in with concealer. 04:14 People always ask me how do I manage being a working mom? 04:19 Honestly, my kids come first. 04:22 Had a really rough couple years, 04:24 so their emotional wellness and wellbeing is my priority. 04:29 And then I take jobs that respect me as a mother 04:34 and honor my time as a mother. 04:40 Armani Luminous Concealer 04:45 in a lighter shade than the other one. 04:47 But I'm going to mix these two today 04:48 'cause I feel like the sun's been shining a little bit. 04:53 You can just put it on your hand like this. 04:56 Not too much. 04:57 You don't want people to think 04:58 you're doing too much in the middle of the day. 05:01 Or maybe you do, maybe you don't care. 05:03 Live your life. 05:04 Who cares what people think? 05:05 Okay bow. 05:07 Hit it up like this. 05:17 Okay, bow, bow, bow. 05:18 Bow, wow, wow. 05:20 these little eyebrows right here 05:21 need a little love in the club. 05:26 I just be talking and saying stuff. 05:28 I'm an only child so I talk to myself a lot. 05:30 All the time. 05:31 I am my own best friend. 05:32 I'm gonna bake this up because I get creased up under here. 05:36 I don't know why. 05:37 That's how the Lord made me, okay. 05:42 Tatcha the Silk Powder. 05:47 Now I'm gonna go into some bronzer. 05:50 This cute Chanel bronzer. 05:54 Swirl her around like this. 06:03 And I heard Miss J Lo say that go up under here 06:06 because that's where the light, something like that. 06:09 So if Miss J Lo said something, I'm gonna keep it. 06:12 Okay, bow, wow, wow. 06:15 Yippie yo, yippie yay. 06:16 I like to keep my eyebrows kind of thick. 06:19 And anybody who knows me knows I don't touch this. 06:23 High school, my eyebrows 06:25 were as thin as this black string, okay? 06:29 And I had slits. 06:30 Then I would tweeze two little slits. 06:33 Which, I really do like that look. 06:34 I might go back to the slits. 06:37 I don't use anything on my eyebrows 06:38 besides Anastasia, her dip brow. 06:42 When I get makeup done professionally, 06:44 I don't let anyone do my brows. 06:46 They can do anything else, my eyebrows are mine. 06:54 So on this new movie You People 06:56 I actually got the honor 06:59 to work with one of my beauty icons, Nia Long. 07:03 She's a professional the way she carried herself 07:06 as a Black woman on a set. 07:08 And she's so pretty on pictures 07:12 and much more beautiful in person. 07:15 I just... 07:15 Her face card does not decline. 07:17 I'm in love with this Liquid Killawatt. 07:20 I just put a little bit right there. 07:26 Pat it with this beauty blender. 07:36 I'm going to now get into to my blush, 07:39 which is Nars Torrid. 07:41 You can do a little smile. 07:44 Ooh, looks like I'm blushing. 07:54 Lancome Hypnose Drama is, to me, 07:58 the best mascara in the world. 08:01 I'm just gonna say it. 08:08 Look at that. 08:15 I love me some Fenty Beauty clear lip gloss. 08:22 My dad told me this advice one time 08:24 because I was going on auditions 08:26 and I was like rejection after rejection. 08:29 And he was like, Every no you get 08:32 is just one step closer to your yes. 08:35 So then I would rejoice in the nos. 08:38 'Cause I would be like, Oh that means 08:39 it's getting closer to the yes. 08:42 Now that we're done with all of this 08:43 we're gonna set it with this. 08:46 I gotta cover my little edges, so. 08:53 This was a lot of fun. 08:54 Thank "}
