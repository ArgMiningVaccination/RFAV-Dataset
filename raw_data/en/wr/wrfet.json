Going back to school is an exciting time but it can also be challenging. It can mean more colds, sniffles, stress and anxiety. But not to worry, there are things that can be done naturally to prepare, through lifestyle, supplements and homeopathy. When going back to school, it's common for kids (and adults) to get sick shortly after the term starts. This is because after a whole summer of being around just family and friends, back to school means being in close proximity to a lot of new people. The exposure to new germs, combined with stress and fatigue increases the chances of being sick. Boosting the immune system naturally Our bodies are strong and resilient and want to be healthy, they just need the right tools. They need enough sleep, good nutrition (think lots of fruits and veggies), movement and a few supplements which are the building blocks of health. The must-have supplements are : - Omega 3's - Probiotics - Vitamin D Ideally, we would be able to get all the nutrients we need from our food and lifestyle, but our standard diets don't include enough fatty fish and naturally fermented products, and we don't get enough natural exposure to the sun to get Vitamin D. These supplements are important because: Omega 3 fatty acids improve brain function and concentration, are anti-inflammatory, enhance immune cells and provide fluidity to the phospholipid bilayer of our cells. Probiotics are the good bacteria of our body. Our gut flora is referred to as our second brain. Our flora plays an important role in fighting off harmful bacteria, assimilating food, and produce a large amount of our serotonin and GABA. Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin and is important for mood and immunity. Prepare for back to school using homeopathy. Homeopathy is gentle, fast acting, does not have any negative side effects and does not interfere with any other medication. It works energetically to encourage the body's natural healing mechanisms and allow the body to heal itself. Basically, there is no downside to trying homeopathy! Homeopathy for colds If the little ones get sick, homeopathy can help the body get over the cold quickly and effectively. Homeopathic remedies do not suppress. They either make the cold, fever or cough more productive, or if something is out of balance (for example, a persistent cough) it will help it calm down and bring it in balance. When you encounter a cold, there are 2 options homeopathically. Either check in with your homeopath, and receive personalized remedy and supplement recommendations based on the presenting sings and symptoms, or try a complex homeopathic. Complex homeopathics are a combination of a few homeopathic remedies which are known to help with a specific problem. For example, R1 from Dr. Reckeweg is the first remedy take for inflammation, even at the early signs of colds and flus. It can be taken in conjunction with R6 which is for colds, flu and fever symptoms. For coughs, R8 is an excellent homeopathic cough syrup which can be used for coughs ranging from dry to wet and productive coughs or Stodal Cough syrup/ Homeopathy for Injuries Injuries can happen no matter how much we try to avoid them. For anything from scraped knees to bruises to a bump on the head, Arnica is the go-to first aid remedy. Arnica helps the body get over the initial shock of the injury and encourages the body to heal itself quicker while helping with pain. If you were to have one homeopathic remedy in your first aid kit, it should be Arnica 30CH. Homeopathy for stress and anxiety. Homeopathic remedies work to help physical health, but also mental and emotional health. They help bring balance to the mind and body. Homeopathic remedies are amazing to use for anxiety. They are highly specific to the individual and the type of anxiety experienced. When the right remedy is administered a change can be noticed in as little as a few minutes or overnight. A few remedies for anxiety include but are not limited to: Aconite: helpful for panic attacks or anxiety with shock. Gelsemium: for anxiety from anticipation. Fear of presentations, speaking in front of people or performing. Feels timid, frozen and weak from anticipation. Pulsatilla: anxious and needs reassurance and support, may be more cuddly than usual. Calcarea carbonica: anxiety because of being taken out of a safe routine.
